[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  over the city in fact I've gotten emails and calls and the news reporter told me
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.920]  the same thing that there isn't really a street in Toronto that doesn't have it
[02:05.920 --> 02:13.760]  up with info wars.com on it was also in north Texas news and they show video of
[02:13.760 --> 02:17.520]  the posters up and say it says anti-war.com and on the video it says
[02:17.520 --> 02:22.800]  info wars.com I guess that's just the mainstream media can't get anything
[02:22.800 --> 02:26.400]  right but maybe they did that on purpose thinking well we won't plug this
[02:26.400 --> 02:36.680]  guy's site also a big cover story in the metro section of the Orlando Sentinel

[08:49.360 --> 08:53.440]  listeners and continue the discussion about the attack on free speech in this
[08:53.440 --> 09:04.440]  country it doesn't matter what politician or political parties in power in this
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.640]  country they continue to erode our liberties and our freedoms and our free
[09:08.640 --> 09:14.040]  speech at an exponential rate and then the party out of power always poses as
[09:14.040 --> 09:20.240]  if it's the party for liberty and the party in power attacks the freedom but
[09:20.240 --> 09:36.320]  on every key vote on every key vote the Republicans or the Democrats will back
[09:36.320 --> 09:43.080]  stab when they're posing as the party of liberty which is out of power and go
[09:43.080 --> 09:46.960]  along with it whether it's the bank or takeover bill or whether it's the
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.800]  Patriot Act or wars or any of this they are bought and paid for they are
[09:51.800 --> 09:59.960]  political prostitutes and you now have this diversity chief at the FCC on video
[09:59.960 --> 10:05.480]  we're gonna play this coming up later it's posted up on info wars.com and
[10:05.480 --> 10:31.520]  prisonplanet.com he is up there saying saying openly that they are going to set
[10:31.520 --> 10:38.080]  up Hugo Chavez style style quote diversity controlling the media
[10:38.080 --> 10:46.960]  controlling the internet controlling talk radio that they want taxes on top of
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.160]  all this and as the test case they're going after people they know are
[10:51.160 --> 10:56.560]  polarizing figures and unpopular with large swaths of the population
[10:56.560 --> 11:03.760]  Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and they're mixing me now in all the big media
[11:03.760 --> 11:07.360]  matters George Soros Rockefeller Brothers Foundation funded that's openly
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.400]  who funds those they're mixing me in because they're actually threatened by
[11:12.400 --> 11:19.160]  my listeners who are politically active and by the Obama deception five months
[11:19.160 --> 11:24.280]  in six months in still the number one viral film on the web it's only picking
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.440]  up steam they're threatened by the ideas we have of putting up the Obama info
[11:28.440 --> 11:32.960]  wars.com joker posters that's really shaking them up and now we have a new
[11:32.960 --> 11:38.040]  contest and we've been sent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of poster
[11:38.040 --> 11:44.280]  entries folks that isn't the contest read the rules and I'm just frustrated
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.440]  because you're so many great posters the contest is to make the poster and
[11:49.440 --> 11:55.160]  videotape yourself posting them in legal lawful commons areas in your towns and
[11:55.160 --> 12:03.840]  cities or your universities bulletin boards you name it and then videotaping
[12:03.840 --> 12:09.360]  it and putting it on YouTube like the last contest that's what goes viral and
[12:09.360 --> 12:14.040]  then gives other people the idea to do it that's the whole point of it and in
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.000]  this new contest everybody's still putting up though the Obama joker posters
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.240]  and that's great intensify that but in the new thousand dollar first place
[12:22.240 --> 12:27.880]  500 second place 200 third place in the new contest that ends Friday you have
[12:27.880 --> 12:33.440]  to post the new poster of any issue police brutality fluoride in the water
[12:33.440 --> 12:42.480]  the flu shot and concerns over that whatever issue it is anti-war you know
[12:42.480 --> 12:48.600]  whatever it could be showing Obama as a fraud showing Obama as a ghoul showing
[12:48.600 --> 12:57.440]  Obama as Hitler I don't care 50% of the will be judged on the best poster the
[12:57.440 --> 13:03.760]  other 50% when I'm judging this me I'm the judge I do take some of the feedback
[13:03.760 --> 13:10.760]  from people in my office will be whoever posted the best and it makes the best
[13:10.760 --> 13:16.360]  video of posting it that is the contest and the reason this new contest is
[13:16.360 --> 13:18.720]  whatever you want to make it because it just doesn't need to be about this
[13:18.720 --> 13:23.440]  Obama joker situation it's about you having a first amendment and free
[13:23.440 --> 13:29.440]  speech and seeing the power of the people putting up different posters and
[13:29.440 --> 13:35.040]  then whoever wins the contest I'm gonna take that image and I'm just gonna let
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.320]  you know now and have another contest for whoever can put up the most of that
[13:39.320 --> 13:48.760]  poster and it may be as much as $10,000 in the next one I bet that's gonna be
[13:48.760 --> 13:53.120]  announced in the future so let me just let you in on it whoever makes the best
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.720]  video and post the best posters again makes a new poster of whatever political
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.840]  image you want I want to see the true diversity of ideas out there and the
[14:02.840 --> 14:06.600]  true first amendment in action and then who and then the other part of the
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.240]  contest is whoever makes the best video of it that's what's gonna be judged the
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.680]  best video of posting it and that's in the rules but no one seems to understand
[14:14.680 --> 14:18.960]  that so that is the contest and you know they don't like this Obama info wars
[14:18.960 --> 14:24.360]  dot com Obama New World Order poster Obama fascism poster notice the media
[14:24.360 --> 14:30.000]  loves to only give the Obama socialist joker issue the attention because that
[14:30.000 --> 14:44.040]  ends up generating the left-right paradigm fight when Obama is really not a
[14:44.040 --> 14:47.320]  socialist you know when newsweek tells you we're all socialists now and shows
[14:47.320 --> 14:51.400]  two hands to the left and right shaking hands the red states the blue states
[14:51.400 --> 14:54.720]  that's so they can divide you and play you off against each other and yes they
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.760]  socialize the risk and privatize the profit that part's true but you get into
[14:58.760 --> 15:04.720]  socialist fascist all these different terms it's command and control in fact
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.040]  how about an Obama poster I'm asking Janae our great graphics lady to make a
[15:09.040 --> 15:13.400]  new Obama joker just for us we're gonna make a new t-shirt and it's gonna be our
[15:13.400 --> 15:18.680]  image of him as a joker but I want one with him with a big smile like the
[15:18.680 --> 15:24.080]  George Bush variant she made with big sharp teeth and I want it to say
[15:24.080 --> 15:31.000]  tyrant and that announced I already thought about doing this but I'm going
[15:31.000 --> 15:38.560]  to do it now that we've got 500 or so left of these Obama joker t-shirts the
[15:38.560 --> 15:41.960]  different variants with fascism info wars dot com new world order and
[15:41.960 --> 15:49.280]  socialist under it got about 500 or so left I I'm gonna start having more and
[15:49.280 --> 15:52.840]  more of our t-shirts be limited edition we may down the road have some new
[15:52.840 --> 16:00.320]  Obama joker variant but it will not be the archetypal one that you've seen when
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.720]  when when these are sold out we're gonna have our new Obama joker image and
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.120]  that's going to be limited edition as well so I will let everybody know if you
[16:10.120 --> 16:17.280]  want the Obama as the joker t-shirts from info wars dot com order them now
[16:17.280 --> 16:19.720]  because when they're gone they're gone they'll probably be gone in a couple
[16:19.720 --> 16:27.480]  of days again info wars dot com to go order online or 888-253-3139 and I'll
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.480]  tell you my main reason for doing it is I saw the Obama a different variants of
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.840]  it and I saw the ones you know our graphics lady made of bush when I ask
[16:35.840 --> 16:40.520]  her to and it's much better than the Obama one I think much scarier much more
[16:40.520 --> 16:45.520]  serious and I just want to have our own complete version I mean we took it
[16:45.520 --> 16:49.240]  change it a bit and put it up and it's public domain and out there and so it's
[16:49.240 --> 16:55.360]  going to be limited edition from us when these are sold they're gone so if you
[16:55.360 --> 16:59.240]  want to have the original Obama socialist fascist info wars or new world

[17:37.280 --> 17:42.440]  contest we need to add that to the rules I just had that idea that if you
[17:42.440 --> 17:48.440]  submit it for the contest and win that we're gonna use it as the t-shirt
[17:48.440 --> 17:53.280]  whatever that image is I want to see the diversity I want to see the ideas the
[17:53.280 --> 17:56.960]  contest is just a focal point to get people excited about getting out on the
[17:56.960 --> 18:02.760]  streets and posting flyers and posters it's about the poster revolution it's
[18:02.760 --> 18:07.160]  about the idea of getting up off your butt hey if you love big government you
[18:07.160 --> 18:11.760]  theorized eugenics health care you really buy all the crap being fed and you
[18:11.760 --> 18:14.600]  don't know the insurance companies actually want immunity and they're
[18:14.600 --> 18:17.640]  gonna give the big doctor groups immunity through this health care plan if
[18:17.640 --> 18:20.960]  you don't know it's a ripoff like the banker bailout and everything else and
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.920]  you believe it then why don't you make posters for the government take over a

[18:41.400 --> 18:46.240]  motivated and involved that's why I'm doing this that's why I spend 18 hours a
[18:46.240 --> 18:51.480]  day doing what I doing six seven days a week is because I understand real
[18:51.480 --> 19:07.200]  tyranny when I see it looking me in the eye and I'm concerned I'm concerned I'm

[25:11.480 --> 25:16.360]  front the Democrats are having staged town halls where they only let pre
[25:16.360 --> 25:22.120]  chosen supporters in and then they beat up anybody that I mean I'm seeing videos
[25:22.120 --> 25:26.400]  five six seven times a day of Democrats beating people up punching people
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.400]  elbowing people in the face I mean they're just a bunch of Nazi thugs and
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.800]  then they yell and scream and say the Republicans are staging all this and
[25:35.800 --> 25:41.000]  then the Democratic Party and other groups run ads paying their supporters
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.120]  to go out to fake town halls and then they have their supporters caught posing
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.000]  as doctors at town halls saying they're for it I mean it's just disgusting these
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.400]  are disgusting anti-American trash they're nothing but pirates it's a gang of
[25:55.400 --> 26:01.720]  pirates that want to rob what's left in the private sector and they work for the
[26:01.720 --> 26:06.320]  big offshore banks that are also waging war against what's left of the free
[26:06.320 --> 26:12.600]  market in this country the bankers are monopoly men they want a consolidation and
[26:12.600 --> 26:19.120]  this nation is just completely falling apart you know they love to just say on
[26:19.120 --> 26:23.320]  the TV we've got to have an amnesty bill I was watching CNBC this morning and I
[26:23.320 --> 26:27.000]  was running on the treadmill and they just kept saying we've got to have more
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.880]  immigrants it's what keeps America alive we're a nation of immigrants yeah when
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.080]  we were a nation of immigrants a hundred years ago or fifty years ago or two
[26:35.080 --> 26:39.360]  hundred years ago there wasn't welfare when somebody got off the boat they
[26:39.360 --> 26:42.920]  weren't given free health care and you know to have their babies and free
[26:42.920 --> 26:47.200]  housing and you know fake matricula cards of the average illegals on three
[26:47.200 --> 26:55.120]  different groups of welfare under three different names it's just all lies all
[26:55.120 --> 27:04.960]  distortion and the country it's now over a month and a half since we learned
[27:04.960 --> 27:09.520]  twenty three point seven trillion had been stolen in ten months now it's been
[27:09.520 --> 27:21.760]  eleven months eleven months since the banker takeover of October 3rd 2008 that
[27:21.760 --> 27:28.640]  means at current rates it's going to be twenty seven and a half trillion dollars
[27:28.640 --> 27:35.880]  or more than double the GDP GDP 13 trail two times 13 trail is 26 trail it's
[27:35.880 --> 27:40.760]  going to be a trillion and a half dollars more than double the GDP stolen by
[27:40.760 --> 27:47.200]  offshore banks and that's more than doubled all the mortgages paid off in
[27:47.200 --> 27:53.200]  the country mortgages on sky rise buildings mortgages on bungalows mortgages
[27:53.200 --> 27:56.800]  on farmhouses mortgages on twenty million dollar
[27:56.800 --> 28:04.000]  villas every mortgage paid off nine point four trillion nine point four
[28:04.000 --> 28:11.240]  trillion everyone so what's two times nine point four trillion that's eighteen
[28:11.240 --> 28:20.480]  point eight trillion and so we're talking about twenty seven and a half
[28:20.480 --> 28:31.080]  trillion we're talking about nine trillion plus dollars above double all
[28:31.080 --> 28:36.680]  the mortgages in the country in fact wait nine point four that's almost three
[28:36.680 --> 28:41.080]  times twenty seven and a half trillion is what it's going to be coming in at
[28:41.080 --> 28:45.360]  probably even more that's conservative twenty seven and a half trillion in a
[28:45.360 --> 28:54.560]  year since the foreign banks took over that is right at three times all the
[28:54.560 --> 29:01.840]  mortgages in the country they have stolen more than three times all the
[29:01.840 --> 29:07.400]  mortgages in the country and haven't given you a dollar of your stupid
[29:07.400 --> 29:11.600]  socialist money back because it isn't socialism it's robbery when somebody
[29:11.600 --> 29:14.600]  comes in your house and knocks down the door and puts a gun to your head and
[29:14.600 --> 29:19.720]  walks off with your TV your computers and your jewelry and your silverware and

[33:12.200 --> 33:28.640]  I am a Midwest farmer I make a living off the land I ride a John Deere tractor
[33:28.640 --> 33:36.600]  I'm a liberated man the rain it hasn't fallen since the middle of July and if
[33:36.600 --> 33:43.440]  it don't come soon my crops will die the bankman says he likes me there's
[33:43.440 --> 33:51.120]  nothing he can do he tells me that he's coming but the clouds are coming to be
[33:51.120 --> 33:55.040]  my friend now the clouds don't come around Central Texas while the Kim
[33:55.040 --> 33:59.840]  trailing I'll ride down the storm clouds blow in and government jets fly in Kim
[33:59.840 --> 34:03.640]  trail it all out why the house admits they're already terraforming the planet
[34:03.640 --> 34:09.320]  it's all part of studies though for official terraforming AP Reuters Wall
[34:09.320 --> 34:12.880]  Street Journal are announcing terraforming earth and the average
[34:12.880 --> 34:18.400]  public knows all about American Idol and all about dancing with the stars but
[34:18.400 --> 34:23.680]  they're like oh there's a giant program manipulating the weather no big deal you
[34:23.680 --> 34:30.600]  know why should we care oh we're living in 2009 we're living in Buck Rogers but
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.320]  instead of walking around in silver spacesuits and flying around jetpacks
[34:34.320 --> 34:38.520]  we're eating genetically modified food that's been engineered to sterilize us
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.240]  they're poisoning our water a bunch of eugenesis run things how do we get the
[34:43.240 --> 34:49.160]  public to wake up and pay attention to what's going on well I guess you make
[34:49.160 --> 34:53.800]  posters that say don't drink the tap water I mean I think that's one of the
[34:53.800 --> 34:59.040]  better ideas maybe an image of a great white shark coming up out of the water
[34:59.040 --> 35:03.280]  with its mouth the mob its mouth hanging open and it says don't drink the tap
[35:03.280 --> 35:08.160]  that art type of image of the tap water will hurt you there's something bad in
[35:08.160 --> 35:11.920]  the tap water now obviously I don't think somebody can win the contest now
[35:11.920 --> 35:17.480]  with that because I put it out there is my best idea but I mean what am I
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.320]  supposed to do I'm sick of coming in here and doing this radio show and I'm
[35:22.320 --> 35:25.920]  not sick of doing it because I don't like the work or the time of the energy
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.160]  I'm sick of knowing how real this is knowing how serious it is knowing how
[35:31.160 --> 35:35.160]  hardcore it is and understanding that if people would just take this seriously
[35:35.160 --> 35:44.800]  like it really is then we could end our problems very very quickly I don't like
[35:44.800 --> 35:48.480]  having to grub around and I'd rather just spend all my time making films
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.120]  making posters making videos getting a word out but I've spent about half my
[35:52.120 --> 35:55.360]  time just trying to fund the operation and I'm not bitching I'm not complaining
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.520]  I'm just letting you know why I'm frustrated you think I like having to
[35:59.520 --> 36:02.760]  run around all day with sponsors you think I like having to turn down most
[36:02.760 --> 36:06.440]  people that come to me wanting to be sponsors you think I like having to
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.120]  spend all my time dealing with taxes and regulations and crap because we play
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.400]  by the book here and by the numbers and all the stupid rules so we can keep our
[36:14.400 --> 36:20.280]  nose clean so we can continue what we're doing you think I like it you think I
[36:20.280 --> 36:24.840]  enjoy having to burn most my time dealing with power out of Jews and light
[36:24.840 --> 36:28.440]  bulbs burning out and websites going down and all the regular crap of life
[36:28.440 --> 36:34.600]  when all I want to do is war people I got children that live in this country on
[36:34.600 --> 36:41.120]  this world I believe the things I say I know I'm right I know it's real then I
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.520]  see something like media matters openly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation by
[36:46.520 --> 36:49.880]  the Carnegie endowment and by George Soros you know look at their federal
[36:49.880 --> 36:53.920]  filings so who's who of foundations attacking me every couple days I'm
[36:53.920 --> 36:58.560]  attacked every day by daily costs think progress all the big globalist news
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.440]  sites are singling me out that lets me know we're having an effect and that
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.960]  that's what keeps me going is to know that we are exposing these bastards and
[37:07.960 --> 37:10.960]  they don't like it and so they're pulling out every stop behind the scenes
[37:10.960 --> 37:13.920]  against us and I don't like spending time I'm not gonna give it attention on

[39:33.080 --> 39:37.080]  cacophony is so high that even them shutting the internet down as they're
[39:37.080 --> 39:44.120]  openly saying they're about to do well only backfire on them record these shows

[40:40.480 --> 40:44.080]  cable guy movie where he's running around in a pigsty with being chased by
[40:44.080 --> 40:59.040]  Secret Service but I don't even want to be here because I want to be here so
[40:59.040 --> 41:02.560]  bad I'm burning to just yell and scream at the microphone I've got all this
[41:02.560 --> 41:11.360]  information to cover all these phone calls to get to and I'm just tired of
[41:11.360 --> 41:19.880]  it I'm tired of bureaucracy I'm tired of tyranny I'm tired of all these
[41:19.880 --> 41:32.360]  parasites running all over us I am just so sick of it I mean every day I see
[41:32.360 --> 41:38.280]  hundreds of stories that are 180 degrees the opposite of liberty and freedom
[41:38.280 --> 41:43.800]  feds cracking down on garage sales McClatchy newspapers if you're planning

[42:03.720 --> 42:08.440]  poison in your water and they say oh it's for children because there might be a
[42:08.440 --> 42:12.600]  toy that's not safe being sold that's up to the parents to decide the government
[42:12.600 --> 42:16.920]  can't be their nanny the government says it can't read the 1300 page health care
[42:16.920 --> 42:20.440]  bill but can run our health care

[44:51.480 --> 44:54.600]  and all these self-serving full of themselves idiots out there
[44:54.600 --> 44:57.160]  don't realize that they could have stopped this overnight if they just get
[44:57.160 --> 45:01.080]  involved now the good news is people are waking up but not fast enough
[45:01.080 --> 45:04.360]  and rush limbaugh and glenn becker there to play the part of the opposition
[45:04.360 --> 45:08.600]  so that you go to them so that when they put a neocon back in power
[45:08.600 --> 45:12.040]  they can make you stand down part of the left-right paradigm just like obama
[45:12.040 --> 45:15.560]  was there you wake up under bush you vote for obama now he's in
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.000]  now you're supporting all his tyranny you've been fooled
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.760]  by a simple parlor trick
[45:22.760 --> 45:29.400]  if you're planning i mean this is usa back in the ussr if you're planning a
[45:29.400 --> 45:34.040]  garage sale organizing a church bizarre you best beware you could be
[45:34.040 --> 45:37.560]  breaking a new federal law as part of a campaign called resale roundup
[45:37.560 --> 45:40.760]  most everything's a roundup they have local newspapers in austin about people
[45:40.760 --> 45:44.520]  arrested and it's a fun culture to laugh at people in the gladiatorial pit
[45:44.520 --> 45:48.360]  even though you'll be in there next week and it's all about roundup roundup
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.040]  you know over 10 percent now of texans or have felonies for all the finds and
[45:52.040 --> 45:55.240]  fees and they announce it as a roundup so when they have real roundups you'll
[45:55.240 --> 45:59.320]  sit there and suck your thumb also some offshore banks can own and rule
[45:59.320 --> 46:02.840]  everything and all their parasite servants just can't wait to have their
[46:02.840 --> 46:05.960]  way with you because they know how to put black uniforms on and they know how to
[46:05.960 --> 46:09.000]  rape your daughters and that's about all they plan on doing
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.080]  and you're gonna take it because you love it as part of the campaign called
[46:13.080 --> 46:17.000]  resale roundup the federal government is cracking down on second hand sales of
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  dangerous and destructive products the initiative which targets toys and other
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.320]  products for children and forces a new provision that makes it a crime to resale
[46:25.320 --> 46:28.520]  anything that's been recalled for its manufacture
[46:28.520 --> 46:31.000]  see because that's how they get their camels nose in the 10th lap oh it's for
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.320]  the children we're just gonna be out there we're just gonna be helping you
[46:35.320 --> 46:39.240]  those who resell recall children's products are not only breaking the law
[46:39.240 --> 46:42.920]  they're putting children's lives at risk like all the tens of millions you've
[46:42.920 --> 46:46.200]  killed with your chemical weapons
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.040]  so the chairwoman of the consumer safety product commission

[47:17.960 --> 47:21.320]  without a face scan and a thumbprint and yeah i know we've heard of that before
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.520]  somewhere called the bible but even if you're an atheist you should realize
[47:24.520 --> 47:30.040]  this is total tyranny dummies the crackdown affects sellers

[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:44.440]  right right but it wasn't that that the first thing you know it's not a town
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:48.360]  hall they did i snuck in they made me surrender my side outside
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:52.760]  but then a bunch of kids were allowed to run in on the up to the stage waving
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:56.040]  their pro obama propaganda side which is just like what they do at the city
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.040]  council meetings they make a surrender
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:01.240]  side there when they let these obama students run in and do it
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:06.280]  so it's total uh... total hogwash this is big business they've stolen 23.7
[1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:09.320]  trail they're going to take everything you got they're going to ban your garage
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:11.400]  sales they're not going to let you sell eggs

[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:28.040]  counseling the first amendment rights and uh... that's how it works that's how
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:32.520]  america hey you heard the uh... you heard that these the the government
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:35.720]  bureaucrats saying this ain't america no more
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:39.080]  we owe you you son of a batch
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:44.280]  well they it's scary but uh... it was exciting and then there's a huge rally
[1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:48.600]  before the uh... church thing there's a huge uh... pro freedom rally at the
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:51.480]  pink lady you know lots of people out there to state
[1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:55.000]  capital building and we were just uh... you know there's all kind of patriots
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:58.200]  and we're all that's good and protest and demonstrations are good but what if
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:01.400]  the five hundred peoples what i've read was it five hundred or more
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:05.720]  i think it was more okay well the news said five hundred if five hundred people
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:08.760]  we've had two thousand before and they said it's a hundred so
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:12.600]  if you have five hundred people all put up a hundred
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:16.760]  uh... pro liberty signs you would take over austin so it's good to go out and
[1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:20.360]  have demonstrations but that's kind of primitive look our armies here better
[1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:24.840]  than your army but but it's better to start micro fm's or a m's it's
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:28.440]  better to start access tv it's better to put up signs
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:31.640]  it's better to put out a local neighborhood newsletter it's better to go
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:35.160]  to city council you know they shut you down a thousand more should go

[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:26.040]  yeah um yeah one of the things i kind of brought up on the forum was uh talking
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:29.880]  about the michael moors new movie uh capitalism a love story i i've only
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:34.440]  watched the uh the trailer but you know knowing how its films have been in a
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:37.400]  past and seeing all this trail yeah he's gonna blame
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:41.560]  free market on what happened not criminality not offshore banks that
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:44.440]  actually fund the fake environmental movement actually fund
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:47.720]  socialization of wealth so it can be pooled and extracted
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:51.160]  internationally he's playing the false left right paradigm
[1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:54.760]  and our trailers got released the same day unbeknownst to me i didn't
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:58.600]  do that on purpose ours had more than him until
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:02.760]  fall of republic until they put it on the main page as a featured video
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:08.120]  as an advertisement as the top bar as the top ad on youtube and he's still
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.360]  barely beating us i mean people really are tired of his left right system but
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:15.640]  go ahead and make your point well i just wanted to ask you know do you think we
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:18.600]  should be uh you know at least protesting or not maybe
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:22.120]  about boycotting the film at least at least when the movie premieres
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:29.160]  when does it come out uh i think was october 5th i think or second
[1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:35.400]  yeah ours comes out uh october 21st and gets into the whole banking thing and
[1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:39.320]  how both parties are involved and how it's a criminal takeover
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:43.960]  not socialist again the media says it's socialist this is not socialism and i'm
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:46.840]  not a fan of socialism but it's better than this
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:50.760]  this is not socialism i mean if we're gonna have the debt
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:56.440]  of 23.7 trillion and growing it'll be 27.5
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:00.040]  again by the one-year anniversary at the way it's trending
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:03.480]  that would pay for all the mortgages three times over
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:08.920]  three times in one year nothing to do with mortgages that's not socialism
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:11.640]  socialism would be taking money from the middle class
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:16.760]  and redistributing it and from the rich the rich are all tax free and exempt
[1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:20.440]  i haven't seen the trailer yet i just bernards was showing me the numbers
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:23.240]  sunday of look we have more views for your trailer
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:26.360]  than michael moore had till it was put at the top of the page but
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:30.520]  uh go ahead well yeah that's that's great i just that's pretty much just why
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:33.880]  you pretty much answer for me just you know why your opinion on that
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:37.160]  as far as oh yeah he'll he'll he'll he'll call
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:41.240]  guaranteed for a new global regulator over corporations
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:45.960]  which is what the global corporations that engineered this are calling for
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:50.520]  so see oh we screwed up give us unlimited power
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:53.480]  just like in the in the 90s they said give us more power
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:57.560]  to stop any regulatory crises or economic crises and they got rid of
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:01.240]  Glass-Steagall i appreciate your call
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:08.360]  in fact uh a bunch of big scientific publications
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:12.280]  including new scientists came out with reports
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:16.280]  that a handful of global banks own basically everything
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:19.320]  well of course they do they own the corporations they own it all
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:25.160]  these are just different subsidiaries ibm microsoft it's all government slash
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:29.400]  private corporate corruption is so bad now
[1:14:29.400 --> 1:14:33.400]  that you're not allowed to photograph royal families anywhere in the world
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:37.480]  you can photograph any citizens you want any movie stars you want on the street
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.720]  but courts will rule for the dutch and british royal family that it's illegal
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:45.320]  to photograph them they're god because they own the oil companies they own the
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:48.280]  derivatives through fraud they own everything
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:51.800]  they're god then they're saying to you you have no rights and you're their
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:58.280]  slave you got to say 1776 i'm not your property scumbag
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:00.680]  they just so happen to be a bunch of you genesis
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:05.000]  who openly want to drug your water supply and your food
[1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:10.040]  it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:13.160]  stumbles are where the doer of deeds could have done
[1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:17.240]  them better the credit belongs the man who's actually in the arena
[1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:21.160]  whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:25.480]  who eras and comes short again and again
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:31.480]  because there is not effort without error and shortcomings
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:34.760]  but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:38.680]  enthusiasm's the great devotion who spends himself in worthy causes
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:42.520]  who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:47.320]  and who at worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:51.080]  so that his place shall never be with those cold timid souls
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:55.240]  who know neither victory nor defeat get out
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:59.880]  in the arena ladies and gentlemen draw your sword in the end for the war
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:03.480]  and go out and start hacking down our enemies we have the truth
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:07.080]  we have the passion we have it all so
[1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:11.400]  deal destruction in the info war to the enemy unleash
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:16.040]  your power can't you feel it seething in you
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:20.440]  rising can't you feel your ancestors demanding
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:23.480]  that you shake off the fluoride and mercury
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:28.600]  haze and that you rise up with power and strength and honor
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:34.760]  and stand up for the innocent stand up for our country stand up to the parasites
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:40.680]  huh all these lesser men bind themselves together at
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:46.280]  hordes and try to pull down the strong stand up to the eugenicist trash
[1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:49.880]  stand up to ron emmanuel's brother and tell them
[1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:54.600]  that they are not your gods your owners your kings
[1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:58.680]  and that you have an absolute divine right as a free creature
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:05.400]  made in the image of the creator of the universe to be free
[1:17:11.480 --> 1:17:15.320]  thinker in texas you're on the air looks i had two things
[1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:18.600]  but your your talk right now is so strong i'm going to start with a second
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:22.760]  one if you don't mind sure um this is something from
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:27.160]  mary becker eddy i belong to no church i want that to be very clear before i
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:30.920]  read this she says the great battle of onageddon
[1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:34.920]  is upon us the powers of evil are linked together in secret conspiracy against
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:38.360]  the lord and his christ large numbers and desperate malice
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:41.960]  are engaged day and night in organizing actions against us
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:45.640]  their feeling and purpose are deadly and they have sworn entity against the
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:49.320]  lives of our standard bearers and it goes on like that and that was written
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:53.160]  in 1886 um she knew that conspiracies
[1:17:53.160 --> 1:17:55.880]  were terrible then and that they would be coming out
[1:17:55.880 --> 1:18:00.440]  more and more and it's you're uncovering them now and thank god for that
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:04.200]  um the question i had for you first was and you you answered it a little while
[1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:07.720]  ago partly but i would love it if you would make another comment
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:11.240]  you said every time the clouds come in they chem trail them out
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:14.840]  we're having a terrible drought in in austin the animals are staggering
[1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:18.440]  around the plants are dying can you say a few more words about that and after
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:22.920]  that i have one more question if i could we're making a chem trail film we have
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:26.120]  the government's own documents they admit they're doing it
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:29.640]  in mass and you tell the general thumb sucking public
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:33.160]  on fluoride that they're chemical spraying us with barium salts and
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:36.280]  aluminum dioxide that they come in and kill the cloud
[1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:39.960]  formations that they're engineering a worldwide drought
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:43.000]  and it's it's just admitted they're doing it and
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:46.440]  it's just going to continue because there's nothing these evil people won't
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:50.280]  do i mean it's john p holdren just search
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:54.840]  engine his name and the term geo engineering and he said admits their
[1:18:54.840 --> 1:18:59.800]  giant chem trail program well exactly all these years exactly what we
[1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:03.160]  said chem trails are they now come out in the wall street journal and say
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:07.320]  they're good i hear and often in particular do
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:12.600]  you think because there seem to be rain all around us it just doesn't come here
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:16.120]  well i mean out in california you can see when the cloud formation comes in
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:18.920]  with water they come in and spray and knock the clouds out they've got
[1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:22.920]  mixtures that do that i mean they admit they're quote manipulating the
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:26.360]  weather they just say the details are classified
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:29.400]  and they have a congressional weather control bureau

[1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:38.360]  and uh nasa admits that the earth's 20 darker than it was a few years ago and
[1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:41.960]  they're just spraying out satellite photos show the trails
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:45.080]  and it's just hellish and they're just going to keep spraying and keep spraying
[1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:47.880]  and keep spraying because out of disaster
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:51.320]  government gets more power they want to bankrupt everything they want to

[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:06.600]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:10.440]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:13.720]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:17.560]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of
[1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:21.000]  your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:24.120]  will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to ensure
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:27.480]  deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:31.160]  a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:34.760]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:38.120]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:41.720]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative

[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:25.400]  streets when really they just want government control of it so they can
[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.720]  steal it they want another 20 percent of your

[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:48.440]  tyranny in the name of taking care of people
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:53.960]  let's go to uh tina and then wilson and then ingrid
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:57.480]  tina in ohio you're oh tina just hung up wilson in florida
[1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:01.720]  you're on the air go ahead hello good afternoon alice jones
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:05.080]  is the president speaking to you i just got a quick question
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:09.640]  curious if i have like a water filter will that still well the water still
[1:25:09.640 --> 1:25:12.280]  like a fragment like you say there's fluoride in the water
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:19.400]  well am i safe what type of filter do you have a pure water filter
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:26.120]  that the company pure yeah yeah is it uh
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:31.320]  is it on the faucet or is it like a i mean i i'd have to know the model
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:34.440]  number uh but what what type of filter does it
[1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:39.720]  say it is charcoal um now one second i got it
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:44.200]  right here
[1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:49.800]  it says pure nsc faucet mountain filtration system it doesn't really say
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:56.600]  anything on it is it a pitcher or does it uh hook onto the faucet
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:02.440]  it's hooked onto the faucet all filtration is better than nothing
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:06.120]  it it stops the dead back see chlorine only kills the dead bacteria that are in
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:10.760]  the city water system it cuts out just any even a
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:14.680]  charcoal filter depending on the filter cuts 70 80 90 percent
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:18.600]  it varies with every one uh a lot of those more complex
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:23.480]  filtration systems as long as you change them on a regular basis they reduce
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:26.520]  everything uh if you leave them on too long they
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:30.280]  become more toxic as all that stuff builds up then it starts leaching
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:34.600]  at even higher levels what's been built up so getting rid of filters
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:37.640]  and changing them out on a regular basis is what's essential
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:43.560]  but yes a charcoal filter a carbon filter other basic ceramic filters
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:50.200]  are great uh but they only reduce even reverse osmosis only reduces 98
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:52.840]  percent or more depending on the filtration system
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:56.360]  fluoride this fluoride is so small its molecule
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:27:02.120]  is close to the size of uh water and so the only thing that will really do it
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:10.760]  is distilled water uh or true water from a spring
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:14.920]  and then you've got to check the content of that spring's water
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:19.240]  but let's see when you hear fluoride a lot of natural springs have calcium
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:23.080]  fluoride that's actually good for you when you hear the word fluoride
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:29.400]  that is a catchall term for up to 340 plus but usually over 100
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:34.680]  different chemicals that cities dump lead mercury arsenic
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:38.360]  uh cyanide i mean you can't make this up
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:43.800]  the what they call fluoride is actually a special toxic waste brewed
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:47.400]  just to cause brain damage they put in the water and i and i've had the head of
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:51.960]  the epa uh union on the top scientists just you know
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:55.560]  we're 90 plus percent of them wrote a letter
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:59.640]  last year or was it it was a 97 now or 2007
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:02.760]  saying this is deadly poison this is killing people
[1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:07.080]  so do not drink the tap water the tap water
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:11.560]  is just absolute hardcore chemical weapon that's why the public is retarded
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:16.440]  i mean they literally have been under chemical attack
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:20.280]  all right and i have one final question i was curious my uncle was actually
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:25.320]  curious how was the swine flu came came upon us
[1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:29.400]  well we've had top scientists on and you can begin search engine it
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.000]  top virologist says swine flu made in lab
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:41.640]  then you'll see bbc and other headlines and it was clearly clearly made in a
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:45.320]  lab and then it showed up in the wrong hemisphere wrong time of year
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:51.960]  they fearmongered about it and regardless the attempted response to it
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:56.280]  and the level 6.2 now they've made the scale even higher than six
[1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:59.800]  was the formal height uh is all about the un
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:03.800]  world health organization ordering nation states what to do under treaty
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:06.760]  and the un's bragging oh this is great for the un and
[1:29:06.760 --> 1:29:10.280]  global governance global government because this is how we order everybody
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:13.080]  to take it but we have all these other flu shots killing
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:17.000]  people in the trials in history we have the 76 swine flu killing a bunch of
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.880]  people we have internal cdc documents saying
[1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:25.800]  past swine flu uh test of killed people the the bird flu test
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:29.720]  last year killed a bunch of people in europe so why

[1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:19.400]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:23.640]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all
[1:32:23.640 --> 1:32:28.120]  in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or
[1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:31.960]  government created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get
[1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:36.280]  off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power
[1:32:36.280 --> 1:32:40.200]  if so this will be the most important information you have ever heard
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:44.360]  solar power generators are finally available they have no moving parts to
[1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:48.600]  wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever
[1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:53.480]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:58.360]  that's mysolarbackup.com check out mysolarbackup.com

[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:23.080]  i want to do a big news blitz i'm going to announce in 10 minutes who's coming up
[1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:28.680]  on the show in the final two hours today
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:34.200]  so stay with us for that ingrid in nevada ingrid you're on the air welcome
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:39.960]  hello alex uh about uh five months before the maya gripboard came out
[1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:43.560]  my friend and we got pulled over in las vegas for the wrong phone in for war
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:47.960]  stickers and it happened again last friday
[1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:52.200]  in order to protect ourselves and also support your sponsors
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:56.840]  i ordered one of those camera prints but i had it on the charger that night
[1:33:56.840 --> 1:34:00.760]  because it takes from two to four hours to charge
[1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:07.080]  and i forgot to bring it anyway police car behind us
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:12.760]  and then the lights come on and he comes to the car
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:15.960]  and my friend he just had a haircut a few days ago
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:20.760]  and he says you're in the military aren't you my friend said no
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:25.240]  but i was in the marines he says oh so you're a veteran
[1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:29.400]  then he shines the light in the car and my friend has
[1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:33.160]  one of those organites and he says what is this
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:37.960]  and he says that's an organite and he says what is an organite
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:43.800]  this looks like a cell to a bomb i was in shock when he said that
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:49.640]  and then we explained it to him it's against the microwave towers
[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:52.680]  and then he ordered my friend out of the car
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:56.120]  and in the back in the front of the police car
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:34:59.480]  then he so he pulled you over and flipped out over the ron paul
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:04.680]  and i don't know if you're the lady in uh las vegas but there's a video
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:08.760]  of police in a parking lot flipping out over a ron paul sticker
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:13.000]  and in south carolina they raided people's door and kicked it down and
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.320]  uh i mean because the mike report and the dhs report that we broke
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:21.480]  says you're a terrorist basically if you support auditing the fed
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:25.080]  i guess 75 of americans in that gallup polar terrorist
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:30.040]  and so now he's got you out of the car uh all of this is going on did
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:32.600]  continue with the story did he say it was because of the
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:37.960]  evil ron paul no but it definitely was because we never got a ticket
[1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:41.320]  he was behind us for about a minute and then the lights come on
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:45.480]  we never got a ticket and he didn't tell us i understand so how did this end
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:48.680]  how did this end well he wasn't blinded we were
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:52.920]  terrorists making a bomb with the bit to organize
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:56.520]  yeah so these are like a work of art for many people for other people they think
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:00.760]  it deals with the it's it's a writhe in fact somebody
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:04.440]  mailed this one will somebody go grab me that out of the back office the
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:08.520]  orgon generator i mean i mean they're pretty neat little things i don't really
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:12.680]  uh and he thought it was a cell to make a bomb i couldn't look look look look
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:16.040]  the the new thing is cops come up the bad ones
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:20.680]  and they say your camera is a gun your bag is a bomb we know it's not we're
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:23.880]  going to charge you with it that's in truth rising my film
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:27.800]  happened to look radowski and we are changing new york so so how did this end
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:32.120]  he says uh he says uh okay you're obviously al qaeda what
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:36.440]  happens next well uh he questions my friend in the
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:40.120]  back of the police car and then he goes in the face the other way
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:43.720]  then he come back to the car where i was and he says
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:48.920]  now tell me what what is this for is this a cell is this a cell to make a bomb
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:52.440]  so i explain it to him again no it's an orc night
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:57.240]  against the energy of the cell phone towers and um
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:01.080]  he didn't really believe me but he looked like a rookie that just came out of
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:04.760]  the police training yeah we have this quantico fbi training video i've been
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:07.880]  so busy i haven't played it but you know i'm gonna play it tomorrow i'm gonna
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:10.920]  play it unedited in its entirety tomorrow
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:14.520]  we'll do that uh in the third hour tomorrow in fact make a note for
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:18.280]  erin i'm just gonna air the 14 minute fbi training video
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:22.520]  and they are teaching them everyone is a terrorist i mean there are terrorists
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:25.640]  everywhere and of course really the government staged the terror attacks and
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:28.840]  that's been declassified many of the stage terror attacks
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:32.840]  uh in the past yep here it is so this is the
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:37.640]  i guess the evil thing and to be honest it does have metal shavings in it the
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:40.280]  more i think about it this does almost look like a
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:44.760]  shape-charged weapon like you'd put plastic behind this
[1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:48.440]  and uh but but no that's not that's not what they are
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:52.520]  but he definitely then if he didn't give you a ticket pulls you over the ron paul
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:57.880]  thing and then he saw this and so uh the more i think about it i mean it's
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:01.960]  got metal shavings in it this is exactly what we thought about it
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:08.680]  alec that's crazy i wasn't shocked yeah and then he yeah but the point is the
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:14.520]  point is the point is i've seen him uh it's in road to tyranny with
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:18.680]  feral montgomery gets pulled over they just taser him for no reason let the
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:22.200]  dog attack him he's got his hands up and they get on the news with jumper cables
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:27.000]  and go look instead of going look surge roids they go look sir
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:31.960]  pipe bombs and uh it was and then they had to let him go later but they've got a
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:34.840]  look they're out of control they're teaching them al-qaeda is everywhere
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.240]  so they're going to see al-qaeda but i'm sorry how did this end
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:42.920]  he thought it's what he had cut off my friend and and and saying implying he's
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:48.040]  in the military and he's a terrorist uh he finally let us go but no ticket like
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:50.840]  i said and uh it definitely was for the ron paul
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:54.120]  sticker and when you see this f but you definitely put ron paul sticker did
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:57.640]  did you ask him about that no my friend told me to shut up
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:02.040]  because because well i guarantee you you've been putting the database now
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:05.880]  when you see the fbi training manual it says woman has a camera
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:09.640]  al-qaeda put her in the crime database she's now al-qaeda
[1:39:09.640 --> 1:39:13.320]  uh and so it's all about a chilling effect where there's no judge no jury
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:16.360]  can't own farms anymore when you're put on the secret list
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:20.280]  can't have jobs they're openly announcing just total tyranny
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:24.360]  just big armored government buildings that control the country through these
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:28.120]  tracking grids and then they just turn your life off and you try to
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:31.240]  make money with a garage sale after they've turned your national ID card
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:34.600]  off the swat team pulls up and gets out and goes
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:40.360]  you don't sell stuff in america take them away to the reeducation camp
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:44.840]  this ain't america anymore queue up the bureaucrat saying it isn't america
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:48.440]  anymore i mean i appreciate your call and believe me that's what happens when
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:51.240]  they first start getting rid of free speech in the second
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:56.360]  amendment and any right it immediately goes downhill
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:59.640]  it's like you start cresting like a water slide like if you go to slitter bond
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:03.960]  or some water park right at first you're going slow and then
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:07.720]  and we're already sliding and now it's just now
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:12.600]  starting to speed up we're like and it's gonna go
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:15.400]  and it's just gonna be just stealing and grabbing and
[1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:18.920]  it's ours now everything oh god we love it
[1:40:18.920 --> 1:40:23.000]  we're scum we're filth we can't produce anything but we can steal
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.960]  and and i realized all the thugism all the militarized police all of it
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:35.000]  they're the real class they're the upper class we're the lower class
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:38.360]  and you get a uniform you get a badge you get a government bureaucracy you
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:44.600]  become a code enforcer you become a cps worker you're now a god
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:48.040]  and everyone and because i was in the
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:51.240]  flew out to la last week again to take care of very important projects we're
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:54.520]  working on not just the jesse ventura tv show that i'm now a consultant

[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:01.960]  i'm just gonna probably all of them but i'll just leave it at that and then part
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:04.920]  of the next show that gets picked up but side issue
[1:41:04.920 --> 1:41:08.520]  and i was doing some other stuff out in la that will reveal next week but
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:16.040]  the point is that leaving austin
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:21.800]  tsa big fans again oh my friend in bass drop just loves you oh my
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:24.840]  husband just loves you other tsa guys going yeah i know

[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:47.400]  now they got a little too over the top training everybody to be slaves and
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:50.360]  bossing you around so people kind of rebelled against it so now they act
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.760]  a little more friendly and tsa admits they've been told to do that
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:56.120]  because now they're going nationwide on the streets of america but i did watch
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:00.520]  tsa in like a bathroom coming in like shoving people like get out of my way
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:03.960]  you know just like real body language of because you know it's crowded bathroom
[1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:07.720]  in there at the urinals and i watched them at restaurants and
[1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:11.960]  things people like scared in them going and you're some guy you go get paid
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:15.720]  12 14 bucks an hour and suddenly everybody's scared of you
[1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:19.720]  and see this is the new class system government and national security and
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:23.320]  their bureaucracies they're just turning the whole economy
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:26.200]  into their system
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:32.120]  we're going to go to gene and ray and anti federalist and andrew and pat in a
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:34.680]  moment i want to go ahead and make that announcement
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:39.960]  this is the maiden voyage of the trailer this is an info war centric trailer
[1:42:39.960 --> 1:42:44.600]  though i would say i'm the main there's a lot of other great people in this film
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:49.400]  let me just stop there let me just calmly explain this to you
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:53.640]  drumroll please
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:43:00.280]  william lewis has made a film about the history of fema camps the current fema
[1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:05.000]  camp facility he got tours of fema camps he has made
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:09.800]  a film that i wanted to make but i've been focused on other big issues
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:13.480]  and i'm glad he made it and so when they asked me to be an advisor on it
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:18.760]  and they asked me to be the main voice in the film i was very honored to be
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:20.680]  part of it it's got a lot of other great people
[1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:27.320]  in it as well comes off very well comes off very mainstream but also
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:32.600]  devastating and it covers all the real fema camp info the rumors
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:38.040]  are over it's proven we have a similar in a month or so coming out but i can't

[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:15.800]  in a moment william lewis was already a great
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:23.960]  filmmaker of a whole bunch of different documentaries
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:28.760]  like america under siege and washten you're fired
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:35.960]  and the bubble about what's happening with the economy but this
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:42.280]  film is extremely powerful and extremely

[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:26.840]  the elites have said that they want to have a
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:31.000]  final revolution that they know the public's going to revolt against them
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:34.280]  so that's why they've scientifically set up the surveillance grid
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:38.040]  the casual society this whole continuity of government system
[1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:44.840]  is designed to suppress and control the people of america
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:51.240]  my name is samozaki i'm a native born american citizen los angeles california
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:58.520]  when franklin delano rosevelt signed executive order 9066
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:04.040]  we were all rounded up like cattle and placed into america's concentration
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:07.640]  camps in may 2007 president bush signed a national
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:12.440]  security presidential directive 51 most americans would agree that it
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:16.040]  would be prudent to have a plan to provide for the
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:19.080]  continuity of government they have such a plan
[1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:22.200]  they introduced a little sketchy public version that's
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:26.200]  clearly inadequate but they said don't worry there's a detailed classified
[1:55:26.200 --> 1:55:34.360]  version army regulation 210-35 now this was set up in 1986
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:41.800]  secretly and for 10 plus years it was secret and in 1997 bill
[1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:46.920]  clinton declassified this and we were the first major radio show to cover it
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:52.440]  since then it's been expanded this list 12 camps
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:56.120]  to hold american citizens that have been built
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:03.800]  by the united states army beginning in october the army plans to station an
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.120]  active unit inside the united states under north kong
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:12.280]  and under the new homeland brigade it was first going to be 3 000
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:16.840]  and then 20 000 and then 40 000 the third infantry divisions first brigade
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:20.520]  combat team has spent 35 of last 60 months in iran
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:24.200]  combat hardened troops who've been running camps and
[1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:29.480]  centers in iraq are now coming back to the united states to quote carry out
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:33.240]  law enforcement actions the army unit may be called upon to
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:37.800]  help with civil unrest and crowd control the primary purpose of this force is to
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:40.200]  provide help to people in need in the aftermath of a
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:44.520]  wmd-like event in homeland why is the media on one hand saying there are no
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:47.400]  fema camps but on the other hand legislation
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:51.160]  has been introduced to build here's hr 645
[1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:56.040]  legalizing what has already been developed what's already been paid for
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:57:00.760]  by fema the government doesn't build things that are not needed or that there
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:04.680]  aren't contingency plans let's say there's a reason for them
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:08.440]  these are the kinds of camps that could be used for political dissidents
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:12.760]  just like occurred in nazi germany i think the government's anticipating that
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:18.600]  there's going to be a increased reaction against the economic downturn
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:24.120]  all of our rights are predicated on a a free america
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:28.840]  and if we don't have a free america all of the other questions become moot
[1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:31.880]  don't these companies have a responsibility morally if they're in
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:35.160]  their building camps and building shackles and building bar bar
[1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:40.120]  facing in to speak out i talked to the department of security
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:44.280]  spokespeople and they affirm the contract with this kbr the former

[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:28.920]  of the g20 in pittsburgh and they're saying no no no
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:31.800]  semi-automatic rivals allowed in the city at that time in fact
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:35.160]  that's in my stack but print assault weapons ban for g20
[2:01:35.160 --> 2:01:40.760]  i'm going to cover that go ahead ma'am yeah on truth dig dot org there's a
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:45.000]  big story about it but the other thing i want to mention
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:51.960]  her name is uh Naomi wolf has done a very good um it was earlier than your
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:58.520]  material but she details the 10th which a government will use to go from the
[2:01:58.520 --> 2:02:02.680]  democracy to a fascist state yeah we've had her on and she's been
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:06.360]  critical of obama now she's a road scholar
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:11.240]  and uh she goes over the 10 steps yes and it's all exactly what's happening
[2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:16.280]  yeah and i think that this g20 meeting on the 25th and 26th of september in
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:20.120]  pittsburgh may be the event that these that they're all
[2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:23.480]  getting geared up for well we're going to get
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:27.480]  guessed on about the g20 assault weapons ban which is all semi-automatic
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:30.360]  handguns and rifles and what they do is that see for special
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:33.640]  events they say you don't have your rights then they expand it out to
[2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:37.000]  everything now anything else gene
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:40.520]  no i'm just i'm thinking of going there but i'm looking at this
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:45.880]  picture of the paramilitary being there and i'm wondering if i'm going to get
[2:02:45.880 --> 2:02:48.680]  you know well that's part of the intimidation that's why they hire
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:52.280]  provocateurs to attack the police so they can rubber bullet
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:56.520]  the whole innocent crowd to then scare everybody into not going to political
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:02:59.880]  events this is all that they've been caught in denver last year it's in the
[2:02:59.880 --> 2:03:03.640]  obama deception extras admitted the police attacked their own cops
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:06.280]  they were caught in canada a year and a half ago
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:10.040]  uh... at the north american union summit police attacking police
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:13.160]  these are hardcore criminals and they never get in trouble for it
[2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:16.360]  ma'am i appreciate your call yeah here it is
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:20.680]  pittsburgh post-cazette assault weapon ban for g20 summit
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:25.160]  gun debate springs from city proposal to control protesters
[2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:28.040]  of course concealed carry people are everywhere with guns
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:31.080]  which is even more dangerous but they don't care they don't
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:35.080]  want to see people with guns out in the open because that
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:40.280]  breaks the the spell that guns are illegal
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:43.400]  see they run these ads and billboards saying reporting legal guns
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:47.160]  and all the shows are based in new york or chicago the dramas where a cop finds a
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:49.480]  gun in somebody's house and takes him to jail for it
[2:03:49.480 --> 2:03:55.080]  wheat minded people see that and think guns are illegal in arizona and texas
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:04:02.120]  when they're only illegal in dc in new york and chicago
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:05.480]  pittsburgh short-lived ban assault weapons quashed by
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:10.040]  attorney general the general assembly in 94 is still in the city's books
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:12.840]  and it may get new life under legislation driven by the
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:16.760]  next month's g20 summit a little notice clause in the proposed ordinance
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:21.240]  written by mayor luke raven stalls administration to keep protesters from
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:24.280]  thwarting police crowd control efforts invokes the default
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:27.800]  assault weapons ban the clause says no person shall possess
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:32.440]  an array of items including 37 contraband weapons listed on the ban
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:36.920]  so see this has been thrown out before but they're criminals they don't care
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:46.760]  for the purpose of defeating lawful removal by police
[2:04:46.760 --> 2:04:51.720]  it's effect is a matter of debate so again under national or local
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:54.280]  emergencies they say you don't have a right to your guns
[2:04:54.280 --> 2:04:57.800]  because they're tyrants scum working for offshore banks

[2:11:05.560 --> 2:11:08.680]  think that once people get to see this they're going to be coming back to you
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:12.680]  for some more information uh you know this was a million different
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:15.400]  pieces that we had to whittle down to about a
[2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:19.880]  thousand and put together so um obviously everything that all of our
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:22.840]  guests said in the documentary when we were shooting didn't make it in there
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:26.200]  but uh i think that uh you'll notice you and uh
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:31.160]  what john snap miller katharine blige a couple others there
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:34.600]  uh bald one side and eric you know there were
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:38.360]  there were several people that we gave kind of special treatment to because
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:42.280]  you guys really are on the forefront of uh fighting the new world order and
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:45.560]  and really talking about i've got to say snap miller
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:49.240]  i've never really seen him do tv he comes across really good on camera
[2:11:49.240 --> 2:11:53.240]  so i mean again the film is you want to hand something to somebody and say
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:56.360]  here's the proof of the fema camps you want to give something to glenn back
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:12:00.360]  or go to these tea parties this is it now i know you're mass producing it right
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:03.560]  now uh and we've already gotten some in but we're
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:06.760]  going to get the big group in what about a week and a half or so

[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:18.360]  well it really depends on the manufacturer
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:21.560]  and uh we've gotten good news that they're ahead of schedule so you may
[2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:24.280]  actually be able to ship those out a little bit ahead of time
[2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:27.160]  um i can't guarantee it right at this point i've got to wait a little bit
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:31.080]  further along in production so then i know exactly what the ship date is
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:34.920]  but you know you guys are getting a special drop shipment right to your
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:37.880]  location so you might probably have those a couple of days ahead of everybody
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:41.400]  else um i don't see any problems with selling
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:43.960]  them early or shipping them out earlier doing
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:47.480]  you know you've always done that you've got is it five or six films under your
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:52.200]  belt uh this is seven seven seven so
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:56.040]  established filmmaker first thing you ever did is you contacted me when i was
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:12:58.440]  making films of my own and said hey i'd like to come work with you and i said
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:01.880]  hey it's me and my wife and one other guy sorry don't have the money to hire you
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:04.840]  but i'm glad i didn't have the money to hire you because you're off on your own
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:07.880]  that's what we need is lots of great people
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:11.320]  out making their own films and william i'm telling you it's not just that i'm in
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:14.920]  this film i think you'd ask me a few times being others and i was too busy
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:17.800]  i'm in this because i didn't have the time to make a fema camp film
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:21.560]  i advised i consulted you just did an incredible job
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:24.920]  and you've really knocked it out of the park on this one all the films were
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:28.600]  great i mean look folks camp fema is a real
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:32.760]  accomplishment this has got to be seen i haven't asked you this though where are
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:36.120]  you about people making copies if they don't sell it i know
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:40.520]  uh i've tried to go buy my own films or or sell them on amazon we're about to
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:43.640]  start that and i can't because people claim they're their films and so i'm
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:47.560]  having to now write them letters and say you can't sell my films on amazon
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:49.800]  because they're claiming that they own my films
[2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:54.840]  she can get into trouble doing that but uh what i mean how is it going to work
[2:13:54.840 --> 2:13:58.760]  kind of a blind eye of folks are handing these out to people because i want this
[2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:01.800]  film to go supernova on the streets william
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:04.760]  yeah i understand and you know we haven't put it on the website yet and this is
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:08.120]  mainly because we just don't have the funds to
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:11.800]  make the duplications yet but as soon as we start getting them coming in we'll
[2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:16.440]  be able to offer uh really inexpensive uh you know
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:20.920]  patriot packs where you can get 10 or 100 of these things at a time at a very
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:24.760]  good discount and uh you know we we hope to kind of go that
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:30.440]  way the uh the way erin russo did is uh really so i think this will uh
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:33.800]  i think this will probably be the best way you know if you get a copy
[2:14:33.800 --> 2:14:39.240]  of the uh the dvd uh you're welcome to duplicate it for yourself and your
[2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:41.880]  immediate family members that's not a problem at all
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:45.080]  william i've got a i've got a copy of the film
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:48.280]  coming up just to start thinking about it now during the break tell me so we can
[2:14:48.280 --> 2:14:52.680]  play a mentor to clip a couple times tell me a good spot i mean there's a lot
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:55.880]  of good spots here maybe when we're introducing the modern fema
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:59.960]  camps a clip or two that we can play up a film for the first time for people
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:03.720]  here today but for new listeners who don't know about the fema camps tell
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:08.360]  folks about your journey why you made the film
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:11.400]  obviously glenbeck was saying six months ago it wasn't real i know that spurred
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:14.360]  some of it uh what the film covers what you
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:20.200]  chronicle in camp fema well this journey began over 10 years
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:24.280]  ago back when i was you know just beginning to start
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:27.720]  learning about searching on the internet for these type of things roughly
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:31.480]  1995 or six and you know back then
[2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:35.400]  even then the information you could find on fema camps on the internet and they
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:38.280]  weren't called fema camps but you know the internment camps or
[2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:41.800]  concentration camps in america those types of things were readily available
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:44.920]  though you know there was a lot of information on it uh but they coincided
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:48.840]  with a lot of really bad information like you know
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:52.040]  things that we could necessarily prove such as they're being shipped with 40
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:55.800]  thousand guillotines to air force bases across the country at underground
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:15:59.800]  sites but you know etc etc and although i don't have
[2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:02.920]  you know problem research in those types of things and putting them into a
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:05.560]  documentary if i can prove them we couldn't prove any of that stuff that's
[2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:08.360]  why i say there was a million things that we had to whittle down to
[2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:11.880]  about a thousand what's credible what can we prove that's why this documentary
[2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:15.640]  is so unique because there's nothing in it that can in any way be
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:18.520]  disproved and not the whole on something else you know the entire
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:22.440]  argument that is laid out when people see this for the first time
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:27.320]  they're going to the first time realize that it's no longer an internet rumor
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:31.720]  it never has been all right but you know the whole process of getting
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:35.480]  here um you know gary and i teamed up on this
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:38.680]  about a year and a half ago just shooting footage and collecting
[2:16:38.680 --> 2:16:42.760]  everything we needed this is the first time we've had actors
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:49.160]  in a production so gary's uh gary's niece christina reese plays our young
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:53.160]  victim and uh you can i think uh this is kind of a
[2:16:53.160 --> 2:16:57.800]  different emotional uh catch to this particular documentary which is why i
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:17:00.600]  think a lot of people are going to really get into it
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:06.680]  it's um it's the most scary documentary that i've ever made and not
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:10.440]  not just because of the subject matter but because of the way we laid it out
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:13.800]  we're you know obviously trying to set that tone
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:17.160]  that this is very serious and we just we don't let up you know we don't even
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:20.120]  start giving out solutions and things that you can do about this
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:24.600]  until probably i'd say the last 15 or 20 minutes of the documentary
[2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:29.240]  and it really is a journey down the dark side of government and where this
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:32.840]  is not likely to hit but where this is going you know with the uh but the
[2:17:32.840 --> 2:17:36.120]  legislation that we're talking about that legitimizes these demon camps
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:39.160]  and the mindset of our leaders in washington showing the legislation
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:43.080]  that they want to pass that demonizes people like you and me for
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:47.640]  simply speaking out about government policy um you know this is the mindset
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:50.840]  of that's right you can't just cover fema camps you've got to show
[2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:55.240]  all the other legislation the attacks on free speech the government saying
[2:17:55.240 --> 2:17:59.320]  our number one threat is gun owners and veterans and we need to arrest them
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:02.760]  and the police pulling veterans over and ron paul supporters
[2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:06.040]  we just had a lady last hour it happened to and they said you got a short
[2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:09.960]  haircut ron paul sticker you may be terrorist
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:14.040]  the whole homeland security system set up for we the people
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:17.400]  lying to the good old boys telling folks it was for al-qaeda
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:22.600]  so you cover this in the film camp fema william it's just amazing continue
[2:18:22.600 --> 2:18:26.840]  yeah i mean it's very up to date people will notice uh news clips and things in
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:29.800]  this documentary that may only be a week or two
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:33.800]  old simply because you know as we were finishing up the documentary there were
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:37.960]  several things that broke the helterner story for instance where we were lucky
[2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:40.840]  enough to be able to get that in there so that we could show people that the
[2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:44.360]  co-intel operations from the 1950s 60s and 70s
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:47.400]  never really ended they were just continued under different names
[2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:53.240]  and um you know the glenbeck segment i don't know if you really have a chance
[2:18:53.240 --> 2:18:56.920]  to see that or not but uh i don't think it was in the first edit that we sent you
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:01.160]  but uh the glenbeck segment turned out to be just absolutely hilarious
[2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:05.240]  i mean it is funny to watch uh which is the reason why we had to actually stick
[2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:08.040]  it after the credits some people who get the film
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:11.000]  and you don't see glenbeck in there you have to wait till the credits finish
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:15.560]  and then the glenbeck segment begins and we did that mainly because
[2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:19.240]  it just totally broke the mood it just totally broke the spell that we were
[2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:22.760]  trying to set for everybody because you're literally laughing on the floor
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:26.760]  when you know but that's smart because it's a serious film with all the proof
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:31.000]  with congressmen admitting it with all the documents all their own admissions
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:35.480]  people saying camps are good not just people exposing camps and then you cut
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:38.760]  to beck lying and saying none of it exists
[2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:43.720]  exactly so William Lewis amazing job

[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:50.680]  perspective on camps you can ask me my perspective i think i'm
[2:24:50.680 --> 2:24:54.120]  probably one of the top experts out there i've in depth studied this
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:59.000]  for a long time i could even predict how beck was going to whitewash
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:03.080]  uh so we're fully aware of how these guys operate
[2:25:03.080 --> 2:25:05.480]  but we're going to take some calls right now and they get more into the film of
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:09.080]  william louis coming up anti-federalist from georgia
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:13.000]  you're on the air with our guest william louis go ahead
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:17.880]  hey alex um i uh have a few comments unfortunately nothing specifically
[2:25:17.880 --> 2:25:20.760]  fema but i just wanted to throw them out there real quick
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:24.360]  uh the first thing is uh a great documentary about
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:27.640]  what's going wrong with the one child policy in china and it's called uh
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:32.280]  china stolen babies also uh tonight one of the viewers and
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.080]  the listeners to know there's a special on 9 11 conspiracies
[2:25:37.080 --> 2:25:41.080]  on national geographic at nine let me just add to that
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:45.160]  that in fact i i had that in my stack and i took it home will you get jason
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:50.200]  because he knows where it is national geographic has apologized
[2:25:50.200 --> 2:25:55.080]  about their previous film four years ago about why the towers collapsed
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:59.080]  similar to the nova special i think theirs is called why the buildings collapsed
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:04.040]  novus why the towers collapsed using fake data about bad steel
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:07.880]  and fire melting it they've now changed their story with a new whitewash
[2:26:07.880 --> 2:26:11.880]  they're going to unveil tonight but they've been forced to apologize
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:15.560]  but i still have these idiots telling me why the towers collapsed and using
[2:26:15.560 --> 2:26:20.200]  their baloney but go ahead uh no i'm sure it'll be very interesting to see what
[2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:25.160]  they have to say um also i i just got back from dc last week
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:29.000]  and uh of course there was a lot of things i could say about my trip but i
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.520]  did come back with some kind of flu and i'm happy to say i'm over it
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:37.240]  and uh there are swats because all over the federal reserve building
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:41.080]  all around the uh i don't know what you would call it but the freezes
[2:26:41.080 --> 2:26:45.160]  the the stone carvings that outlined the building
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:48.760]  there's lots of symbols all over there but swastika's i did find it
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:52.200]  took some pictures of it so i just wanted to put that out there thanks for
[2:26:52.200 --> 2:26:57.640]  your time you mean not swastikas put up by citizens but
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:03.640]  in the carving the swastikas absolutely in the oh yeah i mean i mean
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:08.440]  until 1940 american school children did the hitler salute
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:11.960]  you can google american school children to hitler salute at all major high
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:14.440]  schools you can show you la high school doing it
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:18.440]  and they put the fascia the symbol of fascism the bundle of sticks
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:22.360]  with the hatchet heads in the u.s senate and we were going to go that way with
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:25.320]  eugenics and everything else i appreciate your call
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:29.560]  william louis comments on that well just as we didn't go that way
[2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:32.840]  he had they just figured out a better way to disguise it
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:37.800]  uh and that's all i'll add to that good point andrew in canada you're on the
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:40.200]  air with the maker of camp fema
[2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:44.120]  hi alex uh i'm first-time caller i've been listening for just over a year now
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:47.400]  and i'd like to thank you for waking me up first of all
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:51.080]  um in canada it's funny actually because canadiens are always apologizing for
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:53.960]  everything and i i actually uh i've gotten to the point where i i just
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:57.240]  say apology accepted when they're always apologizing but i'd like to
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:00.920]  apologize to everyone out there for not waking up sooner
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:05.800]  um is a very traumatic experience to wake up and i i think that that should be
[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:09.560]  discussed uh more um especially i mean
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:13.080]  you know it's it's literally like your world is turned upside down and i'm
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:17.000]  through it now and i i get it you're you're calling earlier you were saying
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.960]  oh who out there you know can see the whole thing i can see this
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:25.480]  you know big machine of eugenics which um you know it requires humans the
[2:28:25.480 --> 2:28:29.240]  humans are the gears and the cogs of of this big machine and they can't
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:33.640]  go forward with any of this unless people uh you know
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:37.720]  willingly are part of it and i guess and they're racing to put it in place
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:40.440]  right now because they know their time is short
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:43.880]  they know the people are waking up exponentially
[2:28:43.880 --> 2:28:46.920]  but when you really face the horror you're like how could i not have been
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:50.680]  involved and i and i had an epiphany a few days ago and i'm going to hold you
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:52.680]  over if need be called or because i want you to continue to make your point
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:56.680]  andrew but i want to add this now i had an epiphany
[2:28:56.680 --> 2:29:00.840]  the elites at the very top are fully conscious they know the master plan they
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:05.640]  know what they're doing but most their minions i mean even senators and people
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:10.680]  are compartmentalized and are picked by the system because they'll go along and
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:15.640]  rationalize and even believe a lot of their own propaganda
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:19.080]  and that's the thing is that it's not just
[2:29:19.080 --> 2:29:23.080]  that the good people aren't awake bad people aren't awake
[2:29:23.080 --> 2:29:28.840]  selfish people aren't awake to just what this world they're creating is and so
[2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:33.720]  all this denial all this rationalization all this denying what's going on
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:36.920]  is destroying human society and our liberties and freedoms
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:40.760]  i want to get william louis's comment on that statement then go back to andrew
[2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:44.200]  when we come back then wane vincent sam virgil and others

[2:32:04.120 --> 2:32:07.400]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate
[2:32:07.400 --> 2:32:10.120]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:32:10.120 --> 2:32:14.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:32:14.600 --> 2:32:18.040]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:32:18.040 --> 2:32:21.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:32:21.080 --> 2:32:24.680]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:32:24.680 --> 2:32:27.560]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:32:27.560 --> 2:32:31.160]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:34.200]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:32:34.200 --> 2:32:37.400]  outages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:32:56.040 --> 2:33:01.880]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365
[2:33:01.880 --> 2:33:17.560]  for decades people exposed chemtrails scientists tested it
[2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:22.040]  fish and wildlife people tested it we've now been flying around the country
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:26.440]  for an upcoming film interviewing mayors and fish and wildlife people and
[2:33:26.440 --> 2:33:30.360]  government scientists and climatologists and weather weapons experts
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:35.320]  who work for the federal government one of them was the head of the naval
[2:33:35.320 --> 2:33:40.760]  weapons facility naval weapons research laboratory i mean
[2:33:40.760 --> 2:33:45.240]  the head of it all of this is real it's going on and then they just come out
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:48.120]  after this ago yeah we are spraying barium salts and
[2:33:48.120 --> 2:33:52.600]  aluminum dioxide that causes brain damage and all creatures including
[2:33:52.600 --> 2:34:00.520]  not just humans but reptile and also birds
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:04.760]  so the ornithologists should be concerned about that
[2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:07.800]  and then now they just come on go yeah we've been doing tests
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:10.440]  all of this was the department of energy test and we're doing it with
[2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:13.480]  partners worldwide to manipulate the weather and
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:18.680]  we are practicing to knock out different types of weather to create floods
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:22.680]  and to create droughts and we're terraforming and
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:26.280]  they have government textbooks for school children
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:29.720]  in the last three years have come out where they just you know in Missouri and
[2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:34.200]  Texas and California teach the kids the government is spraying sunscreen
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:39.000]  that's what those trails are to protect you from global warming
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:42.040]  but then all the studies show it actually increases global warming because
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:45.960]  the ultraviolet just goes right through it
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:49.960]  and then bounces back up and is captured look it's insane
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:55.800]  it's just like these FEMA camps it's all hidden in plain view
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:35:00.040]  and uh you wake up to this and you realize you're all part of a giant project
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:03.640]  with a scientific dictatorship playing god
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:07.400]  and you just can't only care about baseball
[2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:13.080]  or your church or fishing anymore or whatever it is or two-step it at the
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:17.400]  local bar i don't know what you do the point is we better
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:20.440]  i was talking to some pretty high-powered hollywood people
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:25.000]  last uh week when i was in LA on a project
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:30.520]  and they said yeah how do you go back how do you care about any of this petty
[2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:33.400]  stuff anymore once you know about the new
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:36.760]  world order they want to keep you caught up in left and right and black and
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:39.960]  white and male and female and straight and gay and all these
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:43.240]  little things they have us fighting over
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:47.800]  meanwhile or north versus south or chinese versus america
[2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:50.680]  meanwhile the global corporations are playing all of us
[2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:53.720]  off against each other
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:00.840]  and this is the issue everything else is a side issue to the world government
[2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:04.520]  and what they're doing i want to go back to uh
[2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:08.040]  wane and candid to finish the statement he was making then back to the director
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:12.520]  of camp femo william lewis go ahead it's andridge uh
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:15.720]  andrew ackham andrew and wane's next job
[2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:20.200]  yeah um well i mean double speak is i think it's a huge thing they
[2:36:20.200 --> 2:36:23.960]  it's it's everywhere i think people really need to learn more to recognize the
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:27.960]  double speak you know for example when when the president comes out and says
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:31.720]  you know we are achieving our goals he's not talking about the american people
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:34.760]  he's talking about his cronies his insiders
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:38.600]  you know he's talking about that team the elite and he's just saying it to you
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:42.440]  as if you know people i guess they are expected to think that they're part of
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:45.960]  it but they're obviously not and it's it's all over the place
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:49.800]  the writing is on the wall i mean that if you want to know about chemtrails look
[2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:53.080]  up in the air there's chemtrails well you're right i mean the
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:56.760]  politicians love to say something that's a message to their people
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:37:01.000]  they write about this in their memoirs and then and then has a double meaning
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:04.680]  for the sheep for the cattle they just love that
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:08.040]  if they get something out of it it somehow increases the
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:11.320]  the rush they get from from whatever this this dark power is
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:15.240]  um but uh you know you also talk about solutions and and with regards to the
[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:19.800]  fema camps i actually was when i did wake up i i was in the middle of making
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:24.680]  an album and i ended up changing uh all sorts of the songs and lyrics around
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:28.200]  once i had discovered you know once i'd one gone down the rabbit hole and
[2:37:28.200 --> 2:37:32.200]  discovered this um you know the sick and twisted vision that's
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:36.680]  that's being played out by the elite and uh in the second track on the album
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:40.600]  which is called Eugene Nixon uh i actually say
[2:37:40.600 --> 2:37:46.120]  we got led down to the nice new safe camp to learn all about Eugene Nixon
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:49.480]  we got knocked out in the greatest time to be rolling around like a pig in its
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:53.640]  pen and um you know people are being led down
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:57.160]  you know this path thinking that it's it's all you know grand and great and
[2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:00.760]  they have no idea that there's a big you know grinder at the end of uh
[2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:03.880]  absolutely i appreciate your call well more than that
[2:38:03.880 --> 2:38:07.880]  they know something's wrong but bush is bad obama will fix it then now
[2:38:07.880 --> 2:38:13.560]  well obama obama's bad but only because the evil right wingers won't let him do
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:17.000]  what he needs to do it's their fault we need to arrest them
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:20.600]  i mean i get hundreds of emails no exaggeration today when i look at
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:24.360]  youtube in the comments every third or fourth comment
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:27.400]  is you're a racist white pig you need to be arrested
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:31.480]  you click on their channel it's a white person or i look at local newspapers
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:35.560]  about the obama info wars dot com joker poster contest
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:39.400]  and they're saying these races need to be arrested they're dangerous
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:46.680]  and these people really believe it because msnbc and cnn have said it is
[2:38:46.680 --> 2:38:51.800]  racist to show obama in a bad light and so they're under mind control how do you
[2:38:51.800 --> 2:38:56.280]  reach out to him william louis your comments
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:38:59.960]  well i i think that's a very touchy subject uh
[2:38:59.960 --> 2:39:05.240]  there's um really no appropriate way necessarily to handle this other than to
[2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:09.320]  just simply judge each president on their merits and i think that that's what
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:14.440]  we've got to do uh you know if we we knew obama's
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:18.040]  record before he went into office i know that you were on your radio program
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:21.000]  telling people you've got to watch out for this guy you have the obama
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.200]  deception out you know there was a lot of things going on but still all in
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:28.840]  off guy got elected big surprise um
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:33.320]  i you know touchy subject uh i just uh
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:36.600]  think we should judge people on their merits what they've done f-31
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:40.680]  but i mean it's so um it's so american it it's so
[2:39:40.680 --> 2:39:44.520]  human to criticize the corrupt emperor the king the leader
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:48.200]  and over and over again i have several newscasts in fact guys will you queue up
[2:39:48.200 --> 2:39:52.840]  the north texas did i give you that the latest tv report
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:56.200]  where they're going i think it's wrong to show our president the bad light
[2:39:56.200 --> 2:39:59.560]  thank god we got him taken down before any young people
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:03.800]  saw them you know they're acting like our supporters were posting
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:09.480]  pornography or something again to call him a socialist to call him a fascist
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:14.680]  it isn't racist just because he's black again they're using that as a political
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:17.880]  tools what i'm saying william sure i understand
[2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:22.440]  um i you know if they feel that way uh they're really gonna hate
[2:40:22.440 --> 2:40:26.680]  camp fema because uh you know we've got an entire segment and they're dedicated
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:30.360]  showing how obama's putting together this uh youth army
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:34.040]  uh just like we saw put together in nazi germany
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:37.000]  which of course was outlawed at one point because they knew what it was
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.720]  and then uh hitler managed to get it reinstated
[2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:42.920]  there they were viewed that it actually became
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:48.440]  known as but um we're doing well that's why in africa they love 10 11 12 13
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:51.880]  year old citizen soldiers because they're wild fighters
[2:40:51.880 --> 2:40:56.600]  and think it's all a game and will do whatever they're told
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:00.200]  well this is the great thing about getting a hold of a young mind
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:05.960]  you can train those young minds with all sorts of propaganda and have them do
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:09.320]  anything that you want i mean and how innocent to me this is you know this
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:14.360]  was kind of the whole idea of the uh youth army to begin with uh those will
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:17.480]  be the the spies in your community that will turn
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:20.920]  people over to the authorities because they did something that they weren't
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:24.760]  supposed to uh you know as innocent as a paper boy showing up to deliver the
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:27.720]  papers eat something on your desk that might be
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:30.360]  you know whatever mailman i mean this was a program that was started in the
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:33.880]  bush administration where they had mailman going around and uh
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:36.920]  profiling people that they were delivering the mail to so this is
[2:41:36.920 --> 2:41:41.800]  really not anything new it's just being carried one step further
[2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:46.440]  absolutely we're going to play a select from
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:49.960]  your film camp fema here in just a few minutes and continue with phone calls
[2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:53.720]  into the next hour with gary france and you'll stay with us but since i mentioned
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:57.480]  it and i've got a whole bunch of video newscasts these are
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:00.680]  coming in so many of them i can't even watch it a huge
[2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:05.080]  information war coup in that from berlin germany to tokyo
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:10.440]  japan from moscow russia uh to major capital cities in
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:15.480]  central and south america i've now been on
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:20.840]  ecuadorian tv other channels the obama the joker's
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:23.560]  obama as yeah we're playing a clip there in the background let's hold off for a
[2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:30.360]  second um everywhere this is being covered
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:34.280]  and it's not just because it's info wars dot com and obama as the joker to catch
[2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:38.040]  people's attention now our new contest is a thousand
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:41.640]  dollars for whoever makes the best poster period as long as it has info
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:46.520]  wars dot com or prison planet dot com on it videotapes putting those posters up
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:50.440]  on youtube and i will judge it off the best video about the posters and the
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:55.160]  poster itself that's what's fed into the decision of who wins
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:42:59.640]  but it's all about showing people the power of just putting up posters
[2:42:59.640 --> 2:43:05.000]  for a decade or more before 1776 that's what our forebears did
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:08.680]  even if they shut the web down shut tv off shut our communications off
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:13.960]  which the pentagons announcing they are setting up a takeover of the internet
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:19.400]  to shut down opposition to north com and the 400 000 troops they've now announced
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:23.400]  they plan on putting on the streets they're trying a hot coup takeover
[2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:27.160]  they've listed veterans and gun owners and landowners as the terrorist you are
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:30.760]  being listed as terrorist this is real what happened in nazi
[2:43:30.760 --> 2:43:34.440]  germany and soviet russia and malice china and pol potz cambodia
[2:43:34.440 --> 2:43:39.080]  and fidel castros cuba is now happening and the end
[2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:42.360]  obama's new fcc head of quote diversity officer
[2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:45.880]  says they want to put in chavez controls here
[2:43:45.880 --> 2:43:49.880]  i mean they're not playing games and so
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:53.480]  make whatever poster you want get out there and put it up
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:58.120]  okay and then send us the video of you posting the poster
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:03.080]  any comments on the the our our our whole poster campaign and its success i
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:06.120]  did it showing people their power
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:11.320]  if they'll just take action with a message with an idea
[2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:14.760]  yeah this is uh you know posters are that are definitely the way to go
[2:44:14.760 --> 2:44:17.160]  especially if the internet ends up getting shut down
[2:44:17.160 --> 2:44:20.920]  uh dvds obviously are a great way to go because people don't have to read
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:24.520]  they can just pop in and watch it but a poster you know if you're clever enough
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:28.440]  about designing your poster and you know what 10 seconds that it
[2:44:28.440 --> 2:44:31.720]  takes to read that poster you can get your entire message across
[2:44:31.720 --> 2:44:34.840]  and i don't know that it's illegal to put them up
[2:44:34.840 --> 2:44:37.400]  at this point i'm gonna know that they're certain that you know they've tried to
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:40.920]  create a chilling effect they've dropped the charges on the teen
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:45.000]  or never filed them because it blew up in their face they tried to intimidates
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:47.960]  and it didn't work people put up more so they backed off in florida
[2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:51.960]  but no do it legally and lawfully take haze county in fact that article is out
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:54.440]  on the desk somebody grab it for me about the hate crime i've committed
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:57.560]  it said it's not illegal that alex jones's listeners are putting him up in
[2:44:57.560 --> 2:45:01.320]  haze county but we need to pass a law to make it illegal
[2:45:01.320 --> 2:45:03.560]  go ahead
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:12.040]  yeah this is uh you know the continuation of the powers and and control
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:16.760]  that want to shut down opposition to their authority their control
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:20.680]  and uh it's just like we point out in camp fema
[2:45:20.680 --> 2:45:25.400]  these uh forces that are you know controlling our government it's not
[2:45:25.400 --> 2:45:29.400]  it's not obama and it's not george bush you know there's other people behind the
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:33.560]  scene here pulling the strings because we see too many similarities in there
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:36.680]  and their toxins and the way they think and the words that they use
[2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:41.240]  that's right there's a total congruency all and the national security council
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:44.680]  is the true dictatorship over fema over north com
[2:45:44.680 --> 2:45:48.920]  and all presidents are just frontmen exactly though
[2:45:48.920 --> 2:45:51.560]  you know if i don't know that it really makes any difference who's empowered
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:55.240]  the the problem that we've got here is that anyone who opposes the
[2:45:55.240 --> 2:45:58.840]  administration on anything i mean literally we're talking about something
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:03.560]  as simple as immigration or abortion you know things that they've
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:07.480]  used in the past heavily to divide the republicans and the democrats now
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:09.800]  they're coming out and saying any opposition to the
[2:46:09.800 --> 2:46:13.320]  administration on these particular topics and probably uh you know a list of
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:17.240]  a dozen others that we got listed in the film then you're going to be considered
[2:46:17.240 --> 2:46:21.000]  a potential domestic terrorist and people i don't think they understand
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:25.320]  that once you're once you're labeled as a potential domestic terrorist
[2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:29.720]  there's a whole other set of rules that apply to you and uh those are the rules
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:33.080]  i think and those are the ones we discussed that are going to be used to
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:37.640]  haul those people off to these fema camps and contain them keep them away from
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:40.360]  the public you know the the fema camp will be your
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:44.200]  free speech at all go there and say what you need to say and
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:49.160]  you can't leave and um if anyway you know it's it's a
[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:53.640]  continuation of same old policies from the past and william this is not your
[2:46:53.640 --> 2:46:58.520]  opinion when they say if your homeland security national i d card
[2:46:58.520 --> 2:47:01.560]  now they issue a hemispheric north american i d card
[2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:05.160]  that the tv ads are on television people are still in denial
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:08.760]  if you don't pay your bills if you have bad credit they're going to turn the
[2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:12.440]  card off this has been announced i saw ridge in 2002
[2:47:12.440 --> 2:47:16.600]  before homeland security even got funding in a congressional
[2:47:16.600 --> 2:47:20.920]  round tables big four big tables together in a square
[2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:24.520]  and he was explaining it you're going to have to have this idea to have a job
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:27.880]  you're going to have this idea there'll be no underground economy no garage
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:32.120]  sales allowed no more roadside sales uh everything's
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:35.960]  going to be controlled we're going to have tsa in the streets at the malls
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:40.280]  on the buses in the trains checkpoints the feds are going to take over the
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:43.000]  local cities through the threat fusion centers
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:46.520]  through fema and he was saying how great this was
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:53.400]  and how and then now they say no fly list a million 200 000 and growing on it
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:58.040]  now you'll be a no gun by list and they openly are announcing
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:02.040]  that we'll just say you can't own a gun no judge no jury are not arrested
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:07.160]  and their own homeland security documents leaked to us that we put out
[2:48:07.160 --> 2:48:10.920]  from good people inside a federal marshal gave it to us i'll just
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:15.720]  leave it at that says gun owners and veterans are the number one threat to
[2:48:15.720 --> 2:48:19.640]  america it's all for the american people
[2:48:19.640 --> 2:48:26.120]  it was never about al-qaeda al-qaeda's cia go ahead
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:29.880]  yeah you know you probably can add a few other things to that list too uh
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:33.320]  gun control federal reserve if you're against the united nations
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:37.720]  or north american union if you even mention the word new world order
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:41.880]  if you have a problem with your income tax or being radio frequency identified
[2:48:41.880 --> 2:48:46.200]  with an rfid chip and tract that's a problem for them if you are against
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:50.040]  abortion or illegal immigration you know those are their main topics if you're
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:54.280]  protesting the fed and now they're saying if you say no to the naked body
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:57.640]  scanner don't put your wife and kids in it to scan your naked body they're
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:49:01.160]  going to put you on a no fly list as a terrorist i mean this government is
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:06.520]  completely rogue and criminal absolutely and you know that this all ties into
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:09.880]  uh like you were mentioning before you know people who own private property
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:12.840]  and who believe that their private property rights
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:16.440]  outweigh any uh you know federal intervention or even states coming in
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:19.080]  and saying that if you don't pay your taxes we're going to
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:22.280]  take that property away from you those types of issues
[2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:25.240]  i know that this is really big right now in kansas city
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:29.080]  um in fact we you know we covered the the tenth amendment
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:32.520]  as part of the conclusion in this documentary as a solution
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:36.360]  um and what we're talking about of course this uh states rights
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:40.600]  uh the the citizens the citizenry going back
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:45.080]  and uh electing sheriffs and their communities that they know uphold and
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:48.760]  answer the constitution and then again getting involved yourself running for
[2:49:48.760 --> 2:49:52.600]  these local offices where politics actually begin because if you can

[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:05.480]  let's go ahead and go to a clip here of some of the selects from camp fema
[2:55:05.480 --> 2:55:09.400]  here it is technology has created a new plan of
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:13.160]  terrorism there were persons who for whatever reason
[2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:17.880]  came to view their home country as the enemy the kind of right-wing religious
[2:55:17.880 --> 2:55:21.320]  based domestic terrorism disturbing news tonight about homegrown
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:24.680]  terror part of this is big change in the white house
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:28.440]  any cultural experience at some of the crazies are coming out of their closet
[2:55:28.440 --> 2:55:31.320]  right now looks like there is no connection between the van arrested
[2:55:31.320 --> 2:55:35.400]  and any known terrorist cell homegrown yeah homegrown i should say
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:38.920]  folks we've got a very serious situation here i'm holding
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:43.080]  what is called the right-wing extremism current economic and political climate
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:46.280]  fueling resurgence and radicalization and recruitment
[2:55:46.280 --> 2:55:50.360]  and in it we talked about the fact that they define pro-lipers as domestic
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:54.680]  terrorists they put this in a department of homeland security
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:58.440]  document this official assessment now saying pro-lipers
[2:55:58.440 --> 2:56:01.880]  people that believe in end-time prophecies people that are opposed to the
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:05.880]  administration's position on immigration those of us that are standing up for
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:09.320]  the sanctity of life and for the sanctity of marriage all of those
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:12.120]  are now potential and this is what they're saying
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:16.680]  domestic terrorists it's a terrorist next door that could be our bigger
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:20.600]  threat they call people who believe in a sanctity of life
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:24.520]  who believe in owning firearms who believe in serving their country the
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  military and coming back who are very concerned about the policies
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:32.760]  that this nation is embarking on spending too much money taxing too much
[2:56:32.760 --> 2:56:36.680]  it's all listed right here these are the domestic
[2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:40.840]  right-wing extremists one million names under the watch rely of the united
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:44.120]  states america's so-called terrorist watch list has
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:47.000]  hit the record number according to one of the country's most prominent civil
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:50.440]  liberties groups that's a lot of people to keep track of they're adding new
[2:56:50.440 --> 2:56:53.720]  people all the time it's a secret list that you don't know
[2:56:53.720 --> 2:57:00.360]  really quite how one gets on and you don't know how you get off
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:06.760]  they're coming out and profiling huge groups of people you know if you voted
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:11.000]  for a certain political candidate you should be considered a potential threat
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:14.520]  and you couple that with things like the patriot act where
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:20.200]  if you are a threat in their eyes you can be held without access to judge jury
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:25.640]  and and without access to a liar or even to your family
[2:57:25.640 --> 2:57:29.800]  that's very concerning because we've watched our country go through and do
[2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:33.560]  this to brown people you know overseas they're rounding up
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:37.880]  enemy combatants they're putting them in camps and they are torturing them that
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:41.640]  is a fact we know that
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:45.560]  in Missouri a new document meant to help Missouri law enforcement agencies
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:49.800]  identify militia members or domestic terrorists
[2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:54.440]  has drawn criticism the february 20 report called the modern
[2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:58.040]  militia movement mentioned such red flags as
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:02.200]  political bumper stickers for third-party candidates such as ron paul
[2:58:02.200 --> 2:58:06.680]  ran for president talk of conspiracy theories such as the plan for a super
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:10.840]  highway linking canada to mexico and possession of subversive literature so
[2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:13.080]  that the state police in Missouri have been told
[2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:17.240]  that if you see a car with a bumper sticker that opposes
[2:58:17.240 --> 2:58:21.640]  the so-called creation of north american union the silver super highway that
[2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:25.800]  you are probably following a militia member that you are following an
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:31.000]  anti-government radical if you see a car with a bumper sticker that says ron paul
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:34.760]  for president you might be dealing with a violent radical
[2:58:34.760 --> 2:58:39.320]  exercise extreme hothead boss

[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:48.120]  top stories we haven't gotten to yet coming up in this hour
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:52.360]  wane in canada you're on the air welcome what's on your mind
[3:00:52.360 --> 3:00:56.120]  hi how are you alex i'm a first-time caller welcome
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:00:59.480]  thank you um i just want to let you know
[3:00:59.480 --> 3:01:03.560]  that my wife um was listening to your show
[3:01:03.560 --> 3:01:08.680]  for the last year and a half two years and i am now just becoming a believer in
[3:01:08.680 --> 3:01:14.280]  the last few months but she has uh heard your
[3:01:14.280 --> 3:01:18.840]  comment about the government doesn't own the sun yet
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:22.520]  okay and we both believe that of course now
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:28.920]  what she has done is filed an actual document with the government to claim
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:34.600]  the power of the sun the energy of the sun and we have the business number and
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:39.400]  now we have the documents for the patent
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:44.840]  oh that's an idea and then because you can also sue them over their
[3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:49.080]  chem trailing that's torturous interference right when they try to
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:54.760]  block the sun out uh the science r says they're
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:59.000]  doing this and want to expand it that's hurting your crops that's hurting your
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.640]  life that's why they keep the details secret
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:05.480]  so people have trouble suing them but i think that's a way to stop them let's
[3:02:05.480 --> 3:02:09.240]  bring william louis up william that's an intriguing idea that
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:14.120]  wane has in canada yeah i guess the question of whether
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:18.280]  they would uh actually let you take out a patent on something like that what is
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:22.040]  the patent for could you explain that a little more
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:25.880]  yeah what is the patent for sir okay the patent is not for the sun
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:34.360]  it's for the energy from the sun gotcha as in as into power of solar panel
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:37.480]  now i think they only let you patent the device itself
[3:02:37.480 --> 3:02:41.960]  you can't patent a naturally occurring thing though that's what the gmo
[3:02:41.960 --> 3:02:46.520]  companies do when they alter something then they claim ownership of it
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:49.880]  but it's an intriguing idea you want to write it up as an idea wane
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:53.400]  just to get people thinking i think it's a good exercise send it to us at
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:55.960]  ridersandinfowars.com thank you wane
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:03:01.080]  vincent in virginia and sam and others go ahead vincent

[3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:31.480]  we took the classic obama joker put fascism put new world order put info
[3:09:31.480 --> 3:09:35.080]  wars dot com under it and also improved on the image by
[3:09:35.080 --> 3:09:38.120]  oh you know more saturating it making it look a little bit cleaner
[3:09:38.120 --> 3:09:42.040]  we've got better images of him as the joker and bush as the joker so
[3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:45.000]  those are going to be the only ones that are available
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:49.160]  in the next few weeks when we sell out of the classic
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:54.600]  obama joker so it's limited edition if you want to get your hands on info
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:57.800]  wars dot com in the fed that's what it says on the back in
[3:09:57.800 --> 3:10:01.800]  the fed on one shirt another shirt says arrest the criminal
[3:10:01.800 --> 3:10:06.600]  stop the criminal there's some that just say info wars dot com
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:10.040]  if you want one of these classic shirts we're making them special
[3:10:10.040 --> 3:10:15.240]  by saying that when they're gone they're gone and that's it
[3:10:15.800 --> 3:10:19.160]  so i hope everybody gets them because the media nationally has said it's
[3:10:19.160 --> 3:10:22.680]  racist it's evil it's bad and you should be arrested
[3:10:22.680 --> 3:10:27.160]  if you put these up on light poles though the state attorney general said
[3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:29.720]  they're not going to charge the youth who put them up in
[3:10:29.720 --> 3:10:32.600]  one area florida because when they got when they said they were about to
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:36.040]  arrest him people put up hundreds of times i mean it's
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:40.200]  all over florida the toronto star told me saturday when they called me
[3:10:40.200 --> 3:10:46.280]  they said every road in the city has them they said
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:50.920]  are you behind this and i said no it's my idea but i said no
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:53.960]  she said i mean did you hire hundreds of people i said no
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:57.960]  people are mad that the media tried to censor them and said they couldn't put
[3:10:57.960 --> 3:11:01.560]  this image up and this is only the beginning so the joker thing is out of
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:04.600]  control it's awesome it lets the system know they're
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:07.800]  not going to silence us with the announcements of how the pentagon's
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:10.600]  taking the web over to quote shut it down
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:14.280]  and to quote shut alternative blogs down i mean it's really
[3:11:14.280 --> 3:11:17.640]  happening the pentagon themselves say this
[3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:20.920]  you know they're freaking out and seeing that news in the ap it's much worse
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:24.680]  than this the establishment is losing the hearts
[3:11:24.680 --> 3:11:27.160]  and minds they're going to shut the web down they're going to launch fake
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:30.040]  cyber attacks against the web and shut it down the name of its
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:32.280]  safety i've been telling you that for eight months
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:36.840]  they're now saying it they're now getting you ready to accept it
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:42.680]  so go get the obama info wars dot com posters that are up on info wars dot
[3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:46.360]  com in the in the contest area post them i've gone out and
[3:11:46.360 --> 3:11:49.880]  don't let them chill your free speech but more importantly and i'm gonna done
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:54.040]  plug in this we have a contest running through friday
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:57.480]  and i may extend it a little bit because i'm still getting videos of people
[3:11:57.480 --> 3:12:01.160]  putting up the obama joker and i've gotten hundreds and hundreds and i mean
[3:12:01.160 --> 3:12:04.920]  it's it's over 300 curt nemo said and that was a few days ago
[3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:09.640]  of different ideas for poster art we're having a contest for the best political
[3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:13.560]  poster anti-war anti-vaccine anti-fluoride anti-chem
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:18.440]  trail it'll be whoever makes the best poster and
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:22.600]  on any subject will judge it on what gets the message across the best not even
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:26.360]  what issue it is i'm the judge that's half of it the other
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:29.720]  half is posting it in public and videotaping it and
[3:12:29.720 --> 3:12:34.120]  uploading it to youtube or another major video site and sending it to contest
[3:12:34.120 --> 3:12:39.400]  at info wars dot com that is the contest not the hundreds and hundreds of
[3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:45.080]  posters you're sending us it needs to be posted in public
[3:12:45.080 --> 3:12:51.160]  and videoed that so the message is we're not just putting it up about obama
[3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:54.920]  a lot of people made them with obama and bush next to each other saying that
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:58.600]  you know they work for the new world order two sides of the same coin very
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:13:02.920]  effective whatever it's about showing the
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:05.960]  establishment that the people can take over
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:09.880]  the information war if we want to that is now what's happening
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:13.960]  so that said this is why we need to put up more posters now than ever
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:18.200]  just don't do it on government property meaning property the slaves can't touch
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:21.880]  meaning you pay the money and the government tells you how to live
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:26.200]  all over texas they you know they called for my arrest they've called they called
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:29.800]  it hate speech haze county it's not illegal they say it should be made
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:33.320]  illegal so i can be arrested uh it's spanish tv
[3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:38.680]  internationals calling for my arrest you know the tv here in the u.s
[3:13:38.680 --> 3:13:44.280]  you've all seen it we boldly just said bring it on first amendment
[3:13:44.280 --> 3:13:47.800]  they were going to arrest this youth in florida the one guy an obama supporter
[3:13:47.800 --> 3:13:51.720]  came up for taking photos saying i'm reporting you like a body snatcher i
[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:54.840]  know i'm a nazi i'm reporting you you know i'm going to get you first
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:58.200]  amendment's bad putting on a light pole obama supporters rip them down
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:02.360]  everywhere put up 10 times more here is the local newscast
[3:14:02.360 --> 3:14:07.080]  out of northeast texas pretty big town whether acting like a murder's been
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:10.520]  committed or a bank robberies happened and they're hyper
[3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:14.440]  ventilating and freaking out and oh my god the youth it's so scary
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:18.520]  yeah the the public schools are pushing riddle and prozac
[3:14:18.520 --> 3:14:22.120]  swat teams drug dogs teaching people how to be petty and
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:25.160]  mindless government brainwashing dumbing them down
[3:14:25.160 --> 3:14:28.920]  we teach them to respect the local authorities and the president
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:33.400]  thank god we ripped them down before the youth song
[3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:37.480]  oh yeah thank and then then they say it was anti war dot com you can see the
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:41.080]  video at the school it says info wars dot com so i guess they want they thought
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:44.440]  they would get me by not showing info wars dot com
[3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:48.760]  it isn't about info wars dot com it's about getting everybody to be active
[3:14:48.760 --> 3:14:53.160]  and to see the power you have that's what gondy did for 20 plus years
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:14:56.440]  in india that's what i'm doing is showing you
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:15:00.040]  the power you've got to stand up to these parasite
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:03.160]  trash we're going to frenchie and everybody in a minute but i wanted to
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:07.080]  get to this here's the local newscast out of
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:10.840]  k l tv as we analyze it here it is
[3:15:10.840 --> 3:15:15.960]  there's depicting president obama as the joker started appearing in tyler texas
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:19.800]  yesterday the altered picture of the president was made by a college student
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:22.760]  and has since gone worldwide via youtube
[3:15:22.760 --> 3:15:26.680]  up to 20 posters were put on trees signs and windows
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:31.320]  the only message was the website address info wars dot com
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:34.680]  that's the online site for a syndicated radio talk show host
[3:15:34.680 --> 3:15:38.840]  who offered one thousand dollars to the person who puts up the most obama joker
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:42.040]  okay let's stop right there is unbelievable the guys had no way to
[3:15:42.040 --> 3:15:46.440]  communicate it to me and that's the old one from two weeks ago
[3:15:46.440 --> 3:15:52.280]  the new one if you see it says video no longer available
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:56.360]  and i think that got linked by drudge it probably crashed k l tv site
[3:15:56.360 --> 3:16:00.200]  but that one talked about how evil and bad it was at the school

[3:17:29.240 --> 3:17:32.360]  william have made it's just amazing because it covers everything it proves
[3:17:32.360 --> 3:17:35.960]  the history of it how they operate the police state the demonization of
[3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:39.560]  dissidents that go with it the co-intel pro feds
[3:17:39.560 --> 3:17:42.360]  i mean you guys have knocked it out of the park gary
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:46.040]  alex i am a god blessed american citizen
[3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:52.840]  and i will be i am so fed up with these these elitists
[3:17:52.840 --> 3:17:56.120]  who are putting putting presidential candidates
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:17:59.720]  ron paul chup balvin bop bop listening them
[3:17:59.720 --> 3:18:03.320]  as if i'm a supporter i'm a violent extremist
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:06.920]  well what is this country to come well it's an attempt
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:11.240]  it's an attempt to chill free speech as you know and it's an attempt to shut
[3:18:11.240 --> 3:18:14.440]  you down and to make everybody scared to have political speech
[3:18:14.440 --> 3:18:17.880]  just like when they say criticizing obama is the n word
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:21.000]  i mean they are brutally trying to silence free speech
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:25.800]  william lewis comments okay well yeah here we go again
[3:18:25.800 --> 3:18:29.000]  uh i think that the uh the poster idea the great idea what gary was saying too
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:33.640]  about the uh the no vaccination um you know those are some of the issues
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:36.680]  that are dealt with in the documentary we try not to get
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:39.560]  really specific and say that you know this is exactly what they're going to
[3:18:39.560 --> 3:18:42.200]  do with swine flu because we've seen this happen before with ant
[3:18:42.200 --> 3:18:45.800]  cracks and smallpox and you know back in 2000 and 2003 when they
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:49.960]  wanted to vaccinate us then but this is a very real scenario and if we uh we
[3:18:49.960 --> 3:18:53.080]  go ahead and start educating people through the posters that we can put up
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:55.720]  in people's neighborhoods or you know wherever you want to
[3:18:55.720 --> 3:19:00.280]  um that that i think is uh a great way to go maybe uh put a website at the
[3:19:00.280 --> 3:19:04.280]  bottom uh and if they can get some information on it
[3:19:04.280 --> 3:19:08.120]  absolutely i i want to continue getting into camp fema but i do want to go to
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:10.600]  vencent and virginia sam and the netherlands and
[3:19:10.600 --> 3:19:15.400]  others that are holding but uh gary i think camp fema is going to really be
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:18.040]  effective and that's why i'm asking my listeners to get it
[3:19:18.040 --> 3:19:21.560]  to pre-order it today it comes out in two weeks and to

[3:24:31.160 --> 3:24:36.280]  wikipedia about why we have the gadston flag or the symbol
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:39.960]  of the rattlesnake being one of the first symbols of this country
[3:24:39.960 --> 3:24:48.120]  even before the bald eagle and i think uh the founders explained it quite well

[3:25:18.120 --> 3:25:22.360]  i have an aunt whose father was a german immigrant
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:25.480]  during world war two and when he came over
[3:25:25.480 --> 3:25:31.160]  he was apparently detained by the fb i for two or three days for questioning
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:34.200]  uh just to make sure he wasn't a nazi operative or
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:37.640]  or something of that sort that's nothing they put tens of thousands of german
[3:25:37.640 --> 3:25:41.240]  citizens in camps japanese and then they stole the japanese
[3:25:41.240 --> 3:25:45.000]  property in san francisco and surrounding areas they were very wealthy
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:49.640]  been here in some cases over 150 years because you know japan's in the
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:53.480]  pacific i mean you talk to these guys like talking to an american
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:25:57.560]  and they rape their women everything else they put italian americans in camps
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:26:01.880]  go ahead um yeah i was just gonna ask how do you
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:06.920]  i mean what what do you find uh if you're looking at these camps i can't
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:11.560]  imagine it's easy to get inside of them to tell that it's made for
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:16.360]  uh supposedly for say illegal illegal immigrants or possible
[3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:20.280]  terrorists versus american citizens i mean how do you tell
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:23.720]  there's a thing the the japanese internment camps
[3:26:23.720 --> 3:26:27.720]  were not even built when they were uh rounded up
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:31.720]  when i spoke to um the internment camp survivor samozaki
[3:26:31.720 --> 3:26:36.440]  uh japanese american you know born in the united states okay just like us
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:41.160]  citizen uh he was rounded up bust off to these uh to these camps
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:44.760]  but the camps like i said they weren't built they used stadiums
[3:26:44.760 --> 3:26:49.000]  they used uh you know amusement parks fairgrounds
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:53.320]  uh you know just large public facilities and held in there
[3:26:53.320 --> 3:26:57.560]  while the camps were being constructed so and gary that's exactly what i
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:01.880]  explained to you if you look at top off and in le exercises they practice
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:05.080]  putting him in sports stadiums putting you in facilities
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:08.600]  then they bust groups of you off and then they make you build
[3:27:08.600 --> 3:27:11.560]  the camp you're going to live in exactly and
[3:27:11.560 --> 3:27:14.840]  you know the gentleman asking what what what makes a
[3:27:14.840 --> 3:27:18.360]  what what are the uh specific characteristics of a FEMA camp
[3:27:18.360 --> 3:27:21.880]  well you know hey next time you drive that past your high school
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:26.680]  look at the fences imagine everyone rounded up inside the fences in your
[3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:30.280]  in your high school stadium okay now it's as simple as that
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:33.240]  uh we're taking a step further i mean they were using
[3:27:33.240 --> 3:27:36.920]  uh they're using churches in chicago to hold german immigrants
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:41.240]  you know uh they they have the uh the actual prison cubes
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:44.680]  the concrete pink prison cubes that they can drop
[3:27:44.680 --> 3:27:48.440]  in like legos and build them up like overnight
[3:27:48.440 --> 3:27:51.560]  so the feds i mean look this is not our opinion they admit
[3:27:51.560 --> 3:27:54.520]  that and they're setting it up where you're going to want to be in the camp
[3:27:54.520 --> 3:27:57.480]  like oh you're starving you want to be you're not allowed to be homeless now
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:01.320]  you've got to live in the camp
[3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:05.240]  yeah so the the film the film breaks it down um
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:09.160]  you know obviously there's the the the the inward facing barbed wire the
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:12.760]  the guard towers i mean these are staples of standard camps that are
[3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:16.520]  existing today um but what's most importantly is
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:20.440]  you know they can build these camps overnight within 24 hours look on record
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:23.720]  the feds built the robert mehler airport and they
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:28.200]  have a large area designated i have local news admitting it
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:31.880]  i mean they take facilities that have barbed wire and that's the camp and

[3:33:48.440 --> 3:33:55.480]  patriots and tyrants the famous yellow flag with the snake on it
[3:33:55.480 --> 3:34:00.120]  the marine corps was the first to use it in south carolina while engaging
[3:34:00.120 --> 3:34:05.240]  british ships in some cases 10 to 1
[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:08.760]  it's now demonized by the department of homeland security as a symbol of
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:13.480]  terrorism but i wanted to read to you what the founders
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:15.720]  said
[3:34:17.080 --> 3:34:22.280]  in 1754 during the french and indian war franklin published his famous woodcut
[3:34:22.280 --> 3:34:26.280]  of a snake cut into eight sections it represented the colonies
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:30.360]  with new england joined together at the head in the south carolina's the tail
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:33.720]  following their order along the coast under the snake
[3:34:33.720 --> 3:34:37.640]  the message was join or die and for prison planet dot tv viewers this was
[3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:40.360]  then used early on the revolutionary war so
[3:34:40.360 --> 3:34:45.320]  that's when the rattlesnake was first seen then it was picked up in 1776 by the
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:51.720]  marines by the marine corps and writing then
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:55.320]  as the american revolution grew closer the snake began to see more
[3:34:55.320 --> 3:34:58.920]  use as a symbol for the colonies it's the true symbol of america
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:02.200]  in 1774 paul revere added it to the title
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:08.200]  of his paper the massachusetts spy as a snake joined to fight a british dragon
[3:35:08.200 --> 3:35:11.960]  in december of 1775 benjamin franklin published an essay
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:16.040]  in the pennsylvania journal
[3:35:16.040 --> 3:35:26.520]  under the pseudonym american gosser they're doing some audio testing in
[3:35:26.520 --> 3:35:28.760]  there today with the new audio system i don't know if your people are hearing
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:31.880]  that on air but it's hard for me to talk with it doing that i'm gonna start over
[3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:36.440]  now try as hard as i can here as the american
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:40.440]  revolution grew closer the snake began to see more and more uses a symbol of the
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:44.200]  colonies in 1774 paul revere added it to the title of his
[3:35:44.200 --> 3:35:51.080]  paper the massachusetts spy as a snake joined to fight a british dragon
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:35:54.280]  in december 1775 benjamin franklin published an essay
[3:35:54.280 --> 3:35:58.120]  in the pennsylvania journal under the pseudonym american gosser
[3:35:58.120 --> 3:36:01.240]  in which he suggested that the rattlesnake was a good symbol of the
[3:36:01.240 --> 3:36:05.320]  american spirit this is benjamin franklin now
[3:36:05.320 --> 3:36:08.840]  known as a terrorist by homeland security literally i have him on video
[3:36:08.840 --> 3:36:15.000]  being demonized by homeland security fema i recollect that
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:21.240]  her eyes excelled in brightness that of any other animal and that she has no
[3:36:21.240 --> 3:36:25.720]  eyelids she may therefore be esteemed as an emblem of vigilance
[3:36:25.720 --> 3:36:30.520]  see eternally awake she never begins an attack
[3:36:30.520 --> 3:36:34.440]  so this describes us this describes me this describes my spirit
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:39.960]  she never begins an attack nor once engaged
[3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:43.960]  ever surrenders she is therefore an emblem of
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:50.680]  magnanimity and true courage as if anxious to prevent all
[3:36:50.680 --> 3:36:54.680]  pretensions of quarreling with her the weapon which
[3:36:54.680 --> 3:36:58.600]  nature has furnished her she conceals in the roof of her mouth
[3:36:58.600 --> 3:37:01.800]  so that to those who are unacquainted with her
[3:37:01.800 --> 3:37:05.240]  she appears to be most defenseless animal and even
[3:37:05.240 --> 3:37:10.360]  when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense they appear weak
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:15.080]  and contemptible but their wounds however small
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:21.240]  are decisive and fatal conscience this of this she never
[3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:25.080]  wounds till she has been grievously given notice
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:29.000]  and generally given notice even to her enemy
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:33.240]  and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:36.440]  was i wrong sir in thinking that a strong picture
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:42.040]  of the temper of the conduct of america and that's what the gadston flag is for
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:45.800]  all you sickening degenerate traitors i was wearing one
[3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:49.480]  out in la and people were shrinking in fear because i guess they'd seen her on
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:53.800]  the news and asking what it was and and and and and who what's the
[3:37:53.800 --> 3:37:59.400]  shirt freedom all right i'm gonna shut up now go back gary
[3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:01.800]  francey william louis you have the floor
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:06.280]  your points about your new film camp fema

[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:24.440]  i'm being labeled a practical terrorist you know that's in the film
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:27.560]  um you know i sat down with an internment camp survivor
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:31.720]  for 60 minutes as he shared his heart-wrenching story of how he had
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:34.600]  to only gather up what you could carry with his bare hands
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:38.440]  and bring into the camp an american citizen
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:43.000]  okay you know that's in the in the in the film
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:47.880]  you know the the evidence is there you know the pictures are there
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:52.440]  it's all there alex and it's it's terrifying but it's true
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:57.240]  the american people need to see it anyway william
[3:38:57.240 --> 3:39:01.240]  take the floor please i can't take it i think beyond all the legislation that
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:06.040]  we're talking about and the mindset and the documentation that we show that
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:10.280]  are you know a senate oversight committee hearings and things that you
[3:39:10.280 --> 3:39:14.040]  know you can't just prove about all these you know
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:16.440]  besides all of this evidence that we've gathered up
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:19.320]  there's there's one thing we haven't talked about and
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:22.920]  the that's the 2010 census which is coming up
[3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:27.240]  this next year no one is mentioning the fact that in 1940
[3:39:27.240 --> 3:39:31.240]  the government collected census information
[3:39:31.240 --> 3:39:35.720]  from the census bureau and used it to profile
[3:39:35.720 --> 3:39:39.880]  american citizens and know whether you were one six percent
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:44.120]  uh japanese american and if you were one six percent or higher
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:47.080]  you were put into one of these internment camps so they used
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:49.960]  census information to know who they wanted to lock up
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:53.240]  we've got a 28 page 2010 census coming out
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:56.840]  uh this next year and if you don't answer the questions on it they say they're
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:40:00.840]  going to find you up to $5,000 for not answering those questions
[3:40:00.840 --> 3:40:04.360]  they've got census takers that are going to have gps trackers that are going to
[3:40:04.360 --> 3:40:07.320]  go door to door within 40 feet of your front door they're going to take a
[3:40:07.320 --> 3:40:09.960]  picture it's going to send it up to the satellite they're going to have
[3:40:09.960 --> 3:40:13.400]  gps coordinates to every single front door in america
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:16.600]  so they're going to know what you think exactly where you live
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:21.000]  and now we've got legislation showing that people who think the way we do
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:24.920]  are a danger and a threat to society so what's the next step well we're looking
[3:40:24.920 --> 3:40:28.200]  at it the legislation is these things these camps are setting up
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:31.400]  this is what they want to do with the american people and i'm not telling you
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:35.480]  not to answer any questions and with 2000 census paper that comes to your door
[3:40:35.480 --> 3:40:38.760]  but you know you have you have to be your own judge you have to decide whether
[3:40:38.760 --> 3:40:41.000]  you're going to say there's three people living in this house where you
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:44.760]  sit down and fill out 28 page four and it says with the owner firearm or not
[3:40:44.760 --> 3:40:49.080]  and by the way they've already phase one the last year
[3:40:49.080 --> 3:40:51.720]  we would tell people this eight nine months ago they didn't believe us now
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:54.920]  it's national news they come and mark your front door
[3:40:54.920 --> 3:40:58.280]  phase two is now beginning they have at least that we know of 10 different
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:02.680]  surveys one has 10 questions another has 49
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:08.360]  one of them has over 200 questions i got the 40 something question one
[3:41:08.360 --> 3:41:11.640]  and this happened in 2000 now it's happening to my neighbors again they

[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:29.400]  effects they don't have the right to come up
[3:41:29.400 --> 3:41:33.160]  if we don't want to answer the door we don't have to answer the door

[3:42:44.840 --> 3:42:48.840]  it's time the american people need to rise up they are rising up
[3:42:48.840 --> 3:42:51.880]  people are going to town hall meetings all across the country there's a town
[3:42:51.880 --> 3:42:54.920]  hall meeting in scotty jane chicowski everyone if you're in the
[3:42:54.920 --> 3:42:57.800]  chicago where you go out there and give her hell
[3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:01.480]  we're not going to take this socialist agenda coming down from on high
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:05.320]  we are going to preserve and protect the united states of america
[3:43:05.320 --> 3:43:10.360]  stand up now gary you were telling me during a break about how
[3:43:10.360 --> 3:43:13.400]  remember in texas they said the loy dogged thing was fake and then now they
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:16.440]  have to admit it's not fake the citizens are mad at the congressman
[3:43:16.440 --> 3:43:19.720]  and how they threw the first few women and men out but then that made everybody
[3:43:19.720 --> 3:43:23.160]  else come out just like they were trying to arrest people putting up the obama
[3:43:23.160 --> 3:43:26.520]  posters but but now they've had to back off they realize
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:30.600]  that we run this country and if we'll just exercise it it's over gary
[3:43:30.600 --> 3:43:33.720]  franci william louis comments that we're going to calls
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:37.800]  alex you know that lady that was demonized by the mainstream media
[3:43:37.800 --> 3:43:40.920]  she was demonized because she stood up and held a birth certificate to our
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:44.520]  congressman you know what what that did that backfired on them
[3:43:44.520 --> 3:43:47.240]  because when they put that out across the country when they put that out on all
[3:43:47.240 --> 3:43:50.680]  the mainstream media reports make demonize her the good
[3:43:50.680 --> 3:43:54.760]  people of america saw that for what it was and now they're coming out to all
[3:43:54.760 --> 3:43:57.400]  the town halls and she was the example of the set
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:01.560]  and now everybody else is standing up that woman is an american hero
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:04.760]  that woman is an american hero and everybody else is a stand-up just like
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:08.040]  her and then hi and and that's the key and i
[3:44:08.040 --> 3:44:10.520]  want william to comment on this and we're going to calls
[3:44:10.520 --> 3:44:16.440]  from the netherlands and beyond is that i've always said the last illusion to
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:20.360]  fall is that we as patriots are a minority and as the people put up
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:24.200]  posters and go to town halls and call into radio and go to city council and
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:29.080]  do all these things and start websites and and and all this be heard
[3:44:29.080 --> 3:44:32.920]  if you're heard by one person that's victory that now everybody's seeing
[3:44:32.920 --> 3:44:36.440]  we're the majority and the system used to try to demonize us
[3:44:36.440 --> 3:44:39.160]  now they're not doing that as much because they realize
[3:44:39.160 --> 3:44:45.880]  oh god that only angers them because the mind control them the mesmerized
[3:44:45.880 --> 3:44:50.440]  trance that people were under is breaking william louis
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:53.960]  yeah people keep in mind that this country was born
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:58.280]  out of political dissent you know they may be labeling
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:00.760]  george washington and the founders of this country
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:04.600]  as terrorists but in the crown side that's what they were
[3:45:04.600 --> 3:45:09.160]  in the government side that's what we are it doesn't make us in the wrong
[3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:13.080]  in fact i think it's quite an honor these days to be labeled a
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:16.680]  potential domestic terrorist because it says you're standing up and saying the
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:20.760]  right thing so we can't let them intimidate us
[3:45:20.760 --> 3:45:24.360]  into not saying the things that need to be said and this woman like gary said is
[3:45:24.360 --> 3:45:28.760]  a hero we need to all be standing up we all need to be protesting what's
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:31.720]  going on in our government and speaking our mind
[3:45:31.720 --> 3:45:35.880]  well i want to say something else than we are going to calls and it's this
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:41.000]  in 99% of the cases and i mean it's literally those type of numbers now
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:43.960]  when we hear about somebody putting up an obama poster we hear about somebody
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:47.160]  going to a town hall or somebody shoots the video of the town hall
[3:45:47.160 --> 3:45:50.680]  or cops come over and say you can't have that anti-obama poster but pro
[3:45:50.680 --> 3:45:54.280]  posters are allowed or somebody gets punched in the face
[3:45:54.280 --> 3:45:58.920]  and then stands up it's my listeners and i want to tell the listeners of this
[3:45:58.920 --> 3:46:02.600]  show you are the second american revolution
[3:46:02.600 --> 3:46:07.160]  against the offshore banks tyranny and trying to usurp this country
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:12.040]  you are the only resistance you are wonderful
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:15.640]  and it is just such a blessing and such an honor
[3:46:15.640 --> 3:46:18.840]  to be able to talk to people like you and to be able to work with all these
[3:46:18.840 --> 3:46:23.640]  other great liberty activists and to be the focal point show
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:27.720]  and to have media matters and george soros attacking me every day
[3:46:27.720 --> 3:46:31.720]  it is such an honor and i'm trying to live up to that standard i know i'm not
[3:46:31.720 --> 3:46:35.400]  perfect none of us have all the answers but we don't have to be perfect we just
[3:46:35.400 --> 3:46:38.920]  got to take action we know these tyrants are out of control
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:43.080]  and get the word out gentlemen
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:49.640]  alex your listeners are are a crucial crucial part of this entire revolution
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:52.760]  you know people are standing up there you know people have seen your films
[3:46:52.760 --> 3:46:56.440]  they've seen russell's film they've you know participated in the
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:47:00.600]  ron paul revolution this is the this is the second american
[3:47:00.600 --> 3:47:04.040]  revolution alex i am damn proud to be a part of it
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:07.640]  i'm damn proud to be on your team and if somebody wants to come out and demonize
[3:47:07.640 --> 3:47:11.320]  me because i stand up for what's right and for the constitution i say bring it
[3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:14.680]  i said bring it with full force because you know what i thought you to galvanize
[3:47:14.680 --> 3:47:18.200]  me to step up to galvanize the people to step up
[3:47:18.200 --> 3:47:22.680]  and that's what is that's what's happening right now god bless america and
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:27.080]  absolutely and that's what's happening is people are realizing they have power
[3:47:27.080 --> 3:47:31.160]  the system when it attacks myself and ron paul and only a few other people
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:35.240]  nationally now that shows who the real enemy is that shows
[3:47:35.240 --> 3:47:39.320]  that the whole eye of the new world order is focused into the heart of its own
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:43.000]  empire because if it can't keep its slaves in line
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:47.240]  it fails it falls sam and the netherlands you're on the air
[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:50.600]  with uh... william louis the director uh... and maker

[3:47:59.320 --> 3:48:04.520]  the past uh... and hi alex and william uh... i would like to just say that my
[3:48:04.520 --> 3:48:08.920]  ancestor from south africa was probably in the first concentration camp
[3:48:08.920 --> 3:48:13.960]  and now there's any concentration camp it's big it's called palestine gaza
[3:48:13.960 --> 3:48:20.760]  and uh... israel created viruses against the palestinians also south africa
[3:48:20.760 --> 3:48:24.680]  what else can i say concentration camps are around us
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:28.920]  and uh... it's all from the road seas of roads
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:34.360]  building that first camp in south africa stupid rock shield uh...
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:39.800]  bootlicker and uh... what else can i say well i mean i want to hear more what
[3:48:39.800 --> 3:48:41.560]  you have to say you make a great point
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:45.240]  look at south africa look at some of the stuff israel does look at what
[3:48:45.240 --> 3:48:49.080]  uh... the russians would do they just lock off whole neighborhoods and don't
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:52.920]  let food and stuff in and that's what they're saying under quarantine
[3:48:52.920 --> 3:48:56.840]  which they're setting the this is the excuse for the feds to train locals
[3:48:56.840 --> 3:49:00.200]  to accept the lockdowns of cities whether it happens or not
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:03.560]  is that that's how they work this that's how this is done
[3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:07.800]  whole areas of the world are locked down and they're admitting they're turning
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:11.000]  all of america into a giant fema camp
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:15.400]  william louis yeah look we went to
[3:49:15.400 --> 3:49:19.160]  you know the really cream of the crop when we wanted to ask these kinds of

[3:49:53.240 --> 3:49:56.840]  we're very excited about that katharine is really carrying the banner of
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:49:59.480]  liberty and freedom here in missouri she needs to be

[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:29.640]  well you know i've actually read the writings of hitler
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:33.000]  and studied a lot of stuff and i know the russians have gone back on some of
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:35.560]  the stories they told but i mean hitler
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:39.800]  i mean you do believe he executed people and ran people into pits and
[3:54:39.800 --> 3:54:43.560]  shot him right because that was the nazi's own writings

[3:54:50.840 --> 3:54:54.440]  uh all these governments set up camps
[3:54:54.440 --> 3:54:59.240]  and uh i mean that's really the bottom line here i mean
[3:54:59.240 --> 3:55:03.080]  these camps are real being set up here in the united states
[3:55:03.080 --> 3:55:06.840]  and it is true the british invented camps actually uh
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:10.440]  didn't start in south africa though that's when it got modernized
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:13.800]  the british invented camps they had slave camps here in the u.s
[3:55:13.800 --> 3:55:21.560]  prison ship camps uh andrew jackson's mother and brother died in a camp
[3:55:21.560 --> 3:55:25.000]  they just starved to death so the british invented them vergell in ohio

[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:44.600]  an email or a website that i could go on
[3:55:44.600 --> 3:55:47.480]  that's gonna be hard for you to listen if you got the radio cranked up and
[3:55:47.480 --> 3:55:51.880]  listen to yourself at the same time no actually my wife's got the computer on
[3:55:51.880 --> 3:55:54.040]  okay well i just heard myself so it must have been
[3:55:54.040 --> 3:55:57.560]  that must be going crazy uh specifically what website are you
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:56:01.080]  asking for um i'd like to know a little bit more
[3:56:01.080 --> 3:56:04.440]  about the fema camps and then the whole purpose of
[3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:09.240]  me calling today was i'm calling on behalf of my dad
[3:56:09.240 --> 3:56:13.080]  okay and i was trying to get people to realize
[3:56:13.080 --> 3:56:17.160]  how evil the government's getting to even the people in offices
[3:56:17.160 --> 3:56:20.200]  locally like in the state of ahia where i live
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:24.280]  what they're doing what are they doing and uh like the pro board they're
[3:56:24.280 --> 3:56:29.880]  actually still men's lives they're changing what they was put in for
[3:56:29.880 --> 3:56:34.280]  and then giving them more time yeah i've seen that around the country
[3:56:34.280 --> 3:56:38.600]  where they add charges you were never convicted of
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:42.600]  send me some send me a local news article on that send it to
[3:56:42.600 --> 3:56:46.040]  show tips at info wars dot com good to hear from you sir uh
[3:56:46.040 --> 3:56:50.920]  the film camp fema covers all the documents
[3:56:50.920 --> 3:56:55.400]  i'm in the film going over the documents civilian inmate labor camp program
[3:56:55.400 --> 3:56:59.480]  uh let me ask gary franchi uh and uh william louis this have you seen the
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:05.160]  clip of of uh fox radio host alan combs saying
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:08.440]  he doesn't even believe army dot mill is a real website so
[3:57:08.440 --> 3:57:12.360]  even when the the the the government's trying to hire
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:16.520]  camp workers they're saying it's not real that's in the documentary we we found
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:20.040]  a clever way to introduce people to that we've got
[3:57:20.040 --> 3:57:23.160]  combs his own words on his radio program talking about it
[3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:27.320]  saying that he can't find the army dot mill website and of course at the same
[3:57:27.320 --> 3:57:31.080]  time we are you know we got a camera on the computer and we're going there
[3:57:31.080 --> 3:57:34.920]  physically showing people yeah it's real so yeah that's covered
[3:57:34.920 --> 3:57:39.320]  and i think people will find that really funny see you did so much in this film
[3:57:39.320 --> 3:57:42.600]  that's another thing i forgot about you show folks how to google it
[3:57:42.600 --> 3:57:46.440]  and then you're on the army site hiring people to run the camps i mean
[3:57:46.440 --> 3:57:49.880]  there's just so much denial going on out there
[3:57:49.880 --> 3:57:53.000]  well i mean it reminds me when just a couple weeks ago
[3:57:53.000 --> 3:57:57.480]  we got a national guard posting you know one uh job posting
