[03:08.400 --> 03:12.720]  выходите федоров revelations were confirmed by the fact that moscow is now

[03:49.080 --> 03:54.320]  constitutional stability china also recently passed a new law which restricts
[03:54.320 --> 04:00.440]  the activities of foreign NGOs the two superpowers are finally waking up to the
[04:00.440 --> 04:06.240]  fact that regime change plots in the modern age are achieved not via bombs and
[04:06.240 --> 04:14.080]  tanks but via mass subversion expect to see an intensification of the propaganda
[04:14.080 --> 04:18.760]  campaign against russia over the next few months starting with the blame game
[04:18.760 --> 04:24.800]  being laid at Moscow's door for the downing of fly mh-17 some will be
[04:24.800 --> 04:29.360]  skeptical as to how a president with an approval rating in the high 80s could
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.920]  possibly be overthrown but the very fact that NATO and the White House are even
[04:34.920 --> 04:41.120]  considering this illustrates their staggering disconnect with reality which
[04:41.120 --> 04:46.840]  blinded by neo-colonial imperatives threatens to place the world in the
[04:46.840 --> 04:54.760]  most dangerous jeopardy since the height of the Cold War exactly and what's
[04:54.760 --> 05:00.000]  depending on thinking you can't win a war with nuclear weapons turns out it

[05:22.000 --> 05:26.440]  secret but what difference at this point does it make right Hillary especially
[05:26.440 --> 05:30.600]  after it's been revealed that Chinese email hackers have been spying on top

[09:03.760 --> 09:08.120]  information Hillary Clinton is being called the Democratic Party's ticking
[09:08.120 --> 09:13.840]  time bomb she is a testament to the fact that she's a Democrat and she's a
[09:13.840 --> 09:21.240]  woman and so she is allowed to get away with bloody murder not just taking money
[09:21.240 --> 09:25.360]  from foreign dictators at the State Department to sell them weapons not
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.920]  just being involved in Benghazi not just being involved in cattle futures and
[09:28.920 --> 09:36.720]  deaths and corruption and all the rest of it going after our guns trying to
[09:36.720 --> 09:42.200]  ram through the first Obamacare scam there's literally hundreds of bad things
[09:42.200 --> 09:47.320]  Hillary Clinton's done caught lying to Congress over and over again involved in
[09:47.320 --> 09:54.400]  fast and furious involved in IRS persecution gate but now after a year of
[09:54.400 --> 10:02.000]  refusing to turn over emails or more she wipes the servers which is obstruction
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.040]  of justice on its face there are subpoenas there are search warrants and
[10:06.040 --> 10:13.720]  sure here it is erased just like the IRS did so she's finally handed it over
[10:13.720 --> 10:24.720]  after it's been professionally wiped clean but Obama that means the Clintons
[10:24.720 --> 10:34.520]  run the Justice Department and so she is basically above the law the majority of
[10:34.520 --> 10:38.080]  Americans support a criminal investigation of Hillary emails national
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.400]  polls show that's out of the Washington Times here's another one Hillary Clinton

[10:54.320 --> 11:00.720]  for sex but not for missile secrets the Chinese government you know now that
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.040]  we're on the verge of war with the Communist Chinese and the Russians who
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.000]  they shared it with not the Russians needed our technology we've got a lot of
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.520]  it from them and the Germans but the Chinese certainly needed it they allowed
[11:13.520 --> 11:18.840]  Laurel and Hughes to transfer the Merv technology and the liftoff and
[11:18.840 --> 11:25.160]  separation technology so that their long march missiles in the mid 90s every one
[11:25.160 --> 11:30.240]  of them was blowing up on the launch pad or a few thousand feet in the air they
[11:30.240 --> 11:37.560]  couldn't get up into orbit well after they got all of NASA all the German and
[11:37.560 --> 11:40.440]  all the Russian research that the Russians had shared with the United
[11:40.440 --> 11:45.480]  States as well all their missiles basically get off the ground now and get
[11:45.480 --> 11:50.880]  into orbit and then they sit around saying don't criticize the government

[18:11.320 --> 18:16.600]  enemies of Islam Haroon Rashida Swat a top aide to Abu Hamza would later be
[18:16.600 --> 18:22.280]  singled out as the supposed mastermind of the London 7-7 bombings as what is
[18:22.280 --> 18:27.800]  also suspected of working with British intelligence Omar Bakri Muhammad who
[18:27.800 --> 18:32.000]  collaborated with Osama bin Laden also worked for British intelligence the
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  British government knows who we are he said MI5 has interrogated us many times
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.520]  I think now we have something called public immunity Bakri admitted in 2001
[18:42.520 --> 18:47.840]  like many jihadists the Syrian-born imam was connected to the Muslim brotherhood
[18:47.840 --> 18:52.960]  a documented British and later CIA intelligence asset the terrorist who
[18:52.960 --> 18:57.240]  trained the London bombers was a US informant the London Guardian reports
[18:57.240 --> 19:02.640]  citing his exceptional cooperation in working with US authorities a New York
[19:02.640 --> 19:07.320]  judge released Mohammed Jenaid Babar despite him pleading guilty to five
[19:07.320 --> 19:11.640]  counts of terrorism the 10th of December of last year six years after his
[19:11.640 --> 19:16.240]  initial arrest and subsequent guilty plea he was sentenced to time served and
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.200]  charged $500 by the court in a special assessment fee other leaders of
[19:21.200 --> 19:24.800]  Islamic extremism protected by the British government and what is now
[19:24.800 --> 19:29.840]  being dubbed London a stand include our Libby implicated in the alleged al-Qaeda
[19:29.840 --> 19:35.840]  bombings of two US embassies in Africa Abu Qatada radical imam told MI5 agency
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.000]  exercise powerful spiritual influence over the Algerian community in London
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.080]  the cleric sermons were found in a flat in the German city of Hamburg used by
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.160]  some of those involved in 9-11 in May the British government fast-tracked a
[19:48.160 --> 19:52.480]  proposal to allow police to monitor the conversations of alleged terrorists we
[19:52.480 --> 19:56.280]  will introduce legislation to combat groups and individuals who reject our
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.960]  values and promote messages of hate said Home Secretary Theresa May since 2000 the
[20:01.960 --> 20:06.000]  government has introduced five major pieces of terrorism legislation often
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.440]  in response to anticipated events like the supposed plot against the Queen a
[20:10.440 --> 20:14.280]  theater of fears persisted worldwide with all of the roles inhabited by
[20:14.280 --> 20:18.640]  government patsy's time and time again in order to pass illegal liberty
[20:18.640 --> 20:23.320]  destroying legislation how is this latest threat any different in the words of
[20:23.320 --> 20:27.400]  Thomas Jefferson when government fears the people there is liberty when the
[20:27.400 --> 20:32.120]  people fear the government there is tyranny John bound for info wars dot
[20:32.120 --> 20:39.240]  com and now I'm gonna play a clip from last week of general Michael Flynn
[20:39.240 --> 20:46.400]  retired the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency saying US made
[20:46.400 --> 20:53.800]  willful decision to support ISIS in Syria and I've had Colonel Schaefer on who
[20:53.800 --> 20:59.040]  is graduated above the military now and is involved in very secretive
[20:59.040 --> 21:04.160]  intelligence operations and he says basically entire military army marines
[21:04.160 --> 21:09.000]  Air Force Navy are very upset as you know two and a half years ago saying no
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.080]  to attacking Syria no to giving him air support for the rebels because they
[21:13.080 --> 21:20.920]  estimate from on-the-ground assessments 96 percent of the rebels are foam at the
[21:20.920 --> 21:29.000]  mouth Salafist Al Nuzra Al Qaeda will hobbyist they fly Al Qaeda flags they
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.360]  attack resuppliers when they're trying to give them weapons they hate Americans
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.320]  and Westerners so much it is joke level and of course you've heard whistle
[21:38.320 --> 21:45.040]  lower CIA contractor retired Tosh Plum Leon who was given from NATO folks three
[21:45.040 --> 21:52.040]  years ago when all this first went down the Intel and and Congress has been
[21:52.040 --> 21:56.000]  briefed they know and so that's what the Pentagon's like coming on going yep we
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.920]  were ordered to do this it's Al Qaeda we don't like it they even sent General
[22:00.920 --> 22:05.280]  Dempsey in as you know two and a half years ago to tell Obama the military
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.680]  is not gonna stand for this they were going to attack him and now Obama has
[22:10.680 --> 22:15.760]  announced air support for the rebels against Assad there are no good rebels
[22:15.760 --> 22:23.280]  Syria did nothing to us Assad is good compared to these people he's good
[22:23.280 --> 22:27.240]  compared to Qaddafi it's like Assad's good compared to Qaddafi Qaddafi's good
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.960]  compared to these people Saddam is good compared to these people but he did some
[22:31.960 --> 22:38.680]  stuff at least these people have done nothing it's one of the few safe havens
[22:38.680 --> 22:42.360]  in the Middle East where Christians Jews and non-medical Muslims live in peace
[22:42.360 --> 22:48.240]  and our government is destroying the country over five years killing 300,000
[22:48.240 --> 22:56.760]  people and now using the scum army they've let breed again they don't run the
[22:56.760 --> 23:01.560]  army they put a big vat out in the woods of stagnant water so the mosquitoes
[23:01.560 --> 23:05.520]  could breed it and now the globalists are walking around selling mosquito
[23:05.520 --> 23:11.240]  propellant to everybody mosquito repellent they're not even trying to
[23:11.240 --> 23:16.800]  kill mosquitoes they're they're just selling us anti mosquito systems these
[23:16.800 --> 23:22.040]  these expensive things they put on your houses that don't work too well and it
[23:22.040 --> 23:26.240]  is disgusting so here's that clip and the sake of our viewers in 2012 your
[23:26.240 --> 23:30.480]  agency was saying quote the Salafists the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda in
[23:30.480 --> 23:35.760]  Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria in 2012 the US was
[23:35.760 --> 23:39.720]  helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups why did you not stop
[23:39.720 --> 23:43.680]  that if you're worried about the rise of quote unquote I mean I hate to say it's
[23:43.680 --> 23:49.080]  not my job but that my job was to was to ensure that the that the accuracy of
[23:49.080 --> 23:52.720]  our intelligence that was being presented was was as good as it could be
[23:52.720 --> 23:59.320]  and I will tell you it goes before 2012 I mean when we're when we're in Iraq and
[23:59.320 --> 24:02.440]  we still had decisions to be made before there was a decision to pull out of
[24:02.440 --> 24:07.560]  Iraq in 2011 I mean it was very clear what were we what we were going to face
[24:07.560 --> 24:11.160]  well I admire your Frank very clear we were gonna let me let me just take one
[24:11.160 --> 24:14.800]  before we move on just to clarify once more you are basically saying that even
[24:14.800 --> 24:18.000]  in government at the time you knew those groups were around you saw this
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.320]  analysis and you were arguing against it but who wasn't listening I think I
[24:22.320 --> 24:26.760]  think administration so administration turned a blind eye to your analysis I
[24:26.760 --> 24:29.600]  don't know if they turned a blind eye I think it was a decision I think it was a
[24:29.600 --> 24:32.880]  willful decision a willful decision to go support an insurgency that had
[24:32.880 --> 24:37.560]  Salafist al Qaeda decision to do what they're doing which which you have to
[24:37.560 --> 24:42.760]  really have to really ask the president what is it that he actually is doing with
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.800]  the with the policy that is in place because it is very very confusing I'm
[24:47.800 --> 24:51.360]  sitting here today Maddie and I don't I can't tell you exactly what that is and
[24:51.360 --> 24:57.720]  I've been at this for a long time okay well let's go back to your eyes powerful
[24:57.720 --> 25:01.280]  video sometimes when you play videos out of the computer they play off sync
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.640]  we're gonna fix that video re-sync the audio and play it again or the media will
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.960]  say it's a fake clip and because the audio was about a half second off but
[25:09.960 --> 25:13.920]  but that's an extremely powerful admission and you heard him say look I was
[25:13.920 --> 25:19.160]  just following orders but my job was to give accurate intelligence and yes we
[25:19.160 --> 25:28.200]  were funding al Qaeda and then Jeb Bush we played the clip yesterday gets up in
[25:28.200 --> 25:39.800]  a speech Tuesday and says we need to take out a sod to stop Isis I mean that
[25:39.800 --> 25:45.920]  is such an insult to everyone's intelligence that's like saying the
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.080]  Pacific Ocean is off the coast to New York I mean it's that big a flame and
[25:51.080 --> 25:57.560]  lie no the Atlantic Ocean is and I'm not even joking around here with my
[25:57.560 --> 26:02.360]  analogy I mean Assad and his government and his people he's very popular in
[26:02.360 --> 26:06.600]  Syria he was democratizing the country he was working with the West he got set
[26:06.600 --> 26:12.000]  up and they turn loose a bunch of Saudi Arabian nutbags and others they
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.200]  recruited to run around murdering everybody and our government is funding
[26:16.200 --> 26:22.640]  it just like they're funding and pushing selling baby parts bad people run the
[26:22.640 --> 26:29.160]  government they're illegitimate at the top most the people in the FBI and the
[26:29.160 --> 26:33.200]  local police in the military are upstanding hard-working good people
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.000]  like the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency but they give them
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.480]  orders by criminals and at a certain point you gotta stop following the
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.080]  orders and that happened two and a half years ago the Globalist Plaint the
[26:45.080 --> 26:52.760]  Pentagon was told by its officers we're not doing this we're not gonna we've
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.160]  already been funding them giving them weapons we're not gonna be their air
[26:55.160 --> 27:02.120]  force this is crazy and they had to back off now they're back again and now
[27:02.120 --> 27:07.800]  they got Jeb Bush the Republican connected to narcotics trafficking
[27:07.800 --> 27:14.840]  everything else saying we need to attack Assad and then and that he's with
[27:14.840 --> 27:22.240]  Iran and all this stuff when we just made a deal with Iran but it doesn't
[27:22.240 --> 27:27.720]  matter Assad's not offensively working with Iran Assad's working with whoever he
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.160]  can to not be defeated it doesn't matter you don't offensively attack somebody
[27:32.160 --> 27:36.720]  that hasn't done anything to you here's Jeb Bush we and our partners should
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.040]  declare a no-fly zone in Syria and then work to expand that zone to prevent
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.000]  more crimes by the regime force that no-fly zone and will stop the regime's
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.600]  bombing raids that kill helpless citizens it could also help stop Iranian
[27:52.600 --> 27:57.440]  flights from resupplying the regime and Hezbollah and other bad actors a no-fly
[27:57.440 --> 28:03.040]  zone is a critical strategic step to cut off Assad counts and influence keep the
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.640]  press let's hit pause do you understand that when Al-Qaeda double
[28:07.640 --> 28:12.400]  crossed the West and went back into Iraq to resupply that the we officially
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.520]  asked Iran and their top general to lead attacks to stop them taking the whole
[28:16.520 --> 28:19.760]  country over do you realize they've actually because Al-Qaeda got out of
[28:19.760 --> 28:25.880]  control have actually let Iranians in to fight them I mean Jeb Bush it's just
[28:25.880 --> 28:31.720]  crazy town to sit there and listen to him talk so now they want to flip back to
[28:31.720 --> 28:35.320]  supporting the Al-Qaeda rebels openly again and start bombing and notice
[28:35.320 --> 28:39.680]  that's what Obama's saying to this is so Machiavellian now they don't even know
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.960]  which side they're on because at a certain point all this double-dealing all
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.640]  this quadruple dealing it just becomes a disaster historically that always
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.160]  happens these people think they're so sophisticated so duplicitous that they
[28:53.160 --> 28:58.000]  have a method of their madness but pretty soon they're just confused let's go
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.800]  back to the end of the clip you're on for a settlement and prevent more needless
[29:01.800 --> 29:07.160]  death in a country that is seen so much of it the pause again it's the West that
[29:07.160 --> 29:10.640]  started the attack on Syria five years ago on record and gave chemical weapons
[29:10.640 --> 29:15.080]  al-Qaeda to attack again its reality turned upside down go back to it when
[29:15.080 --> 29:20.560]  we talk about no-fly zones in Syria precision airstrikes in Iraq or any
[29:20.560 --> 29:25.720]  projection of military power to meet or deter threats all of this assumes that
[29:25.720 --> 29:31.840]  such power is there when we need it yet here as well the shortsightedness of the
[29:31.840 --> 29:36.040]  president administration will leave a cost we're in the seventh year of a
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.060]  significant dismantling of our own military that's enough almost inverse
[29:40.060 --> 29:46.560]  proportion to that's enough he goes on to blame Iraq on the Democrats when it's
[29:46.560 --> 29:53.680]  his brother we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:00.880 --> 33:10.040]  of the information war it's Alex Jones hi I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm
[33:10.040 --> 33:14.040]  simply trying to get the public to focus in on the real issues and the
[33:14.040 --> 33:19.240]  incredibly historical things that are unfolding right in front of us in the
[33:19.240 --> 33:24.400]  final equation it's so key to realize that individuals have power what we stand
[33:24.400 --> 33:33.680]  for what we purchase what we say what we talk about how we vote not just at the
[33:33.680 --> 33:39.000]  ballot box but at the grand jury box and the jury box and when we vote on Yelp
[33:39.000 --> 33:46.240]  or we vote on TripAdvisor or we you know vote on the internet all of that has a
[33:46.240 --> 33:52.360]  massive effect and shows us that it is the knowledge of the crowd historically
[33:52.360 --> 33:57.160]  any philosopher will tell you that ends up being more knowledgeable and having a
[33:57.160 --> 34:04.800]  greater deep wisdom than the social engineers themselves and that's if you
[34:04.800 --> 34:09.080]  have social engineers that mean well now I want to be clear we have a giant unwashed
[34:09.080 --> 34:14.360]  masses out there maybe half the population that is in a trance that
[34:14.360 --> 34:22.200]  cannot find their rear ends with both hands as we say but of the group within
[34:22.200 --> 34:27.400]  the mass that's awake and involved and having their voice heard and that cares
[34:27.400 --> 34:31.120]  enough to fill out a card at the restaurant about what they thought about
[34:31.120 --> 34:39.480]  the service or click on the internet vote or make the internet comment or say
[34:39.480 --> 34:44.960]  something about the hotel they stayed at or send a letter to Congress those
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.440]  people give most the charity they do most the community work they're involved
[34:50.440 --> 34:54.360]  the most they're the people that actually care about civilization and
[34:54.360 --> 35:00.320]  society and in Canadian British and US studies you can just search engine this
[35:00.320 --> 35:09.960]  conservatives and libertarians are six times more likely to give money six
[35:09.960 --> 35:14.840]  times more likely to be involved in charity six times more likely to be
[35:14.840 --> 35:21.160]  involved their communities or to volunteer for the military and in the
[35:21.160 --> 35:27.800]  inverse those calling themselves liberals and environmentalist are six
[35:27.800 --> 35:34.120]  times more likely to not give money and to steal and to not physically
[35:34.120 --> 35:40.800]  volunteer and I'll tell you why that is because modern conservatives and
[35:40.800 --> 35:47.680]  libertarians who aren't perfect as a diverse group of people are the liberals
[35:47.680 --> 35:56.720]  if you go back to 1776 they were called liberals they have again flipped
[35:56.720 --> 36:01.280]  everything on its head where Planned Parenthood loves the black people when
[36:01.280 --> 36:07.240]  it was founded to kill the black people George Soros is a top Nazi living
[36:07.240 --> 36:12.440]  collaborator should have been in Nuremberg trial he is the most highly
[36:12.440 --> 36:19.960]  decorated member with awards from the ADL the leftist Jewish organization it
[36:19.960 --> 36:33.240]  is again a sickening joke a sickening ridiculous macabre hallucination now I
[36:33.240 --> 36:35.960]  want to get into more of the news I've already mentioned quite a bit of it but
[36:35.960 --> 36:39.800]  I haven't drilled into it yet I want to get into the economy Peter Schiff's

[37:12.320 --> 37:21.280]  high-tech brainwashing so before I get to any more of this news and a on-the-
[37:21.280 --> 37:24.600]  street video report shot right after they walked out of the theater I love
[37:24.600 --> 37:27.720]  these movie reviews that jacari Jackson and Kate Daniels do together because
[37:27.720 --> 37:30.640]  they're good buddies and go out and play pool together and stuff like that in

[37:34.880 --> 37:40.080]  well and joins them but straight out of Compton what they're not telling you a
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.960]  movie review by jacari Jackson and Kit Daniels that's coming up in the final
[37:45.960 --> 37:53.700]  segment of this hour as well before I get to Jeb Bush pushing torture let me

[38:06.400 --> 38:16.440]  brain force and I wanted to give you a review by loss from panorama city
[38:16.440 --> 38:23.000]  california on brain force didn't think much was happening was taking it for a
[38:23.000 --> 38:29.680]  week with the secret b12 I cannot stress enough that brain body is missing
[38:29.680 --> 38:34.520]  when I skipped it one day I felt like I was either missing screws or loose

[38:38.920 --> 38:43.560]  lunch for energy and the rest of the day thanks to all the info warriors yeah
[38:43.560 --> 38:49.880]  that's the thing when I don't take brain force I feel it and that's what's so
[38:49.880 --> 38:54.720]  amazing about it somebody ran off of my open bottle saying to take one I know
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.160]  it was put down here when I don't take the brain force that's when I noticed it
[38:59.160 --> 39:03.760]  and I actually didn't take my brain force today and I'm still awake still a
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.600]  lot of energy but this doesn't have the classical stimulants and it has key
[39:07.600 --> 39:11.440]  compounds you can read about on the website watch informational videos about

[40:53.360 --> 40:57.200]  workouts and life in general love this product and buy it regularly I take it
[40:57.200 --> 41:00.680]  with X2 in the morning instead of coffee I would recommend this to a friend thank
[41:00.680 --> 41:05.520]  you so much for supporting us Jack and I'm glad you had a good response we try
[41:05.520 --> 41:10.000]  stuff out for six months to a year after different variations before we even sell
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.080]  it and I've never been a vitamin or nutraceutical guy in the last four or
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.360]  five years I've lost 60 plus pounds slowly getting back into shape from
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.160]  gaining 98 pounds and not working out for 15 years because I thought they'd
[41:24.160 --> 41:27.400]  kill me any minute 15 years ago and they physically attacked me and were death
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.760]  threatening me and I just yeah I'm just gonna go eat a steak I'm gonna drink a
[41:30.760 --> 41:34.400]  six pack of beer at night I don't care I'm gonna quit working out I was the
[41:34.400 --> 41:39.560]  opposite of a narcissist and I just was kind of let myself go and so I slowly
[41:39.560 --> 41:43.520]  started bike riding and slowly started exercising but I could lose 1015 pounds
[41:43.520 --> 41:47.200]  the rest of a state on me once I began taking Beyond Tangy Tangerine from
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.440]  M4sHealth.com an Injevity product I lost about 20 something pounds because I
[41:52.440 --> 41:55.160]  was not as hungry because I was missing all these minerals and trace
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.520]  elements but mainstream media says you don't need but Dr. Wallach's research
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.880]  shows you do and deficiency is such a big part of it and then I researched iodine
[42:04.880 --> 42:10.240]  the best forms of that got on survival shield NX2 like this morning I took I
[42:10.240 --> 42:14.800]  put in a bottle of water when I went to work out two squirts of supermail which
[42:14.800 --> 42:20.040]  isn't as strong as under the tongue but I like it that way and a squirt of of X2
[42:20.040 --> 42:23.840]  and then I drank that so I've got a ton of energy felt great I'd forgotten to
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.600]  take the brain force because I'm just not a you know vitamin mineral guy but
[42:28.600 --> 42:32.920]  when I do remember to take seven or eight of the products a day and to do the
[42:32.920 --> 42:37.320]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine which I give my children every day it's just amazing and
[42:37.320 --> 42:44.080]  then I asked myself why aren't I taking all the M4sHealth products
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.280]  when I'm here endorsing it and it seems it's an incredible response and it's
[42:48.280 --> 42:54.400]  because I'm not a habit driven guy I'm not dominated by it and it's very hard
[42:54.400 --> 42:59.040]  to start new habits but it will just start the new habit these nutraceuticals
[42:59.040 --> 43:02.800]  have been game changers you've heard the rave reviews and then there's the added
[43:02.800 --> 43:09.920]  bonus your funding a hair on fire foam at the mouth 110% committed the
[43:09.920 --> 43:15.520]  organization as one of the greatest samurai said desperate this is the way
[43:15.520 --> 43:20.200]  of the samurai 100 men can't kill such a man and that's absolutely true we're
[43:20.200 --> 43:24.840]  going into this 110% and I just want to thank you and I'm humbled that you do
[43:24.840 --> 43:28.760]  support us we can continue the operation at this level and hopefully expand in
[43:28.760 --> 43:32.400]  the face of globalist because I want to go all the way so these are war bonds
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.160]  when you buy the books the videos the t-shirts the ball caps the shortwave
[43:36.160 --> 43:40.360]  radios the non GMO seeds the high-quality water filters at info or
[43:40.360 --> 43:47.960]  store.com and then subdivisions of info or store.com are made in 1776.com and
[43:47.960 --> 43:54.280]  that's the made in America products and then you've got if you want to get them
[43:54.280 --> 43:57.200]  cheaper for other parts of the world we got the regular apparel area and we got
[43:57.200 --> 44:00.560]  info or health.com this young Jevvie products and then we've got in force

[44:05.520 --> 44:08.440]  done ranting I'm not gonna plug again this hour but I've been forgetting to
[44:08.440 --> 44:11.680]  plug and skipping breaks the last few months and we're a little bit behind so
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.600]  I've been doing some midair refueling to fund the operation here especially with
[44:15.600 --> 44:20.640]  this what looks like a depression coming up and it's more essential than ever to
[44:20.640 --> 44:24.160]  support our local AM and FM affiliates to tell them thank you for carrying the
[44:24.160 --> 44:29.920]  show to become a sponsor locally even if it's small or large or to support local
[44:29.920 --> 44:34.760]  sponsors that is as important as supporting info or store.com so thank
[44:34.760 --> 44:41.680]  you I salute you and want to just absolutely commend you for that. You
[44:41.680 --> 44:45.400]  know what I think I'm gonna air the straight out of Compton piece right now
[44:45.400 --> 44:50.840]  with Jakarta Jackson and Kit Daniels as we analyze culture analyze media because
[44:50.840 --> 44:54.720]  so much of the propaganda is embedded in in media not even so much news we know
[44:54.720 --> 45:01.280]  the news twist things now or the talking points in news too but so much of it I'd
[45:01.280 --> 45:05.240]  say 80% of the propaganda is in movies and TV and you see that message so I
[45:05.240 --> 45:10.640]  appreciate Jakari and Kit going out and getting the job done on this report here
[45:10.640 --> 45:14.640]  is that report and we'll come back with the latest on the buildup for war with
[45:14.640 --> 45:19.680]  Russia and then Jeb Bush on torture tactics saying they're effective that's
[45:19.680 --> 45:23.640]  like saying child molestation is effective or arson is effective it's
[45:23.640 --> 45:32.040]  illegal you little beady-eyed jackass scummy swimy Kenny Bunkport blue blood
[45:32.040 --> 45:35.840]  been feeding on the East Coast back since your family were Tories in the
[45:35.840 --> 45:42.040]  Revolutionary War and setting up skull and bones and then Nazi collaborators and
[45:42.040 --> 45:46.680]  now now urinating all over us excuse me just with Republicans like this guy
[45:46.680 --> 45:49.960]  there's no wonder we're in so much trouble and John Boehner and all the rest
[45:49.960 --> 45:53.760]  of these scum and it's not good to make it personal with these gangsters they
[45:53.760 --> 45:57.480]  can just make a call and have you killed but what's gotten us in this position is
[45:57.480 --> 46:01.920]  cowering to this filth and somebody's got to stand up against them just tell it
[46:01.920 --> 46:06.000]  like it is let's go ahead and go to that report
[46:06.560 --> 46:10.800]  kid Daniels here with Jakari Jackson who's behind the camera we just got out
[46:10.800 --> 46:15.040]  of the Alamo draft house and we just saw the latest movie straight out of
[46:15.040 --> 46:21.160]  Compton about the legendary hip-hop group NWA now overall I definitely recommend
[46:21.160 --> 46:23.920]  the movie it was way better and I thought it'd be you know how a lot of
[46:23.920 --> 46:29.120]  movies are kind of hyped up beforehand this was no exception but this movie
[46:29.120 --> 46:32.320]  almost lived up to the hype and even if you're not a big fan of hip-hop I
[46:32.320 --> 46:36.400]  definitely still recommend it just so you can see a glimpse of popular culture
[46:36.400 --> 46:41.440]  as well as the history of the late 80s and early 90s at the time now there was
[46:41.440 --> 46:45.600]  one scene in the movie thought I thought was very interesting was the musicians
[46:45.600 --> 46:49.960]  were at a press conference after they were arrested in Detroit after a riot
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.600]  and I think it was Ice Cube who said that their art meaning their music
[46:54.600 --> 46:59.320]  reflected their reality now the reality at the time was and it's still true today
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.960]  is that the CIA controls the international drug trade and they do
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.360]  that too mainly so they can fund their black-op operations you know the kind of
[47:08.360 --> 47:11.480]  off-the-book things you know where they overthrow governments and who knows
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.560]  what else they do and in order and for them to create this demand for drugs
[47:17.560 --> 47:21.720]  back in the 80s they use these various intermediate areas you know such as
[47:21.720 --> 47:28.720]  music executives to push hip-hop to the forefront above rock and roll and to
[47:28.720 --> 47:32.680]  glamorize the drug trade and drugs to ensure that there was a demand of for
[47:32.680 --> 47:37.760]  drugs from the American inner youth to ensure that the CIA would still keep
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.400]  getting money off the drugs they were importing through the country and it was
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.920]  back in 1996 that a journalist by the name of Gary Webb who was writing for
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.560]  the San Jose Mercury News he revealed that a former drug kingpin in the 80s
[47:51.560 --> 47:56.560]  freeway Rick Ross one of his cocaine connections was actually tied to the
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.000]  CIA and that created a huge scandal now Rick Ross was on the Alex Jones show
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.080]  back in November and he said this I'm letting you know right now that the
[48:07.080 --> 48:14.400]  establishment is using hip-hop to prime these kids for a life that's gonna send
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.480]  them to prison just like they did with me see when I was coming up there was
[48:18.480 --> 48:26.240]  superfly tequila sunrise squadface all these movies to make you think that you
[48:26.240 --> 48:31.000]  could start with nothing and then you could have the whole world at the palm
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.240]  of your hand only that there was no part of gold at the end of the rainbow was a
[48:37.240 --> 48:42.040]  set of handcuffs and shackles and you want to know why the CIA similar was
[48:42.040 --> 48:46.840]  behind me because they were the guys behind me when I was selling drugs and
[48:46.840 --> 48:55.720]  now they're behind hip-hop and rock and roll this prison hip-hop connection
[48:55.720 --> 49:00.440]  they're behind that too if it was if it was good for them to sell drugs and it
[49:00.440 --> 49:04.440]  should have been good for me to sell drugs the money from the drugs went to
[49:04.440 --> 49:10.640]  buy guns for the country even if you don't read my book one your kids let
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.640]  them know but I advise you that this book is worth reading definitely for your
[49:15.640 --> 49:19.120]  kids even if you don't read it get it for your kids get it for your loved ones
[49:19.120 --> 49:24.200]  let them see what the drug culture is all about so the summit all up the drugs
[49:24.200 --> 49:27.560]  that you saw in the movie and the drug lifestyle and the decadence of the
[49:27.560 --> 49:32.840]  inner city that was all created by the CIA to to ensure that there was still a
[49:32.840 --> 49:36.800]  demand for drugs and to bolster the CIA's profits now jacari what do you
[49:36.800 --> 49:41.000]  think about the movie thank you kid now if I could take one quote away from this
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.840]  movie it was when the guys were all together at a press conference and
[49:44.840 --> 49:49.520]  somebody brought the point that we have AK-47s from Russia none of us have a
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.400]  passport we have drugs coming in from South America none of us have a passport
[49:53.400 --> 49:57.920]  it remind me of that line in boys the hood where Lawrence Fishborn is talking
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.680]  about we don't have any planes we don't have any ships how does this cocaine get
[50:01.680 --> 50:05.360]  here and it goes on to the point that kit was bringing about the evening skies
[50:05.360 --> 50:09.120]  wrap about this stuff they're not the ones who actually bring this stuff into
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.640]  the country and there's another aspect the free speech aspect that ice cube
[50:13.640 --> 50:17.760]  touches on in the movie and I think he is still a vocal free speech proponent to
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.200]  this day that these guys have the right to go out and say whatever they want to
[50:21.200 --> 50:25.840]  say and talking about their situations their involvement with the police now if
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.240]  there is a villain in this movie besides easy ease manager the police are
[50:30.240 --> 50:33.680]  definitely definitely the villain but these guys are talking about what they
[50:33.680 --> 50:37.280]  see that was their experience growing up in Compton all right we're going to
[50:37.280 --> 50:41.600]  break the full report what they're not telling you about straight out of
[50:41.600 --> 50:47.640]  Compton is up on info wars.com we're gonna come back and get into torture
[50:47.640 --> 50:52.680]  they're back promoting that this time and they're pushing war with Russia and
[50:52.680 --> 50:58.840]  the survivability of it this is insanity stay with us
[50:59.320 --> 51:03.840]  planning to buy food storage wait a minute many companies try to confuse you
[51:03.840 --> 51:07.200]  with the number of servings they sell it's not about the number of servings

[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.640]  express and Planned Parenthood have been dreading the superior court of the
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.480]  state of California has ruled that biomedical company stem express cannot
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.040]  legally suppress the release of videos obtained by the Center for medical
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.120]  progress and doesn't have any right to the footage or documents that the
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.640]  anti-abortion activists have obtained yeah especially when there's evidence of
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.760]  what appears to be criminal activity Los Angeles Superior Court judge Joanne
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.640]  O'Donnell explained that the restraining order taken out against CMP will no
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.760]  longer stand and represents a restraint on the First Amendment rights and they've
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.960]  lied and said it's edited videos they released the full video I'm gonna like
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.960]  five and a half hour videos and stuff it's even worse we sit there I sat up one
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.680]  night like scan through a five and a half hour video I watched two hours of it
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.240]  and I mean it's just the the smacking of the lips and the guzzling of the wine
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.680]  you know all the videos and the restaurants and the and the and and the
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.560]  puffery and the and the sycophantic nature of these chicken-neck weak ghouls
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:02.480]  these grave robbers I mean it's just it's just unbelievable
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.840]  we're even grave robbers there they're chopping up living people to their body
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.880]  snatchers vampires Jeffrey Dahmers I mean I don't know what you call people that
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.560]  chop up little kids or they pull them out keep them alive wheel the woman out
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:22.120]  drug get the organs out and you sit around on that Lamborghinis and
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.560]  everything while you eat fancy food and drink wine I mean it's just it's it's
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.520]  the image of serial killers with women in cages in front of them with a big
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:38.240]  banquet table heat with meat and fruit and you know honey glazed giblets
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:45.440]  enjoying themselves the injunction plaintiffs seeks would prevent
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.640]  defendants from disseminating the videotapes said the judge first proposed
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.800]  injunction would constitute a prior restraint on the defense right under
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.000]  the First Amendment and the parallel protections under California
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.960]  Constitution plaintiffs does not persuade the court that the discovery it
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.440]  seeks necessary to obtain the preliminary injunction this is because it
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.640]  appears unlikely the court is going to grant the preliminary injunction
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:15.160]  Judge O'Donnell said yesterday it really means the CMP will be able to
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:19.280]  release remaining footage it has on stem express employees without fair of
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.320]  reprisal attorneys working with the CMP believe justice has prevailed let's
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.000]  think about whistle-blowing if you were in somebody's house and and and you'd
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.440]  been led into the house and let's just say you believed you were there as
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.200]  swingers or whatever to have sex with a couple and then you release that video
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.600]  without them knowing you're super liable I don't care what state you're in
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.600]  you're gonna end up doing jail time or getting fined because nobody's hurting
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.080]  anybody even if you think that's immoral but when you're sitting around at a
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.920]  restaurant talking about selling body parts and you've met in a meeting with
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:58.120]  somebody it's covered under the First Amendment but whistle-blowing goes
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.760]  further than that if you work in a company or a government institution and
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.440]  they're laundering money they're selling drugs out the back they're doing
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.480]  whatever it is that's illegal and you videotape that and expose it it doesn't
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.240]  matter if you're in a two-party consent state under wiretapping because that's
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:20.080]  exempt when you're exposing a crime you have a responsibility under the good
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:27.720]  Samaritan code in common law that's expressed throughout all Western law to
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.280]  render aid or if you know a crimes being committed to report it or to
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.080]  physically try to stop it and what really makes civilizations rise is when
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.680]  people are civically involved and themselves ferreting out corruption and
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.600]  exposing it now that doesn't mean you tattle on your neighbor because their
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.760]  ten-year-olds plan in the backyard till six at night because you're at work that
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.840]  means you you also go after real crime not nanny state BS so there's a delicate
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:01.520]  balance there as well we'll be back Drudge and Fox News could be censored

[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.640]  they're talking about Hillary again being a time bomb the Democratic Party but
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.960]  I mean really no one can believe that she still hasn't dropped out of the race
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.800]  but but I mean don't expect that the she's the lady that's getting most the
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.200]  money she's the lady the establishments behind and they can play the whole thing
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.000]  you just don't like women like Bernie Sanders said on Monday to in a scene
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.560]  interview we played the clip he said it's sex is to criticize Hillary I think
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.800]  she's a great person doing a great job I mean then what are you running against
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:12.320]  and then he's a socialist so that's all coming up up on info wars dot com by

[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.320]  just fear mongering to take more liberties they're now pushing tracker
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.640]  chips for welfare recipients you've got the report right there at info wars

[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:49.040]  Russia it would take everything we had 46 million Americans go to food banks and
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.240]  long lines for dwindling food supplies the lines begin at 6 30 a.m. across the
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.400]  country and food banks are running out a hundred million people are on some form
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:07.480]  of food assistance but 46 million are on direct assistance imagine a food line
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:12.080]  soup kitchens with a hundred million people a day lined up but instead it's all
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:19.080]  digital so it's hidden also video services showing Ferguson shooter Tyrone
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:26.040]  Harris video shows Ferguson shooter Tyrone Harris flashing a gun at Mike
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:31.240]  Brown protest and again there's video of him pulling a gun out on the cops and
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.040]  getting shot and then again they oh my gosh they killed him because he's black
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:41.720]  no if I pull a gun on the cops randomly they're gonna shoot me does that mean
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.000]  there isn't some discrimination against blacks in some areas absolutely but is
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.560]  it the number one issue in America no the media pushes it for divide and conquer
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.600]  and will not touch the really big issues that's some of the news up on info
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:01.840]  wars calm and prison planet calm now we have Peter shift joining us for the
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:07.560]  balance of the hour I appreciate him coming on on short notice but there's
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.000]  four or five financial guests we have on that pretty much line up on a lot of
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.560]  the same issues but they have different perspectives from their life
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.360]  experiences and you know I can't tell you which one I think is the most accurate
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:24.880]  they're all really accurate Peter shifts had about a 98% accuracy rate until he
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:29.360]  said a few years ago that he thought the bubble would bust by then but if you
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.840]  look at the third world and I'm not defending him it's just a fact if you
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.280]  look at what's happening in the old world there's depressions in most areas of
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.760]  the planet in South America Central America most of Africa the Middle East a
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:47.120]  lot of Eastern Europe Asia Japan's been a recession for 20 years but now it's
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.280]  clearly going belly up and more and more analysts from Ron Paul to you name it
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:58.080]  are saying they believe the day of reckoning is here now we had mr. Dent
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.840]  on yesterday with his demographic cliff and he was very bold and said he
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.280]  believes we're in a dead cat bounce within two weeks the Chinese stock
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.000]  markets are racing down he believes it'll pull the other major ones down and
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.080]  that there's gonna be a real estate bubble popping by the end of this year
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.480]  so we'll get shifts take on that but also want to walk through the election with
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.920]  shift what he really thinks about Trump what he thinks about Hillary I mean just
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.480]  the state of this country how can there be confidence in anything when
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.560]  criminals are running absolutely free and the IRS is now persecuting over a
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.680]  hundred thousand people admittedly jailing hundreds of people a year for
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.880]  their political views that's now come out in her emails how she's gonna get
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.520]  Republicans and get conservatives Peter Schiff's father is one of the most
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.880]  famous anti-New World Order patriots for people that are older he's been in
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.840]  jail for what is it a decade I don't mean to get into that story we only
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.720]  mentioned last time he's been on the show probably 50 times never talked about
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:08.000]  it he used to come on my show in 95 96 97 98 right through the 2000s and then
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.760]  the judge federal judge said you keep publishing your books saying the IRS is
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.000]  a fraud and a collection agency for the Federal Reserve I'm gonna put you in
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.080]  prison he is in jail for the First Amendment a true political prisoner so
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.640]  so now we see this is happening and they've issued one tax exemption to a
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.760]  conservative group in three years 10,000 plus the Democrats this is a tyranny
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.600]  and it's bipartisan but the Democrats are the tip of the spear so I want to get
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:42.560]  your economic prognosis of course Euro PAC comm billions under management
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.520]  host the Peter Schiff show and a lot more and find out the tales at Euro PAC
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.840]  comm I've thrown out probably 10 different stories or more since you've
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.880]  been holding five minutes what would you like to tackle first I mean I'd kind
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.920]  of like just get into politics first this is an American to get your view on
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:07.120]  just all of this insanity how much more crazy can it get well probably the
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.480]  craziest thing is how popular Bernie Sanders is right I mean you've got an
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:19.400]  admitted socialist who is drawing the largest crowds is that me yeah I think
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:24.120]  that is you it's okay have a newsroom which it's busy it's real world he's
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:28.240]  getting the largest crowds he's leading in some of the polls I mean most
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.600]  Democrats you know they're a lot of them that are socialists but they don't come
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.280]  out of the closet they don't admit it this guy is not you know ashamed of
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.680]  being a socialist and look how many of Americans want to vote for him he may be
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.800]  the Democratic front-runner yeah you know and of course you know Hillary is
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.440]  self-destructing so that's probably helping it that's probably why Biden
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.600]  wants to get in because he doesn't want to leave it to Bernie Sanders he
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.920]  probably senses there's some vulnerability there but you know people the
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.440]  Democrats want to jump all over the Republicans because of Donald Trump but
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.520]  look at how many Democrats are going for Sanders I remember I did that video
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.000]  last year at the Democratic National Convention if you haven't seen it it's
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.440]  on my YouTube channel I've seen it yeah and I asked if they would be in favor of
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.360]  a law banning corporate profits and these were the delegates for the
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.800]  Democratic Convention and they were in favor of it they yeah let's ban profits
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.920]  they're all socialists there and now you've got one of their own coming out
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.880]  and admitting it and he's leading in the polls this is where the nation is going
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.800]  and you predicted it in that viral video we'll play some of that at the bottom of
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:38.360]  the hour once we pull it up but again it's on the Peter Schiff YouTube site
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:42.440]  in fact I'm glad you raised that because you were Ron Paul in the first campaign
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.240]  congressman Ron Paul chief economic advisor as a top Austrian economist in
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:52.560]  your own right what would you be advising Rand Paul to get back in the
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:59.000]  lead to do right now if you were his advisor well you know my I gave Rand
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.280]  my advice hopefully you know he will he did I mean I think it's good but you
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:09.520]  know rather than attacking Donald Trump right I don't think that is the right
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:17.480]  strategy either Donald Trump is hitting a nerve where he is appealing to the
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:22.040]  people within the Republican Party who are fed up with both parties and who
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:27.000]  are fed up with career politicians and want something different and I think a
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.600]  lot of those Donald Trump voters can really be Rand Paul voters in
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.480]  transition because Rand Paul is not a career politician just because he's a
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.400]  US senator he never was in politics until he won that seat and he ran for
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.480]  Senate as an eye doctor as a small businessman that's how he needs to run
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.920]  president the way he ran for Senate because the field is crowded with career
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.920]  politicians and the only one right now that's standing out is Donald Trump but
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.960]  he needs to get those Trump voters he needs to wait for those Trump voters to
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:04.600]  evolve and realize that the real outsider in this race the real game
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:08.960]  changer the real break from the establishment in the Republican Party
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:14.280]  and the Democratic Party is Rand Paul not Donald Trump sure and I mean Trump's
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.680]  hooked in with the Democrats and all the rest of it do you think though Trump's
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.080]  for real because he is you know he has a big ego to be successful you got to have
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.640]  it I mean I think the guy's really smart I like almost everything he's saying do
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.920]  you think though he might not just want to be a stepping stone for the Democrats
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.760]  and Hillary and Biden I mean maybe he really wants to be president I mean I
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:37.560]  think Donald Trump be a lot better than Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton well the
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.480]  bar is pretty low there so yeah he might be but you know he wouldn't be as good
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.840]  as as Rand I agree obviously the guy would like to be president I mean who
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:49.920]  wouldn't want to be president if somebody just was gonna make you president the
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.760]  problem is getting elected it's it's very difficult I don't think this is some
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.760]  kind of plan to try to help elect a Democrat I mean I don't think he's in
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.600]  it for that reason but some of it might be ego I mean it's something that he
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.720]  might want to do I mean you know it's one of the only things really you can't
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.840]  buy I mean Trump can have whatever is for sale and generally the White House is
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.320]  not at least not for the people who occupy it maybe it's for sale to the
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:21.080]  people who you know who will make all the all the donations but you know I
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:26.520]  think the candidacy really says a lot about you know the country and where we
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.920]  are I don't think he can win the nomination I think when the field narrows
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.080]  it will be harder sure when you got 15 people and they're all the same and
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:39.160]  Trump's the only one that's different he's like the none of the above vote right
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.480]  I mean exactly he's not perfect but if you're out in the ocean a piece of
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.680]  driftwood is like an oasis and so Trump's the only one that's not a
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:54.040]  complete you know buffoon anti-American piece of garbage yeah and you know a lot
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.400]  of the things that he says are right he's right to be concerned about our
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.720]  deteriorating trade balance about our escalating national debt but he doesn't
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.440]  really articulate the right solutions it's not about just hiring smarter
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.880]  negotiators that's not what's going to do it we have to radically transform this
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:13.640]  country back to what it used to be we need massive cuts in government
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:17.760]  spending we do to abolish agencies and departments we need free markets we need
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.320]  to get rid of this welfare state we need to acknowledge the problems that
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:25.760]  exist you know you talked earlier about you know that the fact that we haven't
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.560]  had this day of reckoning yet because the masses still believe that the Fed
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:34.040]  reserves saved us they still think their policy work they still think there's a
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.880]  real recovery here they still think the Fed is gonna embark on rate tightening
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.400]  that isn't even close to true let's talk about it let's start walking through
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:45.680]  as I skip this network break to give you more time what we just saw in China what
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.480]  we are seeing in Greece what we're seeing with the Yanming Lord walk us
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.200]  through each of those and give us the big picture but first of all nobody is
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.000]  talking about the real story of the Chinese you want right people are
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.680]  missing this everybody's focusing on the devaluation which is tiny two or three
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.800]  percent what is important is the principal here China said that they
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.200]  want their currency not to necessarily be pegged to the dollar but to kind of
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.720]  reflect fundamentals everybody forgets that the dollar has risen maybe 30%
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.880]  against the basket of currencies over the past couple years that means that
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:22.760]  Chinese Yuan is also risen by the same percentage because it's been pegged to
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:26.160]  the dollar and China is saying we don't want to be pegged to the dollar we want
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.080]  our currency to be more in line with other currencies and the big problem is
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:35.200]  going to happen when the dollar reverses this is a dollar bubble and so the next
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.120]  time the dollar starts to go down China is not going to catch it China is not
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:44.920]  going to have our back when the dollar was falling from 2001 to 2008 China was
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:49.760]  there to keep buying us treasuries and mitigate the dollars decline and in the
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.800]  currency wars in 2010 and 2011 China was buying dollars and buying treasuries to
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.760]  prevent its currency from rising so this is huge you're saying now that they're
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.520]  going to let the yuan just basically free fall and not back the dollar up
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.240]  could this signify the end of dollar hegemony now what I'm saying is when
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.520]  this dollar bubble bursts and the dollar starts to fall right the Chinese are
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.760]  going to let their currency rise they're not going to try to keep their
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.160]  dollar currency week with the dollar they're not going to buy all these
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.760]  treasuries to suppress the value that you want they're going to let their
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.600]  currency rise with all the other currencies also you see it as this
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.480]  that they're going to stop manipulating their currency and just let it flow
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.800]  they're not going to let it freely flow but they will manage it higher just like
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:39.560]  they've managed it lower and that is bad news for the US because that means
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.920]  upward pressure on long-term interest rates that means consumer prices are
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.440]  going to go up because the Chinese have been helping to keep our inflation in
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.560]  check by absorbing it fall for us they've been taking the bullets for us but
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.080]  what the Chinese are now saying to anybody who's smart enough to listen is
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.840]  they're not going to do that anymore we are on our own when the dollar starts to
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:02.840]  fall we're not going to count on China to provide that cushion like it did
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.560]  before which means we're going to have to deal with the impact of a week dollar
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.800]  with higher domestic consumer prices and higher long-term interest rates and
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.240]  this could be the beginning this is like the first shot that nobody's heard
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.720]  around the world that ends this currency war and the United States ends up
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.080]  being the loser and we have a real dollar crisis and then we might actually end up
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.200]  with that hyperinflation you know that the Keynesians that Paul Krugman's
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.400]  they're taking his premature victory elapsed they're saying all the people
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.440]  like Peter Schiff who are predicting inflation it didn't happen it's gonna
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:39.240]  happen it's just happening later and because they engineered this suckers
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.480]  rallying in the dollar the dollar is just going to crash from a higher
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.200]  precipice sure and the crisis is going to happen later but means it's going to
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.220]  be that much worse because we've exacerbated all the problems by
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:57.480]  delaying the consequences now again you've been very successful predicting
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.240]  markets that's how you've made billions of dollars for your clients I'm just a
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:05.920]  layperson that sits here and tries to study this and the basics and I have
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:11.080]  people on like Harry Dent then I have people on like you have you know a lot
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.200]  of other analysts on and they all generally agree we're going towards a
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.320]  bubble implosion a group of bubble implosions and that this currency war
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.560]  can't go on forever and QE can't go on forever but he thinks that they're
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.880]  printing all the money and issuing the money to cover up the deflation I get
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.480]  we've had some deflation but at a certain point why my republic Zimbabwe
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:38.000]  hundreds of other Mexico there's a devaluation that comes home and then the
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.280]  the the value of the money is lost in every case in history so I don't
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:51.560]  understand how then we're not going to see faster inflation explain to me the
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.240]  two different schools of thought because both ways are bad and then tell us do
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.600]  you think things are deteriorating faster is the moment of reckoning about
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.080]  to be here well again we are going to see more inflation we're already seeing it
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.840]  in in ways that are not being measured or called inflation you got a bubble in
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.680]  the stock market you got a bubble in real estate market you've got bubbles
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:19.640]  going on and in rare cars or fine art prices are rising all around us yet
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.840]  it's not considered inflation if it's an asset price that's going up but it's
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:28.640]  still inflation that's driving the increase in those prices also
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.140]  rents are rising very sharply for some reason that doesn't get captured in the
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:37.640]  CPI we know college tuition is rising we know health care costs are rising
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.840]  insurance rates are rising taxes are rising we know the price of food is
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.680]  going up all sorts of prices are rising yet for some reason it doesn't show up
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.840]  in the government calculated numbers I mean I think that's very convenient but
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.200]  I don't think it's honest and I think that anybody that wants to hang their hat
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:58.320]  on these government-created numbers as proof there's no inflation you know you
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.280]  have to realize the government has a significant interest in under inflation
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:08.640]  and well they admit I mean they admit they cook the unemployment numbers the
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.840]  inflation numbers I mean all of it they admit it's cooked yeah and the
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.800]  unemployment numbers you know the official rate means nothing when you
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.080]  have a collapse in the labor force we have the lowest labor force
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.280]  participation since 1976 we have the lowest homeowner home ownership rate
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:29.320]  since 1967 people are dropping out in droves people who are working part-time
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.920]  they want to work full-time but those jobs don't exist anymore yet they're
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.560]  still counted as being employed just because they have a lousy part-time job
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.680]  but these numbers don't sell the whole story the fact that guys like Bernie
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.040]  Sanders and Donald Trump are getting the most crowds that tells you the real
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:50.240]  story the people are fed up they are not living in a fantasy recovery created
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.480]  by the media sure by street they're living in the reality of this Obama
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:59.680]  recession so what happens as the fantasy fog lifts won't that just accelerate
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:06.080]  the decline a b if we are going into a major correction what do you expect it
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.240]  to look like what could the next shoe to drop be but the only thing holding it
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.000]  together is the is the false belief that the Fed has finished printing money
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.680]  that QE is over that the Fed is gonna raise rates that it's mission
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.960]  accomplished right that everything is fine right well you know it wasn't
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.920]  mission accomplished for the war on terror just because George Bush was on
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.280]  an aircraft carrier you know declaring that mission was accomplished well it's
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.280]  not accomplished for the Fed right they have only just begun to print this is a
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:39.440]  pause QE is not over QE 4 QE 5 the Fed is just getting started the balance sheet
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.040]  is not going to shrink it is going to explode out of control it's four and a
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.400]  half trillion now it's not going down it's going up towards 10 trillion it's
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:52.120]  going higher is as soon as people get their arms around that reality then it's
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.600]  going to be like a watershed right it's gonna go like opening up a dam and the
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.400]  dollar is going to tumble and that is going to be a game changer and China has
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:04.080]  already said we're gonna get out of the way we're not gonna get drowned in that
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.880]  deluge we are gonna let our currency go off you're not gonna sink with the
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.760]  American title well it has sent their stock market back up now for the best in
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.760]  two months since they did this but I mean isn't it overvalued it's doubled in
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.880]  the last few years and and what do you expect to see happen in China how will
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:24.000]  that affect us the Chinese market is pretty inexpensive I mean take a look at
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.200]  it I mean the Chinese market is still a lot lower than it was in 2007 I mean look
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.800]  at the Nasdaq you want to see something expensive look over there you know
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:36.120]  people are exaggerating the decline in the Chinese stock market China's stock
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.840]  market is positive on the year the US market is down this year China had a
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.960]  big drop only because it had a huge rally right before there was a spike in
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.360]  volatility in the Chinese market that's all there wasn't a market crash there and
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.440]  I don't think there's gonna be a market crash there I actually don't even think
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.000]  there's gonna be a market crash in the United States there should be and if the
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.200]  Fed did the right thing there would be but they're not gonna do the right thing
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.160]  they're gonna print a lot of money okay so what's the time frame in your mind
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:06.200]  then look something's gonna happen by next year because everybody expects to
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:10.000]  Fed to raise rates this year and if they do if they come forward with a
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.720]  meaningless quarter-point rate hike that's not gonna be enough to prop up the
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:18.880]  dollar the Fed is gonna have to do more but I think a quarter of a point is too
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:25.480]  much for this fragile economy look at the first half GDP it was 1.45% Atlanta Fed
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:32.600]  GDP now this week they lowered their forecast for Q3 to 0.7 a year ago
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:37.160]  economy grew 5% the first quarter Peter shift stay there I want to come back and
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.120]  and walk through this because again I'm not an economist like you or a money
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.360]  manager but it just seems crazy they're now saying don't raise interest rates
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:50.960]  because of China so damn we do damn we don't we're on the March the Empire's on

[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.960]  amendment rights when you fill out the IRS forms they also went after a federal
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:11.080]  a Treasury officer armed officer of the IRS of course that we've had on as a
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:18.280]  frequent guest on this show Joe Bannister and twice he had jury trials
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.800]  and they didn't put him in prison because he had juries and this was
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:29.400]  forgiving speeches saying the IRS is a fraud that's like arresting you for
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:33.960]  saying Planned Parenthood sells body parts and you know those what was it
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:40.600]  12 different IRS agents that were in full-page ads in USA today of the 12
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:50.320]  9 are in prison 9 so the IRS is the Gestapo in this country the IRS is like
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:57.400]  the KGB or the NKVD the internal police that politically the commas ours that
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:01.440]  go after people and it's shameful he should be abolished he's be gotten rid
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.160]  of and Rand Paul of course has called for that we need to see that as well
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:13.720]  from folks like Donald Trump it can selectively destroy whoever you want
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.920]  fortune money they've all done it 30 different tax preparers 50 different
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:23.320]  tax preparers Wall Street Journal a few years ago had a hundred and they gave
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.920]  a hundred different answers 30 different answers 50 different answers you
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.560]  cannot pay it correctly it's designed to screw you over it's designed to put you
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:38.600]  in prison and now we have the emails we know they're targeting libertarian
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:45.120]  conservatives and I was asking him how cuz I've never had Peter Schiff who's
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.960]  separate from his dad author researcher manages billions at Euro PAC comm I
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.400]  never really bring up his dad I brought it up a few weeks ago four weeks ago when
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.440]  he was on he said yeah dad's in prison got you know all these years left for
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.640]  publishing this book he was ordered not to force saying the IRS is a fraud that's
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:07.160]  how scared they are and I was asking him again how's your dad and he said well I
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.880]  I don't know if I should make this announcement it's not public yet but the
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:18.720]  family would like to get a chance to see him before and now I'll let Peter Schiff
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:26.720]  talk about this on air it's some really sad news for this political prisoner who
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:31.600]  I knew so well Peter tell us about your dad what's happened yeah well he is you
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:36.160]  know a political prisoner he's not even kind of a pseudo political prisoner he's
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:40.520]  he's the real deal here in the United States because he is in jail for his
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.560]  political beliefs he's not in jail for breaking any laws and you know you
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:49.920]  mentioned you know the tax code his real issue has always been that the
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.400]  Internal Revenue Code the laws were written voluntarily you hear it's based
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.280]  on voluntary compliance well that means you're not required to pay and the
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.800]  reason that all the laws were written voluntarily is because otherwise they
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:06.040]  would have violated numerous provisions of the Constitution the Constitution is
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:11.920]  really inconsistent with a a mandatory direct tax on your income sure they get
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.360]  you to opt in to a corporate contract then that's how they come after you it's
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.480]  not really a corporate contract I mean the laws were written voluntarily if
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.520]  you just ask the IRS is the is the internal is the tax system based on
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.800]  voluntary compliance or compulsory compliance I'll tell you it's voluntary
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.880]  and then you'll say well but I don't want to volunteer so well you have to
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.400]  volunteer well but then it's compulsory no it's voluntary you know and the
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.200]  reason that they want it to be voluntary is because it was illegal right you
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:41.440]  can you can lie on your tax return you can do whatever you wanted on it and
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.880]  they couldn't use it against you because of the Fifth Amendment but also you know
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:52.800]  there's all sorts of violations of the Constitution in the in the income tax I'm
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.800]  just trying to I keep I forgot that I had this program up and I'm getting I'm
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.360]  getting phone calls I haven't do not disturb yes so there's all sorts of
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:07.520]  ways that a compulsory income tax would violate the law you know the income tax
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.920]  is based on self-assessment you're supposed to assess yourself and if you
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.920]  don't do that there's no legal authority for the government to do it so that
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.960]  there's a lot of legal argue sure they get you to waive your force and Fifth
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:21.080]  Amendment on its face yeah and of course the taxing provisions of the
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:25.280]  Constitution that were not changed by the 16th Amendment you know Congress if
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:28.520]  they want to lay it leveled a direct tax on income they still have to
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:32.680]  apportion it the 16th Amendment didn't change that the 16th Amendment just said
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:35.000]  well you know if you don't want to apportion the income tax and you have
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  to levy it as an excise tax but the government's not doing that I mean the
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.560]  government is violating numerous Supreme Court decisions in the way it it
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.640]  enforces the income tax and you know my father just tries to point all these
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.400]  things out but of course you know the courts are routinely rubber stamping
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:53.120]  government action that violates the Constitution I mean there's really you
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.760]  know as far as the government is concerned there's nothing or rather as
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.400]  far as the courts are concerned there's nothing that the government can't do the
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.960]  government is in no way inhibited or restrained by the Constitution the
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.040]  government has unlimited power and you know that's one of the things that my
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:11.600]  father still never really understood or accepted because even though he's been in
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.600]  jail for 10 years he continues to fight thinking that he's gonna get out thinking
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.480]  he's gonna get justice in a justice system that has no justice and you know
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.240]  which gets me to the the news that we want to talk about is that my father who
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:30.400]  is 87 and who has been in jail for 10 years was just diagnosed with terminal
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.680]  lung cancer and you know initially told me the prison doctor said he had maybe
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.760]  four to six months to live but then I'm not really sure I try to talk he may
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.040]  have longer than that I don't know maybe he has a year it's hard to say you know
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:49.240]  they did have a cancer specialist that that talked to him but you know he's
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:53.680]  still in jail and he still has another year and a half or two to go and so in
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.280]  theory he won't survive the rest of his sentence and so is he would have an
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:03.320]  amount amounts to you know a life sentence for a nonviolent a tax crime
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:08.360]  and you know but we are still trying to get him out on a compassionate release
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.280]  the crazy part about it is my father doesn't even want to get out yet on
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.400]  compassionate release he still wants to get out on the merits of his legal
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:21.440]  arguments but I think we've been able to persuade him to you know to allow the
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:24.680]  compassionate release process but you know who knows how long this thing is
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:29.080]  going to take the whole prison system is so inefficient you know well it's very
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:32.060]  sad to me because I probably had dinner with your dad when he would come to
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.120]  Austin to give speeches and a few events I spoke at in Dallas and once in
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.960]  Vegas probably had dinner with him ten times and man the stories he tells and
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:46.480]  the story I mean he is like a real Archie Bunker type guy real Americana and
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.720]  and it's just it's so sad to hear all the persecution he's gone through but they
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.680]  hated his guts because he was traveling the whole US speaking to crowds of
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:58.760]  thousands he was on the radio he was selling books by the tens of thousands
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.440]  a month I mean he was really giving him a problem and they threw his butt in
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:07.000]  jail and now I guess they hope to see him die there yeah they wanted to make an
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.560]  example of it they wanted people they don't fight the IRS so you'll end up
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.720]  like Irwin Schick right you'll end up in jail and that's the whole purpose of a
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.000]  political prisoner you're trying to send a message I mean you're clearly my
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.600]  father is not a criminal the most you can say about my father is that he's
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.240]  mistaken but we don't put people in jail for having good faith beliefs that
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:30.480]  that turn out to be wrong but he's clearly right though yeah well you know I
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:34.800]  think he's right about a lot of things but I know there's no nobody can argue
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.760]  that my father is insincere that he's some kind of con man that he doesn't
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.120]  believe what he says of course he believes what he says there's no there's no
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.880]  doubt about remember the judge said do not publish the book anymore you can
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:50.720]  walk away right now he could have put another book out he said no and started
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.320]  putting the book back out yeah well they actually banned this they banned him
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.640]  from selling his book and I think it's the only a time that's happened since
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.440]  Lolita but they didn't ban the book itself of course the book is the federal
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:05.120]  mafia they just banned they just banned my father from selling it but you know
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.600]  here's another interesting angle to talk about you know because I when I talk
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:14.440]  to his caseworker because I'm trying to get him released into my care and one
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:18.160]  of the things would happen is if you know if he ends up getting out of jail
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.280]  I'm able to live with my house I have to make sure that I get rid of all my guns
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:26.440]  that I'm not allowed to have any guns in the house if you have an you know an
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.160]  ex felon which is so ridiculous that I have to surrender my second amendment
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.360]  rights in order to care for my sick father I mean the reality of it is my
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:38.640]  father is practically blind you know and all my guns are locked up in states
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.120]  even if I gave my father the combinations he still couldn't open
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.560]  you know I don't even think I don't even think he could load the gun let alone
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.600]  shoot it and yet just because he's a tax offender he can't be in the house if
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.080]  anybody has a firearm for self-defense so I have to disarm myself in order to
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.320]  take care of my father I mean that's just another you know violation of you
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:02.200]  know the second then but then you know everything the government does violate
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.120]  their constitutional rights so you know why should they why should they stop
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:09.440]  there well he's in the federal prison there in Dallas folks need to contact the
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:14.320]  federal Bureau of Presidents and just say release the political prisoner
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.600]  Erwin Schiff and I would do it nicely but I would say look he's got terminal
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:24.520]  lung cancer normally they they released nonviolent quote offenders when they
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:28.760]  have something terminal because it's a drain on the system this is ridiculous
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:34.680]  he's been in there ten years for selling a book that says the IRS is a fraud
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:38.280]  that's like going to jail for saying Hillary Clinton's a witch I mean it's
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:42.920]  just a prima facie fact and now with all this IRS news of them persecuting
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:49.080]  everyone it just really is a cherry on top of how evil this government is who
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:53.120]  are these people man I would feel like I mean I feel like I do something bad it's
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.600]  gonna come back on me I wasn't taught that I just feel that I can't screw over
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.560]  good people and I wonder how the government I wonder how that judge
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:05.000]  sits around knowing that they put some guy in jail for ten plus years and he
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.440]  may die there for putting out a book I mean it's just ridiculous well I mean
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.560]  obviously it's more than just a book I mean that they're gonna say well you
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.560]  know he was advocating nonpayment of taxes he was helping people what my
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:20.560]  father was trying to do is educate people as he understood the law and he
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:23.520]  encouraged people to make their own decisions and I always remember when my
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.320]  dad gave seminars he would always encourage lawyers and accountants to show
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.000]  up if he ever talked to somebody about not paying taxes he would say look bring
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.080]  your accountant bring your lawyer he would always say it on my show he go I'm not telling
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:39.880]  to do this is what I do but here's the facts yeah and you know I sat around many
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.760]  people who have admitted to me you know I've seen the you know where lawyers and
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.400]  have said look you know your dad is technically right he's legally right but
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.200]  the government won't let him get away with it I mean that's an important thing
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:54.040]  when people were I've talked to judges who told me that okay yes technically
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:58.240]  your dad may be right but it doesn't matter well shouldn't the law matter are
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:02.400]  we a nation of law or we may well here's the bottom line your dad's the kind of
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:07.480]  guy that made America great he's willing to go to jail and stay there and won't
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.000]  recant for the truth I mean that's what we're missing in this country if more
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.640]  people were like your dad we wouldn't have to go to jail for the truth because
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:20.520]  we wouldn't allow this to happen yeah I know he's very rare in that sense look
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:25.200]  I don't do it I mean I pay taxes I pay a lot of taxes and and you know not
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.400]  because I believe I'm legally required to do it but they're the mafia they'll
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.840]  break your legs yeah yeah I mean you know I'm like a little I'm like the store
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.040]  owner that pays the protection money because I don't want to stand up to the
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.400]  mob well my dad stood up to the mob and you know he's been in jail for 10 years
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:42.480]  and you know that's the spirit that made this country look at our founding
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:46.320]  fathers I mean how easy would it have been for George Washington a very wealthy
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.640]  guy and all the other framers I mean they did not to stand up to King George
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.880]  they'd have to stand up to those principles they had good lives and they
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:59.480]  risked it all for for a concept for freedom for an idea right and most
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.840]  Americans you know we're not even involved in that but can you imagine
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:06.920]  today I mean would we have had any kind of revolution if the the type of
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.080]  Americans who are around today were around you know it's 1776 if America you
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:15.880]  know these we you know we still be ruled by the King by by England but you know
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.640]  who knows we might even be better off you know if you think the British did a
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.240]  pretty good job with Hong Kong so maybe they would have done a good job with us
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:28.600]  if we had stayed under the crown but you know what what Americans are willing to
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:34.040]  accept today the type of taxation the type of regulation is off the charts
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:37.240]  compared to the tiny little bit of government that Americans were
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:41.840]  protesting from from King George right you're absolutely right Peter shifts our
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.560]  guest you're all packed calm we're going to get the specifics up the next day or
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.680]  so I'll probably launch it Monday because Friday's a bad day to do it we're
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:53.600]  going to take the video from this live radio TV show put out a call to arms
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.840]  politically Monday with an article with the addresses for folks to just say
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:04.760]  have some basic decency and you know let this guy out they let the average
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.280]  murderer out of state prison within four years federal within 10 those are
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.640]  national numbers your dad's been in over 10 years for his political speech and do
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.720]  they really want to make him a martyr where he dies I mean it'd be better for
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.920]  him to get out see his grandkids spend some time with you right Peter well
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:24.680]  absolutely and the thing with the government they don't care if they let
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:28.000]  a murderer out because what's the worst thing he can do murder some people they
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.840]  don't care about that but a tax protester that really scares them because he gets
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:37.520]  out he educates people he shines a spotlight on the illegal actions of
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.680]  government and the government is afraid of that the government wants to keep my
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:45.520]  father in jail to keep him quiet right let's be fair he said he's not gonna
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:50.720]  shut up I mean he stands by what he stands by yeah I mean look he's still
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:54.600]  there in jail fighting this fight you know he still hasn't willing to concede
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.760]  that he's lost even though he spent the last 10 years of his life in jail and
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.960]  you know ultimately in the long run he has his books out there I think he'll
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:07.000]  be vindicated you know in in the things that he stood up for but it might not
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.800]  be in his lifetime but it may be maybe in my children's lifetime well America
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.160]  freedom to fascism really scared him to Aaron Russo there's so many good
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:19.600]  congressman Hanson fought the IRS they put him in jail and tortured him I mean
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.080]  folks these are real heroes for this Republic that have stood up against his
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.320]  organization they come after you they try to take everything Aaron Russo had
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:33.240]  when he put that film out and he suddenly died of cancer I mean they mean

[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:32.360]  will throw you in prison for saying that and again they want to intimidate and
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:36.440]  shut everybody up but I'm telling you it's going too far are we got about six
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.960]  minutes left in this segment I'm gonna cover news clips special reports and your
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:45.280]  phone calls next hour and what would war with Russia be like the Pentagon's been
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.960]  wargaming it jab bushes back out promoting torture for the very groups
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:56.160]  the West is funding just absolutely ridiculous but finishing up with our
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:01.400]  guest from Euro PAC dot com Peter Schiff Peter getting back into China the
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:06.640]  economy what's happening I mean do you think it's gonna degenerate quicker as
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.560]  a lot of people are saying or you're saying it's next year what's the next
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:14.760]  shoe to drop for you that you're watching okay the only shoe I think is
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:19.160]  gonna be the realization that the Fed is not finished with quantitative easing
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:24.960]  and that the U.S. recovery isn't real that we're back in recession in fact all
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.760]  of the economic problems that created the great recession still exist in fact
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:36.360]  they've been exacerbated by the very cure that the Fed chose to try to kill
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:41.600]  us right the the cheap money quantitative easing 0% interest rates it
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.960]  was the Fed's manipulation of money supply and interest rates that inflated
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:49.720]  the bubbles you know sure they had help from Congress but I think the chief
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:54.480]  enabler is the Federal Reserve and they've done a lot of damage and I think
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.760]  when people come to terms with this reality it's going to be a huge game
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:03.160]  changer I think the bottom is gonna drop out of the dollar in a very big way I
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:07.760]  think you're gonna see a spectacular reversal in gold prices silver prices
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:11.400]  commodity prices when people realize that you know we are just gonna print and
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:15.680]  print and print the Fed is just getting started the helicopters are still in the
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:20.040]  hangars they're getting warmed up this is gonna be you know more money printing
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:24.480]  and this is not gonna end well this is not the happy picture the smiley face
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:28.520]  that Janet Yellen is putting on this or all the Wall Street economists and
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.160]  there's not a lot of time you know people have been riding his bubble on the
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.480]  dollar the U.S. stock market made new highs people need to act now you know
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.400]  people need to open up accounts you know and with me at Europe Pacific's capital
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.560]  so that they can get their money out of U.S. assets get out of dodge before the
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.960]  bullets start flying you got to get into foreign stocks in the right stocks I
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:53.360]  mean there are certain countries Switzerland Singapore New Zealand in
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:57.400]  Hong Kong they're places that you should invest to escape the carnage and you
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:01.160]  got to get out of U.S. currency you got to pick the best foreign currencies you
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.520]  got to own real money you got to own gold silver you got to look at the
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:08.000]  opportunity in the mining shares that have been beaten down because people
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.640]  have no idea what's going on the people who have been selling gold selling gold
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:15.920]  stocks these are the same guys in the subprime morning the elites the elites
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:19.520]  are hoarding and buying gold that's admitted and gold's gone back up a
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.680]  little bit I just don't see there's got to be within an inflationary system even
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.840]  if we're in a depression gold's got to go up we know in the great depression
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:31.960]  towards the end it did go way back up yeah look again people have confidence
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:34.840]  in the central bankers they have confidence in Yellen just the way they
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:39.120]  had confidence in that on Greenspan in the 1990s and that was a disaster that
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:42.360]  was false confidence and it's the same people that have bought into the same
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:46.560]  you know monetary magic they've been fooled again by the sly the hand of the
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:50.640]  Fed and they have no idea what's right around the corner if they if they were
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:54.360]  surprised by the financial crisis they ain't seen nothing yet because this
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.160]  next crisis is going to be much worse but it's also going to be much different
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:01.200]  because it's not going to be a credit crisis it's going to be a currency
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:04.600]  crisis it's going to be a crisis in the U.S. dollar right you don't have to worry
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:08.600]  about the yuan going down it's the dollar going down we are going to win
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:13.200]  this currency war which means every American who is not prepared will lose
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.680]  and they just hope those dollars don't come back and they can hide it and maybe
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:22.880]  lower oil prices to cover that but it's certainly a balancing act we're we've
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:26.240]  all got front row seats to it Peter chef thanks for joining us we'll talk to you

[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:11.640]  just know we're sitting on top the biggest bubble the world has ever seen
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:22.200]  real estate currencies debt derivatives and elites are building armored
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:28.480]  redoubts and gearing up for martial law and and there's huge military actions
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:37.440]  taking place is it all for naught and in many areas of the world are in
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.080]  depression I want to talk about this subject with listeners you can call on
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:45.960]  about anything you want but I'd like you to also give me your take on do you
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:50.120]  think the global collapse is coming what do you think it's gonna look like it's
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:58.080]  already really bad a lot of parts of the world or just can this keep rolling on
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.440]  forever what do you think all the preparations are for classified Pentagon
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:07.160]  exercise revealed us would struggle the one war with Russia it would take
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:11.480]  everything we had all Joseph Watson article info wars.com the Pentagon has
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:14.600]  been running a series of exercises throughout the summer based on the
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:18.520]  hypothetical ground war with Russia which reveals the US would struggle to
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.840]  defeat Moscow their Navy's not good but they got missiles they got tanks and
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:28.960]  they got nukes two defense officials who refuse to be named today told the
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:33.200]  Daily Beast that Washington is not ready for a sustained conflict could we
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.800]  probably beat the Russians today in a sustained battle sure they'll take
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.280]  everything we had one official says the fish official said what we are saying
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:48.200]  is that we are not ready as we want to be but if nuclear weapons get used none
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:52.880]  of it matters and there's a good chance they would so stop looking and having
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:58.320]  this war stop trying to topple the Russian government if our government
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:01.760]  had the moral high ground and what a bunch of criminals I would still say if
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.240]  the Russians aren't invading other countries aren't trying to take over
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:11.640]  don't mess with them you just as common sense historically that's criminal but
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:16.040]  we have a disgusting government trying to turn the Middle East over to al-Qaeda
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:24.640]  and the Saudi Arabians so there's just no moral high ground anywhere here the
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:28.240]  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have depleted the US Army's ability to
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:33.440]  maintain a sufficient troop presence the exercises revealed there would also be
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:37.640]  little time to sufficiently train airmen for the conflict against an
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.440]  adversary like Russia this is a quote we can't take the kind of air dominance
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:46.080]  we've had in conflicts it's time level for granted yeah you're not even in
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:50.480]  position like you were in Iraq or Afghanistan this is the Russians and
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:57.120]  yes they have a rotting Navy and let's bring Joe Jennings and if he's there at
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:02.160]  his desk because he brought up the fact why don't we just have Putin and Obama
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.280]  get in a boxing ring and fight like they did in old times of our two champions
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:11.200]  instead of us having nuclear war and killing the planet you want to add
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:15.960]  anything else Joe yeah I think that it solved two problems you know that's a
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:20.400]  race for we could we could solve the race war problem right there I guess you
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  could say the Russians are behind the African slave trade sure I mean Putin
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.680]  is white it's his fault it's his fault who do you think would win in a fight
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:37.120]  between Obama and put oh come on Obama's a smoker Putin's bear Russian bear
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:41.360]  really I love to see that fight I don't know I mean Obama grew up Chicago he's
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.680]  probably pretty tough they're probably poking him in the eye I think you could
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:51.280]  take out the KGB agent you know I don't know old putty put now put putty put does
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:55.920]  you get to all day in the martial arts I think he would probably dispatch old
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:00.560]  obozo pretty quick but they're both puppets in the day Drudge and Fox News
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:04.880]  could be censored under new federal rules experts warned article by
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:09.520]  Washington Examiner a Washington DC appeals court is set to hear arguments
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:14.280]  later this year on new net neutrality rules which critics say could lead to
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:18.880]  government regulators censoring websites such as the Drudge report and Fox

[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:46.560]  suggested implanting tracker chips in Finland's welfare recipients to
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:50.920]  prevent them from joining the Islamic State he said some welfare recipients

[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:22.040]  music one of my favorite B movies escape from New York another amazing classic
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:29.360]  from the great director you know speaking of escape from New York since you
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:33.920]  guys came in with this intro that ties in let's let's pull up in a minute the
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:37.880]  trailer you can find on YouTube from escape from New York this that came out
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:41.600]  in the early 1980s where you got a shadow government black helicopters
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:45.560]  New York's been turned into a giant prison colony which is something the
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.800]  French and others have done with islands before and the president gets
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:55.120]  brought down by a terrorist in the middle of New York City if you haven't
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.720]  seen the John Carpenter classic and they put exploding microchips in the
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:04.320]  arteries of snake plisken a special ops guy and sending men we were just
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:12.480]  talking about having Obama and Putin in a ring of them both baseball bats with
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:17.560]  nails in them instead of you know it's having nuclear war how about they get in
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:24.000]  a ring I mean back in the old days when they'd have wars in Spain between the
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.720]  different Christians they wouldn't have wars most the time between one city
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.080]  state and another they would just have their champions fight and back then it
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:37.440]  was usually the king or his son like you didn't get to be a king a thousand
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:42.800]  years ago in Spain or in England unless you didn't lead the trips and so I can
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.120]  see back then you admired the king is it be like your war champion you know the
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:51.520]  toughest smartest guy around nowadays we have these globalist slime bags you
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.280]  know that get advice from Gruber about how to lie to everybody oh what great
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:01.880]  leaders you are so I'm told we already have it that was quick good job so why
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:05.640]  not before I go to your phone calls play the trailer for escape from New York I
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.360]  think this is the answer how about escape from the New World Order and then
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:12.520]  we're gonna cover the news I haven't yet I've already mentioned some of it and
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:16.680]  take your phone calls on the world financial collapse that I think it's
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:21.160]  pretty clear is starting to unravel is it this fall this winter next year I
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:25.640]  don't know but it's getting closer and the elites are bunkering and digging in
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:30.920]  what do you think's going on 800 it's a free-for-all everybody can call in
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:42.080]  800 259 92 31 800 2599 231 your calls are coming up in the next segment but
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:47.160]  without further ado a skate from New York
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:59.160]  New York 1997 the entire city is a walled maximum security prison the
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:01.960]  bridges of mine
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:08.520]  the rivers are patrolled I'll do this with Chicago in New York and the United
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:12.320]  States police force has everything under control you know the United States
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.520]  police force you don't have it
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:24.560]  cameras everywhere
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:30.000]  communist taking over it's actually happening now in 2015 the president's
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:43.200]  the commie leader took number one I'm going in
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:50.240]  I love going I think I'm gonna sneak it's more stuff from New York the high
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:12:01.840]  adventure of the future one man must go in where no man has ever gotten out and
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:04.880]  if he comes back alone
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:16.160]  nightmare has just begun were you John Carpenter's escape from New York
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:22.240]  this stuff is like gold around here you know
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:43.560]  that's a great man I think I'm gonna watch that tonight escape from New York
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.760]  the greatest escape of them all is about to blow the future apart stay from
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:54.560]  LA's horrible she did LA to fall off in the ocean but it's not funny it might
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:13:02.760]  actually do it it culturally is already falling off in the ocean 800 2599 231
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:08.200]  here's the deal as stuff unravels which the elite is orchestrating as they want
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:12.680]  a post-industrial world as they kill NASA kill developments kill technological
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:17.240]  developments that they don't control I'm gonna be in the rear with the gear out
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.200]  in the countryside I'm doing my best to try to stop all this from unfolding but
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:27.640]  there is no enemy to even attack in a civil war they're gonna try to brand it
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:31.880]  as if you go shoot cops or shoot the military you're winning that's the plan
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.800]  is to chew up the police and military during a martial law crackdown to then
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:40.800]  after a year of the lights being off or more bringing in the UN forces and
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.960]  that's not out of movies folks that's out of the admissions in fact I ought to
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.840]  pull all that up I've talked about it we got the documents and actually show
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:52.760]  that because I've seen it in the Washington Post we're like during
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:57.120]  emergencies they will bring in foreign troops to stabilize the United States
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:03.360]  you want to know how they're gonna handle states that rebel governors that
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:07.280]  don't go along with others gonna turn the power off because all the microchips
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:12.360]  and these power plants and these grids the globalist have the codes to you see
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:16.160]  that's what smart growth is that's what the smart cities are the the smart
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:24.680]  trends the smart appliances is all maximum overdrive for real but it's not
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:33.480]  Skynet being run by machines as I always said it's Skynet run by the humans
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:37.320]  using the machines against the rest of humans which in the last term and they're
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:41.880]  not the latest one I haven't seen that but the last one they actually got
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:45.280]  produced by guys hooked in with the Bilderberg group I'll just leave it at
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:54.120]  that it's a human brain at the core of Skynet running the operation and that's
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:58.160]  basically what we're dealing with here in their freaked out minds you're like
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:01.760]  why would they want to do that because they believe that's how they're gonna
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:05.600]  live forever and before you think oh that's fantastical that's not gonna
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:14.080]  happen remember biometrics was invented in the 1850s eugenics all of it by a
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.240]  British Royal Commission that funded a bunch of scientists to come up with a
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:26.440]  plan for social control for the Transylvanian royalty that rules Britannia
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:32.680]  now that's more freaked out than a movie isn't it Vlad the Impalers great great
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:35.800]  great great great great great great great great great great great great
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.480]  great great great great great great great great great great great great great
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:44.240]  great grandchildren they it's like 20 generations down over that thousand
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:51.600]  years or so to these people and then their plan has actually worked and they've
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:55.840]  now got almost planetary government and think they're gonna merge with machines
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:03.040]  and who knows the machines might double cross them I mean it's so dangerous it's
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:10.480]  like the astronauts said we had on a few days ago we're in a little bitty blue
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:15.920]  lifeboat with 20,000 nuclear weapons more like 40,000 but he said 20 is he
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:21.480]  means operable this is crazy town but then the globalists created all of this
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:26.120]  proliferated the weapons and then want world government or they're gonna detonate
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:33.840]  them give them the power give them world government give them control or they'll
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.520]  have nuclear war and they've used our tax money to build the bunkers you know
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:42.560]  what let's just go to calls now and then I'll get to the news after that I've
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:45.320]  already covered a lot of it but there's some good news some bad news some crazy
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:54.000]  news some insane news healthcare.gov is giving illegal aliens the free
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.320]  health care nobody else gets it but if you they don't verify social security
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:05.040]  numbers citizenship status none of it I'm sorry I shouldn't laugh at all this is
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:11.040]  just so ridiculous let's go ahead and go to your phone calls Robert and Tennessee
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:17.720]  you're on the air thanks for calling in today yeah I'm having a trouble on your
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:22.560]  phone it may not be connected go ahead and try again I'm gonna have to put that
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:26.720]  caller on hold we may have a failure on his phone or failure at the network let's
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.880]  show it we'll put you on hold let's go to Andy in Tennessee Andy you're on the
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:37.640]  air hey Alex how you doing good go ahead hey listen a couple weeks ago you were
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:45.560]  talking about a thing I think of it as a movement called what your cause and this
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:50.320]  really struck me because as I listen to the show there are stuff there's such a
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:55.760]  plethora of topics and issues that we're dealing with and I hear you when
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:59.320]  callers call and they talk about you know they praise you and you're not into
[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:03.360]  that night you know I get that but you know we do all have the power the
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.400]  problem is is that with all of this inundation of trouble it's hard to nail
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:16.400]  down what exactly our cause is and when we're able to figure that out how to
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:21.960]  pursue that cause and rise up in that cause no I hear you so so I'll let you
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:27.600]  continue but let me just throw this out I highlight the solutions in my view get
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:31.120]  rid of Boehner put a patriot in the speakership expose the private
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:36.000]  fellow reserve abolish the IRS get us out of the United Nations stop starting
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.120]  wars with foreign countries stop funding radical Islamists control our
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:44.720]  border stop advertising free welfare to all of the unskilled workers of the
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:50.200]  world you go down the line and and and say no to the globalist agenda you cut
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:56.680]  off the blood supply to the new world order absolutely but this is this is the
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:19:03.280]  thing though is with all of these topics any one of us can latch on to one and
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:10.360]  then reach out to other people who have taken that on as their cause and then
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:19.560]  grow that cause to be a force within this battle against the globalist and but
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:23.840]  but it's difficult to do that because we it's hard to say where to start and if
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:28.720]  there were a place and I use your your YouTube site as an example on your
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:36.160]  YouTube channel you have it broken down by by topic basically and if we were
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:43.520]  able to have a clearing out where we can explore each thing and then find the one
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:48.400]  that really targets us that really is on your I agree we should have a specific
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:51.600]  video on the Federal Reserve a specific video on genetic engineering and a
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:54.440]  specific video and that's all great ideas I'm gonna come back and let you
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:59.440]  finish your point on solutions then we'll go to Frank Gerald Carl Frank and

[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:20.920]  what is it you think we can do better because there's a hundred things a
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:26.080]  thousand things I could do better info wars though is not the rise and fall of
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:29.920]  the Liberty Movement worldwide that is an individual hearts and minds everywhere
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:36.000]  we're just a focal point breaking down history trying to mobilize others to
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:41.080]  take action in their area and then there's no way that the bad actors can
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:45.120]  stop us that's what they want is decadent dumb down not believing we have
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:51.840]  power but you specifically you know have some ideas go ahead well thanks for
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:55.800]  bearing with me but I'm thinking in terms of I mean maybe even just on your
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:25:01.880]  website to keep it simple on your end if you had links that could direct people
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:08.520]  to movements that were specifically involved in say international finance or
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:15.000]  the pro-life movement or what have you and then it's out of your hand that goes
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  to the people you know I hear you I gotta jump Andy I gotta jump we have the
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.520]  links up to the group putting out the videos exposing Planned Parenthood
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:29.840]  anybody could just follow the video and link to them we have the pro-life groups
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:38.200]  on and plug their websites I mean we actually spoon feed all this when you
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:41.800]  get down into local groups I can't specifically say go to this group or
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:44.640]  that group cuz I don't have the human intelligence to say what's a group what's
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:48.080]  a bad group that's for you to suss out or for you to start as your own
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:53.280]  organization but I hear you we could do better we'll try Frank in New York you're
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:59.280]  on the air go ahead hey Alex how are you good brother go ahead very good thank
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:02.640]  you oh just let you know basically you're my morphias you actually woke me up
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:05.960]  so everything that's going on and everything that I know today all the
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:09.680]  knowledge that have occurred that I've actually known is because of you and
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:12.560]  just what I just want to say that I think that you part of my family every
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:16.200]  day well I'm honored I'm honored sir and it's a humbling job but I'm just an
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:20.640]  average person who woke up to this earlier than you did we were all in the
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:26.240]  matrix at one time and so I'm very honored sir thank you okay my question is
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:31.400]  this from the Pope from our world leaders from our bankers from all the
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:35.160]  people that are causing all these tragedies around the world basically they
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:40.440]  want their Messiah which the devil to come up and appear basically I don't
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:44.240]  want some religiously I'm a Catholic I don't trust the Pope I think the Pope's
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:49.240]  a pony in my opinion I just want to just tell those people out there they're
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:53.280]  non-believers the first time listeners to you that you should start waking up
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.560]  telling tell your friends and family what's going on even though they're
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:59.280]  probably laughing at you but unfortunately one day they're not
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:01.920]  gonna be laughing at you because everything's gonna turn out to be true
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:05.640]  hopefully that's not the case but the way things are going right now it's
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:10.400]  happening well sure Christ told us look out for wolves and sheep's clothing and
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:14.800]  again I mean I wouldn't criticize the Catholic Church before because for all
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:19.640]  its problems I saw mainstream media attacking it which is a sign that they
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:22.360]  didn't like it well that's because they were taking it over you could say
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:26.640]  whatever you wanted about different periods of the Catholic Church now it's
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:31.400]  promoting socialism and communism not fighting abortion pushing world
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:38.600]  government carbon taxes I mean Pope Francis is the most powerful globalist
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:45.400]  leader promoting the New World Order other than Obama right now and it's just
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:50.360]  sickening I mean I I watched like an hour-long video last night that was on
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:54.560]  info wars.com of an upset Catholic you know saying I want my church back out
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:58.280]  in LA at an event but I didn't really watch him so much he was like two
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:01.760]  thirds the way in and the media act like it was outrageous and he stood up
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:05.480]  started yelling it was like a communist meeting with them just organizing all
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:10.240]  the Catholics but listen I've got family that are Methodist and I've gone to
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:14.640]  their Methodist Church 15 years ago and five years ago and a year ago now you
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:18.400]  go there they got a husband and wife team up there they got rid of the old
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:22.920]  preacher it was anti-war and a pretty good classical liberal they've got
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:29.080]  people in there and I mean it is like hearing a Fidel Castro speech or
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:34.200]  something but then they mix into it a bunch of eugenics and Planned Parenthood
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:40.520]  and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation I mean it's the churches are Democratic
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:44.560]  Party run and they can be political as they want they're left alone if a
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:49.240]  conservative church says we shouldn't kill babies the IRS comes after them so
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:53.080]  there's a reign of intimidation and terror in this country so I'm not just
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:58.720]  picking on the Catholic Church but to have a pope behaving and acting like
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:04.280]  this you know we're in it we're entering the final phase you this is a big deal go
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:09.440]  ahead I work with all these trendies at work you know these college students and

[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:19.760]  know they think because they're educated they're probably established and I guess
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:23.680]  that sounds crazy that's saying that but basically these people are very damn
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:27.120]  ignorant and it's just so damn frustrating you talk about eugenics you

[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:34.200]  job they don't have health but they have the cult that they're part of the
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:37.040]  intellectual team and then we go out and interview them and they want to put
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:42.840]  gun owners in forced labor camps they are a cult of sniveling dangerous shallow

[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.600]  County they've done it again Sheriff compares constitutionalist remember
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:38.240]  they said last year they need the armored vehicles for the American people
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:41.800]  the kill fell and wrote this article I believe this is the type of story that
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:45.360]  should go viral doesn't mean drudge should link to it I just call it drudge
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:49.800]  worthy we'll get up on our Facebook and Twitter Sheriff compares constitutional
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:53.920]  list to ISIS there are some of these folks that want to overthrow the
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:35:00.560]  government period this is how ISIS starts so he's compared and we're gonna
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:04.560]  have that video they're grabbing it right now and we're going to be playing
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:10.280]  that here for you on air right now let's go to some more your phone calls and we
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:13.960]  will be going over that as soon as we're able to grab the video but that just
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:20.080]  broke mckelthaloninfowars.com then let's grab the Spokane video from last
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:23.520]  year where the SWAT team commander goes we need this armored vehicle there are
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:26.760]  a lot of gun owners and veterans and constitutionalist and we've got them in
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:30.240]  Indiana saying the same thing constitutionalist haven't done anything
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:37.400]  to anybody I mean maybe three cops a year on average I think four got killed in
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:43.160]  2013 three in 2014 and I think two cops so far have been killed by
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:47.200]  a constitutionalist where the media could link it to a group sovereign
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:52.680]  citizens I mean that's one of the lowest crime rates of any group out there
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:56.840]  and but if you watch MSNBC you believe there is just an epidemic of police
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:01.240]  being killed by right-wingers and it's total baloney but they keep saying it's
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:04.360]  going to happen and a lot of it is then it gets the police in this attitude of
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:10.240]  messing with constitutionalist and then you get a self-fulfilling prophecy
[02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:14.640]  wow so as soon as we get that video we'll be playing at the video is up on
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:21.280]  infowars.com shot video police prepare for war with gun owners and preppers so
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:25.600]  they've now doubled down on it again
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:32.880]  fact I'm in the article and in the announcement in an article featured the
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:40.240]  August 2015 edition of the Inlander the Washington State Sheriff draws
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.440]  comparison to ISIS terror group while railing against everyone from info wars
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:49.200]  Alex Jones to Washington State Representative Matthew Shea yeah we've
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:53.680]  got the photo of like six Washington State reps wearing you guys bring me one
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:37:00.640]  I wear it on one of my jackets one of the maiden 1776 pens because really
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:05.280]  anybody can wear an American flag we need folks to start wearing 1776 lapels
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:12.520]  our little Paul Revere Pell and and the cover is him standing on a map let's
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:19.240]  show that again for TV viewers of don't tread on me people standing on the snake
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:25.080]  Spokane is one of the most patriotic anti-New World Order awake areas in fact
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:31.200]  that's it I'm going to speak with George Norian a week in Toronto but I'm
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:36.120]  going to Spokane that's it this sheriff has done it I'm gonna pick a date today
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.800]  and always get busy and free I'm gonna pick a date and like the next month or
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:45.760]  so to go to Spokane and the broadcast live from there and I'm gonna go to the
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:49.080]  Sheriff's Department nicely and I'm gonna ask for interview with his Lordship
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:53.580]  and I'm gonna say man knock it off I don't know who's running you who's in
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:56.880]  control of you but you know they're trying to start a civil war with the
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:00.280]  Patriots and and by the way they're not just right wingers of Spokane they're
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:04.800]  like libertarians that know what's going on they're super awake it's one of the
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:12.280]  most conservative cities in the country in an island of just brainwashed lib
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:18.000]  tards is the word I call them tyranny tards because they're not liberal there
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.360]  are some of these folks that want to overthrow the government no no the
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:23.440]  government was overthrown by foreign globalist we want the government back they
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:28.640]  want to hit a reset button the sheriff said if they're willing to lie to get
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:37.400]  that reset button this is how ISIS starts lie oh I'm a liar now the inlander
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:41.120]  peace highlights the sheriff's ongoing campaign against local conservative
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:46.160]  grips who he feels are pushing dangerous rhetoric when asked to specifically
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:50.840]  name those responsible he named both representative shea and all those folks
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:56.000]  who created the video about the deputy the deputy yeah he says it's a lie the
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:01.480]  deputy says constitutionalist or why they have armored vehicles and we have
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:21.200]  that video here is that video so I'm thinking that it's totally appropriate
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  in iraq but we're what kind of a situation in the u.s I mean we've got a lot of
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:42.080]  constitutionalists a lot of people they have no weapons here locally oh my
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:46.080]  gosh and by the way then the sheriff said it was edited so they put out the
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:50.600]  full five-minute interview and he said even more worse stuff it's like the
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:53.960]  Planned Parenthood thing and we have police departments and sheriff's
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:40:02.280]  departments from New York to Indiana to Washington State to Colorado to Florida
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:12.560]  making the exact same statements this is amazing so this news is up on info
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:17.240]  wars.com artists rendition of the sheriff standing on a don't tread on me
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:23.560]  flag in August issue that just came out in fact we can click to enlarge that and
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:29.280]  put that on screen for TV viewers info wars.com radio listeners just go to
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.880]  info wars.com our prison planet.com I want that red-linked I mean what is
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:39.520]  wrong with this sheriff he can't be that stupid to fall into George Soros's
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:46.120]  hands they've spent on countless billions in the last few decades you get a
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:50.600]  civil war going between the gun owners and the police I mean number one that's
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.280]  traitorous number two most the cops they know are conservative or libertarian is
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:57.400]  bad as some of the police are folks they're more awake the general public
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:01.680]  I mean it's a fact they're not our enemy we need to reform the police from the
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:06.680]  feds who themselves are captured and so you got these little stars of the
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:10.840]  Southern Poverty Law Center which he admits he's advised by in the ADL
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:15.480]  criminal organizations in my view anti-American organizations clearly I
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:18.320]  mean the ADL's lost lawsuits they've been caught breaking into police
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:26.720]  departments to steal intelligence files in San Francisco they are so creepy and
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:32.600]  that's the ADL and I just don't know what to say anymore that he would be
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:36.840]  dumb enough to be part of this whole movement to start a fight with the
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:41.320]  Liberty Movement and the globalists are very close to staging terror attacks and
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:45.840]  blaming it on us that's very clear and this is their race in the hole that's
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:49.760]  why they keep saying I want to kill cops I support the boss in bombing blah blah
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:54.120]  blah just out of the blue the oath keepers are there threatening people
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:57.800]  with guns and they work for us they're not threatening anybody and they don't
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:01.920]  work for us either but we support what they're doing all these misrepresentations
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:09.000]  because I'll get up here and have an investigative journalist on about Jeb
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.320]  Bush connected to narcotics trafficking or Hillary Clinton connected to third
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:18.120]  world dictators and yeah I'm aggressive about it because I'm gonna risk my life
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:27.560]  I mean I'm angry I'm going in this is real people it's not a game having the
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:32.120]  Pope call for world government it's not a game all the different things they're
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:38.440]  doing to us fluoride the water on record is to brain damages and lower our
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:43.760]  fertility that enough is reason for revolution but it's not revolution
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:50.240]  criminals eugenicist high jack the country the window into it all is the
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.040]  baby parts a month ago they were saying that was fake video then they said it
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:43:02.320]  was edited then they said it wasn't true now they are defending the sales it's a
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:10.400]  lot worse than the baby parts and yeah I'm angry about it but as a man at a
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:18.160]  genetic cellular spiritual level I'm like the Tasmanian devil man I am ready
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:24.600]  to fight and I understand 90% of war is physical so I am savagely attacking
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:30.040]  them with the truth and notice this sheriff says we're liars I remember the
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:36.200]  articles we wrote about last year when all this broke and his video press
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:45.720]  release where he says info wars are liars buddy I'm a liar like I'm a Chinese
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:51.080]  jet pilot from Pluto I mean my problem is I can't control myself and I tell the
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:56.560]  truth sometimes when I should just keep my mouth shut I crave the truth I live
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:04.120]  the truth I want to be the truth I mean I'm so truthful that when you know
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:08.880]  girlfriends and stuff would ask me does this dress look good I tell you no or
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:16.360]  does this jet on the end of my nose look bad yeah it looks bad so what all I got
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.040]  is my integrity that's why they always attack it because they got my phones
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:23.800]  tapped my computers tapped they know all about me going back to high school they
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:28.160]  know how real I am how I went up against drug dealing cops when I was 16 years old
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:33.280]  15 years old they know I've always been involved I've been involved fighting
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:41.480]  tyranny since I was 14 years old before I even knew I was doing it I'm at a
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:48.160]  party with my buddy's older brother his older brother is getting drugs for
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:54.000]  cheerleaders I noticed it's a guy in a uniform driving off in the Corvette I
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:59.160]  say to his brother was that a cop just sold you that pot and that ecstasy I
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:03.480]  wouldn't spoken the pot or taking the ecstasy was for the cheerleaders and he
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:08.160]  said yeah keep your mouth shut I think I was like 12 or 13 then by the time I was
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:13.280]  14 I'd see cops that I knew were dealing drugs and I'd be like they'd pull over me
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:16.440]  and my buddy who was older driving with a six pack of beer under the seat and they
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:19.360]  go I'm gonna take it to jail for this and I'd say I saw you deal drugs a few
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:22.880]  years ago and the cop would just freak out and start hyperventilating and say
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:26.920]  you want me to kill you kid and I said man I don't know what you're doing but
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:34.840]  you're not gonna take me to jail for beer when you're a drug dealer 14 years
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:46.320]  old I understood that stuff and Texas monthly didn't believe me so they went
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:49.720]  investigated in Rockwall and found out the sheriff went to prison for cocaine
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:54.200]  importation and the police department had been implicated in drug rings hell
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:46:00.040]  they ran the prostitutes they ran the drugs all of it and I wasn't involved in
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:05.800]  it I lived in a wealthy golf course upper-middle-class neighborhood and I
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:13.360]  mean I just saw it for myself and I'm not talking about me anymore it's not
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:17.600]  about Alex Jones it's that I had these experiences and I'm not gonna be signed
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:21.760]  on to it aborting babies because if I go along with it I'm involved in it I'm
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:24.740]  not gonna go along with Dinecore grabbing five-year-olds and putting them on
[02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:30.040]  slave trains I'm not gonna be involved in it and let me tell you if I don't fight
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:34.600]  it I'm involved in it I mean I feel guilty that I'm not doing enough to fight
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:38.960]  it when I cover this stuff I feel like I've done it that's what I call God
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:46.040]  fearing I mean to explain how this feels I feel guilty for all this stuff I
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:55.560]  mean I've seen like white thugs black thugs Hispanic thugs you name it
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:00.200]  repeatedly in stores in my life or at a gas station smart off to some old man or
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:04.080]  some old lady and I probably shouldn't do it and when I have kids I don't I got
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:07.480]  it you know something else in the car to defend and I'll just say hey listen
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:10.400]  start a fight with somebody you think you can they'll start blowing up I'll go
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:15.080]  line up I'm gonna beat your ass right now you sons of bitches and I'm sorry to
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:18.520]  have to talk like that that's really you know what it is I know at those points
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:22.760]  I could wipe the floor with all those people and it's not because I'm the
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:27.280]  toughest guy around it's instinctive that I don't like punks and thugs running
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:35.080]  wild and and running rough shot on people that's a normal male response you
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:39.000]  want to shoot your mouth off to an old lady why don't you say it to me you
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.480]  punk and I don't like seeing cops that act like gang members either and that's
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.240]  what we have a problem with is men that didn't have fathers around who think
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:53.200]  acting like a thug and follow what gangsters taught them is what's tough
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:59.000]  that's not tough that's not manly that's cowardly that's weak that's pathetic a
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:03.800]  man will stand up to the three gang members no info you can get stabbed to
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:07.520]  death and tell them I'll stomp your brains in and let me tell you I've done
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:13.880]  it too and I'm not up here talking about how tough I am either there comes a
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:17.320]  point when you got to stand up against scum there comes a point when it doesn't
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:22.120]  matter what happens that you gotta stand up or you're no longer a human and we
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:26.560]  reached that point a long time ago so I don't give a you know what about the new
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:32.200]  world order or what they do to me or anybody else I've put my whole thing on
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:38.760]  the line my family my treasure my name all of it on the line 100% and when they
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:44.400]  bury me six feet under you can know for sure I'll never compromise I'll never
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:49.440]  sell out I'll never submit I'll never back down because it's not in me to do
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:53.760]  it and the reason we're in the position we are today is because other people
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:56.880]  don't have that attitude
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:00.000]  anyways
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.440]  excuse me
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:10.920]  this sheriff is either stupid or he is a globalist federal wannabe gangster and
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:16.000]  he makes me want to throw up that he's so dishonorable and I'm gonna go to

[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:30.920]  instead of sitting there talking trash about his constituents they need to vote

[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:06.680]  now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic
[02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:10.160]  pick pocketing ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:13.600]  eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:17.880]  with a built-in radio chip called RFID I felt having to broadcast my personal
[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:22.000]  information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:26.400]  credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes
[02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:30.760]  would all soon incorporate RFID it was then I formed ID Stronghold to share
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:34.480]  my inventions and blocking RFID signals with the world there are a lot of
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:38.720]  misconceptions out there today about RFID I encourage everyone to get informed and

[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:11.760]  all that just mimics what guys act like when they really get mad it's just I'm
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:15.560]  so tired of seeing the corruption and us being run over by tyranny and I think
[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:21.640]  about all the thugs and the liars and the scum and it and it makes me really
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:24.920]  really angry we'll do a little bit of overdrive to finish up with these calls
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:29.920]  there's a few other news items I need to hit some good news time magazine and
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:34.400]  others are reporting so is the LA Times that fish oil helps minimize
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:40.520]  disorders for those at risk of schizophrenia study finds yes so many
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:47.280]  neurological disorders are physical not genetic or quote mental like toxicity
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:53.480]  in the body heavy metal poisoning if you're say 20 years old you go in and
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:57.320]  you're seeing little green men they'll tell you you're schizophrenic and put
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:03.440]  you on medication they won't test your blood for for metal toxicity I mean they
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:07.600]  knew 30 years ago that if you take fish oil it massively decreases epilepsy and
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:12.840]  so there another study about how great fish oil is and it goes over it all the
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:20.320]  omega-3 fatty acids so important in supplements new research film that even
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:25.840]  people predispose for schizophrenia where it runs in family who took the
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:32.240]  supplement had massive positive effects I mean I know that I can be angry and
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:36.080]  upset at like seven eight at night when I got to keep working and was my dad a
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:40.080]  decade ago said son fish oil and I could take like four or five fish oil and I
[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:47.200]  get like high off of it like I had two beers I mean it really works what do you
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:50.080]  think brain force does we think super metal vitality does we think all these
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:57.040]  products are real it's natural compounds not drugs I need to probably take some
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:00.360]  fish oil in fact my ungevity fish oil from forest health is back during the
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:06.200]  cabinet somebody bring me some EFA's because it will it does act as a
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:12.920]  sedative as well and I apologize for getting that earlier it's believe me
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:19.840]  it's not an act I get exhausted after I do and I shouldn't do it it's just for
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:23.880]  this latest article with this stupid sheriffs I want to be this guy's enemy I
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:27.880]  know we're right we just don't want to destroy the country and bring in
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:38.480]  basically corporate fascism and so we're bad for no reason you have made
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:42.320]  yourself bad by doing that I want to go to something positive to this is these
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:47.360]  two sisters stumping for Trump stories up on info wars comm and drudge has it
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:51.640]  they're back Donald gives hope to black lives and whether Donald's good or not
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:54.800]  at least it's getting past black white at least they're getting into an
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:57:01.520]  American idea free market here it is hey y'all hey so I'm here just talking to

[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:11.960]  frustration yeah and I can feel your pain yeah but we can no longer take and
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:16.800]  parade the narrative black lives matter that's right in front of people when we
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:21.680]  don't feel like our own lives matter when we take it we burn down our
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:27.000]  neighborhood yeah when we take it we kill our brothers and sisters when we
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:31.160]  route from them yeah when we do destructive things what we're telling
[02:57:31.160 --> 02:57:35.840]  people is we don't care about our own life and sometimes that's why people can't
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:40.960]  care about us now what I want you all to do is to take and take that energy yeah
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:46.480]  and channel it behind someone that I know that care about all and that's Mr.
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:52.080]  Donald Trump he is working to bring jobs back to this country as a matter of
[02:57:52.080 --> 02:57:56.880]  fact you have jobs keeping their jobs over here companies keeping their jobs
[02:57:56.880 --> 02:58:02.400]  over here for people like us so that you can become employed and not only would

[03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:34.120]  ass in the ground I was on my stand up against little gang members picking on
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:39.040]  old ladies okay go ahead make your point yeah well I heard you making some
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:42.760]  disparaging remarks the other day and purring that he was one of the most
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:47.760]  disgusting people out there today who and you know who did you hear me talking
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:54.640]  about I just I'm gonna lay out a little bit where I'm coming from you know all
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:59.000]  this diversity stuff you know there the whole system is lined up against white
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:03.760]  straight traditional society I mean obviously that's that sheriff or that
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:08.840]  cop you answered the question yourself what's behind he wants to be on what he
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:14.760]  perceives at is the winning team just like all these evangelical preachers the
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:18.920]  Vatican the Catholic church they all want to be on the winning team we all know I
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:21.800]  agree it shows they're trying their takeover right now and I'm doing 30
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:27.480]  minutes overdrive she got plenty of time go ahead okay you know I think he's
[03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:32.520]  among the most eloquent voices of reason out there today Bernie Sanders for the
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:37.240]  white race he's advocating not just for the white race but for humanity and for
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:41.520]  Western civilization I'm talking about David what it what is your major bone of
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:46.080]  contention with with dr. David Duke's work well I'll be honest with you I
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:51.280]  haven't followed much of what David Duke has done I do think that he is a
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:56.200]  eloquent speaker from the speeches I've seen him give I do not like
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:00.040]  organizations that sneak around in secret eugenics programs like the real
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:05.360]  clan did and then they run all this race war garbage to dominate and control
[03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:08.840]  society but I'm not putting that on him even though I know he was a grand dragon
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:14.880]  I know this I've been sent multiple clips with David Duke saying I basically am a
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:19.920]  fraud or cover-up for Israel and all this bull I have nothing to do with Israel I
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:25.040]  just don't obsess over it and if I fall down on a banana peel I don't blame
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:29.040]  Jews for it there are some bad Jews there are some good Jews there's some bad
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:32.080]  Germans there are some good Germans there are some good Chinese some bad
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:37.120]  Chinese that's where I stand and the whole race cult groups not even so much
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:43.200]  David Duke but the white supremacist hordes hate me because they get their
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:47.000]  Southern Poverty Law Center ADL connection funding and the rest of it
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:52.480]  they're there to make the Liberty Movement be race centric in the prison
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:56.680]  complex divide and conquer where everyone is forced into their race group
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:01.120]  and then we don't have a unifying idea of basic human liberty and freedom so
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:04.920]  of course there's a war on whites but there's also a war on blacks and a war
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:10.200]  on everybody else directed by the same global technocrats so that's where I
[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:15.040]  stand and I don't care what color you are I don't want you aborted in the womb
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:18.840]  I don't want to speak for David Duke because I haven't read his books I've
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:23.720]  seen him in TV debates I've probably heard clips of his radio shows 10 15
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:27.520]  times I've seen maybe 10 15 of his videos I don't have time to follow it
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:31.720]  it's usually hey look at this clip David Duke's talking trash about you and I
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:36.520]  barely even listen to it so all I know is is that people want to feel like
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:41.800]  they're better than me because they can say Alex Jones works for the Vatican or
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:46.120]  he works for Israel he works for this or that no I'm a real person with integrity
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:50.160]  I work for the ideas of basic freedom as best I see them doesn't mean I'm
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:55.440]  perfect and so I just don't see legitimacy out of the general white
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:04:00.880]  supremacist crowd do I hate them more than I hate the black supremacist no do
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:05.240]  I get a lot of their views understand why they think that I get it but I get why
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:10.760]  black supremacists operate the way they do it's a paradigm manipulation so
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:15.480]  that's what it comes down to go ahead yeah I mean I hear you talking a lot
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:20.560]  about you know genocide of blacks and everything and I mean that's a legitimate
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:28.720]  point but I don't hear you talking a whole lot about the very very engineered
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:34.360]  genocide of the white race I mean diversity I believe is really code for
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:39.800]  anti-white or white genocide and do you can go and find you can go find people
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:44.200]  very prominent people even government basically advocating I'll tell you what
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:47.960]  stay there I gotta go to break Frank and I'll come back and you can finish up

[03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:20.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:28.880]  Alex Jones when white people organize and persecute black people we expose it
[03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:33.740]  and say it's wrong when people try to set police up though for things they
[03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:37.600]  haven't done and make them the enemy period because they're in blue that's
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:42.920]  more tribalism we expose it when cops act like thugs and gangs we expose them
[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:47.320]  so I'm really against tribalism I know humans are so tribal they use it to
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:53.560]  control us I want tribalism of private property of sovereignty of the power of
[03:08:53.560 --> 03:08:59.160]  the family and yes whites are under attack yes they have free slaps for
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:04.360]  whites at Berkeley yes they're telling whites that being white is inherently
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:12.880]  bad and evil all of this is going on all of this is unfolding and happening
[03:09:12.880 --> 03:09:18.280]  but then separately their government programs to basically pigeonhole and
[03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:24.800]  attack and go after black people Hispanics you name it I mean look at
[03:09:24.800 --> 03:09:29.640]  Gardasil which is known to cause reproductive problems and all sorts of
[03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:38.480]  other major major issues that's being targeted against basically what is it
[03:09:38.480 --> 03:09:46.240]  three or four Latin American countries Mexico is a chief amongst it and you
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:51.560]  don't hear mecha la raza mecha means well I mean their slogan is for everything
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:55.960]  for everybody in the race everything for those outside the race nothing when
[03:09:55.960 --> 03:10:00.160]  you look at what la raza means it means the race and it's just like a
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:03.800]  cook less clan organization so why is it bad for there to be a cook less clan
[03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:10.600]  for white people but then it's okay for the Hispanics no it's all manipulative
[03:10:10.600 --> 03:10:18.720]  it's all bad because if you look at how a prisons run in divide and conquer they
[03:10:18.720 --> 03:10:23.640]  organize it around race black gangs white gangs Hispanic gangs Asian gangs and
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:27.160]  then it's controlled by the warden that way and the central banks do have the
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:30.320]  Rothschilds who are Jewish there's a lot of that influence in there but then
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:35.560]  they're also funding eugenics and the Nazi movement so I'm gonna try to get
[03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:38.760]  David Duke on I've actually thought about this for a long time I was a
[03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:42.120]  guest on a radio show one time were they surprised me and had him on like in
[03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:46.040]  1997 or something he probably never knows he's been on the air with me and I
[03:10:46.040 --> 03:10:49.520]  know he's talked about me repeatedly because I've been sent to clips I'm gonna
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:53.160]  invite David Duke on for a full hour discussion I was just thinking about that
[03:10:53.160 --> 03:10:58.160]  a few weeks ago and have a serious discussion about world events and how
[03:10:58.160 --> 03:11:03.360]  does he square eugenics and all these covert programs that are going on
[03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:08.160]  targeting everybody if it's just a conspiracy against white people what I'm
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:12.040]  saying is they put the fluoride in everybody's water they push the
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:16.280]  Gardasil on black white old young they don't care while they play us off
[03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:21.120]  against each other while they weaponized gangster media to destroy the black
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:24.920]  family they're doing it everybody else's families and of course they push
[03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:28.320]  agendas where if you're white and want to have a white wife because that's what
[03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:31.600]  you're attracted to you're racist or they tell black people you know if you
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:34.920]  want a black wife or husband you're your racist you know all the studies show
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:39.440]  people like folks that look like them sometimes they're exceptions so I get the
[03:11:39.440 --> 03:11:45.960]  whole agenda I see it but all you hear out of the white supremacist half of
[03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:49.200]  which have been connected over time to the ADL Southern Parvy Law Center in the
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:56.200]  feds is that hammered all day and that's all you hear not the rest of the pieces
[03:11:56.200 --> 03:12:00.320]  of the puzzle to see the big picture and then you know you got the Catholics run
[03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:03.280]  it all crowd you got the Jews run it all crowd you got the Masons run it all
[03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:07.320]  crowd you got the space aliens run it all cloud and they will all attack me
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:12.360]  because I won't say it's one group of the other when I'm trying to really cover
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:18.600]  the real system of scientific manipulation and control I mean their
[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:23.640]  secret government programs spring barium salts aluminum dioxide and other
[03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:29.200]  radioactive isotopes by the thousands of tons a year to the atmosphere there's
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:34.240]  all sorts of others huge breakaway civilization programs and carrier waves
[03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:39.040]  over televisions to mesmerize the public and the IQs dropping and the brain
[03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:42.640]  waves are dropping this is mainstream news I told you about it 20 years ago I
[03:12:42.640 --> 03:12:49.120]  mean there's big stuff going on body snatcher level stuff going on and I'm
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:51.800]  gonna get David Duke on the show if he'll come on and I think he will he
[03:12:51.800 --> 03:12:55.440]  likes to debate I know that much and I'm gonna ask him I'm gonna have documents
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:59.000]  articles okay great you can have five minutes talk about the Jews and black
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:04.440]  people and then I've got five minutes to say what about this what about that
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:09.960]  okay what about this statement I mean you'll plan parenthood I'm saying
[03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:17.760]  there's a whole agenda above this why would Edward the eighth help push to
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:22.880]  create the state of Israel while he worship Hitler why did Hitler want a
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:28.760]  state of Israel and to send the Jews out why did rich Jews pay a demand of
[03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:33.640]  million dollars at the time in American money that's how calculated out to let
[03:13:33.640 --> 03:13:38.120]  Jews get out of Germany and that's all George Soros was was one of those
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:43.960]  people see I mean it gets weirder and weirder there's something bigger here
[03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:51.040]  it's much worse and it's limited and so that's what I'm saying that's what I'm
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:58.320]  getting at I mean is there Jewish supremacy absolutely is there Jewish
[03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:01.280]  mafia absolutely but does it mean it runs everything and it's the source of
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:04.840]  all evil it's like Italian mafia I'm against the Jewish mafia but I don't
[03:14:04.840 --> 03:14:10.920]  hate individual Jews themselves who are very diverse people it's more complex
[03:14:10.920 --> 03:14:14.680]  than that I mean are there race laws in Israel where if someone comes in the
[03:14:14.680 --> 03:14:19.040]  country to work and they date a Jew you can be arrested absolutely is that a
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:24.920]  apartheid is that yes why does Israel promote racial stuff over here but that
[03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:30.040]  doesn't live by it there I get all that I call Israel out on that Israel some of
[03:14:30.040 --> 03:14:33.760]  the Israel lobby promotes gun control here but once guns over there but do the
[03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:37.960]  white supremacist or the white separatist or whoever they are ever say oh he
[03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:44.880]  told the truth no they lie about me and say I get orders from Israel and then
[03:14:44.880 --> 03:14:49.920]  we'll find some legal office where I followed a corporation once and out of
[03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:54.880]  a huge law firm of 40 something lawyers once they did a liquor license in Texas
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:15:01.280]  for seagrams to sell alcohol and so I must work for the brothmans because a
[03:15:01.280 --> 03:15:08.640]  lawyer at a firm had done a liquor license for liquor stores what the I
[03:15:09.200 --> 03:15:14.760]  mean it's that type of just where people think they're scoring points proving
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:21.000]  something that isn't there so the whole anti-catholic crowd discredits
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:25.520]  legitimate criticism of the Catholic Church by lying the whole white
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:31.200]  supremacist crowd discredits yourselves by the incessant lying the incessant
[03:15:31.200 --> 03:15:35.360]  making stuff up the incessant this person's a Jew that person's a Jew
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:43.280]  everyone's a Jew I'm a Jew no I'm not a Jew I mean I look like everybody you see
[03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:47.240]  from Wales I've been to Wales like a bunch of Alex Joneses are walking around
[03:15:47.240 --> 03:15:53.080]  the point is I wouldn't be ashamed if I was Jewish you think you you gained some
[03:15:53.080 --> 03:15:59.160]  point on me by saying fine I am Jewish 100% I'm Ashkenazi from Russia okay it's
[03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:03.600]  not true but believe it you're a better man than me now I get it you could kick
[03:16:03.600 --> 03:16:07.120]  my butt right could you build a media empire by yourself could you do
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:10.480]  everything I did you're better than me I know you said you were cuz you said I
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:15.560]  wasn't you that made you bigger that made you a man that made you tough the
[03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:23.040]  difference is the stuff I say is true I did do the things I said I did so I
[03:16:23.040 --> 03:16:27.360]  just find the black races the Mexican races the white races it's all about
[03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:30.480]  how somebody stole something from them so they could feel like they're better
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:34.880]  than everybody else and say everybody else is a crook well I'm not a crook the
[03:16:34.880 --> 03:16:43.640]  quote Nixon so there's my rant on that subject Frank and I've actually been
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:45.960]  thinking about getting David Duke on the show I think it would make for good
[03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:52.760]  radio and maybe I could get some of the KKK people to ask themselves a couple
[03:16:52.760 --> 03:17:01.520]  questions why does the left worship the KKK's icon Margaret Sanger because
[03:17:01.520 --> 03:17:05.840]  there's a level above it and I know everybody wants to stay at the level
[03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:12.240]  they're at but I'm here to actually get people to think and come together does
[03:17:12.240 --> 03:17:15.400]  that mean you should have your culture overwritten and be forced to go to no
[03:17:15.400 --> 03:17:19.040]  does that mean I'm mad at black separatists or white separatists wanting
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:23.600]  to have their own lives no that's your right I understand your view I respect
[03:17:23.600 --> 03:17:29.560]  it but the globalists want to set each other's
[03:17:29.560 --> 03:17:32.520]  throats and we don't need that I'm gonna skip this network break I want to
[03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:36.080]  tell the other collars but Frank you got about two three minutes go ahead yeah
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:39.680]  thanks yeah I think that's a really good idea to have David Duke on I think it
[03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:43.680]  would make for great radio if nothing else I don't think he's a white
[03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:48.040]  supremacist think he would just about that I know he's just he was just a
[03:17:48.040 --> 03:17:52.040]  grand dragon and then I agree grand dragons are not white supremacist 40
[03:17:52.040 --> 03:17:57.880]  years ago 40 years ago or something that's a long time ago you know I think
[03:17:57.880 --> 03:18:00.560]  there's a lot of people out there that probably aren't proud of things they did
[03:18:00.560 --> 03:18:05.640]  30 40 years ago or maybe have to change hey hey hey listen being a grand
[03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:09.640]  dragon is the same thing as being a la raza chapter leader I'm not judging him
[03:18:09.640 --> 03:18:15.560]  for it my point of view though I've got to I've got to go with the hand that I've
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.160]  been dealt and I think white men need to stand up for themselves and stop
[03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:24.080]  being cut you know I'm sure you're familiar with this new term cut
[03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:29.120]  servitive because we are under attack from every freaking direction even
[03:18:29.120 --> 03:18:34.880]  traders I would consider them traders in our own race and I think white men are
[03:18:34.880 --> 03:18:38.360]  gonna have to stand up for themselves that's just a reality and another another
[03:18:38.360 --> 03:18:43.400]  person I think you should have on a very eloquent person as well an Italian
[03:18:43.400 --> 03:18:47.120]  American was born in Italy moved here when he was very young his name is
[03:18:47.120 --> 03:18:52.840]  Angelo John gauge and I don't know that make for great radio as well don't know
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:57.680]  that and all I know is the whole white supremacist crowd just says the same
[03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:01.480]  stuff over and over again and I get it a certain paradigm level from their
[03:19:01.480 --> 03:19:07.200]  perspective I understand what they're saying it's just that I'm not a trader
[03:19:07.200 --> 03:19:11.280]  to life and the globalists have a master plan to divide and conquer and
[03:19:11.280 --> 03:19:17.760]  control us and I think somebody should expose the master plan does it mean that
[03:19:17.760 --> 03:19:21.320]  if you grow up and you get attacked as a white person and told your bad and
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:24.720]  physically attacked because you're white does it mean it's some primitive
[03:19:24.720 --> 03:19:27.840]  instinctive level you don't want to go join other white people that have been
[03:19:27.840 --> 03:19:33.560]  abused and get it black people do the same thing it the rhetoric is so close
[03:19:33.560 --> 03:19:40.160]  to each other it's ridiculous meanwhile the eugenicists have a plan to bring all
[03:19:40.160 --> 03:19:45.640]  of our communities down they are the enemy and I want to hear from somebody
[03:19:45.640 --> 03:19:50.280]  like David Duke who's so close ideologically to the left when it comes
[03:19:50.280 --> 03:19:53.840]  to things like Planned Parenthood I mean I want to have a real discussion with
[03:19:53.840 --> 03:20:00.080]  Dr. Duke about all of that I appreciate your call and by the way when I get up
[03:20:00.080 --> 03:20:04.240]  here and talk about beating up drag rats or something it's not me thumping my
[03:20:04.240 --> 03:20:08.960]  chest acting tough it is an explosion for being on air for three hours
[03:20:08.960 --> 03:20:17.120]  frustrated by all this frustrated and and and angry and thinking about the
[03:20:17.120 --> 03:20:22.800]  things I've seen gang members and scum do that makes me physically angry that's
[03:20:22.800 --> 03:20:30.040]  what I'm talking about and we need to translate our anger into action and
[03:20:30.040 --> 03:20:36.920]  that's all I'm saying people need to do you know so many white supremacists are
[03:20:36.920 --> 03:20:39.280]  like we need to keep abortion around here with the black people and you you
[03:20:39.280 --> 03:20:43.400]  write that in comments on info wars all the rest of it would you really take a
[03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:46.400]  one-year-old black baby and beat its brains out I mean cuz you know that's
[03:20:46.400 --> 03:20:52.360]  what we're talking about here I mean you're just like Khalid Muhammad how do
[03:20:52.360 --> 03:20:55.560]  you hate Khalid Muhammad saying kill all the white babies but then you want to
[03:20:55.560 --> 03:21:02.720]  kill the black babies and I'm not saying you Frank but my gut my soul recoils
[03:21:02.720 --> 03:21:06.360]  from that I don't need to read it in a book or know it intellectually even though
[03:21:06.360 --> 03:21:13.760]  I do to know that's not good I'm not gonna get ahead posing as a liberal and
[03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:16.560]  making sure a Planned Parenthood gets built in the black neighborhood when I
[03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:21.080]  go around and basically talk about how much I hate black people at night while
[03:21:21.080 --> 03:21:27.000]  I live off the government and I have seen all these liberal white racists I've
[03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:31.520]  seen how they live I see how they operate they're snakes and the black
[03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:36.440]  leaders they bought off or even worse they hate black people and I will not
[03:21:36.440 --> 03:21:40.920]  sit here and kick people around and feel good about myself sitting there
[03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:47.520]  stomping on members of the human family it's disgusting and yes they are
[03:21:47.520 --> 03:21:53.360]  winding up the black people on average to act like complete idiots but so does
[03:21:53.360 --> 03:21:58.080]  the rest of the public and if you're being approached by five racist black
[03:21:58.080 --> 03:22:03.280]  thugs who want to physically attack you they come after you pull your gun out
[03:22:03.280 --> 03:22:07.920]  shoot them same thing of the clan tries to come kill some black family that's
[03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:15.400]  why I'm all about guns let me tell you it's scary bunch of big black guys
[03:22:15.400 --> 03:22:18.360]  looking at you like they want to kill you because you're white and wanting to
[03:22:18.360 --> 03:22:22.200]  rob you and hating your guts but I'd imagine it's scary back when that would
[03:22:22.200 --> 03:22:27.520]  happen to black people with at the hands of a bunch of white people and let me
[03:22:27.520 --> 03:22:32.560]  tell you what the clan does in the south because I've experienced it not much but
[03:22:32.560 --> 03:22:35.520]  if you're driving a nice truck at a good looking girl in your car you'd have
[03:22:35.520 --> 03:22:39.520]  some toothless scumbag come over with three or four guys and threaten to kick
[03:22:39.520 --> 03:22:43.720]  your butt in a parking lot all because they were jealous of you what you're
[03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:46.880]  doing around here Yankee we're the clan you better watch us you know what I do

[03:22:59.280 --> 03:23:04.360]  clan just like I've seen black thugs act just the same way you people are the
[03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:09.760]  same and I don't like any of you you understand that I am not sinking down to

[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:41.720]  teenager he had to kick some of their asses just because they were shooting

[03:24:21.280 --> 03:24:25.240]  a rant today too much brain force this hour brought to you by brain force go
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:30.400]  ahead you're on the air no it's alright man I love when you get mad because
[03:24:30.400 --> 03:24:34.320]  that's the type of attitude you need for these um globalists they treat us like
[03:24:34.320 --> 03:24:40.000]  crap they're poisoning us they poisoning our kids nobody really they got jet
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:43.880]  liners with the fuel added poisoning us and we're supposed to argue about what
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:51.320]  color we are it's but I'm calling about Trump I personally think he's just
[03:24:51.320 --> 03:24:56.680]  another arm a shield he's being used to take away attention from Rand Paul Rand
[03:24:56.680 --> 03:25:01.960]  Paul was doing his thing right before Donald Trump he was the leader and yeah
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:07.560]  and then all of a sudden all his numbers just dropped um I also wanted to talk
[03:25:07.560 --> 03:25:13.040]  about one more thing if I can much of your time no take it and uh I want to
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:19.200]  call you president Alex Jones that's how I see you that's how I see you you're
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:24.880]  like you represent what America how it started which was you know for the
[03:25:24.880 --> 03:25:30.320]  people it wasn't for the British crown and a lot of people don't study that
[03:25:30.320 --> 03:25:36.720]  they like you had the videos with them the people celebrating July 4th and they
[03:25:36.720 --> 03:25:41.000]  didn't even know what the hell they were celebrating they thought it was uh they
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:44.720]  thought it was like from the 60s or something I know it's crazy and you know
[03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:47.280]  and again they could point out that nobody was perfect then it was the
[03:25:47.280 --> 03:25:52.040]  ideas that were revolutionary what they wanted to do and and it was that they
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:57.060]  tried and exactly and now those ideas are under attack my friend and then
[03:25:57.060 --> 03:26:02.880]  people say oh it was only uh the that George Washington and and Thomas
[03:26:02.880 --> 03:26:07.620]  Jefferson had slaves the slaves were helping in the war fighting against the
[03:26:07.620 --> 03:26:12.120]  British crown like well that's because the British would also take you as
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:15.600]  slaves they just didn't call it slay or they called it press gangs it was a
[03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:23.720]  absolutely anything else I just want to say um free truth about uh March on
[03:26:23.720 --> 03:26:30.520]  Twitter March 20 I'm excuse me August 28th 1355 Market Street in San
[03:26:30.520 --> 03:26:36.000]  Francisco California and I love you Alex you woke you part of me waking up a
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:41.360]  whole a lot more than I was I thought I was awake but somebody was like yo you
[03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:46.520]  sound like Alex Jones and then I looked you up and I found you and you just like
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:51.920]  opened it up even more like whoa well God bless you thanks for putting up with
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:54.520]  me I'm gonna do one more segment overdrive to go to people they've been
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:57.080]  holding too long and it is true I'll make you hold too long most of us would
[03:26:57.080 --> 03:27:02.040]  just hang up on the callers they weren't gonna go to calls but I I probably
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:05.040]  shouldn't be on air today because I got upset earlier because I just start
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:07.360]  thinking about stuff that's happened in my life and I have like flashbacks
[03:27:07.360 --> 03:27:11.960]  basically to it I guess they are like flashbacks and in the older you get the
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:19.120]  more those flashbacks when you have them really hit you and I think more than
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:29.040]  anything it's like I'm struggling to not be a slave myself I just fundamentally
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:32.920]  it's like when you're like 10 years old and five or six bullies are sitting on
[03:27:32.920 --> 03:27:36.080]  top of you and they're kicking you and they're hitting you and you finally just
[03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:39.520]  find this explosive strength throw them off of you and you know like beat four or
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:45.520]  five of them up and it's like at that moment you're empowered and you realize
[03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:49.560]  that you've got this strength that you never knew you had and it wasn't till
[03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:53.000]  you were in deep trouble that you used it we need to use our strength
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:56.880]  politically that we've got now before it gets physical because once they kick
[03:27:56.880 --> 03:28:00.280]  off a civil war and a race war it's gonna be so hard to communicate with
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:05.760]  people and they'll come a time in a race war where you don't want to have to kill
[03:28:05.760 --> 03:28:09.560]  people that are attacking you but they will hate you because of your race
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:12.640]  whether you're black or white or whether side and you're just gonna have to
[03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:16.240]  defend yourself even though you know they're robots that are following a
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:22.840]  brainwashing program and I'm just here trying to short-circuit that program
[03:28:22.840 --> 03:28:28.000]  because we're following a globalist game and there's truth from every
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:37.800]  perspective everybody's got real issues but there's a bigger plan and I'm just
[03:28:37.800 --> 03:28:40.400]  here with the caller just said God bless you trying to get folks to think
[03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:45.560]  about that we're Dr. Garland Judy Tom Paul and a few others when we come back
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:50.360]  and I will hit some of that news I'm so angry it's probably like 70 degrees in
[03:28:50.360 --> 03:28:54.560]  here but I'm sweating that's what happens when I really get angry and it's
[03:28:54.560 --> 03:28:59.120]  again I'm just explaining it it's metabolic I'm in a fight mode when I
[03:28:59.120 --> 03:29:03.680]  really when all this comes home to me how real this is it's so fantastical that
[03:29:03.680 --> 03:29:08.360]  I start sweating and I want to start throwing stuff and we and that's a
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:12.280]  normal response folks people need to get out of their comfort zone and wake up
[03:29:12.280 --> 03:29:16.520]  and that's the only reason info wars has been able to reach out to people is we
[03:29:16.520 --> 03:29:20.680]  do have passion that cuts through the brainwashing that cuts through the

[03:29:26.400 --> 03:29:30.040]  back I mean I just there's so many bad Jews in the New World Order that are
[03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:34.160]  horrible smart people that use their intelligence for domination then there's
[03:29:34.160 --> 03:29:37.040]  somebody like Aaron Russo a great Jew who fought against tyranny and it was a
[03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:41.520]  wonderful man and really cool or Erwin Schiff ten years in prison dying for
[03:29:41.520 --> 03:29:45.320]  fighting the IRS a great patriot I mean I know so many Jews are just great
[03:29:45.320 --> 03:29:49.200]  people and then people just didn't hate them because they're Jewish it's the same

[03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:55.240]  a miracle every day on air is a miracle there's so much good around us we're on

[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:05.920]  much together but the ruling controllers want us to fight with each other they
[03:34:05.920 --> 03:34:10.200]  want to stir us up they want to get us at each other's throats and some of my
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:18.040]  frustration came out earlier I just want to ask all the white supremacists
[03:34:18.040 --> 03:34:22.520]  your best friends ever the left want to kill black people that's the apple of
[03:34:22.520 --> 03:34:25.840]  their eyes so but then they want to take the ones that are left and get them to
[03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:29.240]  fight with white people I mean can't you see what's happening they're attacking
[03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:33.960]  everyone the globalist are attacking everyone we have to come together
[03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:38.480]  against it and then we want to kill each other later that's fine
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:42.800]  big sarcastic let's go to your calls you've been holding long enough Gerald
[03:34:42.800 --> 03:34:48.200]  in Arkansas you're on the air welcome oh hey Alex listen you're doing a
[03:34:48.200 --> 03:34:54.280]  fantastic job but you're fulfilling process only in 521 the Bible says
[03:34:54.280 --> 03:34:59.600]  search and prove all things this is what I tell people your opinion if you got
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:04.760]  one and I got one and we can't prove it it's a Mexican standoff but you show
[03:35:04.760 --> 03:35:09.640]  documentation you read from the document it's not your opinion it's what
[03:35:09.640 --> 03:35:15.120]  they said and what they've been doing now I have two big questions here that
[03:35:15.120 --> 03:35:21.240]  I'll answer from from the Bible basically who is behind all this you
[03:35:21.240 --> 03:35:26.760]  said it before it's a spiritual battle good versus evil Satan is the one
[03:35:26.760 --> 03:35:31.920]  influence in these people who will be influenced and said to say they're the
[03:35:31.920 --> 03:35:36.000]  the lust for power and greed and selfishness is so prevalent on our
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:40.880]  planet they like that sheriff you showed a picture of look at the yellow friend
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:46.600]  flag behind him he's a he hates the Constitution because that's bonded on
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:54.800]  godly principles he wants to be God he wants unlimited power exactly not now
[03:35:54.800 --> 03:36:01.760]  the how how is this being done if you go back take this back to the federal
[03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:08.280]  reserve act of 1913 for our country now the bankers are international so they're
[03:36:08.280 --> 03:36:12.200]  Jews there's a lot quite a few Jews in the banking system but then there's
[03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:18.240]  others too so it's no monopoly there it's human nature at play if you're a
[03:36:18.240 --> 03:36:24.480]  selfish person look at those women in the Planned Parenthood video gleeing over
[03:36:24.480 --> 03:36:30.480]  a big baby selling baby parts well they're just tickable they're evil and
[03:36:30.480 --> 03:36:36.920]  Satan has put that kind of thinking in their mind so life is not valuable God
[03:36:36.920 --> 03:36:43.680]  is the only one that can that gives life and and he can restore it so that's why
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:51.280]  we the tank of man that says Matthew 1917 thou shalt not murder because you
[03:36:51.280 --> 03:36:56.360]  can't restore that life God is the only one that can so murder means in cold
[03:36:56.360 --> 03:37:00.680]  blood then they line so you can't defend yourself but but clearly key thou
[03:37:00.680 --> 03:37:04.200]  shalt not murder and then they turn it into thou shalt not kill but but you're
[03:37:04.200 --> 03:37:08.120]  right murder and killing are two different things right now here's here's
[03:37:08.120 --> 03:37:14.280]  the thing though and I you had had the Peter ship on a little earlier his dad
[03:37:14.280 --> 03:37:20.440]  his dad was a forerunner of identifying the Federal Reserve and the IRA no you
[03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:25.640]  got exactly you've got a Jew there fighting the Federal Reserve that's got
[03:37:25.640 --> 03:37:29.560]  a lot of powerful Rothschild interest in it exactly so it just shows it's evil
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:35.240]  can manifest in any group or people are individual and so that's it it is good
[03:37:35.240 --> 03:37:40.160]  and evil and if we promote good many people will resonate by example and
[03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:46.680]  will grow up into good and be strong and not overtaken by evil yeah yeah you're
[03:37:46.680 --> 03:37:52.720]  right see the wherever at in time though the computer age Alex has changed
[03:37:52.720 --> 03:37:56.320]  everything now he talked about printing money they don't print much money
[03:37:56.320 --> 03:38:00.640]  anymore I mean they don't they're in front of a hundred dollar bill anything
[03:38:00.640 --> 03:38:05.960]  bigger than a hundred dollar bill since the 60 so so because and look at it it's
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:13.520]  the odd if there's no redeemable for what nothing so the computer you can get
[03:38:13.520 --> 03:38:17.680]  on there and you can put trillions in there but you can't do that with ink and
[03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:23.320]  paper there's not enough that that's my point so the computer age has allowed
[03:38:23.320 --> 03:38:29.680]  them to multiply their fraud beyond our comprehensive you brought it up many
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:35.880]  times what is it two thousand trillion just in derivatives just in derivatives
[03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:42.040]  yeah yeah there's no way those numbers are impossible even for the mind to
[03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:47.320]  even figure out and then they can go into Russia and spend like a hundred
[03:38:47.320 --> 03:38:51.560]  billion of fiat made up money and and and buy all their politicians I mean
[03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:55.840]  that's what I mean and but again that's why they attack morals because if you
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:39:00.600]  have morals no amount of money will make you sell out but beyond morals if they
[03:39:00.600 --> 03:39:04.520]  can make you starve to death even the best person to feed their children might
[03:39:04.520 --> 03:39:11.600]  sell out that's why they're bringing in agenda 21 because once they can have
[03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:14.800]  people totally desperate then they can say you got to take a microchip for your
[03:39:14.800 --> 03:39:18.840]  welfare you got to take a guard a soul shot for your welfare and they're now
[03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:23.680]  announcing make you take vaccines to get your welfare make you get sterilized
[03:39:23.680 --> 03:39:27.920]  to have your welfare make you take a microchip to have your welfare I mean
[03:39:27.920 --> 03:39:32.080]  ten years ago if they announced that I'd be all over it I'm so conditioned now
[03:39:32.080 --> 03:39:36.560]  that it was in the news today I didn't even cover it microchips to get your
[03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:40.520]  welfare God bless you good to hear from you Gerald thanks for putting up with
[03:39:40.520 --> 03:39:44.960]  me because let me tell you this show is a train wreck a lot because of me but it's
[03:39:44.960 --> 03:39:50.360]  real and that's why it's so popular let's go ahead and talk to Judy in
[03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:57.280]  Florida Judy you're on the air welcome hey Alex God bless you and your crew I
[03:39:57.280 --> 03:40:03.560]  think about that you know wondering if the left hand doesn't know what the
[03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:09.280]  right hand is doing I think that on everything that's being portrayed in the
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:15.360]  mainstream media right now could be a major diversion about the fact that you
[03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:21.440]  know I would say it's a better than 50-50 chance that we may not have a 2016
[03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:29.800]  election September supposed to be this more or less ominous month being in the
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:34.800]  Dishmita cycle you know the the blood moons you know everything mixed into it
[03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:41.000]  the pope visiting Congress and then you know this definitely auspicious events
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:45.600]  are here major movements are happening announcements are happening things are
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:53.560]  happening of a very ominous nature and I just look at the fact that I mean I have
[03:40:53.560 --> 03:40:59.360]  lived through part of the you know decimation of the middle class I mean
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:03.800]  it's not just white males black males it's exactly we're all being targeted
[03:41:03.800 --> 03:41:08.600]  my former in-laws went through because they were building counties in Virginia
[03:41:08.600 --> 03:41:14.000]  you know Fairfax County and in other counties I mean Colin Powell used to
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:18.840]  shop at this place that used to be my former in-laws establishment so did
[03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:24.440]  Sonny Jorgensen it's you know what I've gone through myself I mean your anger
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:29.320]  resonates with me much more than you could ever realize because I know it's
[03:41:29.320 --> 03:41:33.640]  happened to both of my families you know meaning my ex-husband's family and
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:39.440]  mine and you know where my two children stand because their polar opposites I
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:43.400]  mean one is a trendy one knows exactly what's going on and it makes his blood
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:47.520]  boil and he can't listen to me very much because of what it what it does to him
[03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:54.960]  and you know and I see when I was born again Christian and I you know you said
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:58.760]  it yourself it could either be the playbook that they're using being the
[03:41:58.760 --> 03:42:04.560]  book of revelations or the end times or this could be the end times and you know
[03:42:04.560 --> 03:42:08.960]  all I know is that I mean I've lived through a lot of the same types of
[03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:15.520]  experiences that you have and I'm I'm I'm angrier than I can express I mean I'm
[03:42:15.520 --> 03:42:20.760]  amazed how you express the anger on air and other people get on and watch you
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:26.160]  you know because they're feeling the exact same thing the other thing I wanted
[03:42:26.160 --> 03:42:33.000]  to say is that if there was a it would be wonderful what one caller was trying
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:40.040]  to express it maybe but there's a the main problem that we have is that we're
[03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:44.040]  atomized people that have good sense people that have high morals people
[03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:48.920]  that love America and you know whatever happened to the Constitution I have no
[03:42:48.920 --> 03:42:53.000]  idea but it's like all the different issues that are out there assailing us
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:57.320]  it's like if there was just a central place you know a website where people
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:02.240]  could be bedded and yes there are different you know causes that people
[03:43:02.240 --> 03:43:06.560]  can go after but you know how do we find each other is the question and yes
[03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:10.560]  there are websites out there but you know if we if we can't find each other
[03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:15.840]  and and believe that it's something as legitimate and nothing goes anywhere
[03:43:15.840 --> 03:43:20.600]  absolutely I've tried all sorts of stuff we've had some success I think the
[03:43:20.600 --> 03:43:25.600]  biggest thing is the Liberty Movement is atomized and that we can't see how
[03:43:25.600 --> 03:43:29.640]  successful we've been but if you were a well-known prominent person you would be
[03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:35.800]  mobbed and anywhere in the world you went and then you would know just how
[03:43:35.800 --> 03:43:39.800]  awake people are but then there's the question but if we don't know how do we
[03:43:39.800 --> 03:43:43.320]  communicate with each other well we just wake up others that aren't awake you
[03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:46.760]  start your own little organization or group and then that will draw other
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:50.360]  people in and then we can all connect together that way I think the surest
[03:43:50.360 --> 03:43:54.760]  way to stop the globalist is to simply get active all of you should do YouTube
[03:43:54.760 --> 03:43:58.840]  channels all of you should use the enemy platform Facebook but not to tell
[03:43:58.840 --> 03:44:02.240]  folks what you're eating for dinner but to share political information
[03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:06.560]  everybody should try to start a local radio show or access show or put out a
[03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:09.920]  newsletter or tell their friends and family about this broadcast there's so
[03:44:09.920 --> 03:44:14.360]  much you can do I want to thank you Judy I want to go to Tom Groovy and Paul
[03:44:14.360 --> 03:44:17.680]  that's gonna be it for calls we're gonna in the transmission and go back to
[03:44:17.680 --> 03:44:22.720]  retransmission at 51 after briefly because I didn't plug enough today I
[03:44:22.720 --> 03:44:27.640]  believe we'll sell out a brain force by Monday at first it sold so well I think
[03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:30.040]  I thought we'd sell out by today but but it's slowed down so but it's still
[03:44:30.040 --> 03:44:34.920]  selling out it'll be back in a few weeks it it's a natural healthy brain boost
[03:44:34.920 --> 03:44:40.160]  pill that's got two things that are prescription in Europe one of them is
[03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:45.880]  what the brain's actually made up of and it just really supercharges me with
[03:44:45.880 --> 03:44:51.080]  energy unlike coffee that makes me feel jittery and you know kind of have a
[03:44:51.080 --> 03:44:55.360]  headache this doesn't do it I take a max of two of them a day can take up to three
[03:44:55.360 --> 03:45:00.880]  a day a lot of folks just take one a day and we've got x2 true nasa and iodine
[03:45:00.880 --> 03:45:04.800]  amazing what deficiency in that can do to you that's probably one of the biggest
[03:45:04.800 --> 03:45:08.480]  game-changers we've got super no vitalities back in stock info wars
[03:45:08.480 --> 03:45:19.360]  life.com or 888-253-3139 and if you go to info wars life.com that's the
[03:45:19.360 --> 03:45:23.840]  proprietary and nutraceuticals that we have you can read the reviews for
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:30.080]  yourself they're five star 4.8 on average thousands of reviews upwards of
[03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:35.480]  600 700 just on supermail vitality alone super female vitality read it for
[03:45:35.480 --> 03:45:40.800]  yourself I mean here's an example about our colloidal silver silver bullet is
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:44.560]  manufactured by the leading manufacturer in the country it's 30 parts per million
[03:45:44.560 --> 03:45:47.800]  you can get it smaller but it can be toxic smaller than that that's what the
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:53.240]  expert says is why we stopped there one of the biggest healthy food chains in the
[03:45:53.240 --> 03:45:57.280]  country will be biggest carries it but they have their name on it and it costs
[03:45:57.280 --> 03:46:02.360]  five to ten dollars more the exact same bottle so that's just an example if you
[03:46:02.360 --> 03:46:06.760]  get the best that's out there industry-wide at a little bit lower price
[03:46:06.760 --> 03:46:12.840]  sometimes a lot lower price leading competitors like to supermail our 70
[03:46:12.840 --> 03:46:17.960]  80 a hundred dollars we're talking twice as much our iodine there is no
[03:46:17.960 --> 03:46:23.080]  competition it turns purple on paper not red real iodine's purple whatever it
[03:46:23.080 --> 03:46:26.400]  does in alcohol the other stuff folks sell because believe me we found this
[03:46:26.400 --> 03:46:29.760]  even better stuff because we had the cleanest seabass stuff that turned blue
[03:46:29.760 --> 03:46:36.360]  but light blue and we still sell original survival shield but we were
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:38.720]  searched around because the place we were getting from couldn't supply enough
[03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:43.520]  and we thought why not go with medical grade deep earth they use promise it's
[03:46:43.520 --> 03:46:48.200]  so DEA controlled you can make a bunch of stuff with the raw crystals and we
[03:46:48.200 --> 03:46:54.160]  were able to get it and it's just total game changer turns purple you know the
[03:46:54.160 --> 03:46:58.600]  crystals when you heat them up on top of plate a hot plate I mean it's it's
[03:46:58.600 --> 03:47:02.040]  amazing and it just goes through your body and grabs the toxins grabs the
[03:47:02.040 --> 03:47:07.440]  garbage you will detox most people in two to three weeks and for couple days
[03:47:07.440 --> 03:47:11.480]  maybe a week you don't feel too high but after that it is it is amazing and
[03:47:11.480 --> 03:47:15.320]  when I forget to take it for a couple days I remember take it and just feel so
[03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:19.480]  good now be careful talk to your physician first because it's it's a
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:26.960]  real base thing of the body I mean it's it's a major part of the body it's a
[03:47:26.960 --> 03:47:31.200]  lot of the full shows we can take all these calls the full hour but info

[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:53.800]  in my view let's talk to Tom in New York Tom thanks for holding her on the
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:48:01.240]  ear. Hey Alex right now I'm on the X2 the B12 the D3 and the brain force and I'll
[03:48:01.240 --> 03:48:05.160]  tell you it takes a axe that would chop down trees and turns it into a sword
[03:48:05.160 --> 03:48:10.880]  that'll split his. Wow so you have had a good effect? Oh yeah absolutely I mean
[03:48:10.880 --> 03:48:14.320]  you know if you're already sharp to begin with it just makes you even more
[03:48:14.320 --> 03:48:19.760]  so so regardless which have been losing sleep here to stay up to catch up with
[03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:24.720]  you Frank in North Carolina way way way I mean it's not yet a to this country
[03:48:24.720 --> 03:48:30.440]  was built on that's not what's gonna fix this and with all the racial divide
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:33.480]  politics I mean the thing is everybody wants to take a personal with them their
[03:48:33.480 --> 03:48:38.240]  own race why don't we start taking things personal as a human race and then
[03:48:38.240 --> 03:48:43.840]  maybe we can have some success against those that are working against us to our
[03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:48.600]  faults I mean is that not more or less what you were trying to elaborate on
[03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:52.840]  earlier and get to? Yes I think you just crystallized it a lot simpler than I could
[03:48:52.840 --> 03:48:57.440]  in my bumbling fashion. No it's all good I mean I'm saying like you know when you
[03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:01.000]  talk about oh god I'm so sorry for getting angry that's like colders
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:04.520]  thanking you all the time it's like nails on a chalkboard don't don't don't
[03:49:04.520 --> 03:49:08.920]  psychoanalyze your anger if you ain't got anger you're not human in all this. No I
[03:49:08.920 --> 03:49:13.680]  hear you brother it's just that I wish I could control myself I mean I usually
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:18.320]  control myself I was coming back through customs the lady knew who I was she
[03:49:18.320 --> 03:49:23.320]  started giving me all this dress down I just said come on Hillary Clinton takes
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:26.240]  money from dictators the government ships the drugs in you're gonna let all
[03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:30.320]  the illegals in I see you doing it you're harassing me about what I got in my

[03:49:34.840 --> 03:49:37.960]  she's like well is this an accurate number and I said it's probably more
[03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:41.880]  higher than what I have would you put false number down I go I don't know pull
[03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:45.480]  it out search it do whatever you want she goes yeah we are gonna search you and I

[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:13.040]  wasn't mad at them because they were particularly bad or their job is it
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:17.760]  important I was kind of scapegoating them but still she was on a power trip
[03:50:17.760 --> 03:50:22.240]  that why am I being scrutinized when the government's and the corporations are
[03:50:22.240 --> 03:50:26.480]  so corrupt I mean obviously you know I have no criminal record no warrants

[03:50:40.520 --> 03:50:46.280]  after I got mad because I didn't yell or scream but I was losing control and at
[03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:52.080]  41 running a major media operation I need to get in control I know it's fun to

[03:54:24.760 --> 03:54:27.960]  a lot of important guests a lot of great reporters a lot of investigative
[03:54:27.960 --> 03:54:32.560]  journalists a lot of important info that needs to be sent out to other people
[03:54:32.560 --> 03:54:36.520]  people are ready to hear the truth so please keep spreading the word and I
[03:54:36.520 --> 03:54:41.640]  want to thank you the listeners don't thank me Paul and then groovy Paul in
[03:54:41.640 --> 03:54:46.520]  New Mexico you're on the air yeah Alex I'll try to be as quick as I can I just
[03:54:46.520 --> 03:54:50.160]  want to throw out some points you can put a timer on me or whatever two minutes
[03:54:50.160 --> 03:54:53.120]  or whatever but I'll let you know when I'm done I just want to throw out some
[03:54:53.120 --> 03:54:58.000]  stuff for you okay I disagree with you as far as giving Trump the benefit of
[03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:02.120]  the doubt because I don't feel our country has the time this could be the
[03:55:02.120 --> 03:55:06.400]  last election and that's like going into a casino I'd rather place my bets on
[03:55:06.400 --> 03:55:12.080]  Rand Paul you know I feel he was like a two-to-one a two-to-one odd versus on
[03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:17.360]  the rule that will place my 101 bet on Trump I don't feel care Trump has any
[03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:25.240]  character okay and let's just spend our time and money at races that we can win
[03:55:25.240 --> 03:55:30.160]  you know I mean and like you're saying the other time but I feel Trump's they
[03:55:30.160 --> 03:55:35.160]  say I think Troy Trump's real popular is because he he's an outsider that's why
[03:55:35.160 --> 03:55:40.760]  people feel he's an outsider he's not a career politician but actually I feel
[03:55:40.760 --> 03:55:46.160]  he's an insider he's actually an insider of the globalist to sabotage all the
[03:55:46.160 --> 03:55:52.240]  other candidates so as far as that goes I wrote down a bunch of stuff I'm a
[03:55:52.240 --> 03:55:56.320]  little nervous no I think you're listen you're probably right and when I say
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:55:59.560]  benefit of the doubt it doesn't mean I'm endorsing him I've said Rand Paul it
[03:55:59.560 --> 03:56:06.520]  means that we'll see what he ends up doing
[03:56:06.520 --> 03:56:12.200]  yeah does that make sense you know he's blackmailable you know we don't want
[03:56:12.200 --> 03:56:16.360]  anybody like that and you know I mean well I think you make some elegant
[03:56:16.360 --> 03:56:20.800]  eloquent points and I think you're right that if you look at his past and what
[03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:28.200]  he's done you judge a tree by its fruits and he is a casino owning shark and a
[03:56:28.200 --> 03:56:32.640]  big slumlord and you look at how rents are exploding and the New World Order
[03:56:32.640 --> 03:56:37.240]  economy the whole thing's not pretty but you have to defend him because what
[03:56:37.240 --> 03:56:42.560]  he's now saying is true so in that office of saying things that are true
[03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:47.040]  you got to say what Trump sings true that's why it's catching on the other
[03:56:47.040 --> 03:56:52.320]  candidates should be saying it as well just more smoothly God bless you I
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:57.080]  appreciate your call Paul groovy you're our tail gunner today go ahead
[03:56:57.080 --> 03:57:03.840]  wow brother we're a bunch of great callers statement I will not vote for

[03:57:19.520 --> 03:57:26.160]  crap and I I'm just so fed up well let's just say it's real what is paying
[03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:29.880]  Al Gore carbon taxes due to fix it we're letting China have three new plants a
[03:57:29.880 --> 03:57:34.060]  week we can have none I mean this is a way to tax and run our lives it's a
[03:57:34.060 --> 03:57:41.680]  giant power grab the Pope's pushing it and it is a fraud it's biblical and hope
