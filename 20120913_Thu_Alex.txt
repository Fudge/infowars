[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.800 --> 00:44.240]  ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 13th day of September 2012 former
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.920]  Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura will be joining us to give us his take on
[00:48.920 --> 00:53.800]  election 2012 and beyond and talk about his new book Democrats and
[00:53.800 --> 00:58.960]  Reblublekens so Governor Ventura always great to have him on is going to be
[00:58.960 --> 01:04.760]  joining us coming up today we're also going to have open phones here ladies
[01:04.760 --> 01:10.560]  and gentlemen throughout the broadcast on the state of the world I mean you can
[01:10.560 --> 01:16.320]  call in about whatever you want but if you don't call in about the fact that
[01:16.320 --> 01:19.640]  the globalists are trying to gear up World War three right now to cover the
[01:19.640 --> 01:23.360]  engineered financial collapse see they're taking over economically but
[01:23.360 --> 01:30.160]  politically they need a war a global war a multi-region war as a political
[01:30.160 --> 01:35.480]  distraction to get people to rally behind the ongoing takeover war is the
[01:35.480 --> 01:39.240]  health of the state and all the analysts all the journalists all the
[01:39.240 --> 01:43.560]  researchers all the economists all the historians that we've had on from West
[01:43.560 --> 01:50.680]  well Webster Tarpley to Chris Hedges to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts to myself to
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.800]  congressmen like Walter Jones they all agree the system wants to start a new
[01:55.800 --> 02:00.800]  giant war as a political smokescreen and who is the system it is the six
[02:00.800 --> 02:04.760]  global mega banks that control the issue in some currency and credit and who
[02:04.760 --> 02:12.360]  have created mega trillions 1,500 trillion dollars plus and gotten
[02:12.360 --> 02:18.000]  governments to sign on to it and then the media runs this Decepticon operation
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.560]  where they say oh this is your debt and a small percentage of it is our debt
[02:22.560 --> 02:29.160]  upwards of 15 and a half 16 trillion the US amount that took three years ago in
[02:29.160 --> 02:32.240]  the Washington Post I'm surprised the Washington Post came out with this
[02:32.240 --> 02:36.960]  because it mirrored Tarpley's numbers he'd come up with a year before that of
[02:36.960 --> 02:47.280]  644 trillion of the 1.5 quadrille 1,500 trill so the derivatives are 644
[02:47.280 --> 02:50.280]  trillion growing since then they've been leveraging out even more it's
[02:50.280 --> 02:54.120]  probably 800 900 who knows just our quote share it's probably over two
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.400]  quadrillion now or more globally those are conservative numbers very
[02:57.400 --> 03:03.560]  conservative numbers so you've got 644 trill probably 800 trill now 800 trill
[03:03.560 --> 03:09.800]  trillion with a capital T as tyranny sitting there telling us that it's our
[03:09.800 --> 03:16.520]  debt when we owe 15 plus trillion to the bankers and it's all my gosh our
[03:16.520 --> 03:22.760]  deficit's real big oh our debt's real big hard trade balance oh bad folks none
[03:22.760 --> 03:29.000]  of that means anything compared to the thousand plus trillion the world has been
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.080]  signed on to and the fact that if the dollar starts to go into a faster
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.680]  decline it's already declining but if it accelerates that decline as it's
[03:39.680 --> 03:43.840]  starting to do and boy it will when they just have continued quantitative easing
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.600]  we're saying hey we promised you no QE3 we're just gonna have ongoing
[03:48.600 --> 03:55.000]  quantitative easing so now it's QE3 and beyond when that starts to kick in
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.160]  Katie Bar the door and if they don't do that you'll just have a implosion of
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.800]  the economy and stagnation so instead they'd rather have stagnation and
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.760]  inflation stagflation or hyper stag inflation the point is we are headed
[04:09.760 --> 04:16.280]  into a situation where you know a we're thrown into the fiery furnace and be
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.080]  we're thrown off the cliff so it's it's kind of like you want to fall off the
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.800]  cliff you know that takes a little while to drop off the you know that the clip
[04:25.800 --> 04:32.680]  with the with the hyperinflation or do you want to just be thrown right into
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.600]  the white hot fire I tend to think the white hot fire is better because that's
[04:36.600 --> 04:39.760]  not what the bankers want and it will bring all this to a head very quickly
[04:39.760 --> 04:43.200]  instead they're just gonna keep strangling us like a baby in the night
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.640]  with a pillow very quietly oh it won't take much longer instead of having an
[04:48.640 --> 04:52.800]  out in front of God and everybody else so we're gonna break down the bedroom in
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.000]  the Middle East we told you was coming and a lot more straight ahead big show

[08:56.360 --> 09:00.880]  governor Jesse Ventura to break down election 2012 and all the bedlam in the

[09:16.120 --> 09:20.080]  specifically because we don't screen your calls except you know when I say on
[09:20.080 --> 09:25.560]  air that hey I'd like you to call in on this subject because it's the big
[09:25.560 --> 09:29.920]  subject we need to focus on it we've got a lot of other news to deal with some
[09:29.920 --> 09:36.080]  good news some bad news some ugly news but obviously you've heard our guests on
[09:36.080 --> 09:44.360]  this show and myself predict the October surprise to stir up the jihadis and to
[09:44.360 --> 09:48.600]  put al-Qaeda into all these countries and then to have the globalists who
[09:48.600 --> 09:54.880]  control them not America but the globalists who are also embedded inside
[09:54.880 --> 10:01.240]  our government have them start murdering US personnel and US troops and
[10:01.240 --> 10:06.560]  European personnel and trips all over the world they can punch a button and
[10:06.560 --> 10:10.720]  al-Qaeda and other jihadi squads that have been allowed to operate in all our
[10:10.720 --> 10:17.000]  countries will start bombing things and then that will be used to take all of
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  our liberties you see people think it's America versus Iran or it's Europe
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.720]  versus Syria or no no no no no it's global mega bankers financing all
[10:28.720 --> 10:35.880]  sides for conflict and bedlam so they can destroy once free societies and
[10:35.880 --> 10:40.960]  again before I get into this news it's a something a child can understand
[10:40.960 --> 10:47.160]  whenever revenge of the Sith came out 10 years ago or whatever it is time flies
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.840]  when when yeah I guess it was about seven eight years ago guys look up when
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.640]  revenge of the Sith came out for me episode three of the cheesy Star Wars
[10:56.640 --> 11:01.320]  prequels not really a fan of those films other than the fact that they have
[11:01.320 --> 11:06.480]  important archetypes in them but you have a senator on a little known planet
[11:06.480 --> 11:13.200]  who finances a group to attack his planet over over trade deals came out in
[11:13.200 --> 11:20.600]  2005 so seven years ago and then he uses that to become prominent in the Senate
[11:20.600 --> 11:26.040]  then he finances groups terrorists to attack the home world but is it
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.520]  Coruscant as a pretext to then say that there isn't enough of an army there
[11:32.520 --> 11:37.760]  isn't enough of a police state to stop the terrorist attacks and so then he
[11:37.760 --> 11:45.840]  abolishes the old Republic basically using that and then hunts down hunts down
[11:45.840 --> 11:50.720]  the old police force and wipes them out now when when the movie came out the
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.640]  media all over the place said we don't understand the plot we don't know what
[11:55.640 --> 12:00.520]  this means and George Lucas did interviews from the Cannes Film Festival
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.080]  and others he said what do you mean you can't get it criminal elements in the
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.840]  government are staging terror attacks as a pretext to take over society just
[12:09.840 --> 12:16.360]  like we're seeing today so he basically is a 9-11 truth or George Lucas love him
[12:16.360 --> 12:20.560]  or hate him that's what he said he said just like we're seeing today he said
[12:20.560 --> 12:23.880]  that the Cannes Film Festival go look it up it was all over the news and the news
[12:23.880 --> 12:31.280]  still played dumb and said we don't know what this means but children knew
[12:31.280 --> 12:38.640]  Palpatine the senator is attacking himself as a pretext to build up an
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.600]  internal army to deal with the outside threat but then he ends up using that
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.320]  internal army to sweep away the old Republic and establish a tyranny and
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.480]  that's what Homeland Security is it's the foreign banker takeover system that
[12:53.480 --> 12:57.000]  says it's here to keep you safe and says it's here to keep you safe from al-Qaeda
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.840]  while the globalists control al-Qaeda publicly they controlled it when they
[13:01.840 --> 13:06.960]  created it in 79 they controlled it when they ran it against the Russians when
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.640]  they ran it against the Serbs when they've run it against Middle Eastern
[13:10.640 --> 13:16.800]  governments that are secular but want to have their own sovereignty they want to
[13:16.800 --> 13:22.720]  wreck those countries and they've wrecked Egypt they've wrecked Libya they're
[13:22.720 --> 13:27.600]  wrecking Syria and they are going to wreck every country in the region but
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.600]  Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia will be left standing because that's British
[13:32.600 --> 13:36.960]  intelligence created with Lawrence of Arabia it's not just a movie it's a true
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.240]  story they went out and got the better ones gave a bunch of machine guns and
[13:41.240 --> 13:44.560]  hand grenades had them take over the equivalent one of about seven countries
[13:44.560 --> 13:51.040]  and they called it Saudi Arabia because oil had been discovered there by Anglo
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.640]  American oil and the other big one standard oil and this is all mainline
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.960]  history this is not a secret it's not something that people you know don't know
[14:01.960 --> 14:07.880]  who were informed it's not debatable it's like saying the Atlantic Ocean is to
[14:07.880 --> 14:14.800]  the east of the Eastern seaboard the Pacific Ocean is to the west of the
[14:14.800 --> 14:20.680]  Pacific seaboard okay I mean it's like saying the Pacific is the Pacific
[14:20.680 --> 14:25.000]  Ocean the Atlantic is the Atlantic Ocean and the sun comes up in the morning it
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.840]  is not a debate there it is Egypt Al Qaeda flag raised above US Embassy in
[14:31.840 --> 14:38.960]  Cairo boom there's the headline Al Qaeda flags raised over Libya over the
[14:38.960 --> 14:45.320]  courthouses all over Libya in Tripoli you name it in Benghazi they're they're
[14:45.320 --> 14:51.080]  now raising the Al Qaeda flags attacking on three sides out of Jordan out of
[14:51.080 --> 14:57.000]  Turkey and other areas pouring in with US and British and Israeli troops
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.600]  openly training Al Qaeda Al Qaeda is the main group they're more than half the
[15:01.600 --> 15:06.720]  fires going in literally chopping everybody's heads off but blowing up
[15:06.720 --> 15:12.280]  mosque blowing up churches blowing up everything it's threatening to kill
[15:12.280 --> 15:19.000]  people's family if they won't go suicide bomb this is what our government is our
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.080]  government is a group of lawless crooks who think that you're in a complete
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.080]  trance and won't even notice what's happening they think you're so dumb
[15:27.080 --> 15:31.800]  ladies and gentlemen and there's gonna be spell over while these while these
[15:31.800 --> 15:37.920]  while these craved psychos mercenaries are just dumped into these countries
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.360]  you're gonna see us ambassadors and people killed because that's the plan it's
[15:42.360 --> 15:46.320]  meant to get out of hand now you've got this movie there probably is even a
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.680]  movie Paul Watson's got an article on it it's just a trailer just like what was
[15:50.680 --> 15:54.960]  it five years ago they had the Prophet Muhammad cartoons and all these neocon
[15:54.960 --> 15:59.840]  control newspapers in Europe ran it to antagonize the Muslims and sure it's
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.960]  wrong that you know some of the Muslims can't deal with free speech that's not
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.320]  a debate I'm having the point is it was meant to antagonize it was artificially
[16:09.320 --> 16:13.520]  done and now they're doing it again remember when France large parts of it
[16:13.520 --> 16:19.840]  burned when the Muslim population what is it 30% of France went out and then
[16:19.840 --> 16:25.640]  other hooligans joined you know the large young Muslim population in burning
[16:25.640 --> 16:31.800]  and raping and other forms of repine all of that and now we've got the Israeli
[16:31.800 --> 16:37.000]  flags being burned we've got the American flags being burned we've got
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.440]  Al Qaeda flags going up we've got all this happening and I've been telling you
[16:41.440 --> 16:46.080]  with our guest who've worked for the NSA you name it like Wayne Madsen who's
[16:46.080 --> 16:49.880]  gone to Syria gone to Libya Webster Tarpley who's gone to both places
[16:49.880 --> 16:54.400]  Tarpley went to cities where people were being shot down the street from where
[16:54.400 --> 17:00.560]  he was at I mean Tarpley's a wild man the point is and and this was all I'm
[17:00.560 --> 17:04.400]  going to get Tarpley on tomorrow by the way this was all predicted here on this
[17:04.400 --> 17:10.640]  show because it's not hard to predict it is a clash of civilizations it they are
[17:10.640 --> 17:16.120]  getting ready for a worldwide financial meltdown and to have a giant war to
[17:16.120 --> 17:20.920]  distract everyone while that happens I mean look at this US sends two warships
[17:20.920 --> 17:29.000]  to Libyan coast Fox News console attack NATO's dudes ludicrously points finger
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.840]  Gaddafi loyalist here's the key article by Paul Watson and infowars.com
[17:32.840 --> 17:38.000]  and principle.com right now is Mohammed movie a contrived fraud I've looked at
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.160]  it yes I mean the way they promote it going rich Jews gave us five million to
[17:44.160 --> 17:47.840]  make this the way the press release is written the way no one knows who's
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.560]  behind it it's meant to antagonize the Muslims it's meant to antagonize you know
[17:53.560 --> 17:57.640]  kind of their wild redneck version of Muslims to go out and say you're not
[17:57.640 --> 18:02.280]  going to insult my god I mean it is pure manipulation and the Muslims are taking
[18:02.280 --> 18:06.640]  the bait 110% I mean here's this Psyop thing just like Adam
[18:06.640 --> 18:11.000]  Gadan the grandson of the former head of the ADL you know it becomes an al-Qaeda
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.760]  leader and gets up there and says all this stuff and then they upload his
[18:14.760 --> 18:20.880]  videos in the same video format with the al-Qaeda bug and the Pentagon funded
[18:20.880 --> 18:25.480]  Intel Center bug that means it was produced the same place that I got
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.000]  produced it of course they did Intel Center's admittedly a Pentagon spinoff
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.280]  it's got the adjunct of rumsfeld under it so so that's what's going on and so
[18:34.280 --> 18:38.040]  it's not even this film on YouTube it's that the media is like this film on
[18:38.040 --> 18:42.840]  YouTube's gonna make the Muslims mad here let's show you you know all this
[18:42.840 --> 18:49.360]  stuff putting down the private Mohammed and then it starts and now Obama won't
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.680]  meet with Benjamin yet and yahoo but he'll meet with the head of the Muslim
[18:53.680 --> 18:59.400]  Brotherhood all meant for everyone to go oh Israel's all by themselves Israel and
[18:59.400 --> 19:02.920]  look they're burning our embassies down and killing our ambassadors we've got
[19:02.920 --> 19:06.840]  ahead Iran and the media knows the public so dumb down they're now saying
[19:06.840 --> 19:11.440]  Iran is behind al-Qaeda when it's NATO and Saudi Arabia literally arming and
[19:11.440 --> 19:17.200]  landing them it's now in the news I ran did it oh I ran did it to our embassy oh

[19:35.400 --> 19:41.280]  month ago they claim the Tea Party is gonna link up with al-Qaeda oh yes there
[19:41.280 --> 19:44.640]  could be staged terror attacks and they'll blame it on the Tea Party with
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.360]  al-Qaeda you're like that doesn't make sense they don't care they run al-Qaeda
[19:48.360 --> 19:52.200]  but then say al-Qaeda is gonna attack they don't care they're meant they're

[23:57.760 --> 23:59.960]  com
[24:19.720 --> 24:24.600]  you see when you understand
[24:24.600 --> 24:29.600]  that the globalists are waging war against humans.
[24:30.780 --> 24:34.520]  Like they're an invading alien force from planet Pop-Tart,
[24:34.520 --> 24:37.320]  but they're not, but use that as the analogy.
[24:37.320 --> 24:39.540]  They want to destroy civilizations
[24:39.540 --> 24:42.160]  and only have high tech reservations,
[24:42.160 --> 24:45.600]  high security zones, mainly in rural areas,
[24:45.600 --> 24:47.880]  but also in mega cities controlled by them.
[24:49.200 --> 24:50.400]  Because in their own words,
[24:50.400 --> 24:52.740]  they want the technology all for themselves,
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.400]  they want the life extension.
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.980]  And I've worked on this for two weeks
[24:55.980 --> 24:57.520]  with Paul Joseph Watson.
[24:58.920 --> 25:00.880]  I basically record stuff, send him links,
[25:00.880 --> 25:02.880]  he does his own research, so we collaborate a lot,
[25:02.880 --> 25:05.000]  because I don't have time to write the whole article.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.640]  The end of humanity, rise of the robots.
[25:07.640 --> 25:09.080]  I want to thank Watson for all his help
[25:09.080 --> 25:11.000]  getting these ideas and research out.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.360]  The elite's plan for the future doesn't include you.
[25:13.360 --> 25:15.920]  Just went hot, just went live.
[25:15.920 --> 25:18.880]  We maybe show this on TV for folks.
[25:18.880 --> 25:21.320]  If you're a radio listener, just go to infowars.com.
[25:21.320 --> 25:24.280]  The end of humanity, rise of the robots.
[25:24.280 --> 25:27.540]  The elite's plan for the future doesn't include you.
[25:27.540 --> 25:29.660]  Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson.
[25:30.700 --> 25:33.800]  And it's got all the quotes, all the links,
[25:33.800 --> 25:38.800]  all of the admissions in it, many of the admissions.
[25:39.320 --> 25:42.320]  So very, very important information.
[25:42.320 --> 25:45.360]  We're gonna be covering that more a little bit later.
[25:45.360 --> 25:48.520]  But please, like let's red link that article.
[25:48.520 --> 25:51.840]  Please get that article in the first part in the series.
[25:51.840 --> 25:53.840]  This is the second part in the series.
[25:53.840 --> 25:55.400]  We did one a few days ago,
[25:55.400 --> 25:57.280]  but it was so much we couldn't put it in one article.
[25:57.280 --> 25:58.840]  Get it out to people, read it.
[25:58.840 --> 26:00.680]  I mean, if you care about the future,
[26:00.680 --> 26:03.040]  if you wanna know what's going on,
[26:03.040 --> 26:04.800]  because the deeper we get down this road,
[26:04.800 --> 26:06.960]  the harder it's gonna be to beat these people.
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.200]  They've thought this out well, they've moved slowly,
[26:10.200 --> 26:12.280]  they've adulterated the food, the water, the air,
[26:12.280 --> 26:14.680]  they've got their tech being wired into everything right now
[26:14.680 --> 26:16.100]  to surveillance control.
[26:16.100 --> 26:17.540]  They're already able to predict the future
[26:17.540 --> 26:21.120]  to a great extent with their data mining systems.
[26:21.120 --> 26:24.160]  I told you a decade ago and got laughed at
[26:24.160 --> 26:26.080]  as I read it in MIT documents at Republic.
[26:26.080 --> 26:28.640]  Now it's in the mainstream news, they can predict the future.
[26:28.640 --> 26:29.960]  They know where you're gonna get gas,
[26:29.960 --> 26:31.280]  where you're gonna pull over and eat.
[26:31.280 --> 26:33.000]  They know what porn you're gonna look at
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.320]  before you consciously do.
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.760]  They're watching your every move with AI supercomputers.
[26:39.760 --> 26:43.000]  And they do not have your future
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.160]  and your prosperity in mind.
[26:47.160 --> 26:49.560]  They want you dead.
[26:49.560 --> 26:52.200]  For the globalist, world government is only the beginning.
[26:52.200 --> 26:54.920]  They want you dead.
[26:54.920 --> 26:56.200]  They want you dead.
[26:56.200 --> 26:58.760]  See in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[26:58.760 --> 27:01.320]  Now six years old, you wanna understand it.
[27:01.320 --> 27:02.480]  And what is the in-game.com?
[27:02.480 --> 27:04.800]  I'm already ranting off into that area.
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.920]  But the globalist hate our trips.
[27:08.920 --> 27:11.080]  That's why they have amused EU weapons
[27:11.080 --> 27:13.040]  that they know will soft kill them.
[27:13.040 --> 27:14.960]  That's why they inject them with experimental vaccines.
[27:14.960 --> 27:16.320]  They know don't protect them from anthrax
[27:16.320 --> 27:18.600]  and smallpox that kill them on record
[27:18.600 --> 27:20.200]  until there's mass refusal.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.640]  Then they have to back off.
[27:21.640 --> 27:22.480]  They don't care.
[27:22.480 --> 27:24.600]  Now they're just trying to make nurses take it in hospitals.
[27:24.600 --> 27:27.480]  All these jobs now where we need to put something
[27:27.480 --> 27:29.680]  in your body before you can work here.
[27:29.680 --> 27:32.040]  Setting that precedent when Big Pharma
[27:32.040 --> 27:34.960]  and this whole system was set up by Eugenicist.
[27:34.960 --> 27:37.840]  Is Muhammad movie a contrived fraud?
[27:37.840 --> 27:40.240]  Paul Joseph Watson, bizarre story behind film
[27:40.240 --> 27:43.040]  that supposedly sparked Middle East unrest.
[27:43.040 --> 27:45.200]  An anti-Muslim film that has been blamed
[27:45.200 --> 27:47.160]  for the attacks on US embassies in Egypt,
[27:47.160 --> 27:50.000]  Libya and Yemen is likely a contrived fraud
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.360]  designed to stir up unrest in the Middle East
[27:52.360 --> 27:55.080]  while shielding the true reasons behind the murder
[27:55.080 --> 27:56.640]  of Ambassador Chris Stevens.
[27:56.640 --> 28:00.080]  And by the way, even the Jerusalem Post is saying this.
[28:00.080 --> 28:03.680]  Paul had his article out and then I see this one here
[28:03.680 --> 28:05.000]  out today as well.
[28:06.240 --> 28:09.800]  And it says officials doubt anti-Islam film creators
[28:09.800 --> 28:11.240]  identity.
[28:11.240 --> 28:13.080]  Yeah, I mean, it looks low budget.
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.440]  We would do a better job in one take here.
[28:15.440 --> 28:17.720]  We, you've seen the joke videos we do
[28:17.720 --> 28:20.400]  of cover commander and Don Corzine
[28:20.400 --> 28:22.400]  and stuff like that, John Corzine.
[28:22.400 --> 28:24.920]  I mean, this is, they're calling this,
[28:24.920 --> 28:28.000]  this was made with $5 million by rich Jews.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.680]  You could just see MI6, CIA, Mossad.
[28:32.680 --> 28:33.920]  I mean, I'm sure they were all involved
[28:33.920 --> 28:36.920]  in the production, it may even be an outside Merck group.
[28:36.920 --> 28:38.000]  Just laughing.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.040]  Here, how do we stir these people up?
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.200]  Say we got 5 million from rich Jews.
[28:43.200 --> 28:45.040]  Meanwhile, they shot this on a blue screen, you know,
[28:45.040 --> 28:47.440]  in the back acres at Blainley, Virginia.
[28:47.440 --> 28:51.040]  I mean, this is such a low budget piece of junk.
[28:51.040 --> 28:54.160]  5 million my foot, not even $5,000.
[28:54.160 --> 28:55.480]  I could go to the costume shop.
[28:55.480 --> 28:57.440]  I could recreate this today.
[28:57.440 --> 28:59.920]  I could go over to the costume shop,
[28:59.920 --> 29:01.520]  but so we don't stir the Muslims up.
[29:01.520 --> 29:04.280]  I could say I was, you know, playing the part
[29:04.280 --> 29:07.040]  of, you know, Uga Booga or something,
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.160]  but you know, dress up that way and copy it word for word
[29:11.160 --> 29:16.160]  and have it out by tomorrow for $500.
[29:16.920 --> 29:17.960]  Renting the costumes.
[29:17.960 --> 29:19.680]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[29:19.680 --> 29:21.160]  And then I could come out and say,
[29:21.160 --> 29:24.720]  well, yeah, we got 5 million from rich Jews.
[29:24.720 --> 29:27.200]  Yeah, the Jews don't like Muhammad.
[29:27.200 --> 29:28.440]  Yeah, here's a video.
[29:28.440 --> 29:30.040]  We're not gonna say who made it.
[29:31.080 --> 29:32.680]  So we can cause the Muslims to go out
[29:32.680 --> 29:35.760]  and try to kill a bunch of Jews so we can have World War III.
[29:35.760 --> 29:38.200]  I mean, how obvious does this have to get?
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.480]  But again, this propaganda is all targeted at people
[29:42.480 --> 29:46.240]  who are in a unconscious, dream-like state.
[29:46.240 --> 29:48.680]  Wake up, come alive.
[29:49.680 --> 29:51.080]  We're on the march.
[29:51.080 --> 29:53.560]  The empire's on the run.
[29:53.560 --> 29:56.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.280 --> 30:02.400]  The worst drought in 50 years continues.
[30:02.400 --> 30:04.320]  And the first six months of 2012 marks
[30:04.320 --> 30:05.840]  the hottest half year on record.
[30:05.840 --> 30:09.360]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[30:09.360 --> 30:12.160]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables,
[30:12.160 --> 30:14.720]  and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[30:14.720 --> 30:17.000]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.680]  and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[30:19.680 --> 30:21.440]  The only strategy to counter this
[30:21.440 --> 30:24.080]  is to freeze your food costs to today's prices
[30:24.080 --> 30:25.840]  by getting your own supply of foods
[30:25.840 --> 30:27.280]  from Eat Foods Direct now.
[30:27.280 --> 30:29.440]  As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[30:29.440 --> 30:31.160]  Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[30:31.160 --> 30:32.920]  Now is the time to get your supply.

[30:44.520 --> 30:45.760]  you're locking in today's prices
[30:45.760 --> 30:47.280]  and avoiding the rising food cost.
[30:47.280 --> 30:48.120]  Don't wait.

[31:00.000 --> 31:02.280]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks

[31:03.480 --> 31:05.480]  and laughing as you get sick and die.

[31:31.000 --> 31:34.160]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[31:34.160 --> 31:36.720]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,
[31:36.720 --> 31:37.560]  which is key.
[31:37.560 --> 31:39.440]  Save money by not buying bottled water
[31:39.440 --> 31:41.680]  and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[31:41.680 --> 31:44.400]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[31:44.400 --> 31:45.960]  It's what my family uses.

[31:59.800 --> 32:01.720]  For thousands of years, silver has been used
[32:01.720 --> 32:03.440]  as both a medicine and a preservative.
[32:03.440 --> 32:05.120]  But not all silver is equal.
[32:05.120 --> 32:07.160]  Silver Soul is an amazing new technology
[32:07.160 --> 32:09.520]  that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times
[32:09.520 --> 32:11.960]  more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[32:11.960 --> 32:14.080]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens
[32:14.080 --> 32:15.680]  than older silver technology.
[32:15.680 --> 32:17.680]  Silver Soul resonates at the same frequency
[32:17.680 --> 32:21.080]  as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses,
[32:21.080 --> 32:23.480]  enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[32:23.480 --> 32:25.480]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial

[34:26.020 --> 34:31.780]  and say see the tsa needs to be at highway checkpoints because al-qaeda works with the
[34:31.780 --> 34:36.380]  tea party that's what the army's being taught if you're a new listener going what just type

[35:03.980 --> 35:09.700]  two five nine ninety two thirty one you know you see how people like obama he gets the
[35:09.700 --> 35:14.500]  peace prize he's against war but there's more wars under him than under bush they just don't

[35:20.980 --> 35:28.820]  and blowing their heads off oh they're killing the the muslim minority groups oh they're
[35:28.820 --> 35:32.700]  killing the christians isn't it just cute all they're blowing up churches isn't it
[35:32.700 --> 35:39.820]  just cute isn't it just fun all of this going on while telling you we've got to search at
[35:39.820 --> 35:44.700]  the airport because al-qaeda might be in there might be in your carry-on luggage might be
[35:44.700 --> 35:50.820]  in your underwear but oh our government funds al-qaeda and now we knew that this was coming
[35:50.820 --> 35:59.700]  DHS warns muslim brotherhood and iran forming new terror access the muslim brotherhood
[35:59.700 --> 36:07.420]  is working with iran really even though the two groups have been at loggerheads and then
[36:07.420 --> 36:17.740]  it continues here we have reports coming out from CNN you name it where obama is to meet
[36:17.740 --> 36:25.500]  with the head of the muslim brotherhood but not with benjamin yet nyahu show show al-qaeda
[36:25.500 --> 36:31.860]  is working with iran which is totally made up and ridiculous iran a shiite they're suni
[36:31.860 --> 36:38.060]  and now the group that dhs says is working with iran is meeting with obama no it's the
[36:38.060 --> 36:41.260]  other way around and again i'm not saying iran's good either it's just the globalist
[36:41.260 --> 36:45.260]  are playing all sides off against each other just like they're playing it off against our
[36:45.260 --> 36:52.860]  country and europe as well to take everybody's liberties oh but here it is u.s. deploys drones
[36:52.860 --> 36:59.380]  destroyers and hunt for killers of american in libya oh they've got an invade libyan at
[36:59.380 --> 37:05.060]  a deal with the al-qaeda that they gave weapons in mingazi a year and a half ago and the u.s.
[37:05.060 --> 37:11.940]  special forces trained oh isn't that just special and there's more violent protest more american
[37:11.940 --> 37:16.060]  flags being burned down and people are just kind of halfway paying attention and they
[37:16.060 --> 37:27.620]  think oh well everything's fine everything's okay because at least the government is taking
[37:27.620 --> 37:35.260]  our liberties to keep us safe from iran and that dirty al-qaeda because those of us that
[37:35.260 --> 37:40.460]  are informed have to remember that this is cartoonish to us and over the top ridiculous
[37:40.460 --> 37:45.540]  but to the general public the general public if you know your state's capital they think
[37:45.540 --> 37:50.420]  you're showing off the general public if you know how to tie your shoelaces you're you're
[37:50.420 --> 37:56.700]  a valedictorian the general public if you don't drool while while while seated you know
[37:56.700 --> 38:01.460]  they see you as i mean literally i see want to be intellectuals with newspapers in public
[38:01.460 --> 38:06.100]  showing off that they're reading newspapers are showing off that you know that's like
[38:06.100 --> 38:11.860]  upper crust if you if you know the three branches of government oh my gosh you're like some
[38:11.860 --> 38:17.540]  type of brainiac and these are so-called executives and people are running to they watch the news
[38:17.540 --> 38:21.220]  they regurgitate the talking points and then feel like they're smart instead of actually
[38:21.220 --> 38:26.700]  knowing that itself is a spectrum of disinformation so the general public doesn't even watch the
[38:26.700 --> 38:30.180]  news and has no idea of what's going on they just see some brown people burning american
[38:30.180 --> 38:35.420]  flags and you know are told tsa needs to funnel them to make sure everything's safe and then
[38:35.420 --> 38:38.420]  you've got people that actually watch the news who think they're real informed and that's
[38:38.420 --> 38:42.940]  a bunch of deceptive twisted pap and then you've got you know the kind of the politico
[38:42.940 --> 38:47.700]  types who are just jockeying for political control and to climb the ladder and then you
[38:47.700 --> 38:53.340]  got those of us that are informed and just don't want to be slaves so it's on folks
[38:53.340 --> 38:57.660]  u.s. since two warships to libyan coast to deal with the al qaeda they put in charge and
[38:57.660 --> 39:02.660]  there's now 10 000 missiles missing as you know with 2000 of them heat seeking or radar
[39:02.660 --> 39:08.820]  guided and oh we got to have checkpoints on the highways now they're actually saying that
[39:08.820 --> 39:13.460]  well the tsa needs to have checkpoints randomly because there could there's some missiles loose
[39:13.460 --> 39:18.900]  we need to search all your vehicles because we we gave missiles to al qaeda and the average
[39:18.900 --> 39:24.260]  person here on that can't even find libya on a map i've seen jay walking episodes where
[39:24.260 --> 39:28.660]  people can't even find the us on a world map but doesn't have the name on it i mean i mean
[39:28.660 --> 39:34.780]  it is a joke it is a joke what this country's turned into and it's television you turn on
[39:34.780 --> 39:39.900]  television all of it is a destructive message the new normal and people are like oh don't
[39:39.900 --> 39:45.100]  you be anti alternative lifestyle that isn't even on my radar screen but you know what my
[39:45.100 --> 39:50.820]  kids can't watch television because you want to confuse them every every time i turn the
[39:50.820 --> 39:57.220]  television on at night to see what's on it's anti male anti family pro abortion anti gun
[39:57.220 --> 40:05.020]  pro big government there to screw people up trying to make sure that people get confused
[40:05.020 --> 40:09.380]  trying to make sure and what did the government documents club of roman others said they said
[40:09.380 --> 40:15.780]  they would promote homosexuality and all this and in the family so no one had families to
[40:15.780 --> 40:21.380]  stand together and so the government could control new coalitions of government families
[40:21.380 --> 40:27.780]  and sexual orientation families that is then refereed by the system and so you don't have
[40:27.780 --> 40:34.460]  children so you reduce population i mean europe can't even have 1.3 children for every two
[40:34.460 --> 40:40.180]  adults they're dying russia can't even have 1.2 children japan can't even have 1.3 it
[40:40.180 --> 40:47.660]  leads down to what 1.1 all the old cultures are absolutely dying by design as people
[40:47.660 --> 40:52.980]  are taught oh no have fun you'll be fulfilled don't have children don't get married or if
[40:52.980 --> 40:58.020]  you do marriage is hellish children are horrible old people are gross don't take care of your
[40:58.020 --> 41:05.580]  parents euthanize them when meanwhile family and children and the true order of human development
[41:05.580 --> 41:11.860]  on this planet is what is fulfilling it's it's it's it's everything all the blessings
[41:11.860 --> 41:16.660]  are right there and the statistics show it these people that follow the alternative lifestyles
[41:16.660 --> 41:22.420]  they have the lowest life expectancy they are they have the highest suicide rates they
[41:22.420 --> 41:31.500]  are in living neurotic hells i don't sit there and hate you because of what you do sexually
[41:31.500 --> 41:37.460]  i am angry at the globalist for going in and trying to program you and putting chemicals
[41:37.460 --> 41:47.120]  in your food that in thousands of studies cause every mammal species to become bisexual
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.100]  and then the media gets mad about that runs a national stories about alex jones says juice
[41:51.100 --> 41:57.020]  boxes make you gay actually i said juice boxes give you breast cancer and testicular
[41:57.020 --> 42:02.740]  cancer because they cause them to artificially age and of course now that's all admitted
[42:02.740 --> 42:10.260]  what was in the studies you see this is chemical warfare am i upset that amphibians have two
[42:10.260 --> 42:14.420]  sexual organs once they're exposed to this is because i'm freaked out by the sexual organs
[42:14.420 --> 42:20.780]  of a frog no i'm not freaked out by the sex it's not oh my gosh oh i'm i'm the square
[42:20.780 --> 42:30.500]  who no i i know scientifically that the amphibians and the fish and other species are getting
[42:30.500 --> 42:37.860]  cancer and having multiple sexes and becoming sexually confused there's another article
[42:37.860 --> 42:45.020]  lead found in juice boxes in high levels you need microscopic amounts of lead and things
[42:45.020 --> 42:49.660]  and mercury but that's if it's bound in a natural form not the artificial forms it's
[42:49.660 --> 42:54.940]  like the fluoride they put in the water has been manipulated to where it's totally acidic
[42:54.940 --> 42:59.780]  and literally thousands of times more powerful what is it they removed an electron but but
[42:59.780 --> 43:04.300]  i'm already i'm already digressing here ladies and gentlemen they count on your ignorance

[46:22.620 --> 46:27.740]  ran paul endorsed romney enthusiastically got really upset and it was because i'd watched
[46:27.740 --> 46:37.500]  jessie benton behind the scenes not go after romney uh and and that's now been admitted by
[46:37.500 --> 46:43.580]  dugweed you know top of the campaign that that was jessie benton's decision jessie benton can
[46:43.580 --> 46:49.820]  hardly talk folks i'm not trying to be mean it's just i mean he's not that smart uh but but but
[46:49.820 --> 46:54.300]  jessie benton said so uh and again you gotta blame ron paul on the final equation for that
[46:54.300 --> 46:59.180]  okay because really i've just got to be honest about this i'm done talking about ron paul
[46:59.180 --> 47:03.820]  i'm done talking about any of it i still think they're good guys overall i think you know ran's
[47:03.820 --> 47:11.420]  doing some good work in the senate overall but if people call in about ron paul you're not gonna
[47:11.420 --> 47:16.940]  get the responses you've got for me in the past okay i i just you don't want to go there with me
[47:16.940 --> 47:23.180]  okay because i know too much all right and i don't see already said mean things about jessie
[47:23.180 --> 47:27.020]  benton he doesn't matter i said two weeks ago you watch he's gonna go work for the main line
[47:27.020 --> 47:32.700]  republican party because i knew that from inside okay and now it's all over the news today that
[47:32.700 --> 47:39.980]  he's going to work for mitch mcconnell so he basically though was just a scapegoat and an
[47:39.980 --> 47:46.060]  excuse for everything that went on uh we you know we've seen the video uh of at paul fest that was
[47:46.060 --> 47:55.260]  snubbed by the paul's and everybody um we've seen the footage where peter schiff shows people the
[47:55.260 --> 48:01.020]  text from jessie benton saying don't go to paul fest it's extremist and that's what i can't handle
[48:01.020 --> 48:05.900]  it's one thing of the if the paul's kind of get married off the republican establishment and try
[48:05.900 --> 48:10.860]  to influence it towards libertarianism and freedom in some way i get all that to a certain extent
[48:10.860 --> 48:16.300]  you can debate it either way but the jessie benton talking and acting like the southern private
[48:16.300 --> 48:22.460]  law center or adl uh and uh you know the things i've known have gone on behind the scenes the last
[48:22.460 --> 48:32.060]  few years uh and all the things that happened um it's just very sad to see after all this great
[48:32.060 --> 48:37.740]  work ron paul's done and that we've done supporting him patriots out there to just kind of see campaign
[48:37.740 --> 48:45.020]  for liberty and the whole political list of donors because i now get solicitations from neocons the
[48:45.020 --> 48:53.740]  list is out there has been given pretty much a list of my listeners because back four years ago
[48:53.740 --> 48:59.980]  ron paul said on the show half his donations and support came from this show and it's not that oh
[48:59.980 --> 49:04.460]  i'm i'm out in the cold or something because i don't you know just fall out of worship meant romney
[49:04.460 --> 49:12.780]  me because ron paul and them they lose not not being supported by you by us it's just that
[49:12.780 --> 49:21.020]  it's the headlong lust to call us extremists and behind the scenes you know try to sabotage
[49:21.020 --> 49:25.900]  paul fest and then see all those families ten thousand plus people show up and all those rock
[49:25.900 --> 49:31.100]  bands and people out there pathetically worshiping ron paul and they didn't even show up and then
[49:31.100 --> 49:35.660]  jessie benton's calling him extremist and then jessie benton goes to work for mitch mcconnell
[49:35.660 --> 49:42.860]  here's the washington post today mitch mcconnell hires ron paul aid to run his campaign we're
[49:42.860 --> 49:46.060]  committed to running a presidential level campaign in kentucky and that starts with a
[49:46.060 --> 49:50.380]  presidential campaign manager mcconnell said in a statement jessie is literally the best
[49:50.380 --> 49:54.460]  in the business at building an organization conservative grassroots movement no he's not
[49:54.460 --> 49:59.820]  he's the best at going on my show and other libertarian and constitutional shows and getting our
[49:59.820 --> 50:04.940]  money and our support and now he's taking that list over to the republican party and mitch mcconnell
[50:04.940 --> 50:09.180]  that's what went on now i'm done talking about this and i'm not going to talk about ron paul
[50:09.180 --> 50:14.620]  anymore when people call him with stars in their eyes i'm about to throw up on the radio okay so
[50:14.620 --> 50:21.580]  just please don't do it don't do it in fact i know a lot more folks and i'm not going there
[50:22.140 --> 50:28.860]  i want to forget about it okay i want to forget about it and just i like the constitution i like
[50:28.860 --> 50:35.900]  the bill of rights i like people that support it uh the paul's got star struck ron paul got old
[50:35.900 --> 50:40.780]  whatever they sailed off of the sunset and they're hooked up with the republican party
[50:41.340 --> 50:46.860]  and jessie binton's a genius and i'm an extremist okay and you're an extremist and all those
[50:46.860 --> 50:53.420]  families at paul fester scum i'm going to stand with those families okay okay that's who i'm with
[50:53.420 --> 50:57.260]  i'm with the american people not with mitch mcconnell well they're right back i'm not going

[54:15.260 --> 54:23.500]  you know if i ever talk about the ron paul issues i want to do it professionally in a
[54:23.500 --> 54:32.940]  tape prepackaged you know focused uh news piece and i don't really see even any good in that
[54:32.940 --> 54:37.100]  because ron paul and rand paul are not our enemies they're our friends overall
[54:38.620 --> 54:44.380]  but if somebody i don't know does me wrong it's it's not personal i don't get upset that's just
[54:44.380 --> 54:53.580]  life when we've worked and been passionate and defended and done so much for someone and to
[54:53.580 --> 55:01.580]  watch them really turn their back on the liberty movement uh and but but but but rope a dope keep
[55:01.580 --> 55:06.460]  everybody going along like he was going to be president when rand was already announcing you
[55:06.460 --> 55:11.340]  know five months ago that it was a done deal last time he was on the show that you know that you
[55:11.340 --> 55:19.260]  know things that already been decided it was it was all just an exercise in in capitalizing on a
[55:19.260 --> 55:29.260]  political list and raising money and again the whole thing piloted by jessie benton but i can't
[55:29.260 --> 55:35.740]  morally just blame it on him but then to see the venom towards paul fest which was pretty milk
[55:35.740 --> 55:41.900]  toast a lot of mainline people there you know lou rockwell uh folks like that there um
[55:44.540 --> 55:49.660]  peter schiff you name it and then to not have ron paul at that and they're not even having to show up
[55:51.260 --> 55:56.140]  and then they'll learn benton was calling them all extremists it it's just to know the people that
[55:57.100 --> 56:02.620]  brought ron paul to the party brought rand paul to the party i mean i encouraged off air and on air
[56:02.620 --> 56:08.300]  ran to run uh back when he was here in austin visiting and didn't even have any politicos with
[56:08.300 --> 56:14.460]  him you know years before he even ran i remember interviewing ran paul when his dad was running
[56:14.460 --> 56:20.380]  for congress 16 years ago 17 years ago when he was running again for congress he'd been out of
[56:20.380 --> 56:24.060]  congress and i remember interviewing him when he was out there you know promoting his dad i
[56:24.060 --> 56:30.780]  remember interviewing him 10 years ago it's just to see people totally become plastic and political
[56:30.780 --> 56:37.340]  and then to have benton calling us extremists it's it's an insult it's like man that's really
[56:37.340 --> 56:43.100]  nasty i mean i i kind of understand going and trying to influence the republicans and merging
[56:43.100 --> 56:47.180]  with that power structure thinking you can work from within i don't really agree with that overall
[56:47.180 --> 56:54.300]  but i i get it i could forgive you that but but the the nastiness the i mean we don't see this
[56:54.300 --> 57:01.740]  type of nastiness except out of democrats towards libertarians and constitutionalist and people and
[57:01.740 --> 57:06.300]  and kind of using adl southern prairie law center talking points and now he works for
[57:06.300 --> 57:12.300]  mitch mcconnell and it's and and mcconnell's like oh we're hiring him because jesse's the best
[57:12.300 --> 57:18.220]  really jesse's the best you mean he's got the rand paul list of contributors and email addresses
[57:18.220 --> 57:26.060]  and jesse probably believes he's really this darling and oh jesse you're so smart here here come
[57:26.060 --> 57:33.340]  come come run our senate campaign so it's all about as i said months ago jesse benton being this
[57:33.340 --> 57:40.220]  big politico and this big star and all about him married to ron paul's granddaughter so the so the
[57:40.220 --> 57:47.260]  so the ron paul revolution had to get derailed to a great extent because some punk married ron paul's
[57:47.260 --> 57:51.980]  granddaughter i'm done don't call my show folks about ron paul i don't ever want to hear about him
[57:51.980 --> 57:57.660]  again okay we don't ask him on the show we don't want him on the show go hang out hang out with
[57:57.660 --> 58:03.500]  your republicans because ron paul i know you know about all this i don't want just i'm done you don't
[58:03.500 --> 58:11.660]  want us we don't want you okay we don't need you we're not gonna compromise if i needed to sell out

[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.740]  and i tried to go to your phone calls we just joined us and i kind of went off on
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:43.180]  as the whole ron paul thing is my feelings are hurt i like the ideas of ron paul i know he's a
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:48.860]  good man he's never compromised we still hear good things out of him but we hear totally
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.820]  different stuff out of his campaign and the people that work for him and rand is drifting
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.060]  more and more and it's just very very painful and i tend to want to scapegoat and just blame
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:03.260]  jesse betton because he is an unsavory terrible person but i don't want to talk about it anymore
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:08.860]  we got serious news here ron paul's not our enemy it's just painful do you understand
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.780]  when people call in about it now or i see articles it's like it hurts okay it hurts i'm a real
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.260]  person i'm not one of these fake plastic corporates who doesn't care about everybody
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:26.460]  like i say have i stepped on a lizard in my house or gecko and it's flopping around with its
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:32.860]  you know gut sticking out i get upset and you call me a wimp or whatever i just once i
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:39.500]  like people once i commit to people it hurts man and and and again i don't want to even sit
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.420]  there and talk about about people without giving the evidence of it as well but then it's like
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:51.340]  what's the point it's a done chapter it's over okay i just don't want to hear about it i don't
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.820]  want to hear about we need ron paul to run he'll he'll save us he hadn't doing jack squad okay
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.100]  and that's fine i understand that strategy of try to influence the republican party from
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.500]  within they're having some success i try to be positive i said hey maybe they're right a few
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:11.500]  months ago and then i find out about more stuff behind the scenes where they absolutely jesse
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:17.260]  benton and others are saying you know to ron paul ron paul everybody get away from your old base
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.740]  you're a rock star now one time i was on the phone with one of them i'm not going to say which person
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:27.980]  one of the senior people they're like ron paul's a rock star now i'm like this isn't about being a
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.700]  rock star this is about information this is about civilization this isn't about you know
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:40.700]  oh he's all over television and i just i just the weakness of humanity i love humanity i love our
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:49.020]  strength i know i'm weak as well i just all that matters is you don't sell out and see if you were
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:55.020]  already in a camp and that's what you do that's one thing it's that when you go and you use people
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.980]  and then you treat them like trash it's bad to use somebody you ever heard the old saying you can
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:07.500]  crap on me but don't rub it in i mean you know it's it's it's it's outrageous it's outrageous
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.780]  now see i've already digressed here i'ma shut up right there in fact they brought me this
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.940]  article this morning mitch mcconnell hires ron paul aid and i and i saw it and i'd already seen
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:21.980]  it i said no i'm not going to cover it and the caller the caller set me off and again it's not
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:28.540]  like i've even censoring info it doesn't matter we've got world war three gearing up we've got the
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:35.740]  dollar melting down other currencies qe three we've got all of this serious stuff going on
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:41.660]  and then there's these pipe dreams ron paul running was a great thing because it did influence people
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.500]  that exposed the private fellow reserve it exposed the new world order but

[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.460]  then we're going to talk about the good news that's right they announced last week we had
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:42.540]  tyrell his son on is one of the producers of the show and one of the stars of third season with

[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.980]  al-ci aida being put in libya and syria now we've got to invade because they're blowing up our
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:03.740]  embassies and killing people uh and then we'll also get into his take on the new world order
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.220]  being announced openly we're going to play some clips of the news saying that and get his take
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.460]  on 2012 and all this hubbub uh jesse great to have you back with us
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:23.260]  and we just had him and that yeah i think we lost him go ahead and get him back on that phone
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:28.220]  line's been dropping go ahead and get him back on that was a that was a good build up and then
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.860]  not have the guests there these phone lines are weird all right continuing though i want to get in
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:40.060]  with him into this report right here us sends two warships to libyan coast
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:48.380]  again two us navy guided missile destroyers uh were sent towards the coast of libya following
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:54.620]  the killing of us ambassador to libya and three consulate employees fox news reported citing
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:10:02.300]  unnamed military officials ambassador christ stevens and three other americans were killed
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:09.980]  on tuesday after the diplomatic facility in banghazi was attacked by an armed mob angry
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:17.660]  over a us production film that is said to be insulting to islam's prophet muhammad now think
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:24.940]  about that and then this film looks like a total and complete shy op at every single level
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:33.100]  uh continuing consulate attack nato stuge is now ludicrously point finger at qaddafi loyalist
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:40.860]  blame attempt to shift blame away from us backed extremist so now they're trying to claim that these
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:46.780]  are groups loyal to qaddafi or that it's iranians it's admitted wahhabist al qaeda that's been doing
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:53.100]  this i mean that's even admitted in the british press and the german press and and other outfits
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:11:01.660]  this is this is not debatable this is not debatable what's going on now i see him in there on the
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:05.100]  phone since i think we are having a phone system problem and i was going to get to this at the
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:10.380]  start of the next hour i want to go to this i want to go to this right now uh while we go
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:14.700]  deal with that because this is a report speaking of ron paul would it be great if ron paul ran for
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.700]  texas governor i mean he would have already been running uh you know that elections coming up here
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:24.860]  in just a year or so he would have been president for four years imagine ron paul as governor but
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:30.540]  do we get jessie binton as governor you know is the question and our very own david or tees
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.380]  reported on this so we're going to go to this report ron paul for governor here i am saying i
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:39.980]  don't want to hear about ron paul anymore because we've got to move on now to the rest of the election
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:53.180]  and then we're airing a report on ron paul uh but here it is while chance of president paul have
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:58.220]  long been silenced the congressman's supporters may still have an unexpected opportunity to get
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:04.860]  ron paul elected to high office that's because in 2014 the seat for texas governor will be open
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:10.540]  while a spokesperson for the congressman has stated to info wars that the doctor is not interested
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:16.700]  in the position many activists can argue that a large-scale grassroots effort promoting this idea
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:22.220]  could prompt them to reconsider current texas governor rick perry has stated he does intend
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:27.580]  to seek re-election despite the fact he has already held this position for 12 years and
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:33.900]  a recent dallas morning news poll shows a majority of texans don't think he should run again i recently
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.700]  asked visitors at the texas capital building in austin what they thought of this possibility
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:45.340]  do you think ron paul should run for governor of texas yes why i think he's a good politician
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.180]  he gives the rights to the people not as much government interference which is something i'd
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.700]  prefer um he's also very confident politician very experienced and i believe he'd do a great job
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.860]  do you think he has a shot of winning possibly if he gets his message out there and really conveys
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:09.100]  to the people that he is uh the best in interest in his mind is texans i think he should yeah i mean
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:14.620]  it seems like a a guy that might uh actually do a little bit better than rick perry it seems to be
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:18.460]  a little bit more caring for people and stuff like that another man do you think ron paul would have a
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:25.500]  shot of winning a realistic shot of winning not really um do you think ron paul should run for
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:31.580]  governor of texas no i don't i really don't why not i don't care for him too much i just don't
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:36.220]  care for his policies and some of the things he stands for do you think he could win if he ran
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:44.060]  um probably not it's it's it's hard to tell but i don't think so but a lot of people don't care
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.460]  for some of his issues but i mean some of he has that are good but the underlying things i really
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:54.380]  don't care for i don't think so because he doesn't really have any experience in governing do you
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:14:02.060]  think he could win if he ran for governor of texas i don't think so why not uh he's not he's too
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:07.180]  too much of an individual and not part of the machine you have to be part of the machine here
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:13.100]  in order to win if ron paul were to win the election he would be 79 years old on election day
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:17.820]  while some may argue that his elder age would be viewed as a negative to his campaign it is
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:22.620]  important to note that he would have been serving as a public servant at this age had he won the
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:27.980]  presidency advocates can also argue that a statewide campaign would be far less taxing on
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:34.140]  the congressman and his family than a national campaign and that he can choose to serve for
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:40.620]  just one term in a recent blog posted by former paul spokesman doug weed he states that he does
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:46.460]  not rule out the possibility that dr paul will run for public office again however he was referring
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:52.460]  to a presidential run a recent university of texas paul shows that most state residents are happy
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:57.900]  with the direction the state is currently going in the survey also shows that while the economy is
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:03.580]  the most important issue for most americans illegal immigration and border security are the two most
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:09.900]  important issues for texas residents i spoke to however would want dr paul to address another issue
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:15.980]  if he were to win uh you know i've been reading a few articles about um people that are wrongly
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:21.100]  convicted and to me that's kind of disheartening because um you know i don't know anybody personally
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.860]  there was in that situation but from hearing the stories and stuff like that you know kind of
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:30.700]  devastation family i'd like to see any governor or any candidate for governor address the death
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:37.820]  penalty and speak about abolishing it again it's very unjust always fighting on behalf of liberty
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:43.420]  for info wars nightly news i'm david orteez all right there goes david orteez now if i was a
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:47.660]  conspiracy terrorist i'd say they killed our phone lines we never had that happen before i was
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:53.900]  talking to the governor ventura during the break it was working fine we go to air and the uh line
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:16:00.140]  was still there but no audio but we now have governor ventura back with us now uh getting into
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:06.940]  his new book demo cribs and reblobblicans gov good to have you with us hi alexa it's a pleasure
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.780]  that's just good to have you here now it's good to hear your voice well i tell you your book
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:15.260]  your book couldn't come out at a better time tell us i mean i've read it it's an excellent book but
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:21.020]  tell us why you wrote this new bestseller well i wrote it because i want people to understand
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:27.340]  that we have a completely broken system created by the democrats and republicans uh it's a system
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:33.420]  based completely on bribery uh if you do bribery in the private sector of course you go to jail
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:39.020]  but uh it's alive and well in our political arena because that's how it works if you don't
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:43.660]  grease the palm of the congressman or senator you're not going to get an audience with them
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.020]  it's how money talks and you know what else works
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:56.140]  well you're right about that and you know it's becoming more and more evident that that that
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:17:02.140]  romney and obama are bought and paid for by the same interest so where do you see it going uh
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:06.700]  you know once one of these stooges gets back in and the globalists just continue this takeover
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:12.220]  well i think it'll just continue on that's the thing you know when they always like to tell you
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:17.500]  if you vote for a third party candidate you're wasting your vote you've heard that alex yes well
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:23.100]  i'd like to reverse that and say that if you vote for a democrat or republican you're wasting your
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:28.300]  vote because you're going to get the same government it does not matter with these two
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:32.860]  as you stated they're both bought and paid for if you go to their two conventions
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:37.020]  you'll see the same lobbyists there with trunks full of money paying them a laugh
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:42.460]  and uh so it makes no difference who wins because we will have the same policies
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:47.820]  and i fully expect as soon as the election's over that within a year or so we're going to be at war
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:55.260]  in iran let's get into that right now because we were talking before we went on air about the fact
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:18:02.140]  that they admittedly put al-qaeda and libya and syria the nato's funding them and then the wahhabis
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:06.780]  shoot up and kill the ambassador they're attacking our embassies and now they're dispatching marines
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:13.820]  and warships and predator drones to deal with the saudi arabian jihadis our government put in there
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:19.980]  i mean this is this is even crazy for the new world order well you know uh everyone likes to
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:25.900]  hold ronald reagan up on that pillar and let's go back to ronald reagan you remember when the marines
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:30.780]  were attacked attacked in lebanon that time and they killed at the barracks they killed like 200
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:37.420]  of them yes did ronald reagan start a war absolutely not he got the hell out of there
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:45.500]  and uh that's my view on this if these countries don't want us there then let's leave and let's
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:51.980]  leave with our foreign aid i can't believe today and there's where i stand with ron paul completely
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:58.380]  we need to cut off foreign aid to any foreign country and we need to do it for not only those
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:06.220]  reasons but the economic reasons alex our country's broke now let's put that in layman's terms it would
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:11.340]  be like if you were losing your house because you couldn't make mortgage payments and you're
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:17.660]  going to lose your car because you can't make car payments and yet your your cousin joe from
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:25.420]  california calls you and wants needs 500 bucks and you send it to him i mean our country's broke
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:31.180]  how can we possibly give out foreign aid but as you covered your tv show with the wall street
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:36.860]  insiders they're just loaning us fiat made up digits so why not get us in more debt the big
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:42.780]  megabanks they stand again by countries being in debt oh yeah but i mean as far as on a political
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:49.980]  front if i if i became president there would be no foreign aid i would close every international
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:57.260]  base and bring all our troops home and uh and i would and i would have courage enough to carve
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:03.580]  into that defense budget because it is so bloated you notice that when they talk about cutting
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:09.820]  government and cutting government spending it's never it's never the defense budget is it and
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:16.940]  how many countries do we have troops in it's like 165 yeah it's absurd we're an empire and every empire
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:22.460]  falls i mean you'd think somebody would read the history of the roman empire and realize wait a minute
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:27.100]  we're going right down that path ourselves and there's no difference to it why is it going to
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:34.060]  be any different now you're right these countries don't want us there these muslim countries then
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:41.420]  let's get the hell out of there let's see that's just it we're there because our corporations want
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:48.060]  to be there and the corporations run the united states of america now it ain't the politicians
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:54.380]  that call the shots it's corporate board board heads that do it and it's total corporate welfare
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:21:00.140]  that multinational corporations give paltry sums of money to politicians and then they
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:05.260]  commit our money our treasure our blood our young men and women to go into these countries
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:11.900]  and then antagonize all these people it's just amazing and we're paying for all of it you know
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:17.020]  what you know what you know it's in my book alex i've read it it's like this did you know that
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:23.260]  most of the big multinational corporations spend more money on lobbyists than they pay in taxes
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:32.220]  yes isn't that our outrage they spend more money on lobbying and getting our elected officials into
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:40.380]  their back pocket than what they do paying taxes to our government to run it we pay the taxes and
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:46.700]  they make the decisions what do you see happening i mean i understand it's rearranging deck chairs
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:53.340]  and the titanic but uh it looks to me like romney uh is probably going to end up uh
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.940]  getting in there what's your take on that statement oh i don't think so not after the
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:05.980]  blunder he made today the latest polls now have obama had 50 to 43 i did see that because romney
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:11.740]  turned it political and attacked obama when when uh this tragedy happened to the you know over in
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:18.700]  libya and all that stuff where they should have worked to bring the country together and instead
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:24.940]  romney went ahead and drove the axe through the divide and he blamed it all on obama and all of that
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:30.780]  and uh the public reacted very negative even a lot of the big leagues in his own republican party
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:37.100]  said he blew it and the latest polls now show obama with a strong seven-point lead sure well
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:44.380]  that's john mccain john mccain uh went with this ambassador to actually stir it all up over there
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:49.820]  and fund al qaeda going in so he has a stake in this not coming out i'm not defending romney
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:56.620]  uh but the issue here is you know it was mr peace prize that has helped start all these wars
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:03.260]  using jihadis and so uh i can see why the power structure doesn't like the fact that romney
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.420]  brought that up but i agree with you romney was pulling ahead until this new event but
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:12.860]  election is still what 50 something days away yeah it is and you know but i'll tell you that
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:20.380]  that if i can't believe the short memory people have i mean everything's about the economy and
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:25.020]  jobs right that's the big thing they thought that that they think the election's over yes
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:30.700]  well who ruined the economy it was the republicans they were the ones that took the handcuffs
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:37.420]  off well street allowed them to rape and pillage us and george disson dictainy are responsible
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:43.260]  for all the wars and that the bad economy in fact and i'm not an obama supporter don't get me
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:47.020]  wrong i despise no but they're all guilty you're right no no i mean i mean they're all guilty
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:52.780]  when they point fingers at each other it's a joke but but alex how do they think the republicans
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.860]  are going to save the economy when it was the republicans that initially ruined it
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:03.340]  they don't they know the lemmings out there don't even have a memory that goes back over a year
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:09.740]  i said to my wife in the o eight election i said i wouldn't want to be the next president for anything
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:15.420]  because whoever it is is going to get all the blame for what george bush and dictainy did no
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:20.300]  no you said that on this that's exactly the way it's working governor you said that on this show
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.220]  you said that i mean obama is going to get you know obviously the blame for everything i mean
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:29.180]  even george bush said that uh hey i don't think obama is going to be the top that complains and
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:36.220]  says poor me uh when obama was president elect you know bush was uh in a press conference
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:40.940]  and basically pointed out that obama was going to get the blame for everything oh yeah and and
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:45.820]  our idiot memories of the people of this country they can't think back that far you know they got
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:51.020]  about a year that they can remember and and they don't realize that it was bush that did the first
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:56.540]  bailout it was bush that started all the wars people need to understand this and i speak from
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:04.380]  experience here yeah on the economy its decisions made about four years ago that affected today
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:11.980]  so when the economy went sour in 2008 it was decisions made back in 2003 4 and 5
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:18.700]  that caused that to happen in 08 it does not happen overnight because it's so big and large
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:24.700]  that it takes about three years or four years for decisions to have their impact on the economy
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:30.380]  well i agree with you but expanding on that you know being a former governor former mayor talk
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:36.620]  show host author i mean a lot of life experience governor ventura what is your take on the future
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:42.220]  of this country we have 1.4 billion bullets bought by homeland security in the last 11 months the
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:47.500]  media spends it and says it's about 174 000 bullets for social security they won't even address it
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:52.380]  there they've got tsa now in all 50 states on the highways train stations and bus stations
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:59.260]  starting to pop up we've got the the military admitting they're preparing for civil unrest
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:06.060]  what do you think they're gearing up for i don't know obviously something very bad and we'll
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:12.460]  transition to my tv show now if we may which will tie into this uh the new season starts
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:19.660]  november 7th 10 eastern 9 central on 2 tv and one of the interesting shows we show you this
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:24.860]  here is in ozark missouri there's a complete underground city we discovered it
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:32.940]  and i've really wanted to investigate that i'm glad you guys did uh it all over the country the
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:38.540]  elites are building these underground cities and bunkers even private ones and i know some of the
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:42.380]  amazing findings but i don't know how much we can say how much can you tell us about it
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:48.060]  well one of the interesting things here's an interesting thing we found out in ozark missouri
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:55.580]  city now the only new construction there except for this big 72 000 square foot single family
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:27:01.900]  dwelling on top of a hill that we that led us there that's another story but the only new
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:07.500]  things happening in this little town in missouri is the only thing being built are banks
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:15.420]  tons of banks and we found the statistics and it goes something like this there's one bank for
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:22.860]  every 11 000 people in new york city there's one bank for every 9 000 people in los angeles
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:31.820]  in ozark missouri there's now one bank for every 51 people incredible now how can 51 people support
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:40.860]  a bank they can't not unless there are multi-millionaires that's right and if it's an alternate government
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:47.580]  facility but i we found that very interesting a lady there said the only new things we have in
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:54.140]  this town she said i can't figure it out it's our banks she said we've got six or seven new banks
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:58.700]  that have moved here and yet our pop you you know and then we found out those statistics that there's
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:06.220]  now one bank for every 51 people in ozark missouri for minnesota governor jessie ventura is one of
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:11.660]  my favorite guests and a friend of mine wow jessie so much that you've talked about that i've talked
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:17.260]  about is just now out in the open i want to get more into the tv show and we come back from break but
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:24.460]  just what is your take on the fact that they just admit the nsa spies on us now they just admit the
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:29.980]  tsa's now dragging little kids off to private rooms i mean how much crazier is this going to get the
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:36.620]  drones are now getting armed alex it'll get as crazy as we allow it to get that's right and we
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:43.420]  seem to sit back we're not listening to ben franklin when benjamin franklin said the famous quote
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:48.540]  for those that will give up their liberty for security shall have and deserve neither that's
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:55.260]  right and and we better start listening to what mr franklin said or it's going to be too late all
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:29:00.620]  those people out there that think the government can make you safe are you kidding me the only
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:07.500]  way government can make you safe is to lock you down i always remember a cartoon i saw on a couple
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:12.940]  months back it showed a mom and a dad and a brother and a sister sitting at the dinner table
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:19.180]  and the captain they all said gee i sure feel safe now and the cartoon backs away and they're inside
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:26.220]  a jail cell you know you've always in the seven eight years i've known you know said basically i'd
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:32.220]  rather face the danger uh security is a prison and i don't know if you knew this but i was wondering
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.260]  where you got that because i thought you would come up with that and it made perfect sense
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:40.220]  turns out eisenhower guys pulled the quote during the break eisenhower said exactly that
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:46.700]  in a speech in 1949 to a university he later went on of course to be president jesse ventura
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:54.220]  will be with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:29.820]  the only thing lacking is freedom to white d eisenhower and he said that at columbia university

[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:39.020]  its common sense his new book democrats and republicans is available no more gangs of government
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:44.620]  excellent book at info war store dot com i carry all the best books and videos there on the site we

[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:55.580]  which is probably my favorite because it's all the little factoids and photos and documents

[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:15.100]  there certainly is an awakening i think that's what the police state buildup is in response to

[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:34.620]  are going to be in there well you know i can't tell you why it got held up alex uh we finished
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:41.420]  them on time in november of last year like we always do and all they said was it was editing
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:47.580]  and uh they dragged their feet dragged their feet and they finally got around and uh two weeks
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:53.100]  ago i went and did my voiceover work on four of them and i still have to get back and do voice
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:59.500]  over on the final uh three but uh you know i'll do them but probably as the show starts breaking
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:04.300]  on television or whatever or right before to in october or whatever so they'll be done on time
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:09.260]  but i can't tell you why they waited that long maybe it's because they wanted to release it
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.980]  during the election cycle i don't know you know maybe that was what they had in mind they never
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:19.580]  told me right we weren't normally on in the winter like we always are but i don't mind being on in
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:24.620]  the furrow right now i think it's a great time slot that they moved us back to wednesday it was a
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:29.660]  huge mistake when they moved us from wednesday to friday friday is the worst night you could
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:36.620]  ever have on the second year but now we're back to wednesday at 10 eastern nine central and uh
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:42.780]  we're doing some pretty wild shows uh we do we do one that's very interesting does the united
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:50.780]  states have a death ray and of course that gets into tesla show uh we also do one on are they trying
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:36:00.780]  to create a humanity meaning a half monkey half man person so there's some wild stuff that we look
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:08.300]  into this year and i have a new team on board uh we we we brought on sharn stone who is the son of
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:15.180]  oliver stone the great film producer and sharn's a graduate of princeton university a very very
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:20.620]  bright kid and he fits perfect into our show because it's right down his alley because
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:26.540]  he's a huge studier of the illuminati and all that stuff he knows it inside and out now he has
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:31.500]  amazing understanding getting a chance to hang out with him quite a bit there on the shoes and
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:35.980]  of course tyrell's knocking it out of the park as well i just can't wait to see the episodes because
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:40.700]  i mean i was there in part of some of the investigations but i haven't seen any of it have
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:46.940]  you seen any of it yeah i've seen four shows the ones i've voiced over yeah i've seen them
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:52.140]  completely right now what there'll be except minus my voice over and a few uh a small little edits
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:56.540]  that they'll have to do to tighten it up a little bit but i've seen four of the shows and three of
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:02.700]  them i have not seen yet what would you say about this season compared to the other seasons i'd say
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:09.100]  this season it's even more bizarre and i think it's this season's going to be even more entertaining
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:15.340]  for people to watch because we also get into uh your buddy ike ike so whatever his name is
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:22.220]  i wish you guys wouldn't have got into it tell us what happened well you know i wouldn't have
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:29.340]  did it except it was on time magazines top 10 conspiracies i mean people believe this and
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:35.180]  you know we're also there to show the conspiracy but we're also there to show if the conspiracy we
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:40.700]  believe is a flood you know we play both sides so you don't believe the queen is a uh five and a
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:49.660]  half foot reptoid do i believe it yeah no no but i'll tell you it's very intriguing and entertaining
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:58.140]  alex because you know when you go back to ancient times why do well why do well carvings and pictures
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:04.060]  on caves and stuff are show reptiles who rock upright no i know it's it's kind of like the movie
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:10.460]  very intriguing and if you look at the birth of christianity okay how did christianity start
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:17.500]  allegedly according to the bible a man a woman and a talking snake well the snakes are reptile
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:24.540]  isn't it and then when you get into the fact that all of our brains have a certain small portion
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:31.660]  that's reptilian which means to tell me i believe in evolution that means that we were the same
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:39.020]  if you go back far enough well who's to say that they died or not jessey maybe you are a
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:44.780]  reptoid shape shifter well i don't know i could always swim pretty good and reptiles usually
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:51.020]  can swim hey i was inviting you down here to barton springs you'd love it uh tell us about the surfing
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:56.860]  oh well the surfing is fine my my wife's now doing a lot of paddle surfing she's doing it
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:02.700]  more than i am wait till you hear this one though alex this will this beats us in the united states
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:12.860]  of america in minnesota right you have to license a surfboard can you believe that
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:19.340]  and they require you to wear a life jacket now if laird hamilton the greatest big wave surfer
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:26.300]  in the world who rides 40 foot waves and he also tattlesurf if he came to minnesota to do a
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:34.780]  you know a lesson thing or whatever he would be required to license his surfboard and wear a
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:42.380]  life jacket that's something i want to get your take on because this nanny state is their real
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:47.660]  takeover system now with their not letting children run at school recess they've gotten rid of dodge
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:54.380]  ball touch football and now in in a suburb of houston in the country a woman in a rural area
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:40:01.180]  on a cul-de-sac her kids were riding on bicycles and scooters the police arrested her and said
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:07.580]  kids cannot be in a cul-de-sac i mean this nanny state is pure tyranny it's awful uh you know
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:13.980]  but you know there's a reason i was governor alex you know i what i figured out of the way around
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:20.780]  at minnesota i thought i when i was there to practice i brought surfboards and i did not
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:27.260]  license my surfboard you know how i got around it well when you license it you have to give them
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:34.300]  an address well i gave them my address in mexico so i didn't have to license my boards and the
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.820]  guy said yep that'll work he said as long as the address you give me on the sales thing is outside
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:45.260]  of the state of minnesota you do not have to pay for a license and people should always look for
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:49.660]  those loopholes because the establishment always puts those in there for themselves i was buying a
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:56.860]  small one-man tiny kayak for one of my children at academy a few months ago and they got in my face
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:01.740]  not rudely but you know hey the state police want this you need to register this and i said is it the
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:06.780]  law and they said no but but the police want it and i said what am i going to use it to blow up the
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:11.580]  dam and i said fine i'm not buying it and they said fine you're not getting it i started walking
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:16.460]  out the manager goes no no no you can have it and and governor we're talking about a 200 dollar
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:21.980]  little cheap plastic kayak i mean what type of country is this where where they want me to register
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:29.980]  my kayak the same country that i have to register a surfboard and get this alex there's no serial
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:36.140]  numbers on a surfboard so therefore how do they know the license of this surfboard even
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:42.700]  belongs to what about saying you got to wear a life preserver well i'll put it to you this way
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:48.300]  if you showed up on the beaches of haraii the beaches of california the beaches of mexico the
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:54.940]  surf beaches if you were wearing a life jacket they'd probably string you up well listen i was
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:42:00.540]  down at the texas coast uh just of three four months ago for uh one of my parents birthday's
[01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:05.580]  that they want to go down there it was a total nanny state uh now they have like these beach
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:10.300]  rangers coming up and harassing you and saying look out if you go back in there there's rattlesnakes
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:14.300]  and just i've been going to there my whole life and never had any interaction now it's
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:20.380]  total interaction over and over again like it was a a comedy yeah why do you think i live
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:28.540]  half the year in mexico mexico doesn't bother you with nonsense like that if you go out and kill
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:34.540]  yourself doing something well the mexican people they're very religious they will probably say a
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:40.140]  prayer for you and they will feel bad for you but ultimately they're going to say what a knucklehead
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:44.780]  he does why did he do that exactly but but that's what i'm talking about but to finish the brief
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:51.100]  story i actually saw people henpecking each other because now all the dogs including labradors
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:56.700]  in lakes and in the ocean are wearing these big life jackets and i saw a woman come over to people
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:02.380]  that had some dogs and said you ought to have your dog in a life jacket this new nanny state
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:06.940]  where people come and tell you what to do not just the cops what is going on in this country
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:15.420]  well you know i can only go back to the water alex everybody's drinking fluoridated water which
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:22.220]  of course we are no fluoride is the major ingredient to prosac and that's that's the only
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:26.700]  answer i can give you there they're dumbing themselves down and they're getting our docile
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:31.580]  because they're drinking prosac water by the way they call you conspiracy theorists for having
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:37.580]  that incredible episode one of my favorite last year on that governor ventura but the harvard study
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:42.460]  came out of two months ago and they looked at more than 20 studies and said it's conclusive
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:47.980]  fluoride sodium fluoride in the water it's actually an acid they remove an electron so it's
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:55.340]  worse that's why it's so bad it is toxic it causes cancer and it lowers iq massively so it's not
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:44:00.460]  debatable now so why is it still in our water governor exactly why did they put it in the
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:05.820]  water in the first place when you know when you find out the nazis were the first ones to put
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:12.700]  fluoride in the water so we're following some beautiful nazi type thinking exactly i want to
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:18.380]  know why in austin where i live because i've seen the film when when doctors go and speak to the
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:23.900]  council the mayor laughs at them i mean i'm telling you it is outrageous that they're doing this to us
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:31.740]  and they think it's funny i don't know how you got me and what brainerd minnesota brainerd minnesota
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:37.580]  voted their city council to not fluoridate the water the federal government came in and made them
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:43.180]  yeah and since one of the feds doing that in new jersey minnesota in texas i've seen now where the
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:50.940]  feds are ordering it oh absolutely brainerd minnesota their mayor and council voted that
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:56.380]  their public water that they did not want fluoride in their water and the federal government came in
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:02.780]  and told him oh no you're putting fluoride no matter and so you don't even get a choice anymore
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:08.460]  it's unbelievable i mean it is just such tyranny that we're seeing speaking of that i want to go
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:14.780]  to a few phone calls governor but before you go alex i got hot news for you and i'll tell you this
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:22.780]  for all your listeners please i stated that if a grassroots campaign took place across america
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:31.420]  grassroots and didn't cost any money if they got me ballot access in all 50 states and if the grassroots
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:37.740]  campaign could guarantee that i would be in the debates that i will give serious consideration
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:45.100]  in 2016 of running for president are you breaking that here pretty well i've said it a couple places
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:51.660]  but you're pretty well there are the same day so you're hearing it the same day wow well thank you
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:57.100]  for announcing that because our so it's up to the people of the united states of america if they
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:03.340]  want to form if they want to cross this great land of ours get me ballot access in our 50 states
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:10.220]  and then raise enough hell to ensure that i get look at it this way alex they always tell us that
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:17.260]  competition is tremendous in the private sector right it's good death competition how come there's
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:23.820]  no competition in the public sector why do we only get two choices why for 20 years have we not seen
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:28.220]  a third voice in a presidential election okay governor let me stop you this is a big deal we've
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:35.260]  been talking for 40 minutes here and now you drop this bomb show on us so i want to officially have
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:39.660]  your statement here so let me give you the floor for a few minutes please start over and make the
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:43.660]  announcement because my show is big enough that it'll probably end up breaking nationally here
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.780]  that you said on the show so governor ventura please make your announcement well i said that if a
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:55.180]  grassroots effort not a money effort i don't want millions of dollars raised and i don't want to do
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:47:01.820]  all that but if there's a grassroots blue collar effort out there and people do the legwork to get
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:09.900]  jesse ventura on the 2016 ballot for president and if we and if they can likewise guarantee me because
[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:16.220]  i've got to be in the debates i won't do it if i can't have an opportunity to win and the only
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:22.620]  way you can have an opportunity to win is you must be included in the debates if they can guarantee
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:30.060]  me the debates and guarantee me ballot access in our 50 states i will give very strong consideration
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:39.100]  to running for president in 2016 as a complete independent with no party well so you're announcing
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:45.100]  here today on the radio that you will run for president that's amazing because we've all
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:51.180]  been disheartened by the fact that ron paul didn't go third party uh that he didn't challenge mit rom
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:56.300]  anymore as we've now learned uh from one of their campaign people that they made the decision not to
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:02.380]  do that in michigan months and months and months ago uh and we need somebody third party to inject
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:08.460]  real issues well i don't want to even be a third party alex i'm talking about jesse ventura as a
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:17.340]  governor ventura as an individual not even a party me as an individual because my book advocates the
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:25.100]  abolishment of political parties so i do not want to be aligned with any party so you are a 100
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:33.260]  percent independent and you're saying get ballot access in get get me ballot access in all 50 states
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:40.540]  and i think port urico don't they vote do yes uh what's the time frame on that though get me
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:46.620]  ballot access in all 50 states to where i'll be on the ballot north 50 states and guarantee me that i
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:54.540]  can uh participate in the debates i will then give heavy consideration to running when i see that's
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:49:00.780]  in place when did you make this decision that you would throw your hat in the um 2012 presidential
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:08.700]  race 2016 but the 2016 one not this one no no i understand that but i mean when did you make
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:14.700]  the decision in 2012 well i just kept looking at the whole situation and realizing that something
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:19.900]  needs to be done to defeat and destroy this two-party as rough native but at the two-party
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:27.100]  dictatorship and i i am again i'm up for challenges and i think it would be just a
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:33.980]  riled affair to actually be a legitimate candidate for president and be part of no political party
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:41.580]  well we need someone who's got the personality the background and the understanding to do it
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:48.700]  and there is no one out there ron paul is going to be too old uh and uh there there's no one else
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:52.700]  who even has the integrity you know i don't agree with every single one of your political stances
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:58.060]  but i know that you're a real guy who cares about freedom and who can't be bought i mean i've studied
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:02.700]  what you did as governor why the whole system came after you why the whole media turned against you
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.780]  and it was because you couldn't be bought by special interest and that's what we need is somebody
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:11.740]  with integrity so that's very very exciting now governor so you're saying it's interesting alex
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:17.260]  when i was governor i didn't accept any pack money or anything at all no special interest money
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:25.340]  did you know for four years in office i never met runks with a lobbyist lobbyists were banned from
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:30.700]  my office i told my staff i said i don't need to meet with a lobbyist i said they didn't elect me

[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:16.780]  he's saying he's strong consideration but talking to him during the break he's pretty darn serious
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:22.140]  about it so that's exciting what's your take on the whole war on terror god i saw a recent quote of
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:27.740]  yours well i think the terrorists have run pretty well because they've certainly changed the united
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:33.820]  states of america since 9 11 i mean we're not the same country alex were locked down now we've
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:39.660]  lost all of many of our freedom rights and it keeps going in that direction it's not getting
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:45.020]  better they're not backing off unlocking us down they're even taking it farther and farther
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:52.060]  in a harder lockdown and i'm trying to figure out why well that latest interview did with uh
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:58.300]  joy bayhar uh is up at info wars dot com where you basically broke all of that down
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:03.660]  on uh let's go ahead and take a few calls real quick uh earnest in washington you're on the
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:08.700]  air with governor ventura then we'll go to john go ahead earnest well what a pleasure to speak
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:13.500]  the two american patriots uh your announcement governor's got my adrenaline going through the
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:19.340]  roof so i'm i'm so excited i can't even tell you well thank you i appreciate that like i said it's
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:24.620]  it's going to be a tough road to hold because you know the democrats and republicans are going
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:28.700]  to probably challenge everything in court and they're going to do all this stuff because
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:34.540]  as i said they don't want competition in the pop public sector they certainly tell you they enjoy
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:40.300]  it in the private sector but we haven't had a third voice in a debate for 20 years now
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:46.780]  and i think that's utterly ridiculous absolutely voted for that person earnest any quick questions
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:52.620]  yes i was wondering if you could just comment quickly on the list that westley clock brought up
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:56.620]  that we've gone through a lot of the countries already with the last one being iran yeah i mean
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:00.860]  it's all a plan they're stirring up the muslims with the cia produce film that's a good question
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:08.380]  governor yeah well you know it doesn't surprise me because the neocons that was part of their plan
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:14.540]  they're they're nailing every country that used to be a soviet satellite any country that was
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:21.020]  aligned anyway with the soviets back in the cold war the wars have been in every one of those
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:25.020]  countries i mean it's like clockwork that's right it's all part of a plan too but they always have
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:33.100]  a new excuse but it's all planned out john listing on 770 am was in ohio john you're on the air with
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:38.060]  governor ventura governor ventura i love i've loved you since you were wrestling i loved you as
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:42.300]  governor because i think you were one of the only ones that had the balls to look at these people
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:50.700]  and tell them they were wrong i don't know about that maybe the stupidity i just wanted to ask you
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:56.220]  you know uh well i got two i got one question for you and i got two statements for alex real
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:57:01.260]  fast buddy we got about a minute and a half here okay yeah um one question first question was why
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:06.380]  do you think oliver stone went so soft on bush in that movie he did it what you you know there were
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:10.220]  so many real scandals there that's a great question next question what's the other one
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:16.940]  next question was uh i saw the i just got the movie america was an old movie from the 80s about
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:21.500]  so listen he's got to go he's got to go got another interview so let's answer that question
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:27.820]  oliver stone's uh george bush worship fast is is a pro 9 11 thing the other goes along with
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:34.380]  the official story well again oliver's kind of uh in a little way kind of sold out because he wants
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:40.220]  to keep working you know so i think he's kind of moved away from all the controversial stuff and
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:45.660]  the film works and the film direction he's going now you know his son shawn would be the better
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:50.940]  person to ask about that rather than me you know i'm just giving you kind of a far-reaching opinion
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:56.700]  i don't really know you know shawn stone his son would be the better person to ask and he did tell
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:01.740]  me at one point that his father had kind of felt that he needed to change a pace you know he needed
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:06.620]  to go a new direction and i can understand that because oliver stone's taken a lot of grief for
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:12.220]  some of the great film work he's done he also has been arrested a few times and uh magically if you
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:18.940]  don't play ball goodbye goodbye uh sunshine you're gonna go underground in one of their boxes jesse

[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:59.260]  i i'm kind of glad that governor ventura wasn't on because how do you follow something like that
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:09.260]  and announcement that he might run so i am wondering i i have actually found out about you
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:17.900]  through uh ventura and through the conspiracy theory show uh wasn't big on the internet or
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:25.100]  anything uh then started doing some digging and immediately connected with you before that i was
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:32.700]  in a room uh screaming and nobody's listening uh but uh so i'm a little late on board uh last
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:38.300]  couple of months i i do subscribe to your service i think that's important oh thank you yeah well we
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:43.260]  couldn't do any of this if it wasn't for the members at prismplanet.tv so thank you so much
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:48.380]  ma'am yeah and listen don't feel bad that you've just now woken up that means you're always awake
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:53.980]  at one level just not fully you got to worry about people that just will never wake up i mean
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:03:01.820]  we were all wants to sleep right and it's only been a couple of months you know you have that
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:07.420]  feeling in your gut some's not right some's not right and i'm putting everything together like
[02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:16.780]  like a big puzzle and i i really relate to you you're human i and you put everything in in the
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:23.900]  humanitarian you mean humanitarian terms but listen i have one question that i i guess i'm not getting
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:29.820]  and i understand the the uh the central banks and and uh how they're controlling everything
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:35.020]  and i've and i've gotten my hands on i've ordered from your site three times i i know you offer
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:39.340]  things for free but i think it's important to support that as well so i'm not caught up on the
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:50.220]  movies yet but my my question is at the i the islamic extremists i how does this play in
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:04:01.340]  to this i mean i i don't see them uh succumbing uh to to uh world dominance or well all you do is
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:07.100]  you you finance the sunnis and she hides to kill each other in divide and conquer the great game
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:13.420]  and so that's what's happening is that you you see the policy obama's like i'm not gonna talk to net
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:17.980]  and yahoo but come on muslim brotherhood come hang out with me and they're telling them basically
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:24.220]  run wild go crazy uh and then i guess obama's gonna leave office and then they come around me and
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:30.940]  start bombing them i mean it's it's it's absolutely cynical and very very evil and then to have the
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:36.380]  globalists produce this you know video to get them all hyped up and and sure it's it's wrong for
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:41.900]  the you know them to get all hyped up and not it's so stupid to take the bait like this uh but
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:47.340]  the point is they are manipulating them into a larger conflict that will probably lead to a
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:53.500]  larger war not just a civil war god bless you ma'am thank you for your support we'll be right back

[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:18.940]  riders on the storm there's a killer on the road it is thursday my friends the 13th day
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:26.780]  of september 2012 and we have some good news here chris hedges the Pulitzer prize-winning
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:35.020]  journalist who joined us last week who sued over the ndaa clearly stating that someone
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:41.420]  like himself a journalist that just talks to people they claim are extremist whether it be a
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:47.500]  co-clux clan member a muslim extremist a jewish extremist a russian extremist that you could
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:54.700]  be disappeared secretly executed whatever the case is that's what obama signed on december 31st
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:10:00.140]  of last year when he thought no one was watching well the federal court that did a temporary
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:06.780]  injunction has done a permanent injunction now it will be appealed and go to the supreme court
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:13.500]  and it's on its face completely unconstitutional just like obama saying he has the power of the
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:19.340]  purse not congress that's totally unconstitutional or obama saying our military's under nato control
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:27.980]  that's unconstitutional u.s. the talitarian system loses major battle as judge permanently blocks
[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:34.940]  india's military detention provision and again folks if they claim they've got terrorist you need
[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:39.660]  to have a trial or they can grab anybody and say we're all terrorist and again who's been caught
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:44.620]  running the real terrorist the government because the government's been taken over by foreign interest
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:49.100]  hedges called the president's action allowing a definite detention which was signed into law of
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:55.340]  little opposition from either party unforgivable unconstitutional and exceedingly dangerous
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:01.420]  the attack point blank the civil rights farce that is the never-ending war on terror conducted
[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:08.060]  by both parties targeting whom exactly is unclear but certainly attaining ever more intense
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:14.620]  retaliation from foreigners such as the furious attacks against the u.s. consulates in egypt
[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:20.300]  and libya and again that's the phony war on terror that's actually meant to stir up all
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:24.460]  of the muslims so they can then take all of our liberties here domestically and launch
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:29.740]  wider wars now i want to shift gears into a report by jacari jackson here uh that was
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:35.420]  conducting on the streets of austin texas kind of mayberry uh usa for a big city it's about
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:40.700]  as mayberry as it gets to give you a cross-section of what people think about police checkpoints
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:45.900]  and rubber stamp warrants for a while they weren't even getting warrants and the feds are paying for
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:52.380]  this nationwide and first they start as a no refusal weekend where you pull up at any legal
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:57.980]  checkpoint totally unconstitutional and they want to see your driver's license and all this stuff
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:03.420]  now they've expanded in san antonio and other cities to seven days a week and there's that point
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:09.580]  of give us a breathalyzer or we're going to jam a needle in your arm and all of this is the medicalization
[02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:14.140]  of police that's why they're getting them ready for forced inoculations under the model state's
[02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:18.940]  health emergency powers act that's what this is about they're trying to force the military to take
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:23.260]  experimental shots you can't make the military take experimental shots that's the law you can make
[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:28.620]  them take regular vaccines because you've signed away your rights but now they want to make all
[02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:34.300]  first responders take it you have a right to say no so this is a very very dangerous precedent in
[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.980]  our own police chief where i'm broadcasting to you from here ardey saveta who's been in studio
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:45.340]  here he is just selling out completely to this because it's the safety to stop drunk drivers
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:51.500]  really really uh texting while driving five times more dangerous uh department of transportation
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:58.300]  studies show you know arresting someone who's had two glasses of wine is a joke while they have bars
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:03.740]  up and down the roads this is just a way to get regular people in the system just like mothers
[02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:09.180]  being arrested of their kids play in the front yard this government is out of control while pushing
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:14.220]  ritalin and prozac and all this garbage on us let's go ahead and go to jacari jackson's report
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:30.140]  for infowars nightly news we're preparing we're we are premiering it here on the radio
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:35.820]  the city of oston hosts no refusal dwi weekends no refusal meaning that the driver can have their
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:41.420]  blood drawn even if the suspect refuses the blood draw and or the breath test now while we recognize
[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:46.300]  driving while intoxicated as a very serious offense is it serious enough to have your rights
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:51.340]  and privacy violated police are doing no refusal dwi weekends when they can draw your blood without
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:55.980]  your approval do you have any thoughts about that i don't have any problem with that i think that's
[02:13:55.980 --> 02:14:02.860]  really unsafe um a lot of people faint when they have their blood drawn and it doesn't make it any
[02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:07.340]  safer for them to be driving what are your thoughts on them you know being able to acquire a warrant
[02:14:07.340 --> 02:14:14.220]  to draw your blood even if you refuse um i don't i think it's that's i don't know they shouldn't
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:19.740]  allow that i kind of feel that's a little invasive and kind of i don't know the lack of communication
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:23.660]  between them and communities kind of stupid i think even if i'm completely sober hadn't had
[02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:29.500]  a drink all night i'd still rather go to jail for the night really yeah why so i just i don't think
[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:34.380]  it's fair do you think they could do anything besides blood draws and breathalysers to you know
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:39.900]  keep the auto accidents down whatever it takes whatever it takes to uh to keep it safe and to
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:47.660]  keep everybody all safe i think just installing uh checkpoints and doing breathalysers of suspected
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:55.980]  drunk drivers would be a good way to limit the number of dwi accidents i don't know i i'm not
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:15:00.300]  sure what they can do really it's up to the people you know i think the streets of austin are safe as
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:06.300]  they are even from drunk drivers there's no drunk drivers everyone who drives a cab nowadays i think
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:13.500]  right yes right do you think texting is more or less dangerous than drinking and driving um
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:22.700]  maybe equally anything that's gonna take zeir uh sound judgment uh then it's better to uh ban it
[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:26.700]  you've seen people text and drive right yeah do you think that's more or less dangerous than
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:32.060]  drinking and driving it's probably more dangerous i would think you know i feel like anyone can
[02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:36.220]  be distracted by really anything that they do while driving and taking texting away is just
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:39.900]  stupid i mean you can be talking and still get into an accident it's not necessarily about
[02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:43.900]  what you're doing it's about the driver and how responsible they are have you ever texted while
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:50.060]  you're driving always i try i try and i try and do it at red lights the national highway and safety
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:56.300]  administration released that in 2010 10 000 people died as a result of alcohol related incidents
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:16:01.500]  very serious numbers but if you take a look at textinganddrivingsafety.com's post they found
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:06.380]  that texting and driving is six times more dangerous than drinking and driving also that
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:11.740]  texting and driving mirrors the effects of driving after having four beers once again we do not in
[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:15.980]  any way encourage you to drink and drive we are simply pointing out that texting and driving is
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:21.340]  more dangerous i'm here with commander jason duster off of the highway enforcement unit
[02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:25.260]  all right so i want to ask you a few questions about the no refusal dui weekends first of all
[02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:29.020]  how long have you been doing them we've been doing them over three years in our department
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:33.340]  all right and how do they get started was there any particular reason or need for them chief
[02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:37.980]  osaveto came in and really saw the need that we need to hold more drivers that are out there
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:42.220]  driving impaired and especially the ones that are killing and injuring people accountable now are
[02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:46.940]  there any plans to make these no refusal weekends permit or to expand them to other you know maybe
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:51.180]  not holidays just kind of every weekend is there any plans to do anything like that i know a lot
[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:56.220]  of cities like i explained earlier are moving towards no refusal 365 days of the year all the
[02:16:56.220 --> 02:17:02.220]  time 24 hours that's something we're always going to keep in our bag and look at it individually
[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:06.300]  and say is it right for austin is there any type of violation of the fourth amendment right to be
[02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:11.500]  you know securing your person in your opinion no not at all this has been upheld throughout the
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:16.220]  united states that it's within the constitutional rights for us to take that blood recently the
[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:21.100]  city of austin was in the news for you know having people infiltrate the occupy movement last
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:26.940]  december uh protesters were at the port of houston and they say that officers were involved in
[02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:31.500]  allowing them you're assisting them block the the houston port do you have any comment on that
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:35.740]  i don't i really don't have any information on that i just one final question sir now we had a
[02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:39.420]  chance to speak to some people on the street just a few minutes ago and one of the questions we asked
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:42.860]  them is when you're driving and you look in your rearview mirror and you see a police officer do
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:46.540]  you feel safe or do you feel threatened we talked about seven or eight people and the majority of
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:50.540]  them said that they felt threatened when you see a cop car you know drive and you see a cop car
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:57.260]  behind you you know do you feel more safe or less safe i feel less safe i feel fine i'm just at that
[02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:03.180]  point worried about if i have like a tail light out or something i think uh the police have they're
[02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:09.740]  not like they used to be i feel very scared always i'm even when i'm not drinking even when i'm just
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:15.100]  going to the store i feel threatened all the time so i'm threatened by who just the cops i feel like
[02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:19.020]  they're gonna pull me over for anything it out of pain because they like to harass you know what i
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:26.060]  mean when i see the police man i don't have any no nothing to hide so they're my friends now now
[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:30.780]  to clarify you're saying you feel unsafe because of the police or just unsafe in general unsafe
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:35.260]  because of the police do you have any idea of why that may be well i think most of time people see
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:39.660]  those lights behind them is the first thing they think is was i speeding you know did i not obey
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:45.740]  the law what did i do so typically you know that's a normal feeling but i think once they meet the
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:49.420]  officer and they're able to go okay you know i was just going a few miles an hour over the speed
[02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:55.260]  limit or my tail lights out or something like that 99.9 of our citizens are doing nothing wrong other
[02:18:55.260 --> 02:19:00.780]  than a minor traffic violation now over the weekend over 90 people were arrested for the no-refusal
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:05.660]  dui clause about half of those gave both breath and blood samples but not all of those were
[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:09.340]  voluntary now we had a chance to speak to a couple officers off the record they told us
[02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:13.580]  that the blood drops are not automatic and they do need a judge's approval to do them this is

[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:41.900]  info wars command center we've got him for the rest of the hour and it's such a big story we're
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:46.940]  going to have on the nightly news as well because he had all these documents and articles and what
[02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:51.980]  he was telling me i mean this is a guy who's got big giant factories folks i mean you know
[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:56.860]  everybody copies him he's got other companies with spies trying to find out what he's doing
[02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:01.820]  he's having to buy food out a year or two ahead just so he can give you good food at the lowest
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:06.140]  price when other folks are selling you things that the cardboard has more nutrition literally
[02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:09.740]  see i'm already running on here we're not talking about eatfoodsdirect.com
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:14.300]  he does not want to talk about that he came here to talk about the news and boy there is a big giant
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:20.860]  stack of it but interjecting into that dhs warrants muslim brotherhood and i ran forming new terror
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:25.820]  access but wait a minute our government put al qaeda into libya and syria unreal obama invites
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:31.100]  egyptian muslim brotherhood president to meet next week refuses to meet net and yahoo they've got
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:37.500]  marines landing ships arriving there's basically a new invasion of libya to kick out the people they
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:44.940]  use to take over bedlam and syria so that's a side issue here's what he brought roiders world food
[02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:51.260]  prices jumped 10 percent in july world bank boom that's hyperinflation folks not just the droughts
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:58.540]  food stamp used climbs to record 46.7 mil but you add in the rest is over 50 mil bloomberg hot
[02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:04.380]  long summer since food prices soaring the ethanol issue record numbers entering poverty i mean
[02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:08.860]  it this is just the beginning steve shank we're going to break her about three minutes we're
[02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:13.580]  going to come back with us we got so much to talk about here today what is your message in three
[02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:18.620]  minutes of what's coming up i mean why did you want to address people here today very simply
[02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:26.780]  alex we've got a situation where food is is becoming very literally the road to roam in
[02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:31.020]  other words everything leads to food when they've got trouble in the middle east when we've got
[02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:36.220]  oil prices going up when we've got embargo possibilities all the oil issues we've got
[02:27:36.220 --> 02:27:41.820]  ethanol when people are looking at their at their gas pumps and seeing 10 percent ethanol
[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:47.340]  that's your food going into the gas tank that's your food going into the gas tank because right
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:52.380]  now we've lost 70 percent of our corn crop and the animal feed pig farmers are just throwing in
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:57.740]  the towel beef farmers yeah and some of them are feeding our feeding their livestock candy
[02:27:57.740 --> 02:28:03.740]  because they can't afford to call i saw that the corn candy is cheaper than corn gotta show that
[02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:10.300]  article yeah and so what we've got is a situation where food is becoming the currency of the present
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:16.700]  it used to be that food was the way that you measured someone's wealth now we've got we were
[02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:23.260]  struggling to pay for the gas in the gas tank primarily because the ethanol that that was
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:29.020]  touted as being a means by which we could keep the gas prices down corn is so expensive to make
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:34.700]  the ethanol out of that is actually boosting the price of petroleum up so we've got just absolutely
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:41.340]  a world gone insane in this the country that was in 1959 capable of producing enough food to feed
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:47.020]  the entire planet five times over is now importing 40 percent of its food and our american population
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:54.540]  50 percent of the population of this country is needing subsidization for their food budget
[02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:59.580]  it's not just the 50 mil uh or close to it on food stamps and you got all the social security all
[02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:05.180]  of it if the dollar goes belly up my gosh it's going to be it's going to be in the invasion of
[02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:10.380]  the zombies and the government's running ads saying get prepared zombies are going to attack
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:16.140]  as a metaphor of the giant hordes of people i mean this is insane when the homeland security
[02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:22.460]  is running zombie apocalypse tv ads yeah oh it's absolutely what is going on steve shank this is
[02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:27.500]  insane we're going to break it all down on the other side i wish it wasn't unfolding coming through
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:32.860]  but it is reality is more sensational than any movie you can imagine we've got a bullet list
[02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:37.580]  a mile long we're going to tackle on the other side and i'm going to plug it he can't stop me

[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:27.260]  mentally ill but i was just reading an article during the break and following the links uh
[02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:33.340]  it's at info wars dot com new attack on second amendment says substance abusers cannot own firearms
[02:33:33.340 --> 02:33:38.220]  so now if they take your blood at one of these checkpoints and find thc in it they're not just
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:44.300]  going to take your kids now they're going to take your guns and they're calling it a mental disorder
[02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:50.140]  to be pro gun i'm not kidding so we're entering the soviet union this stuff is moving so quick
[02:33:50.140 --> 02:33:55.420]  but let's see him try to implement it the irs over health care they say they don't run health care
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:34:01.180]  now they're just issuing the rulings and saying what you've got to do uh also we've got establishment
[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:06.060]  capitalizes on embassy attack as election approaches and i'm not defending mit romney but
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:11.660]  when he said obama's been helping the muslim brotherhood and all these groups uh and whenever
[02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:17.660]  romney said look at how your people you put in libya killed the embassy head the ambassador that
[02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:23.180]  was true and john mccain who helped get all this war launched he's out attacking mit romney in the
[02:34:23.180 --> 02:34:28.780]  media's life even a republicans attacking him well if john mccain's a conservative or libertarian
[02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:34.460]  i'll eat my hat and this is anti gun pro open borders and again i'm not citing obama romney
[02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:40.700]  they're both globalists but let me tell you this is a fake attack on romney here because this he
[02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:46.460]  should own it romney should own it and say you help put al-qaeda in libya and syria but see he
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:51.820]  didn't want to do that because it's part of the larger plan so uh the establishment's like hey
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:57.820]  don't use that romney because they're all involved in it and that's why politicians will never use
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:05.580]  real issues now steve shanks here of efoodsdirect.com the j michael stevensson group and they are the
[02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:10.620]  name i mean i've bought a bunch of storable food over the years they've got the best the best prices
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:16.220]  because they buy in bulk uh they cut out the middlemen they don't do all the giant advertising
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:19.820]  there's some other groups out there that you hear on some of the big shows that i got to tell you
[02:35:19.820 --> 02:35:24.620]  folks is an absolute travesty it's like some of these gold companies that have a you know hundred
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:30.060]  percent markup and stuff i mean it's just amazing what goes on and again he doesn't want to talk about
[02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:37.500]  that i'm just telling you this guy is an authority he knows what he's talking about when it comes to
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:43.820]  food prices and the economy because he's there buying the food a year out or more doesn't mean
[02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:49.580]  he buys food and sits there for a year he's future contracts on crops that haven't even grown yet
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:54.060]  so he's a big insider basically telling all we're going to have an in-depth interview today on the
[02:35:54.060 --> 02:35:59.020]  nightly news uh that will air soon on the radio but uh steve while you're here live you've got the
[02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:04.380]  floor take it away you want to get into food stamps first and how we hear them being advertised
[02:36:04.380 --> 02:36:08.700]  doesn't matter if you've got a job or a car come get them what's that about well it's absolutely
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:14.940]  absurd what's happening is um i i hesitate to say this but on this program i can't think i can
[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:21.660]  do you want to buy a presidency because here's the here's a very simple simple concept if you feed
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:28.060]  them you'll lead them and what we've got right now in this country is 50 of the population needs
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:34.460]  some sort of a subsidy for their food because they can't afford it millions of people are in a
[02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:39.420]  situation where they're getting food stamps already but in addition to the food stamps you've got a
[02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:45.900]  whole lot of folks that uh are getting support from their churches getting support from other
[02:36:45.900 --> 02:36:52.220]  sub organizations that are assisting and so half the population really needs help buying food because
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:58.540]  the food prices are so high but then at the same time we've got a drought that's knocked out about
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:06.300]  70 of the corn crop well now what does that mean all of these dots connect up together alex and all
[02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:13.820]  roads lead to food very simply when we lose the corn crop we've had a certain percentage of that
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:19.660]  corn crop that's been mandated to be put into ethanol in other words you're pouring the food
[02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:24.940]  into the gas tank now the whole idea behind ethanol was the fact that it was supposed to
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:34.540]  save money on on petroleum okay when when ethanol when actually corn as a result of the ethanol
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:40.300]  ethanol went to us all time high it actually started increasing the cost of the gasoline
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:46.780]  that the ethanol was put into now you put together the other insanity of this that it takes about a
[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:53.100]  gallon and a half of petroleum energy to make one gallon of ethanol from corn plus tremendous
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:59.260]  amounts of water and corn is being subsidized for ethanol by the government now anytime you have the
[02:37:59.260 --> 02:38:05.260]  government putting money into a project drives the price up like healthcare absolutely so what
[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:10.380]  we've got is the farmers that are raising ethanol corn are being subsidized by the government what
[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:15.900]  about the farmers that are raising the corn that feeds our livestock and is is people food yeah
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:21.820]  because a lot of people say i don't even like corn why do i care folks it's the base of the food
[02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:29.980]  chain for animal feed for fillers and products corn in some families is half the vegetable protein
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:36.140]  and sugars they're getting i mean it's in everything 70% of the food that you get in the
[02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:41.980]  grocery store has corn connected to it somehow but the the other interesting thing is that is the
[02:38:41.980 --> 02:38:47.980]  chain effect what's happening is that the ranchers that are growing the beef the the farmers that are
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:54.060]  that have the dairy herds and and all the poultry and all this kind of stuff they can't get the feed
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:39:00.460]  that they need in fact it's gotten to the point where corn is so expensive that some of the some
[02:39:00.460 --> 02:39:06.780]  of the farmers are actually feeding their livestock candy wow because the candy has corn products in
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:10.540]  it and they can get some of the nutrition into the now you brought up the farmers they admit the
[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:15.180]  big boom is farms being bought up the banks won't loan the money so tell tell me what you
[02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:20.380]  told me yesterday well we had the bailout right that's supposed to solve a lot of problems well
[02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:27.260]  the congress looked at about 77 billion in in bailout money but some of the some of the people
[02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:32.380]  that have actually looked at all of the subsidiary subsidiary relationships that the government
[02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:40.060]  committed itself to has it over 12 trillion dollars that has actually been been committed now what
[02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:45.820]  you've got is the government bailout created a situation where the where the banks got into good
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:52.460]  good order but immediately after that you had a lot of the the grocery store chains complaining
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:57.740]  because they couldn't get government loans to actually buy the foods to put on their shelves
[02:39:57.740 --> 02:40:04.700]  to sell the people then right behind that the farmers stopped getting loans for planting the
[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:09.260]  crops and harvesting the crops and doing whatever they needed to for the fuel and everything that
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:17.580]  they needed and a lot of that was was based on requirements that the farmers have enough water
[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:22.140]  to fill a crop through because the bank didn't and again that none of this is an accident they're
[02:40:22.140 --> 02:40:26.700]  paying to move our factories overseas they know full well what they're doing it's all the post
[02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:32.300]  industrial world agenda 21 as you said yesterday the bottom line is shut down the small family
[02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:37.980]  farms which they're doing it's a consolidation and take the country that in the 50s they said
[02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:43.820]  could feed the whole world now was as you said we import 40% of our food but in the third world it
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:50.300]  causes riots where they spend more than half their money on food here it impoverishes us there it
[02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:54.860]  causes people to starve to death and then you understand why they pulled the trigger on the
[02:40:54.860 --> 02:41:02.220]  ethanol chain reaction this is eugenics well the interesting thing is is that it all connects up
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:08.300]  all these dots line up in a row if you've got if you've got corn subsidized for ethanol and the
[02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:13.900]  farmers that are raising our food have to pay higher prices for the corn to feed the feed the
[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:18.620]  cattle and now we've eliminated the corn as a result of the drought now it's not just here in
[02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:24.060]  the united states we've got a drought we've got a drought worldwide we're in the seventh year of a
[02:41:24.060 --> 02:41:31.180]  worldwide famine china lost 60 of a sweet crop last year the russians did oh something's weird
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:37.420]  maybe the helpers not some of this 2012 we're all gonna be here next year don't even start me on
[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:40.940]  that the alignment of the planets and all this kind of stuff and what has happened to the weather
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:46.300]  patterns and things there's some real stuff there but let's let's get back to what's happening here
[02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:55.660]  with with all of the the commodities buying this going on you see it used to be illegal for anybody
[02:41:55.660 --> 02:42:01.260]  to invest in commodities food stuffs you know corn and wheat and this type of thing unless they
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:06.140]  were actually in the business but that got opened up yeah only farmers could do it to hedge their
[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:11.580]  bet and and people that were in the process of processing the food in other words the the the
[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:16.540]  bakeries and that type of thing people that were in the business and could take delivery
[02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:22.380]  they couldn't just invest in it and just buy and sell but you say couldn't speculate
[02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:27.660]  now now we've got you've heard about the trade deficit we've got a trade deficit situation right
[02:42:28.220 --> 02:42:34.060]  they talk about how the united states is is passing all of us money overseas mostly to china by the
[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:40.060]  way china has more of our money than we do but the fact is is that the the united nations came
[02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:44.700]  out just a couple months ago and was lauding the fact that we are now doing something about our
[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:50.300]  trade deficit what are we doing we're selling our food you see the united states is one of the few
[02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:55.980]  countries that does not restrict when it has it doesn't have enough food to sell its own is to
[02:42:55.980 --> 02:43:03.580]  provide for its own people it does not restrict exports on food and so that means commodities
[02:43:03.580 --> 02:43:09.580]  buyers can go in and buy up our food china can come in india can come in australia can come in all
[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:12.300]  these countries and they're not just buying the food as you were telling me last time i went and
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:17.900]  looked it up they're buying up the farms oh absolutely absolutely in fact uh some of the
[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:23.100]  people that that promoted the most the most activity with regard to investing in gold
[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:27.900]  are now saying they started saying it about a year ago alex that what you want to do is
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:34.860]  you want to start divesting of your gold and start investing in farm and farmland and agriculture
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:39.900]  well yeah that's what uh all the big wigs are saying uh faber uh jim rogers all of them are saying
[02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:43.900]  those are the source is also going into gold at the same time but you're right they're rushing
[02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:49.260]  into the real commodities and the you know uh holding things physically now we've got all
[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:54.460]  these other data points you gave me here that we go over how does it affect things to have the
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:59.740]  middle east going up in flames i mean how does it affect things to have the russians threatening
[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:04.860]  to you know counter strike with nukes i mean well the whole world is really crazy right now it's
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:09.580]  true so give us your i mean you were here a year ago on the phone uh you haven't probably been on
[02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:14.540]  in six seven months you were saying watch food prices go up 10 20 30 percent it's now done
[02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:20.380]  that 30 percent it's now gone up 10 percent just in july we're talking about 10 percent now by the
[02:44:20.380 --> 02:44:25.740]  end of this month on top of that's like 40 percent in the last year what's going on and and where is
[02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:30.620]  all this going to go what's this going to cause in the third world where they're going to die
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:35.180]  if they don't get their food well what's going to happen very simply is that in the third world
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:42.860]  countries uh they are already in in bad shape but they depend on imports from other countries
[02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:49.980]  obviously they're not growing their own so what you have is a situation where if we if we cut back
[02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:56.220]  on our exports if some of the countries that have food cut back on their exports they have a problem
[02:44:56.940 --> 02:45:01.260]  but you've also got rioting and that type of thing when we deal with the war you mentioned the war
[02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:09.180]  war what we had just a few months ago was that the arabs and the oil producing countries when
[02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:16.140]  they get ticked off at us they they threaten to shut back on the oil well if you look at the last
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:24.940]  10 years of prices of oil prices and food prices their the the graphs go just right neck and neck
[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:30.300]  they're just exactly identical they're actually overlays well because it i mean that feeds in
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:35.500]  the fuel to ship the food there you process it everything so you've got this big you got this
[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:41.340]  big circle we're raising cane over there with the oil producing countries we won't develop our own
[02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:46.060]  oil production ourselves which is another issue that i'm sure that you're you're pretty well aware
[02:45:46.060 --> 02:45:52.700]  they use the controllers yeah and so basically what's happening is worldwide when we go into these
[02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:58.380]  countries they every country out there the third world countries particularly have a seed base
[02:45:58.380 --> 02:46:02.780]  of heritage seeds these are the seeds that the the pioneers had you know they could plant that
[02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:06.780]  seed and then they just say take that same seed and plant it the next year in the next year heirloom
[02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:13.260]  seeds heirloom seeds yeah they had what's what's happened is each one of these countries have their
[02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:19.420]  own heirloom seed base but that's being destroyed interesting so the even the third world countries
[02:46:19.420 --> 02:46:25.020]  have to buy their seed each year in order to plant and have crops yeah now the gmo's taken over
[02:46:25.020 --> 02:46:31.180]  there you go you see the total plan yeah well food basically is a control mechanism
[02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:38.220]  you see food has always been a currency but what we've got right now the un said 96 in Beijing
[02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:42.780]  they said we will use food as a weapon henry kissinger state apartment random 200 this is the
[02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:48.140]  plan right and when these foreign countries come in you see as a result of the bailout they
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:52.780]  stop giving they stop giving loans to farmers now we're jumping around here a little bit
[02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:59.180]  but when they stop doing that then these foreign countries come in and they say to the farmer okay
[02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:03.820]  if you're going to stay in business you've got to be able to grow crops so we'll give you the money
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:09.020]  and we'll pay you a profit but the but the food goes out of the country to wherever they are
[02:47:09.660 --> 02:47:17.340]  China is literally farming the planet they're farming Africa yeah they're now getting 98%
[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:22.620]  of rare earth minerals out of the ground our elites have just given control of everything to them
[02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:26.940]  strategically they've made a behind the scenes deal with them right to help bring in the new
[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:31.660]  world order now now i mean you you sat me down yesterday it was like i was Howard Biel and
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:35.820]  they're in the office and network you get the speech but it was all true because i know this info
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:40.220]  but the way you put it explain why food is so important because i know this i mean you know
[02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:44.860]  me i've got two garages jammed full of it with air conditioners on it right explain to me
[02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:49.820]  but everybody else i mean this is the key why they're advertising food stamps to everybody
[02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:55.020]  this is domestication a wild animal can get its own food a wild human a free human
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:48:00.300]  but if you depend on the government for food during a collapse they've got you so i mean break
[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:06.460]  that down well it's very simple you can't do anything about the earthquakes and the storms
[02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:11.260]  and things are happening as a result of the the 2012 thing you can't do anything about what's
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:16.540]  going to happen i don't care who gets into office right now with this election it doesn't matter
[02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:22.620]  there neither one of them can do anything about and we as individuals joe lunch bucket out there
[02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:26.940]  can't do anything about what's going to happen with all of the goofiness is going on with
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:31.900]  government and to take over the food and and we're going to talk about michelle obama and her
[02:48:31.900 --> 02:48:35.900]  interest in tracking all the food that we've got a little bit later oh yeah i meant to cover that
[02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:41.980]  yesterday will you guys reprint me that go ahead so anyway you can't do anything about that now
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:49.580]  alex you are a master at going in and finding all the goofy stuff that's going on all the
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:54.460]  inappropriate stuff and you expose it and all of us we've got people out there that would not
[02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:59.660]  miss one of your programs that actually take notes when you bring up what's going on with obama
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:04.220]  what you when you bring up what's going on with the chinese taking over our farmland when you bring
[02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:09.500]  up what's going on with ethanol and the various things that we've talked about but i got a question
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:16.140]  for you you've got food in your in your garage under air conditioning what can you do about
[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:21.580]  obama and the and the weather and what can you do about all of the things that we've talked about
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:26.780]  you can't do a stinking thing and all of these people that are taking notes and are saying my
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:33.020]  gosh alex really hit it today what have you done for him what can they do now it's like there's one
[02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:38.860]  thing they can do so it's like the the titanic is listing the food is the lifeboats is what you're
[02:49:38.860 --> 02:49:45.340]  saying absolutely now no i agree listen i promote my ideas of liberty and freedom and news and resistance
[02:49:45.340 --> 02:49:49.100]  to this tyranny so as it gets worse and worse people know who did it so we have a chance as a
[02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:53.500]  remnant to rebuild things and dig out of this because they've got the reeducation camps and the army
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:59.340]  manuals it's all real everything it's all coming through i am so unpleased that we were proven right
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:04.620]  but i agree with you people need to have good friends and family and medical supplies and food
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:09.740]  and water filtration and firearms and and i've gotten out of the city listen i lived in town
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:14.220]  i like living in town i like to be able to drive a quarter mile the movie theater or a quarter mile
[02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:20.460]  the grocery store not now i gotta drive 10 minutes to get anywhere and i'm not and i went and read
[02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:25.020]  strategic relocation and i found the one area in the hill country in texas it's probably one of the
[02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:30.540]  few safe areas or safer i mean i've made preparation i've put in the well i'm put in the solar power
[02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:36.060]  i mean because this is real and i hope people will go to the one place to get their food

[02:53:54.540 --> 02:54:14.700]  Steve shank who literally is the food expert i've learned so much from this guy and i've
[02:54:14.700 --> 02:54:17.580]  heard him say something on the radio before i'm like really and then it comes through
[02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:22.140]  during the breaks you got to hear these breaks he's explaining why they want to track what's at
[02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:29.020]  the grocery store what you buy i mean that's how crazy things have gotten is that my kids
[02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:34.460]  are homeschool but twice a week they go to a homeschool academy and the place is accredited
[02:54:34.460 --> 02:54:39.020]  so there they got handouts that michelle obama loves them and is going to tell them what to eat
[02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:43.500]  i'm like that's it they're out of that academy uh so now it's getting to the point where there's
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:48.700]  nowhere to run from these people and you were explaining it all to me but i hear the ads where
[02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:53.180]  they're like you need to get on food stamps and we don't have enough hispanics on food stamps and
[02:54:53.180 --> 02:54:57.340]  we need to get everybody on food stamps and even if you have a job in a car you need food stamps
[02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:02.780]  and it's your money you need it it's clear domestication and you pointed out romney came out against it
[02:55:02.780 --> 02:55:07.500]  and you just said that's political suicide well it very simply is because what they're doing is
[02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:12.780]  they're getting all these people on the dole and that's the way they're buying the presidency and
[02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:17.580]  when romney comes out and says we want to cut back the funding for food stamps that's not the issue
[02:55:17.580 --> 02:55:22.700]  what we need to do is put people in america in a situation where they don't need food stamps anymore
[02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:28.140]  because they can make enough money to buy the food we need to keep the price down to the point
[02:55:28.140 --> 02:55:33.740]  where they can afford it yeah but they call this a recovery and say we left the recession four years
[02:55:33.740 --> 02:55:37.820]  ago what happens every time the government puts money into something what happens price goes up
[02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:41.740]  what happens when when the government put money into health care what happened there
[02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:46.460]  it's already affecting the food stamp push is already affecting tell people what's happened
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:50.700]  to you buying food of your own well what we're having to do is we're competing with the chinese
[02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:55.420]  and we're competing with the indians we're competing with pretty much everybody out there
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:56:02.940]  and it's it's boosting the food prices to the point where the demand is pushing raw materials
[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:07.820]  so that very literally we're having to compete with the countries that we've given all of our
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:13.580]  money to buy the food against look at this headline michelle obama hopes to take over grocery stores
[02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:18.060]  in the next four years i mean i'm entering the twilight zone here they're arresting mothers
[02:56:18.060 --> 02:56:24.940]  nationwide for their kids in their backyard three years ago i got a call from southern utah a wife
[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:29.740]  of a veterinarian she had been informed by the us department of agriculture that they were going
[02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:35.740]  to have to go out to all of the farms in their area and identify and tag every single living
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:43.180]  critter that was out there okay so that they can they can determine if a chicken gets sick and
[02:56:43.180 --> 02:56:48.540]  dies and somebody yeah you've got to do all this bureaucracy but then big pharma and big agra
[02:56:48.540 --> 02:56:53.740]  they're exempt well it's a total looky has the rural council that's under the department of
[02:56:53.740 --> 02:56:59.260]  homeland security and they've got spies i've got family in the country there's no spies going around
[02:56:59.260 --> 02:57:04.780]  asking questions about loyalty anybody that talks about about obama they get government visits
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:11.260]  yeah well the the main thing that that's happening there is everybody heard the the news
[02:57:11.260 --> 02:57:16.460]  briefs that we went through about the cattle where they're identified and they're being taxed
[02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:23.660]  because of of cow flatulence yes okay this this carbon this carbon footprint type of stuff
[02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:31.340]  well what's happening if they identify where the food comes from and what grocery store shipped it
[02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:36.860]  out what do you think the objective is if they have a recall now look at the number of recalls
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:43.340]  we've had on our food over the last year it's been absolutely insane it's all about fear for a federal
[02:57:43.340 --> 02:57:46.940]  takeover which they admit listen we've got to end this hour we're going to do a whole hour to
