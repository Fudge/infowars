[00:00.000 --> 00:29.760]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[00:29.760 --> 00:39.960]  Hi, Iran USA Radio News. I'm Jason Walker. Three people killed, one wounded when a man
[00:39.960 --> 00:45.760]  opened fire at the Athens, Georgia Community Theater Saturday. Suspect identified as George
[00:45.760 --> 00:52.000]  Zinkin, a marketing professor at the University of Georgia. Spokesman Pete Cohencamp says
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.560]  Zinkin was well thought of by students and faculty. He has an excellent reputation on
[00:56.560 --> 01:02.080]  campus, a terrific background. He has won awards for outstanding contribution to research.
[01:02.080 --> 01:07.320]  New York City health officials say eight students had a Queens private school testing positive
[01:07.320 --> 01:14.320]  for influenza A possibly swine flu. Samples have been sent to the CDC for confirmation.
[01:14.320 --> 01:20.320]  Also officials in Kansas now confirming two cases of swine flu. Virus had also been verified
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.600]  earlier in both Texas and California. No one in the U.S. has died from swine flu in this
[01:25.600 --> 01:33.120]  outbreak. This is IRN USA radio news. If you've been watching the news lately, you've
[01:33.120 --> 01:36.960]  been hearing a lot about the obstacles in our economy. If you'll listen for just a
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.280]  few seconds, I'll share the opportunities that this economic downturn is offering to
[01:41.280 --> 01:46.160]  those with the energy, courage and know how to take advantage of it. Hi, how in the world
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.800]  are you anyway? I'm Andy Willoughby with the three step plan home business system. The
[01:50.800 --> 01:56.240]  three step plan helps people feel better, look better and make more money. History has shown
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.360]  that our product line actually grows during an economic slowdown. Our newest product category
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.720]  actually grew 21% during the last 12 months while most business categories were dropping
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.760]  like a rock. With the three step plan, you can help yourself and others develop another
[02:11.760 --> 02:17.280]  stream of income to survive and prosper in today's uncertain business climate. Don't
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.880]  wait for things to get worse. Check out the three step plan today. Go to threestepplan.com

[02:35.520 --> 02:41.280]  Saturday in their weekly radio address, Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander. We say find more American
[02:41.280 --> 02:47.840]  energy and use less. Energy that's as clean as possible, as reliable as possible and at as
[02:47.840 --> 02:54.880]  low a cost as possible. And one place to start is with 100 more nuclear power plants. In his
[02:54.880 --> 02:59.920]  weekly radio address, the president looked at several key areas. As we do everything that we
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.400]  can to create jobs and get our economy moving, we're also building a new foundation for lasting
[03:04.400 --> 03:10.320]  prosperity. A foundation that invests in quality education, lowers healthcare costs and develops
[03:10.320 --> 03:15.920]  new sources of energy powered by new jobs and industries. Saturday morning, Obama also says
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.760]  the American people are having to make very tough choices these days because of the economy,
[03:21.760 --> 03:51.600]  but he adds, Uncle Sam is doing much the same.
[03:52.720 --> 04:06.480]  800-879-5819. 800-879-5819. The actress who starred in Maud and later Golden Girls has died.
[04:06.480 --> 04:13.600]  B. Arthur was 86. South Carolina couple at the center of the probe into what sparked the wildfires
[04:13.600 --> 04:18.640]  in that state. Even so, Governor Mark Sanford says, despite the finding, there are bigger
[04:18.640 --> 04:34.000]  things to be concerned about right now. A woman says she called 911 after realizing a trash fire
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.320]  near her home was out of control. She claims the fire department arrived to handle it and
[04:38.320 --> 04:43.600]  douse the flames, but the blaze reignited this week behind her home and quickly tore through the
[04:43.600 --> 04:49.440]  area. Her husband has been cited for starting the fire without a permit and letting it get
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.960]  out of control. Well, before the New York Mets took on the Washington National Saturday at
[04:54.960 --> 05:01.600]  City Field in Flushing, Mackenzie Brown was there to throw out the ceremonial first pitch
[05:01.600 --> 05:08.960]  and trust us on this one. This young lady knows how to throw a baseball. The 12-year-old hurled
[05:08.960 --> 05:15.920]  a perfect game this week in little league action. In that six inning game, 18 batters, by the way,
[05:15.920 --> 05:23.040]  all of them boys, came to the plate. Not one of those guys reached base. Mackenzie even struck out
[05:23.040 --> 05:29.520]  12. I'm Jason Weicker. This is IRN USA Radio News.

[06:53.120 --> 07:06.880]  Call AlexNOW toll-free at 877-590-5525. Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[07:10.880 --> 07:18.560]  It is the 26th day of April 2009 on this Sunday. It is six minutes past the hour
[07:18.560 --> 07:24.720]  of our Central Standard Time, 4.06. Central Standard Time will be live here for the next
[07:24.720 --> 07:31.200]  two hours. We're going to open the phones up, but at the beginning of the radio show,
[07:31.200 --> 07:36.560]  I only want to have people from Mexico City or other states in Mexico. I did a special
[07:36.560 --> 07:43.280]  two-hour show last night only for infowars.com, internet stream listeners, and prisonplanet.tv
[07:43.280 --> 07:52.240]  viewers. We got what, five calls from Mexico, a call from the suburb of San Antonio. I got
[07:52.240 --> 07:57.440]  right next door to the school where they're closing the school tomorrow because they have two
[07:57.440 --> 08:04.400]  cases of the bird swine human flu. They're calling it swine flu. It's bird swine human flu.
[08:05.120 --> 08:09.920]  We got calls from Canada where they've had outbreaks. I've gotten emails from Spain,
[08:09.920 --> 08:15.760]  Israel where they've had outbreaks. There's just outbreaks all over the world of this.
[08:16.320 --> 08:20.400]  And so I'm going to give out the toll-free number. And I know some people from Mexico can't call
[08:20.400 --> 08:24.320]  a toll-free number. You'll need to call a toll number, but we'll get to you very, very quickly.
[08:25.200 --> 08:37.520]  It's 877-590-5525. 877-590-5525. Or you can call 512-836-0590.
[08:37.520 --> 08:46.640]  But I would ask everybody else to hold, to not call in yet, like I did last night,
[08:46.640 --> 08:50.880]  unless you have family in Mexico. We got some of those calls with eyewitness reports.
[08:51.920 --> 08:56.720]  I did confirm that Aztec TV, that's the big national channel, was saying, was in Felipe
[08:56.720 --> 09:00.640]  Colorado, saying, don't worry, we've got a vaccine for this flu. That's impossible unless
[09:00.640 --> 09:05.520]  the government released it. You can't just days after they identify what it is,
[09:05.520 --> 09:12.320]  then already have a vaccine for it. And you've got Baxter tied in with mixing bird flu with
[09:12.320 --> 09:16.960]  regular vaccines. According to the London Telegraph that we broke just a month or so ago here in the
[09:16.960 --> 09:24.640]  U.S., then it was covered by Bloomberg, AP, and others with the headlines admitting that it could
[09:24.640 --> 09:29.360]  have caused a worldwide pandemic, that 18 different factories in Europe, U.S.-based Baxter,
[09:29.360 --> 09:36.720]  ordered them to mix live bird flu in where the regular vaccines, the perfect way to create a
[09:36.720 --> 09:44.400]  mutagen or to mutate it, exactly what supposedly has naturally happened. Bird flu from Asia,
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.480]  human flu from Europe, particularly deadly strain, and swine flu or porcine, pig flu,
[09:54.480 --> 10:04.560]  from North America have magically mixed somewhere in Mexico and has now jumped species back into
[10:04.560 --> 10:12.240]  humans and appears to be airborne because it's got rapid person-to-person transmission
[10:12.880 --> 10:17.680]  with people who haven't been around pigs, haven't been around birds, haven't been kissing anybody
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.360]  that had it, haven't been holding hands with anybody that had it. So I want to state this
[10:23.360 --> 10:29.360]  on the record, I believe the mainstream media and the governments of Mexico, the United States,
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.760]  the global government, the United Nations are hyping this to grandstand as saviors.
[10:34.720 --> 10:38.800]  In Mexico, on the verge of revolution and collapse in their own admissions,
[10:39.840 --> 10:45.600]  we'll use this crisis to unify support of the people under the ongoing corruption in police
[10:45.600 --> 10:51.840]  state as the government composes a savior. Now, before I had, I was thinking this last
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.880]  night on the air when I did that two and a half hour plus emergency transmission internet only,
[10:58.080 --> 11:01.840]  just the power of the internet was amazing. We had about 9,000 on the free streams and
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.160]  a few thousand watching Prison Planet.TV that are members there and the tuned in with no announcement
[11:08.720 --> 11:13.200]  and we had calls again from, I think, what five calls from Mexico, several from Mexico City,
[11:13.200 --> 11:18.160]  just amazing. Well, now we're on AM and FM stations, you know, places like Southern California,
[11:18.160 --> 11:26.240]  Austin, Texas, Chicago, Miami, Tennessee, not just WBCR and Knoxville, but got another one in the,
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.960]  I got to get a proper list of all these. The point is, there's a lot of affiliates,
[11:30.960 --> 11:34.320]  so there's over 30 picking up the Sunday show now, over 70, the week those shows,
[11:34.320 --> 11:42.080]  with people everywhere who have these contacts. So I want to hear from you at 877-590-5525,
[11:42.080 --> 11:47.760]  877-590-5525, or if you're in Mexico and that toll free number won't work and it works for
[11:47.760 --> 11:58.160]  some people in Mexico, but with some plans it doesn't, 512-836-0590. Again, that's 512-836-0590.
[11:58.160 --> 12:03.760]  Okay, let me break down the issues here.
[12:07.120 --> 12:14.880]  Just like right before 9-11, I saw preparatory brainwashing on television, the radio and in print
[12:14.880 --> 12:21.120]  saying Al Qaeda is going to attack us. I mean, the average American didn't even know what Al
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.040]  Qaeda was then. Maybe one in a hundred did. They introduced the enemy. They said they're
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.560]  about to get you. When they do, we're going to take all your rights. And I saw the feds and the
[12:30.560 --> 12:33.840]  army putting out white papers about how they'd already set up Homeland Security. This is before
[12:33.840 --> 12:39.200]  9-11. It wasn't set up in 2002, folks. We have those documents. In fact, we have some of them
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.360]  tonight. We're going to go over. And I saw them getting ready to stage an attack. That's how I
[12:45.360 --> 12:50.000]  went on air and said, okay, they're going to stage an attack saying Al Qaeda, known CIA front, did it.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.920]  They'll probably attack the World Trade Center again since the feds had done that in 93 on
[12:53.920 --> 12:57.280]  record even the New York Times had been at the FBI, cooked the bomb, trained the drivers.
[12:57.280 --> 13:00.800]  They didn't want to go forward. They told them, go ahead. It's just a drill. They tried to blow
[13:00.800 --> 13:04.640]  up the building, but the drivers didn't park it up against the main column. So I said, hey,
[13:04.640 --> 13:09.920]  I think they're going to try to blow up the World Trade Centers. And I said, call the White House,
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.400]  tell them don't do it. Well, the last two months, I never talk about bird flu. I say it's hype,
[13:14.400 --> 13:19.680]  it's baloney, it's fair mongering. If it ever is released and really causes a lot of death,
[13:19.680 --> 13:24.320]  it's been engineered. A lot of major reports have looked at some of the bird flu strains and said
[13:24.320 --> 13:31.920]  they are engineered. They're designer viruses. And then suddenly it comes out a few months ago
[13:31.920 --> 13:38.080]  that Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly shipped out factor eight with HIV and hepatitis in it to
[13:38.080 --> 13:42.960]  over a million people worldwide. They did it with a company Baxter based in the U.S.
[13:42.960 --> 13:48.560]  Then Baxter's caught lying to subsidiary factories from Poland to Germany, the Czech Republic,
[13:48.560 --> 13:54.160]  this is mainstream news, Ronto Star, Reuters, you name it, just Google it. We got stories up on
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.000]  infowars.com and prismplanet.com that detail this and I'm going to go to the latest info
[13:58.000 --> 14:09.200]  of what's happening now. And they mixed the most powerful version of human bird flu, i.e. bird
[14:09.200 --> 14:14.080]  flu that can kill humans, 90% kill rate. Well, those that have gotten all over the world,
[14:14.080 --> 14:18.960]  but it hadn't gone airborne yet, very hard to contract. But if you get it, nine times out of 10,
[14:18.960 --> 14:29.120]  you're dead. And suddenly they mail it out from the U.S. to 18 factories and tell them and list it
[14:29.120 --> 14:35.120]  as regular human flu strain of the year and they say mix it with this wide spectrum of flu viruses
[14:35.120 --> 14:39.840]  for Europeans to have it injected into. And over there, they've had the laws open where
[14:39.840 --> 14:44.640]  these are actually cultured on dead babies. They'll have to call it fetal tissue, but it's
[14:44.640 --> 14:51.680]  cultured in dead babies just to add them a cob twist and I guess royal flush to the
[14:51.680 --> 14:57.280]  nightmare nature of it. That's going on there. So they're breeding up in these big vats with
[14:57.280 --> 15:03.600]  the sought up, minced baby. They've got all this, that's how dignified we think human life is,
[15:03.600 --> 15:06.800]  these eugenicists that run things. You may not care about those babies, but the
[15:06.800 --> 15:10.560]  globals don't care about you either. And so they mix the live bird flu with it.
[15:10.560 --> 15:17.440]  And then they all, and then some of the firms subsidiaries like to test it on ferrets and
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.560]  guinea pigs because if they test the flu virus vaccine on it and it gets sick, that means they
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.560]  didn't radiate the batches correctly. So that it just gives you immunity. It doesn't actually make
[15:28.560 --> 15:34.400]  you sick. Well, not only did the ferrets get sick, they all of them died and they went, whoa.
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.360]  So that one firm in the Czech Republic tested it. Top scientists went in the newspapers and said,
[15:39.360 --> 15:46.880]  this is a setup. Baxter had to have been trying to mix this to cover up a release.
[15:46.880 --> 15:52.160]  And then turns out Baxter is developing separately a bird flu vaccine. They don't have a swine flu
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.960]  vaccine. They're in the news on that today in the Chicago Tribune. And the issue is this is very
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.920]  serious. Even if it is an accident, you know, accidentally 18 locations, 18 different factories,
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.880]  you mail out bird flu to be mixed with regular flu. And the scientist on record all over the
[16:06.880 --> 16:14.320]  newspaper said, this is the perfect way to have it mutate in the vats, in the fetal tissue, sometimes
[16:14.320 --> 16:21.360]  they use eggs too, or monkey tissue. And then if you inject it into human, it'll mutate again and
[16:21.360 --> 16:27.600]  go airborne. Now I'll give you the latest on this bird swine human flu that's out. When we get back,
[16:27.600 --> 16:35.760]  stay with us. When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[17:57.360 --> 18:02.000]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.

[19:35.280 --> 19:40.000]  Times are tough right now and people are unsure about our future. The economy is hurting,
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  even though there are powers that would make us believe differently. Banks are failing,
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.880]  and the gold buyers are buying. Question, with all the chemicals being put into our air,
[19:49.520 --> 19:56.160]  how do you use gold when you're very sick or dead? Investing in precious metals is smart,

[20:42.960 --> 20:48.080]  Okay, we got Santiago, Santiago in Mexico City, there's lots of sick people going to go to him
[20:48.080 --> 20:55.680]  first, Steve in Tempe, Mexico. We'll give us a report on what's happening. Chris in Tampa, Florida,
[20:55.680 --> 21:02.320]  Ken in Shirts, Texas, where they've got five schools shut down for the next few days,
[21:02.320 --> 21:07.760]  so we'll be going over that as well. Again, a lot of data I have here in front of me. I want to go
[21:07.760 --> 21:15.840]  to your phone calls, but here's some basic facts I want to lay out. We have eugenicists that control
[21:15.840 --> 21:21.520]  the major governments of the world, the UN biological diversity assessments, Ted Turner, Prince Philip,
[21:22.080 --> 21:27.920]  Prince Charles, they all write books saying they want 80% of us to die, and they want to come back
[21:27.920 --> 21:34.160]  as deadly viruses to kill us in the next life, and all these weird statements, and State Department
[21:34.160 --> 21:39.920]  Memorandum 200, listen folks, I'm giving you documents saying that they'll give the Third
[21:39.920 --> 21:44.560]  World Nations money if they'll carry out the sterilization and reduction of their population
[21:44.560 --> 21:51.280]  of at least 50%. So when we see things like this in Australia and England are announcing they want
[21:51.280 --> 21:57.280]  one child policies and you can just Google this. England wants to cut its population in half from
[21:57.280 --> 22:03.920]  66 million to 33 million. That's a BBC headline. They say it's good. Australia wants to cut it
[22:03.920 --> 22:11.520]  from 20 something million to half. Those are the headlines this week. So remember, as the government
[22:11.520 --> 22:16.560]  poses as the savior, every time there's one of these outbreaks and things like this happening,
[22:18.080 --> 22:24.400]  we have to remember what they really stand for. Now that said, I think this is hyped way, way, way,
[22:24.400 --> 22:30.960]  way out of proportion, but we have to take it seriously because the security and prosperity
[22:30.960 --> 22:36.720]  partnership documents that were released a few years ago when judicial watch sued to get them,
[22:36.720 --> 22:42.800]  the big North American Union meeting, had them stating the leaders in North America, Mexico,
[22:42.800 --> 22:47.680]  US, and Canada that they would use outbreaks and things to bring in the North American Union,
[22:47.680 --> 22:54.720]  that out of crises, economic, biological, terrorist, that out of any of those three things,
[22:54.720 --> 23:00.640]  economics, terrorist attacks, or normal biological releases, they could claim it's
[23:02.320 --> 23:06.400]  a naturally occurring event and they could be releasing it, but that out of that they would
[23:06.400 --> 23:11.760]  bring in the North American Union. Now let's talk facts. Then I'm going to Santiago in Mexico City
[23:11.760 --> 23:19.680]  who I appreciate holding. This is the most important thing. There are at least 15,000 deaths a year
[23:19.680 --> 23:27.840]  in the United States of flu because of the sanitation not being as good and some other
[23:27.840 --> 23:33.120]  factors. They have around 20,000 on average in Mexico. There's only 100 million people down there.
[23:33.120 --> 23:37.920]  So a country of 300 million people, we have 15,000 deaths on average. Sometimes it's lower,
[23:37.920 --> 23:45.360]  sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's above 30,000. Back in 1918, close to a million Americans died,
[23:46.160 --> 23:50.640]  40 million plus died worldwide. You can pull up Encyclopedia Britannica to see those numbers,
[23:50.640 --> 23:56.560]  and that was a swine flu as well. And that broke out on a US military base just like the 1976
[23:56.560 --> 24:00.800]  swine flu, and that was clearly a biological program. Then they tried to vaccinate the whole
[24:00.800 --> 24:06.240]  population of the US. Thousands of people died, ladies and gentlemen. Many of them diagnosed with
[24:06.240 --> 24:15.040]  Gillian Bernays' diseases on record causing an autoimmune disease that killed them.
[24:17.040 --> 24:25.040]  So what am I saying here? We don't know what's happening right now. All we know is that somebody
[24:25.040 --> 24:31.920]  is lying. We have governments that use stage crises to get more power and control. They could
[24:31.920 --> 24:38.000]  have released this flu. It could be super deadly, like some are saying. It could just be a regular
[24:38.000 --> 24:44.480]  flu. They're overhyping because if you've got more than 15,000 people a year dying in Mexico
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.480]  from the flu, mainly in Mexico City, 30-something million people, half of them almost homeless,
[24:50.480 --> 24:56.000]  open sores, suburbs that stretch for hundreds of miles around the mega city, biggest city in the
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.840]  world. So why are they hyping 80 deaths? It was 68 yesterday, 80 today. The BBC, though, has doctors
[25:03.840 --> 25:09.040]  and others posting in their stories, and the BBC is talking to doctors saying, no, it's actually
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.280]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds dead, but the government's covering it up not to create panic.
[25:13.280 --> 25:18.240]  Then what happens last night? I opened the phones up to Mexico City. They call in and they say,
[25:18.240 --> 25:24.240]  look, I was at the hospital for my wife to have a baby, and there's people vomiting everywhere and
[25:24.240 --> 25:30.000]  passed out in the bathrooms and on the floor. I got calls from states in northern Mexico with
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.840]  people falling down, collapsing, vomiting everywhere, and some of the northern states
[25:35.840 --> 25:42.560]  locking down from the southern states in Mexico. Now, you've got World Health Organization, a
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.040]  bunch of eugenicists openly calling for world population reduction at the UN, say swine flu
[25:47.040 --> 25:50.640]  could trigger global pandemic. Now they're saying it basically is about to be one.
[25:50.640 --> 25:55.200]  Administration declares flu emergency. The White House has announced it. They've confirmed
[25:55.200 --> 26:01.760]  20 plus cases in the United States and growing. Now, we're going to Santiago right now. I just
[26:01.760 --> 26:08.480]  want to make it clear first. Somebody is lying because the reports we get from Mexico and what's
[26:08.480 --> 26:14.480]  coming out in local newspapers is that people are vomiting and sick all over Mexico from southern
[26:14.480 --> 26:19.760]  Mexico right up to northern Mexico, right up to the Texas border. San Antonio's got cases.
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.840]  A town north of San Antonio about New Braunville's has got cases. They've confirmed they're shutting
[26:23.840 --> 26:29.680]  down multiple Texas schools. That's going on, but nobody has died. Though some people are at
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.640]  hospitals in south Texas like San Antonio, you can just Google that, San Antonio to hospitals,
[26:34.640 --> 26:39.520]  have patients quarantine. People are quarantined in some of their homes. They've had family members
[26:39.520 --> 26:44.320]  that have gotten it. It's over 20 cases in California and Texas right now, and now it's
[26:44.320 --> 26:51.520]  in Italy. It's in Spain. It's in Israel. It's in Canada. It's all over the place.
[26:52.240 --> 26:55.760]  The latest news is posted at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[26:57.120 --> 27:06.640]  Somebody is lying here because either it is just 80 people dead, and that really is terrible for
[27:06.640 --> 27:13.520]  them, but that's not unusual for a big flu outbreak. Just because this is a bird swine human
[27:13.520 --> 27:17.440]  flu and it kills some people. Well, if you've got tens of thousands that get sick, some are
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.720]  going to die, especially elderly. What's scary is just like the Spanish flu outbreak in 1918
[27:22.720 --> 27:29.680]  that killed over 40 million. It's hitting young, healthy people, and that's what the 76 one did,
[27:29.680 --> 27:33.360]  too. And then the government count with a vaccine that killed a bunch of people.
[27:34.560 --> 27:39.520]  So let's go to Santiago. Santiago from Mexico City says lots of sick people.
[27:39.520 --> 27:45.200]  Santiago, thank you for calling in. Let us know exactly what's happening.
[27:45.200 --> 27:51.600]  I am calling right now from Valle de Ravel, which is approximately 100 miles outside the
[27:54.240 --> 28:02.400]  I'm very, very fortunate I speak fluent English. My family evacuated to Valle de Ravel yesterday.
[28:02.400 --> 28:09.200]  The symptoms that we have seen firsthand are basically it comes down to a common flu type
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.960]  in the initial onset, but then the problem occurs where you have blood and a very bad type of mucus,
[28:15.840 --> 28:21.040]  and I'm presently, I took antibiotics and we're very fortunate enough to have.
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.880]  We have the money to take care of ourselves as far as my family goes, and I feel very much
[28:26.880 --> 28:30.560]  obligated to call and let you know and your listeners that this had been going on for
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.480]  two weeks approximately leading up to this last week. That's right.
[28:34.480 --> 28:37.680]  The Mexican government now says March 18th. They were already aware of it. Go ahead.
[28:37.680 --> 28:45.680]  Well, I'm an IT professional in the HEPA, and basically it was a common cold initially,
[28:45.680 --> 28:48.480]  and then it escalated day by day.
[28:53.200 --> 28:58.960]  And then some other natural things like colloidal silver and echinacea, all that stuff.
[28:58.960 --> 29:03.120]  So you got it. You're saying you got sick. Oh, yeah. I mean, personally, but I mean,
[29:03.120 --> 29:07.760]  I was not to the point where I felt like I had to be, you know, we're very, very protective.
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.080]  My family, and so we went with our personal doctors. Yeah. Well, the really bad flu,
[29:12.080 --> 29:14.720]  as you know, that killed 40 plus million people in 1918.
[29:15.760 --> 29:19.520]  And stay there. Santiago, I want to come right back to you. It was respiratory.
[29:20.240 --> 29:24.240]  That's what this is. It's actually, it's all in the lungs. So if I sound congested.
[29:24.960 --> 29:27.360]  Stay there, sir. Can you hold for three minutes? No problem.
[29:27.360 --> 29:31.600]  I will put you on hold. We'll come right back to Santiago, right outside Mexico City when we get back.
[29:33.120 --> 29:39.120]  Spring is here. Growing season. The economy is not getting any better. In fact, it's getting worse.

[32:30.560 --> 32:35.920]  now. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[32:35.920 --> 32:40.000]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.560]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.800]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[32:48.800 --> 32:54.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.920]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[32:59.920 --> 33:04.480]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[33:04.480 --> 33:09.600]  any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[33:09.600 --> 33:18.880]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[33:18.880 --> 33:27.920]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[33:27.920 --> 33:40.960]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com, or the GCN Radio Network, providing the world with hard hitting talk radio. GCN, great talk radio, starts here.
[33:46.240 --> 33:52.640]  Look, bottom line, we've got psychopathic, eugenicist, new world order control freaks that think we're
[33:52.640 --> 33:58.880]  a cancer on the precious earth. We've got to have our numbers reduced. And we know they've
[33:58.880 --> 34:02.960]  developed weaponized flues. They've released them in the past. They've tested chemical
[34:02.960 --> 34:08.000]  biologicals on every major population of the planet. And so when something like this happens,
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.600]  we have to look at it very, very closely. But on its face, if they're telling the truth that it's only
[34:16.160 --> 34:21.840]  80 deaths in Mexico of thousands and thousands and thousands that have this flu, you know,
[34:21.840 --> 34:25.440]  they're saying it's only a couple thousand people that have it, that's ridiculous. I mean,
[34:26.160 --> 34:30.800]  they're saying people are sick all over Mexico and only 80 deaths. Well, then it's bad if you're
[34:30.800 --> 34:36.880]  that 80, you know, those 80 people. But overall, flu always kills people. Then why is the media
[34:36.880 --> 34:42.240]  hyping it? Why all the fear? Why is the White House declaring a health emergency? Why is all
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.040]  this going on? Why am I getting calls from Mexico? There are people vomiting and sick all over.
[34:47.040 --> 34:54.000]  Okay, going back to Santiago, right outside Mexico City, he got it a few weeks ago, but got better.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.600]  Specifically, Santiago, from what you're seeing around you, is the media covering this up or is
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.240]  the media telling the truth? What's really going on from your vantage point, sir?
[35:05.120 --> 35:13.760]  Yes, please. Absolutely. There's a complete media washout. For example, myself and my family went
[35:13.760 --> 35:20.160]  to Valle de Bravo evacuated yesterday. My entire, the IT company that I work for, I cannot mention,
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.920]  but they will not be in, we will not be at work tomorrow. There's been a mandatory one week
[35:27.040 --> 35:32.880]  stay as far as we're not going to be going to insider offices. The office was sick approximately
[35:32.880 --> 35:40.320]  10 days ago. We were given the proper medication, the forms of penicillin in the states, amoxicillin,
[35:40.320 --> 35:47.360]  but it's the state of, right now, complete a saray, and there's a very foreboding panic on the
[35:47.360 --> 35:54.720]  streets. That's what we left, my family. Valle de Bravo is about, I'd say, 100 miles, about 150
[35:54.720 --> 36:02.480]  kilometers outside of the Jepa, and that's, okay, I get the state of almost, there's a lot of body
[36:02.480 --> 36:07.600]  guards protecting the families that evacuated that are fortunate enough not to be in the city.
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.200]  The city right now is going through chaos because everybody is sick. It's not, the question is,
[36:13.200 --> 36:17.520]  like, the degree and severity of the sickness, there's different symptoms, which I was getting
[36:17.520 --> 36:25.680]  at, like, it is respiratory, and there's blood mixed with very dark forms of mucus, and I'm sorry
[36:25.680 --> 36:30.240]  to be so upfront with your listeners. That's important, but I'm getting calls from Mexico
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.000]  saying that it's just people all over the place vomiting. I mean, are you witnessing any of that?
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.520]  That was witnessed, unfortunately, by myself. It's going on.
[36:40.960 --> 36:46.400]  Okay, well, then it seems that the media isn't overplaying this. I mean, it is a concern, but at
[36:46.400 --> 36:54.400]  the same time, then if it's so widespread and just a flu that makes people sick, then 80 deaths out
[36:54.400 --> 37:00.480]  of hundreds of thousands that are probably really sick is not that big of a deal unless they're lying
[37:00.480 --> 37:06.880]  in more people than 80 have died, as some doctors are telling the BBC and others out of Mexico City.
[37:07.440 --> 37:10.240]  Are you hearing from anybody that they're covering up the number of deaths?
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.720]  That would have to be the case. I mean, based upon what I've heard, right now I am not in the
[37:16.720 --> 37:22.160]  city because the city became something like, something that you would see out of a Hollywood
[37:22.160 --> 37:30.000]  movie. So, you know, right now things are as far as, you know, breaking down a culture and a people
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.840]  and whatever you call it to be civilized humanity. That's exactly what's happened in that city.
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.640]  And that's why we have evacuated and do you think Santiago calling from outside Mexico City, do you
[37:40.640 --> 37:46.000]  think this strengthens the government that was on the verge of collapsing or does this weaken the
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.760]  government? Well, this absolutely gives them the power to do as they like. As I'm sure you're
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.960]  aware of the people of Mexico are extremely oppressed and this is something right now that
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.600]  that could escalate further. People are very, very sick right now. I mean, it's not just
[38:04.160 --> 38:11.600]  3,000 or it's millions. And they've passed emergency powers to forcibly quarantine, forcibly
[38:11.600 --> 38:17.120]  medicate in the lock-down cities. Incidentally, the new powers were declared as well in the
[38:17.120 --> 38:22.480]  United States this morning with a little fanfare. But the health emergency clauses and executive
[38:22.480 --> 38:28.160]  orders that have already been signed in decades past have now been implemented and are now in
[38:28.160 --> 38:35.200]  force for martial law. If you read the executive orders, that is basically what this states. Now,
[38:35.200 --> 38:41.120]  will they exercise it? The White House is saying this is just a formality, but it will take several
[38:41.120 --> 38:46.320]  weeks for this flu to run its course. And I guess we're going to find out. That's what I was calling
[38:46.320 --> 38:51.440]  mainly because I wanted to let you know, you know, somebody who looks at the calendar every
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.600]  single day, this started about at least 10, 11 days ago. And these symptoms were like a regular
[38:57.600 --> 39:05.200]  flu in the office. And everybody that came down with us, fortunately, was able to get the proper
[39:05.200 --> 39:12.080]  treatment. But then it became a very spooky scenario. And, you know, it's very, very rough
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.320]  right now. You know, the head of the museum that Obama first visited this week when he
[39:16.320 --> 39:21.520]  shook hands with the curator, he died of this flu, the AP's reporting. Do you know anybody that's
[39:21.520 --> 39:28.160]  died? Me personally? Yes. I do not know. I can't, I can't. That is good news because I mean, I would
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.640]  imagine if you say everybody hurt, you know, when you say everybody's sick, I mean, you're saying
[39:32.640 --> 39:41.040]  80%, 90%? Oh, no, I'd say, I'd say probably seven out of 10 people you speak to have had
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.960]  the regular flu. That's why it's so deceiving. The actual culture, I mean, there's so many
[39:46.960 --> 39:51.920]  strata of the culture in Mexico City. And there are many people that do not have access,
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.960]  because they don't have a net out to purchase and get access to proper treatment. Oh, I got it,
[39:56.960 --> 40:01.040]  because people are poor, the flu really spreads bad down there. Very, very true. So I mean,
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.800]  I personally do not know people because of my, my fortunate circle of those that I mingle with.
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.920]  And that's why I felt obligated to call you because there is something very severe happening.
[40:11.920 --> 40:17.760]  And this started about 10, 11 days ago. And so, okay, so, so in closing Santiago, we appreciate
[40:17.760 --> 40:22.640]  your call. We got more calls from Mexico specifically, though, what is your overall
[40:22.640 --> 40:28.080]  feeling just a few days into this really becoming a worldwide, you know, number one story, people
[40:28.080 --> 40:33.200]  panicking all over the world, buying mask up off the shelves, buying Tamiflu off the shelves that
[40:33.200 --> 40:40.080]  Rumsfeld and Bush and Obama own the stock in. That's in the news today. I mean, what's your gut
[40:40.080 --> 40:45.360]  feeling on what's really happening? Is this media hype or are they actually covering up how severe
[40:45.360 --> 40:56.480]  it is? It's very, very serious, because I'm telling you that in the capital, I mean, it's
[40:56.480 --> 41:03.040]  complete chaos. And, you know, that's why we left. And, you know, by the brow right now is under
[41:03.040 --> 41:07.840]  complete lockdown and, you know, there's bodyguards and there's people, you know, making, they're
[41:07.840 --> 41:12.000]  preparing for the worst. This could escalate to something that you could never imagine. And
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.880]  that's why it's all been felt obligated to do this. There's no around in Wimbledon.
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.800]  Okay. Well, thank you. Santiago, last question. We're going to more calls in Mexico.
[41:22.800 --> 41:28.960]  Okay. Specifically, they're, I've seen the president and I've confirmed he's on TV talking
[41:28.960 --> 41:33.600]  about he's going to get a vaccine for everybody. There's no way they could already have a vaccine
[41:33.600 --> 41:39.920]  unless they had been involved in this flu. And then when you look at the chances of one out of
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.080]  99 or, you know, the numbers are even higher, but I've been reading what doctors have been saying
[41:44.080 --> 41:50.880]  to have a mutagen that's part animal, part human, the swine human. Now they're saying it's bird
[41:50.880 --> 41:56.880]  flu, swine flu and human flu from Europe, Asia and North America. This has all the telltale
[41:56.880 --> 42:03.360]  signs and I'm seeing doctors on record saying this of a designer virus. And then as you, and
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.280]  I started my show last night and people were calling in from Mexico thinking what I was already
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.080]  thinking, but not saying that people in Mexico are just spontaneously saying the government is
[42:12.080 --> 42:19.520]  doing this or hyping this to again poses the savior uses as an excuse to kind of just blast
[42:19.520 --> 42:24.720]  society down so all they've got is the state to cling to. What are other people saying around
[42:24.720 --> 42:31.680]  you? Are they thinking the government is involved in this? It's a very hard position you put me in
[42:31.680 --> 42:38.080]  to answer because I work with professionals that they don't necessarily believe the same
[42:38.080 --> 42:43.040]  thoughts that you believe and your listeners believe. However, they are very, very upset
[42:43.040 --> 42:49.520]  because they realize the severity of the sickness could end up being disastrous for
[42:50.640 --> 42:56.880]  our people. And so me personally, I'm very, very upset. I do not feel this is natural. I do not
[42:56.880 --> 43:03.040]  feel this is something out of, you know, I feel this is something that is very serious and that's
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.000]  why I've heard about the things you talk about. I've seen a couple of your things on the internet
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.480]  and I felt obligated to call you because it almost sounds like one of your films that
[43:12.480 --> 43:19.520]  we're very upset that people are dying in masses and millions of sick. Wow. Okay. So thank you,
[43:19.520 --> 43:26.400]  Santiago, for that report. Steve in Tepic, Mexico. You are on as soon as we come back.
[43:28.160 --> 43:34.160]  Everybody else stay with us. We'll be back. This year, many of us will have to make the tough

[47:42.960 --> 47:51.280]  Evil minds that plot destruction. Sorcerers. Sorcerer of death's construction.
[47:51.280 --> 48:02.240]  In the fields of bodies burning. As the war machine keeps turning.
[48:04.880 --> 48:13.280]  Death and hatred to mankind. Poisoning. Poisoning their rain wash minds.
[48:13.280 --> 48:21.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order. Let me give you an actual document. Would
[48:21.920 --> 48:29.200]  you like to hear it? September 20th, 2001, rebuilding America's defenses written by the
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.640]  vice president before he was vice president, Dick Cheney, called for the use of race specific
[48:34.640 --> 48:41.680]  bio weapons on third world populations. And even the Austin American statesman wrote a rebuke
[48:41.680 --> 48:47.760]  saying, what are you at all, Hitler, basically? Okay, folks, it's time to grow up and realize
[48:47.760 --> 48:51.680]  what we're dealing with now. Look, I believe this is just fear mongering. It is a bad flu,
[48:51.680 --> 48:57.760]  gets you very sick. Any bad flu is going to kill a certain amount of people. I got the flu one
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.920]  time and was sick for a week and lost like 20 pounds when I was a teenager. And literally
[49:01.920 --> 49:06.400]  was hallucinating four or five days into it. And they had to go to the doctor and get shot
[49:06.400 --> 49:09.840]  up with some stuff. So I quit throwing up. You get dehydrated. That's what kills you.
[49:09.840 --> 49:14.480]  I guess they shot me up with finagran, I think they called it and that that that into the nausea
[49:14.480 --> 49:20.800]  right there and I could finally eat. But I was weak for weeks after. But this is clearly,
[49:21.440 --> 49:26.880]  I'm 95% there that it's manufactured. By the way, is Dr. D going to be on next hour a little bit?
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.880]  Okay. Yeah, let's have him on at the last 20 minutes or so real fast to pop in. He's a medical
[49:32.880 --> 49:37.200]  doctor. I got a bunch of medical doctors lined up with a weekday show coming up who've been talking
[49:37.200 --> 49:43.760]  about this. Now, my earlier issue was I've been covering bird flu. Paul, Jaren, have I not been
[49:43.760 --> 49:50.400]  lately saying I feel bird flu is in the cards? I've, I, I mean, it's not like I'm psychic here.
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.960]  I study the enemy. I study their propaganda. I've seen them hyping bird flu.
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.760]  A baxter was mixing it in with the regular vaccines. You can't make stuff up like this.
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.280]  And then suddenly all these people are dying in Europe of bird flu taking the vaccines and the
[50:05.280 --> 50:10.560]  media kind of just sweeps into the rug. And I said, I feel a tremor in the force. The last
[50:10.560 --> 50:17.520]  time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. And so something is going on. And I'm
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.760]  right here in Texas. I mean, they're shutting down schools here and there. There's cases more and
[50:21.760 --> 50:26.400]  more popping up in Texas. This is only just beginning, whether it's a deadly flu or a
[50:26.400 --> 50:31.440]  moderate flu or a no big deal flu. But, you know, here they say it's no big deal. And, and, and,
[50:31.440 --> 50:35.200]  you know, it isn't going to kill you. But Mexico, they're saying it's killed 80 something people.
[50:35.200 --> 50:38.560]  And that's the conservative number. And doctors are saying it's in the hundreds and hundreds
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.840]  and hundreds. And every caller I get says it's really bad. Everybody they know or 70% are sick.
[50:44.720 --> 50:48.800]  Let's go to Steve in, how do I pronounce that?
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.600]  To peak Mexico. Steve, you are on the air, sir. Tell us what's going on.
[50:55.600 --> 51:01.120]  That was going on, Alex. This is Steve. I called you last night concerning the Aztec News.
[51:01.680 --> 51:05.680]  Yes, that's right. You're married to a Mexican lady living down in Mexico and you're telling me
[51:05.680 --> 51:10.160]  that, and I did confirm that he's on TV, the president's signal where we've got a vaccine for
[51:10.160 --> 51:16.640]  you. What's the latest info? Correct. That air last night at 7 p.m. And that was on millennial
[51:16.640 --> 51:22.240]  in Aztec News. But I'm just going to translate a little bit of what the speech was into English
[51:22.240 --> 51:27.120]  on the first part of the speech. It was, I have to tell you, this is a serious moment to the
[51:27.120 --> 51:32.160]  national level. I have to mention it too, that this is about an epidemic, not because of the
[51:32.160 --> 51:36.960]  number of cases, which are in a controllable range. It's because the virus has not been
[51:36.960 --> 51:43.600]  present in the world before. And then he follows up by saying the good news is this virus is
[51:43.600 --> 51:49.360]  terrible and treatable and we have the medicine enough to attend to it here in Mexico. So that's
[51:49.360 --> 51:55.040]  what it does. Well, that's total fear-mongering. I mean, they always act like they're trying to
[51:55.040 --> 52:01.440]  assuage fears, but they're actually hyping it. Every new virus is a new virus. I mean, there's
[52:01.440 --> 52:06.560]  literally scientists say millions of new flu viruses a year. They identify tens of thousands,
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.400]  but they can't go out and find them all. They guess there's millions. I mean, you've got thousands
[52:10.400 --> 52:15.360]  of different bacteria in your mouth alone and viruses. And this is, I mean, so he's saying,
[52:15.360 --> 52:19.760]  oh my gosh, it's deadly because it's so new. But go ahead, sir.
[52:20.880 --> 52:26.320]  Oh, anyways, an hour and a half after I got off error with you yesterday, they rebroadcasted
[52:26.320 --> 52:30.880]  it on the news, but they also cut out the part of the speech where he said this was good news
[52:30.880 --> 52:34.800]  and they do have a vaccine for that was cut out. And it gets straight to the point on
[52:35.920 --> 52:39.920]  what the Mexican citizens should be doing down here about washing their hands
[52:39.920 --> 52:45.680]  and no kissing, just the typical things to stay away from the people. So...
[52:45.680 --> 52:50.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, I mean, folks, the reason this has to be taken serious, and there's, again,
[52:51.120 --> 52:55.040]  hundreds and hundreds of flus every year that get people sick around the world. But,
[52:55.040 --> 52:58.720]  you know, they say in different hemispheres or two different flu seasons, there might be as many
[52:58.720 --> 53:03.920]  as 20 or 30 flus that get widespread and what they call pandemic when a certain percentage
[53:03.920 --> 53:07.440]  of the population has them. But it's only pandemic and then it makes you sick. It's not
[53:07.440 --> 53:13.920]  pandemic and the idea of killing people. But the reason you have to take this serious is because
[53:13.920 --> 53:19.680]  the swine flu epidemic of 1918 killed 40 plus million people. Then they have the 76 swine flu
[53:19.680 --> 53:23.920]  that also broke out of the US military base. Clearly a bio weapon that's been looked at,
[53:23.920 --> 53:27.920]  and it was a designer virus. Scientists have reported. And then they tried to make the whole
[53:27.920 --> 53:33.040]  population take the swine flu vaccine and it killed a bunch of people. That's the Washington Post.
[53:33.040 --> 53:37.040]  You can just Google swine flu deaths, swine flu vaccine deaths. You'll pull up all the
[53:37.040 --> 53:42.800]  articles on that. Anything else? What part of Mexico are you in? And are you seeing sick people
[53:42.800 --> 53:48.960]  in your area? I'm not actually seeing sick people in my area because I'm staying inside my house.
[53:48.960 --> 53:54.640]  But yesterday when I was out and I'm in the state capital of Magarete, Mexico, which is the peak.
[53:54.640 --> 54:00.400]  And I am noticing there's a lot of people walking around with their mask on, a lot more than normal.
[54:00.400 --> 54:05.360]  So I don't know the severity of what's going on here, but I'm just staying in my house now. So
[54:05.360 --> 54:12.400]  that's all I have at this point. Okay. Thank you so much, Steve, for calling from Topique,
[54:12.400 --> 54:19.680]  Mexico. Thank you so much. Now, I just want to be clear about this. I want to be clear. It is the
[54:19.680 --> 54:25.040]  World Health Organization saying this could be a deadly pandemic. That's the headline. It is
[54:25.040 --> 54:30.080]  Politico reporting. Administration declares flu emergency. An unusual Sunday briefing at the
[54:30.080 --> 54:35.040]  White House, administration officials said a public health emergency is being declared. That's
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.600]  martial law for those that didn't know. But the question is, will they drop the hammer? How
[54:39.600 --> 54:44.720]  intense will it be? So when they declare it, that means they've taken the safety off the gun
[54:44.720 --> 54:49.680]  that would engage martial law. But officially it is martial law. Let me say that again. In an
[54:49.680 --> 54:53.200]  unusual Sunday briefing at the White House, administration officials said a public health
[54:53.200 --> 54:58.320]  emergency is being declared in the United States in order to mobilize maximum resources
[54:58.320 --> 55:05.280]  to combat fears of global swine flu pandemic. The term sounds more severe than it really is
[55:05.280 --> 55:09.600]  said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who called the measure standard operating
[55:09.600 --> 55:14.000]  procedure adding, I wish we could call it a declaration of emergency preparedness. The
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.320]  same measures he said were taken at free inauguration in case of a flutter hurricane.
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.280]  And it goes on from there. Some of the other news. Mexico declares emergency
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.960]  on swine flu as death toll climbs Bloomberg. Deadly fly swine flu spreads across the Pacific.
[55:28.960 --> 55:33.360]  They keep calling it swine flu. This is a never before seen. I mean, in a way, Calderon's right
[55:34.480 --> 55:40.320]  because every new virus is new. But this is really new. So I'm there and criticizing him. But the
[55:40.320 --> 55:46.880]  more I think about it, this is bird flu, swine flu, and human from all over the world mixed
[55:46.880 --> 55:51.520]  together magically. And if you know how these things normally mutate, the most common thing is
[55:51.520 --> 55:56.560]  say South Korea, where they have big geese coops right next to the human sewage slurries. They
[55:56.560 --> 56:02.720]  call them honeypots. They put all the sewage in there, the bacteria eat it, heats up to 135 degrees,
[56:02.720 --> 56:09.600]  then all the bacteria die and it's great fertilizer. And within all of that sewage they
[56:09.600 --> 56:15.360]  use for fertilizer on their rice crops and others. It's a perfect place for different flu viruses
[56:15.360 --> 56:23.040]  to merge with each other. Okay. Well, flu viruses from Europe, Asia, and North America all merged
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.880]  in Mexico. And then I've got the Mexican government and other reports here saying they first identified
[56:28.880 --> 56:39.200]  this virus on the 18th of March. That is 38 days ago. I don't know. What's March 18th to the 25th?
[56:39.200 --> 56:47.200]  Yeah, it's like 38 days. It's off the top of my head. The point is, is that you've got 30 plus days
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.240]  here. You know, they never shut the border. They never warned anybody. They never did anything.
[56:52.240 --> 56:57.680]  The border is still wide open. And it just does become some type of mega massive pandemic. Mexico
[56:57.680 --> 57:01.200]  will collapse. I've had state senators on there saying basically it's already martial law on the
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.160]  Texas border. They've got troops down there waiting for Mexico to collapse, saying it's a good chance
[57:06.160 --> 57:10.720]  it will collapse. It's because of the corruption. And now you throw a flu in on top of it.
[57:12.000 --> 57:18.240]  I mean, this is a serious situation. And hey, I'm in Texas, 45 miles south of me. There's a
[57:18.960 --> 57:27.920]  town north of San Antonio, right by New Braunfels, that's got a shirt that's got the school shut down
[57:27.920 --> 57:32.720]  everything else. Let's take another call here. Who's up next? Chris in Tampa, Florida.
[57:32.720 --> 57:38.400]  And I guess he's going to give us natural protections for bird and swine for them.
[57:38.400 --> 57:45.360]  We got Atlanta call with Dre Cobb County cops posted up all over. I want to know,
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.640]  I'm going to go to him first. I don't know what that means. Let's go to him first.
[57:48.640 --> 57:54.160]  Dre from Atlanta, Georgia. You're on the air, sir. Yeah. How you doing, Alex? Good sir. What's
[57:54.160 --> 58:03.280]  going on? Yeah, you've got to come to work in a highway 120 on each light, like stop light, stop
[58:03.280 --> 58:08.400]  light in a cop posted there in Cobb County. I mean, like eight cars and then like a 20 mile
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.440]  radius. And don't think I could think of what maybe like maybe it was a parent or maybe a
[58:14.320 --> 58:19.120]  containment. Oh, yes, sir. They admit in fact, in fact, I have stay there. We're going to come back
[58:19.120 --> 58:25.600]  over the news. Can you hold, Dre? Hi, this is Ted Anderson introducing a new way to listen to GCN

[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:34.160]  Clarita, FBI now investigating. IRN USA Radio News. Hello, my name is Michael Delozier. We live in
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.720]  West Georgia. I've been with Andy Willoughby's three-step plan for the past three months. I love
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:42.960]  that Andy Willoughby's three-step plan has some credibility because I find that people are asking
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.600]  me, how can I get there? I thought, wow, if all these people want to actually build a business
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:51.600]  and they're all coming into Andy Willoughby's three-step plan, I thought, well, this is really
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:55.920]  great. I gotta do it. And the Lord blessed it and it's just been wonderful. With Andy Willoughby's
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:00.320]  three-step plan, I make a friend and a business partner. I want to build a business that I can
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:05.200]  minister to my family and I can minister to others and have some flexibility to go on mission
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:10.720]  strips. It's just a great program and it's really been a blessing to me. It's been fun. It's brilliant.
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:15.440]  The way it's all put together, especially with the credibility there, if you enjoy people and giving
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:20.160]  people an opportunity to change their life, then why wouldn't you like this? Hi, how in the world

[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:50.480]  said New York City's own JFK airport has reported the most incidents with serious damage. It took
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:56.960]  a near catastrophe to shed light on the problem. Hopefully, it won't take a full-blown tragedy
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:04.480]  to make us deal with it. Unruly passenger aboard a flight from New York to Israel forced the pilot

[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:23.760]  were able to subdue that passenger. Meanwhile, a spokesman says it was not an act of terrorism.

[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:24.640]  Mexico on lockdown, civil emergency, they've announced a health emergency here in the United
[1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:29.440]  States and they're telling the truth only 80 people have died. That sounds like a lot but
[1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:36.320]  15,000 a year die in the U.S. that flew alone. It's well over 200,000 in an average year according
[1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:44.720]  to the World Health Organization, the who over there at the United Nations.
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:53.360]  So we're continuing to take your phone calls. Going back to Dre in Atlanta, Georgia. Yes,
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:59.280]  Dre, under this health emergency, they have done drills before. It's called Operation
[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:04.320]  Dark Winter. That's coming up in the next segment to during smallpox or pandemic flu
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:11.520]  outbreak to lock down all the cities and then they can have some of these kind of false alarms too
[1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:16.880]  to practice locking down the cities and federalizing things and then they can use that as a cover
[1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:21.280]  for martial law takeover drills that could be for political reasons down the road and they're
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:27.040]  announcing all over the news, you know, the Arizona police to be federalized, state police
[1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:32.080]  merging with the feds, New York police merging with the feds, the army to patrol the streets of
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:36.640]  Schenectady, New York. The Marines are helping at DWI checkpoints two weeks ago in Tennessee
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:41.760]  and they found out the army was running checkpoints of U.S. citizens on highways.
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:46.080]  The governor said, don't do it. The army is in the newspapers. We posted this at infowars.com
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:51.280]  just said, you know what? We're going to do what we want. Shut up governor because we're already
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:55.280]  under this emergency under this control and they use things like this, whether it's real,
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.920]  i.e. a real deadly flu or a manufactured deadly flu or it isn't really a deadly flu and they're just
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:07.200]  hyping it. Either way you cut it, they get more power and control in the nanny state through
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:14.800]  this. We're going back to Dre in Atlanta. Dre, go ahead. Yes, but what can tell me more anything
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:21.680]  though is a lot of people in the Atlanta area is sick and already have the flex sentence already
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:25.760]  and I know the news is saying that a lot of people are starting to get it but I think it's
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:32.720]  already here and I think the government is trying to prepare for the outbreak that will happen
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:38.960]  real soon. That's how it works. It's exponential depending on the flu model and the incubation
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:44.160]  period of the flu. It could be two days, it could be a week. It could be as long as well half of
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:51.440]  180 days. It's half of 180 days. We're talking about 90 days till this thing peaks in the United
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:58.320]  States and see they're saying that they first learned about it in Mexico on March 18th this
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:03.440]  strain. They just told us that in the AP today claiming earlier they said they found it last
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:09.840]  week. Now it's 35 plus days ago. They're saying that they found it and so I don't know. I mean
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:14.400]  this is just getting pretty crazy and we know they've been drilling for martial law and preparing
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:20.080]  for a long time. Then you got Baxter mixing it bird flu with regular vaccines in Europe.
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:23.760]  I mean I've been really talking about that at the lot the last few months and I'm saying that I
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:30.160]  in the cards was a staged bird flu outbreak and now this one curveball from the New World Order
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:35.200]  bird flu, swine flu and human flu all mixed together. That is a designer virus.
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:42.160]  Yeah that's what my fiancee said. She said oh my god that's man made of flu there and
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:48.880]  as far as I say that it really really bugged 18 life for me. Well I would tell you the best
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:54.720]  matter to you for almost a year now. I follow you all the time and I wish you keep the formulas
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:57.680]  of all the stuff they don't come with about and I really want to thank you for that.
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:00.560]  God bless you sir. I want to thank you for listening. Please spread the word.
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:04.160]  You know I'm not perfect. I don't get it all right. I try to get it right though. I try to
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:08.960]  research hard. I've been researching this flu probably the last two days. I've been researching
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:16.880]  it all week but I really got on it the last two days. Probably 15 hours of research and I've
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.000]  interviewed all these doctors and scientists over the years and studied the establishment
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:27.680]  and I'm very upset in my gut and what is the gut? It's the integration of all the info and I'm not
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:32.160]  trying to freak folks out but I'm getting calls from friends and people that live in San Antonio
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:36.720]  that the flu is down there and that people are sick all around them and the flu season's over
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:41.040]  and Paul was just down in San Antonio visiting family and his wife
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:48.080]  and now has respiratory illness today. Now it may be allergies or maybe a cold but again
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:55.120]  they're saying it hadn't killed anybody in the U.S. yet so but why is it killing so many people
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:01.280]  in Mexico because they've got a lot more poor people? You know a common cold in places in
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:06.160]  Africa where they're on the edge of starving to death. A common cold will come through in places
[1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:16.000]  like Rwanda or places let me just nations all over Africa and we'll just you know kill in some
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:22.160]  cases hundreds of thousands of people per nation so we're healthy drink more orange juice take that
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:32.880]  elderberry concentrate super antiviral colloidal silver oil of oregano these are all things garlic
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:40.000]  that have been proven to be very antiviral okay let's go ahead and go to chris in Tampa Florida
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  speaking of things that will boost your immune system against viruses and no folks antibiotics
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.880]  will not I'm getting calls going this antibiotics good that antibiotics good antibiotics do nothing
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:13:00.000]  with viruses you have to have antivirals chris in Tampa Florida folks antibiotics are for bacteria
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:04.880]  because they don't have a cell wall chris in Tampa Florida you're on the air
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:11.600]  right uh the the buyer I have a a lifted envelope or a fat coating that allows them to attach
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:16.400]  to yourselves in order to infect yourselves but it'd be great to um so glad to hear you're gonna
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.720]  have these different doctors on uh as you've had in the Dr. Deagle show I was trying to tune
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:27.280]  in even more I wanted to run by him some of these um supplements and uh we should stock up on them I
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:31.440]  think just because gun control would be a whole lot harder if your phone is really bad so please get
[1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:38.720]  to it quick yeah for if we're able to hold the gun but uh the the influenza viruses uh the h5
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:44.080]  n1 bird flu uh it is a lifted envelope virus I don't know about this current one but uh
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:49.520]  lifted envelope viruses can be dissolved by inexpensive supplements like less of thin or
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:56.880]  magnesium peroxide products that release oxygen in your system or ozone and echinacea the
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:02.320]  first caller mentioned uh I'm I might be worried about because it uh it boosts the immune system
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.760]  that might cause hemorrhagic fever which is why the younger people with a strong immunity succumbed
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:13.440]  to this uh flu and and other foods you know that's true it actually explain how that happens
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:19.360]  because I I forget exactly the people that really have good immune system somehow it then goes in
[1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:26.880]  it goes haywire into overdrive with hemorrhagic fever yes inflammation and bleeding uh has caused
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:31.920]  your blood it just goes into your lungs and uh you're internally bleeding your lungs and other
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:38.160]  organs but um this is this is the uh immune response or the the fact that a lot of uh you
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:44.400]  know your cells uh can't get through inflamed blood vessels uh some other other supplements
[1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:48.960]  that I've found are amazing are things like colostrum that are good for hemorrhagic fever
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:55.440]  you mentioned a guy in boray syndrome uh and it's also good for all types of flu um all
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:01.680]  you're open which is from olive leaf olive leaf extract is is it and even anti anthrax and it's
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:06.960]  against uh antiviral against all the viruses against which it has yet yet been tested uh
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:13.200]  it's in a fungal antibacterial uh it even is uh kills the bacteria that uh can survive in the
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:18.720]  presence of oxygen uh or that could survive in the presence of ozone uh there are other
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:24.640]  things like uh golden seal root so you mentioned the garlic allison uh that dr deagle uh mentions
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:30.640]  a lot the supplement that he sells or has available uh that's the active constituent of garlic
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:35.600]  and uh you mentioned the oregano oil and oh by the way a lot of these supplements kill the natural
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:40.800]  flora in your bacteria so you might want to supplement with things like uh probiotics yogurt
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:47.120]  kefir unpasteurized milk and yogurt um because uh it'll fill up a good bacteria but then again
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:51.920]  an oxygenating supplement will help those good bacteria survive well listen speak of the devil
[1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:56.640]  we got dr deagle coming up for you in about 15 20 minutes to pop in with a quick five minute
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:01.360]  report and i'm going to have him and a lot of others on uh throughout the week coming up this

[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:28.160]  now out on dvd showing how barack obama works for the very same interest
[1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:32.640]  that financed george w bush and until we wake up to that the globalists are just going to continue
[1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:41.680]  to win and expand their power and control okay um the way the media and the government is hyping
[1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:47.360]  this they have flues every year that kill hundreds of thousands of people worldwide 15 000 u.s more
[1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:52.560]  than 15 000 in mexico because they have uh more poor folks and and and worse sanitation
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:22:00.320]  and less and less access to medicine so i mean 80 deaths this is nothing and let's say it runs the
[1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:05.520]  gamut for the next couple months and kills a couple thousand that is nothing you know there's
[1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:11.840]  literally hundreds of thousands dying drowning and in car wrecks and 300 something thousand die a year

[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:38.640]  been caught mixing bird flu with the vaccines mainstream news folks strict measures to fight
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:45.840]  deadly flu in mexico vaccination programs underway that's a headline out of world news out of a euro
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:50.800]  news dot net vaccination programs underway but the emergence of a mixture of viruses has taken
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:57.200]  experts by surprise and forced mexico's president to appeal for calm so i mean how can they have a
[1:22:57.200 --> 1:23:02.000]  vaccine for something that that that just popped up just amazing so that's some of what we have i
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:07.360]  want to blitz through your calls and then coming up we're gonna have dr bill deagle who does a show
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:10.960]  on the genesis network where i do want to kind of pop in just briefly because i want to get to all
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:15.440]  your calls with with his take i don't know his take yet we'll find his take on this but he's
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:21.040]  been big on the bird flu the last few years researching and saying it was coming uh so
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:25.280]  well he's a medical doctor we'll talk to him briefly uh but coming up dark winter pretext for
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:30.320]  top off marshal lauderels this is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com tell you why it's
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:36.480]  so important coming up right now let's go to ken in shirts texas uh you're on the air thanks for
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:41.280]  holding thanks thanks for taking the call let me give you a little rundown on what's been going on
[1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:48.560]  out here thursday they uh thursday afternoon as it were they uh they were calling everybody in this
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:55.920]  area with a recorded call saying that they'd confirmed two cases of swine fluid steel high school
[1:23:55.920 --> 1:24:02.560]  which is in sibleau well then uh and they closed uh still down on friday well then it followed up
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:07.600]  with a letter we got saturday from school district saying what had happened about three hours ago
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:15.040]  they called again and now they've closed down all the schools in sibleau shirts in universal city
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:20.960]  now of course you know that all this sits right outside the front gate around our fair force base
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:25.760]  and i don't have any news on that but they have a high school on the on the base there and i'm
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:29.840]  sure they got elementary school so i i you know i i don't know what else is going on there but
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:36.240]  there's uh well you know the last two swine flu epidemics broke out on u.s military bases and
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:41.920]  were genetically engineered that's clear uh designer viruses so uh and then they had a
[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:47.440]  quote forced an oculation program in 76 for it but it killed so many people
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:52.240]  that they had to stop it because people refused to take it so uh you watch folks are lining up
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:57.280]  already just to get the regular flu shot which has no connection to this flu and it'll just
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:02.000]  run down your immune system but they don't care they want to believe there's a magic bullet for
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.720]  all of this well y'all the national news i think it was friday they said that there's no vaccine for
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:12.960]  this flu so yeah i don't know i don't believe in any flu shots i haven't had one in 20 years
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:17.840]  listen my mother was never sick but she was getting ready for a triathlon years ago like a decade ago
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.640]  she took a flu shot and almost killed her and they admit the smallpox shot the flu shots actually
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:28.000]  gives people in many cases flew and smallpox and anthrax they gave it to the troops killed a bunch
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:33.760]  of them these vaccines are dangerous folks they you know they grow them in dead monkeys and dead
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:40.000]  babies and even the seed stock when they grow them on egg whites uh the original seed stock from
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:45.520]  from from where the pathogen came from was grown on dead monkeys or dead humans nine times out of
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:51.520]  10 so there's all those other viruses and human dna involved cancer viruses you know google vaccines
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:56.240]  and cancer viruses i can't believe folks don't know about this almost every major vaccine line out
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:01.360]  there is filled with viruses that cause cancer then no wonder cancers weigh up these vaccines
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:07.360]  are deadly period i agree all right buddy i really appreciate your call can get to hear from you
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:12.960]  let's go ahead and talk to stewart mass uh stewart's off topic so i'll give you about 30 seconds go
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:20.720]  ahead stewart hello yes go ahead man i'm on the alec show show you are go ahead yeah i gotta i
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:25.200]  guess i gotta be quick because uh you're puts it through calls but uh no i was uh did want to
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:30.720]  say so non-subject which is if they do use them um i'm i'm almost convinced they're gonna go with
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:35.120]  a pandemic because if you think about it once that gets out of the bag man there's almost
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:40.240]  nothing anybody can do about it they just have to follow orders i mean even cops that are and that's
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.760]  the perfect cover to bring in yeah exactly that's the perfect cover to bring in the police state they
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:52.960]  need yeah totally and uh i just wanted to talk about like i've worked myself being a info warrior
[1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:58.720]  since before it was popular uh i'm kind of like i'm not you know some psycho kid living with my
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:04.000]  parents but i am one of those kids like a trust me man i have fought the battle i've been like
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:12.080]  snubbed off of canvases lost countless friends uh every girlfriend i've ever had this is a a bad
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:17.040]  fight well well the french well well well the french resistance had people trying to kill them
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:20.960]  though when they were fighting the nazis so no one you're doing the right things what matters but
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:25.520]  i mean look our our movement's becoming more and more mainstream it may be just the kind of the
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:30.080]  circle you're in but you ought to just get with like-minded patriots and try to wake folks up in
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:34.720]  mass but we salute your work i appreciate your call skirt keep up the great work george and la
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:40.560]  you're on the air go ahead hey alex man i'm so happy to hear from you and to talk to you man i
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:45.040]  want to let you know you're doing a great job man and you're my idol bro no no all of you out there
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:50.080]  fighting tearing your my idols but go ahead and i just want to let you know that out on the day of
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:56.160]  the favorite uh the tax tax rally we went again in new california we were wearing a 911 with an
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:01.680]  insect job and we were we went with folders of two of facts that you told us to print out that we
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:06.560]  were showing people we passed out of the opoma discussion i mean we're doing as much as we can
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:11.920]  out here you know for those that don't know we just had the second last november 22nd we had the
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:16.800]  end the fed protest at federal at fed locations private federal reserve we said another big one
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:21.920]  all over the united states yesterday pointing out the real enemy of the people the private bankers
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:27.280]  go ahead you know what what's so ironic uh dialect is that the day of the day of the taxation we
[1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:32.480]  want to go to do the rally there was no chemicals hardly ever sprayed that day because i wanted to
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:36.880]  go and point out to people because these people need to wake up man they really need to wake up
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:43.200]  dialects i mean i've i've been awake for about a year now i've totally changed my life and i'm
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:49.520]  trying to talk to people but people you know are kind of uh give me the what happens is george
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:56.160]  a prophet's never done in his own country and people think nothing of themselves they're so
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:02.400]  insecure about themselves they when they hear about something scary they don't respect themselves
[1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:07.360]  so they don't want to hear about it because they can't imagine that they could actually change things
[1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:11.760]  or that they could make the world a better place you think enough of yourself and have it in your
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:17.520]  spirit and who you are to stand up and get the word out so let people laugh now at you later
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:21.440]  they will thank you god bless you george we're out of time all right i'm going to come back

[1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:50.240]  you know a lot of you think homeland security was set up in 2002 a brand new idea to keep
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:55.120]  you safe for those pesky lcii attacks on the towers and the pentagon
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:03.600]  well guess what bill clinton gave speeches about it in 93 north com was set up in 95 that is the
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:07.760]  military dictatorship over the united states they're now openly announcing and introducing
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:14.400]  up the slaves and they'll use things like hyping up this bird's swine slash human flu they're calling
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:22.000]  it swine flu it's bird swine human flu uh mixture and so i'm going to play that clip coming up and
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:30.960]  some more of your uh calls coming up here in just a few minutes grant kelly donald and others
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:37.440]  calls from nova scotia to austin texas and i've got this uh audio clip of a fake newscast the feds
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:44.320]  produced for part of their drill just months before 9 11 and it ties into the bird flu it
[1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:49.040]  ties into smallpox wait to hear it but i wanted to briefly and i'll have him up later in the week
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:55.440]  on my show uh medical doctor bill deagle because i've interviewed him before about the bird flu
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:59.120]  and how it's engineered and other doctors and scientists and virologists have looked at it and
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:04.960]  said that uh it's you know the that they're hyping and building an infrastructure for population
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:08.960]  reduction through it but but specifically that under deagle i said some quick questions for you
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:14.000]  and i appreciate uh you coming on the show today briefly uh looking at this and i've talked to some
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.480]  other doctors and people they're saying that if it's a regular mutation it shouldn't be bird pig
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:28.720]  and uh human showing up right at once uh because they would have been tracking different strains of
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:36.240]  bird uh human flu pig human flu before they merge that this is a merger of those that uh don't
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:43.440]  follow any original kind of evolutionary uh original uh chain and then expanding on that
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:51.520]  that if it if it was an isolated mutation uh you know say in a sewage uh yard or a agricultural
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:57.200]  honey pot say in central mexico uh that it would have mutated by the time it went through different
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:01.680]  generations of people and would have been made harmless or a variant but they have the same
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:08.640]  strain popping up all over the world simultaneously points towards not just that it's designer but
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:17.280]  that it was uh actually uh transferred and vectored in an unnatural way not just via airlines and
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:22.800]  tourism around the planet what do you say to that yeah it makes total sense um the if you look at
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:29.440]  veteran veterinarians in ohio and this is reports that are just recent 20 carry swine flu antibodies
[1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:35.440]  in their blood five percent of pig pharma workers uh so it's not uncommon in fact pig flu doesn't
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:41.920]  usually kill pigs the fact that this contains it's like a steamer trunk on the genetics of the virus
[1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:47.120]  with different stamps for the locations where it's been it means that the virus has asian genes
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:53.680]  uh avian genes it has human genes and has pig flu genes which means it comes from a lab
[1:36:54.400 --> 1:36:59.360]  the fact that it already has the lethality that exceeds the normal flu means that it has
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:05.440]  lethal genes in it so it means that it's acquired some of the genetics of in all probability the
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:11.440]  h5n1 which which otherwise would never probably affect humans because until a few months ago it
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:17.920]  couldn't even grow at 100 to less than 106 degrees it also uh could attach to human cells because it
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:22.880]  missed a number of amino acids that allowed it to bind to the binding domain so this virus
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:30.640]  is the bridge in a sense to create a new avian swine flu reemergence and if even if this one
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:38.320]  passes out in a week or two uh don't be uh if people should not be put their guard down this
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:44.000]  is without any doubt a release by the globalists that want to set the stage and insert in the chamber
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.880]  in the cake and it's called the first phase you insert this into the gene populations the virus
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:54.480]  spreads even if it dies down it's going to then recombine in the wild that's called the the bioreactor
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:59.200]  incubation phase let me back you up on that doctor it's up on drudge it's up on info wars.com
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:04.320]  and prisonplanet.com Reuters has the quote from her press conference and i've been looking for the
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:10.240]  youtube but Reuters has it janet napolitano the head of the federal takeover of america known as
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:16.160]  homeland security uh she is saying that even if this burns out in the next few weeks get ready
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:22.320]  for another big pandemic soon and then they point at exactly what you just said so not only will some
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:28.400]  of these variants mutate into harmless you're saying some of it's going to mutate into even more deadly
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:33.840]  yeah there's three major gene issues that are present in the h5n1 worldwide number one
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:40.320]  it's become resistant to tamiflu or ostemovir which is the ozotamivir is the drug of course which
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:46.080]  the former members of the bush administration head shares it it is sensitive to that according to
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:51.760]  their at least initial strains of its all one strain but the street changes firstly in the pb2
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:57.760]  gene there's a gene deletion in the h5n1 that makes a completely bypass the immune system so it is
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:05.120]  more lethal by 30 times the 1918 swine flu it has a poly basic amino acid on the hg which we're going
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:10.480]  to find out in the next few days or weeks what the genetics are if it has six poly basic amino
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:16.240]  acid it means it acquired it from the h5n1 and then there's an ns1 gene change which also makes
[1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:22.880]  it far more lethal so even just these three changes are present we now know besides the five
[1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:28.080]  amino acids on the binding domain if those are present which we know the this new swine flu
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:33.680]  does have them it's going to acquire the lethal genes in the wild because millions of birds all
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:38.320]  over the world are dying including i'm getting reports from british columbia washington the
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:44.480]  state oregon state no we've got a doctor i'm sure you know we've got mainstream articles about pigs
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:52.640]  all over the u.s entire uh herds of pigs on pig farms all dying birds dying and cows dying
[1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:57.680]  which i don't understand and this this can by the way leap into cattle farms i'm going to be on
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:02.720]  some other radio shows here this week it's very dangerous because this can leap into into cattle
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:11.040]  herds wild animals when it when it emerged after the a few years ago in china near zinjiang which
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:16.240]  is an old nuclear site in north china uh it actually and they and the king had game reserve
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.520]  and it got into surrounding communities within a several hundred miles the chinese policy was a
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:27.360]  scorcher's policy they literally came in and killed everything animals humans everything i
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:32.480]  reported china that their approach was we're going to completely stop the soap before but is it right
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:38.160]  to say this is a super virus because well it is and the thing is even if it is doesn't emerge this
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:43.200]  time it's going to come back and well what do you mean doesn't emerge i mean i mean it's clearly
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:48.400]  airborne human to human oh yeah but i mean but i mean but i mean why do we see do you think we're
[1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:52.960]  having cover-ups of the real deaths in mexico because i'm getting all over mexico's city that
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:59.760]  it's just people are sick all over well my guess is the lethality right now somewhere between three
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:05.040]  and eight to ten percent but no matter how it is right now it means that the virus is spreading
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:10.320]  very efficiently in humans it's also probably getting into animal populations and that means
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:15.760]  that it's inserting the genes where it's going to come back in weeks or months mostly what does
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:21.200]  it mean that they're saying this the same virus is all over the world now in just a matter of
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:26.480]  this time and i mean if it went through all these humans to mutate it would have already
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:30.720]  been a different virus correct or or is that there's a lot of it well no because it can travel so
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:35.440]  quickly in the time of the steamer ship it traveled around the world in a matter of months
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:41.440]  now you can travel around the world in the day so i know but i mean through its mutations though
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:45.840]  well it doesn't really mutate what's interesting uh is the old theory was a didroids called
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:51.200]  re-artement so it's like age it is the same it doesn't think all recombination if you can have
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:55.840]  with the thing that's particularly bad about this is you have let's say a bird like a crow
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:03.520]  or a vulture let's say in in texas this virus the swine flu one uh can grow any human or
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:09.440]  a vulture okay or a crow but the avian flu could pretty well only grow in a bird so it's not going
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:16.080]  to affect a human now this what this new virus does is allow a bridge to get into cattle sheep
[1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:22.560]  horses polo ponies humans and it can devastate all kinds of so it's like a rosetta stone and it has
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:28.160]  a skeleton key on the end of it right so it's able to actually jump into other humans animals it
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:33.600]  could wipe out alligators i mean it isn't just going to perhaps go after mammals and the thing
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:39.520]  that i looking at the genetics of this it's going to allow the bridge to allow the the emerging
[1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:45.120]  pandemic will be primarily a swine flu pandemic that'll have new avianized genes and if they're
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:51.760]  not in this particular emergent wave the following waves just like a rogue wave will be bigger and
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.400]  contain the lethal genes so this is the first so this is not high now now dr. deagle a medical
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:01.360]  doctor to see people run out and then take the vaccines they say they're breeding that no in
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:06.000]  fact what they did is they stopped the vaccine the world health organization recommended the
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:11.200]  mexican stop because what they were doing is turning the people of mexico into bioreactors
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:15.440]  because they're inserting attenuated virus that would allow it to recombine when they
[1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:19.760]  have an active infection of the current which is exactly what happened with baxter in europe
[1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:24.720]  secretly mixing it with a vaccine stock which the scientist said was a perfect way to cause a
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:28.800]  mutation correct right and they did it in the uh stay there stay there i want to come back with

[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:53.760]  phone lines here and a ton of stuff i want to get to in this video clip it's a video clip
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:48:02.880]  up on info wars dot com audio here uh for the radio but uh it's so important because notice they
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:06.960]  say saddam hussein working with the taliban and al qaeda right before 9 11 putting out
[1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:12.400]  fear mongering fake newscast shown on tv station shown to feds to brainwash them
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:17.840]  where there's going to be a smallpox outbreak then they stage 9 11 they try to get the police
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:24.560]  a military take the smallpox shots they refuse even under orders the first responders nurses
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:29.120]  doctors refuse the head of human health and human services refuses to take it those that do take it
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:33.840]  a lot of them have heart attacks because of an autoimmune inflammation response that happened
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:38.000]  i want this is coming up but dr deagle i got to get you up on my show sometime tomorrow
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:42.640]  we'll try to do that so just my producer will call you in the morning and i'm also going to get
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:45.680]  Steve quail on and a bunch of other people that have really been on top of this all the dead
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:51.600]  microbiologists governments have been killing uh in the build up to this i hope that this just
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:56.800]  kind of runs itself out and mutates into something that's not deadly but just from my own layman
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:49:01.200]  studies to have it all mixed up like this and come out of nowhere and the way the media is handling
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:08.800]  it uh it stinks to high heaven we know this is their ace in the hole uh your website is what
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:15.600]  neutromedicalreport.com folks can find out more of their uh it's a neutromedical and newtrimedical.com
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:20.800]  the um 12 years ago when i spoke in uh zirq switzerland to human life international
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:25.600]  i was given documents and this is my first major exposure to it that one of the three projects
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:30.720]  they were doing was the world health organization the united nations funded by the roschels had
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:36.160]  uh conspired with the national institute of allergy and infectious disease usamrit and the
[1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:41.920]  center for disease control to exhume the bodies of deceased whalers and take the gene fragments of
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:48.640]  the swine flu 1918 and with a supercomputer and bio engines rebuild the virus to noble so this virus
[1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:54.640]  is resurrected uh it's in you can actually wait are you saying this is the 1918 flow yeah and what
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:59.360]  they did is they then added avian genes and then inserted it into the population of birds since
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:04.480]  97 to get it uh to to to give it a better spread factor right and they spread it all over now it's
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:09.280]  in all continents as of last year and now what they have is they have this new bridge virus and now
[1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:15.040]  inserting this bridge virus which is a swine flu avian human hybrid they now have the bridge virus
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:20.720]  which now as it spreads it's going to allow the weaponized genes which are killing birds to jump
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:27.840]  into other animals and humans well there's no doubt that vaxter international got caught
[1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:32.880]  mixing live bird flu in the main vaccine vats at 18 locations by the grace of god
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:36.240]  the companies found out and said what are you doing and check republic doctors said
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:42.640]  this is the perfect way to mix this in with the other normal flu versions human flues to cause an
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:49.520]  airborne uh super bird flu that has a 90 percent kill rate correct that's right in fact uh we found
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:55.200]  out that the baxter labs we've had alexander s jones not maybe not a direct relative an
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:50:59.680]  nyh whistleblower has been on the show a number of times along with dr rebecca carly and dr h
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:05.120]  ruat and uh we've been tracking literally daily and their phone is now disconnected the biotest
[1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:09.920]  in the check republic baxter's not responding none of the four countries or any of the agencies
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:14.160]  are reporting anything in the media in eastern europe uh we don't know how many countries we
[1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:19.280]  don't know what happened to the 37 quarantine in the check republic there's a total blackout
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:25.200]  and uh they're you know for those that don't know if you just google uh uh homeless died from bird
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:29.840]  flu vaccine it's london telegraph and other news the government told me it was a regular shot at
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:34.160]  a health clinic killed them all deader than a hammer dr deagle we'll talk to you again tomorrow
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:39.360]  thank you so much absolutely amazing important this is not going away well i hope you're wrong
[1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:43.200]  but uh we've certainly got to get serious knowing how evil the globalists are and the way they've
[1:51:43.200 --> 1:51:48.640]  been hyping this yeah absolutely pay attention take care of everybody oh my god all right ladies
[1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:52.560]  and gentlemen and again i'll be on the radio tomorrow 11 to 3 covering all this into tail
[1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:56.400]  anyhow uh if i go ahead and call do i need him to come in tonight the producer let's get
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:00.800]  rebecca carly on i'm going into night after i work on this book i'm working on a book i'm
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:04.480]  writing it for two hours after the show and i want to go i'm gonna go in let's get out of rebecca
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:09.760]  carly on all those other bird flu medical doctors we've been having on uh i want to get steve quail
[1:52:09.760 --> 1:52:13.200]  on because he said monday on the show before any of us was even in the news they were about to
[1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:18.000]  launch a bird flu attack now this may just be a we know it's a manufactured virus i mean that's
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:23.040]  nine 95 chance uh degels saying no doubt many others are saying no doubt even mainstream
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:29.840]  media saying it looks like it's designer but the again just fear mongering killing a few people
[1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:33.040]  causing a bunch of sickness they get to get everybody trained to take vaccines go through
[1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:38.080]  the system they make money you know baxter and others do with the vaccines the tamiflu people
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:42.480]  do i mean this is not me in the end of the world you know uh and i know some people think that and
[1:52:42.480 --> 1:52:47.200]  we're just giving you all sides and all views of this but i'm right here in texas where this stuff's
[1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:51.680]  they're closing schools all around me and i got three small children so we are certainly in the
[1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:56.640]  middle of this here uh let's play this video clip and take a few calls at the end of we have time
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:04.400]  this was in june of 2001 months before 9 11 a fake newscast produced by the feds
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:10.560]  before 9 11 before they blame the attacks on saddam and the fake wmds listen to what they
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:15.040]  were showing feds to brainwash them and fear monger them into accepting the new world order
[1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:20.880]  in marshal law listen to this carefully evening we interrupt our regular programming to return to
[1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:27.120]  southwest medical center the continuing coverage of the outbreak of i said pause no no what you've
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:34.480]  got is you are playing two of those are open two you tubes are open uh so that's up on info wars
[1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:39.120]  dot com or something else is being fed over the computer system in there so i think we need to
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:43.680]  just pull these clips and put them to desk or put them on another computer and we'll play that clip
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:51.600]  when we get a chance if not it's up on uh info wars dot com uh for folks right now just reload
[1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:56.000]  the page that's the best answer to the situation thank you while we're doing that let's take a
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:04.080]  call from kelly in austin kelly you're on the air go ahead kelly um i'm concerned about i teach
[1:54:04.080 --> 1:54:10.160]  public school in austin area and i am very concerned about my students who travel over the border
[1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:14.960]  they don't go to resorts or anything like that but they'll leave for 10 days at a time and
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:18.880]  come back uh how concerned should we be in the public schools right here in austin
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:24.480]  well i mean we should be concerned because we have a criminal government that has been caught
[1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:30.320]  testing chemicals and biologicals on the american people we have dr eric piyanka in biology department
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:36.560]  right here at ut who said he can't wait for airborne abola to kill 90 percent of us and then he gets
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:41.440]  standing ovations at the texas academy of sciences and is invited to europe to speak
[1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:45.280]  and then i had his graduate students send me threatening emails when i exposed him three
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:50.320]  years ago when it broke into national news he's just one of thousands of these characters and
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:56.560]  i would google the graduate students names and see them in white lab coats working at bio weapons
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:01.600]  labs so you find out the folks working at bio weapons labs and the folks that release the
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:07.040]  weaponized foot and mouth in england 2001 it was the government i mean that's confirmed who took
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:13.360]  4 000 plus kids foster kids and radiated them to death declassified us government who in 68 released
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:18.720]  a deadly bio weapon in the new york subway uh the u.s government you know who gets power and
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:24.800]  control who is into this the u.s government that's what i'm concerned about is that then the head
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:28.560]  of homeland security says well this may not be a problem but we think there is a pandemic coming
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:33.440]  soon and they i mean this is dangerous so that's what's happening i appreciate your call is that
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:38.960]  video okay here's the video now we'll play part of it the rest is up on info wars dot com this is a
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:44.160]  fake newscast put out by the government right before 9 11 fingering saddam in league with the
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:49.040]  taliban and al qaeda which was the official story when the globalist staged the false attack of 9 11
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:56:00.640]  good evening we interrupt our regular programming to return to southwest medical center and continuing
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:05.920]  coverage of the outbreak of a mystery sickness earlier today hospital officials said they were
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:11.680]  admitting patients with symptoms that seem to be severe adult chickenpox but now we have new
[1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:16.320]  information we go to andy field outside southwest medical center good evening andy what can you
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:21.520]  tell us she'll we've been moved to an isolated area behind the hospital and off the record doctors
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:28.320]  here suspect that at least five patients hospitalized southwest may have smallpox and for those of us
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:32.640]  who don't remember the disease it is a deadly virus you haven't seen it in this country in at
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:39.120]  least 20 years now if this proves to be true we can have a very serious health emergency on our hands
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:44.800]  but officially the hospital will not confirm or deny that diagnosis and the problem is we don't have
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:50.720]  enough vaccine to go around meaning we don't have enough vaccine for the united states well i would
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:55.920]  like to think that but we don't have sufficient uh stockpiles for the people in oklahoma georgia
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:57:00.400]  or pennsylvania much less for the entire united states population well that certainly doesn't
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:06.560]  sound encouraging what do you mean exactly andy it means it could be a very dark winner for america
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:12.000]  sobering thank you very much for joining us dr. kavlik we do continue to wait for official reaction
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:17.600]  to this developing situation now we go to a special report on the deadly effects of smallpox
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:21.120]  that led scientists to launch an eradication program thought to wipe
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:35.280]  all right something's going on with that computer in there that only happens when we're uh
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:39.520]  live on air and things are like that happening you know what i think it is i think i'll give you
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:43.760]  guys a sheet with the video and where it came from and you got a different version of it but
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:49.520]  remember nightline in 2002 after they staged this in 2001 before the attacks nightline had a week of
[1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:55.280]  fake newscast about a smallpox outbreak uh that happened in the united states and then martial
[1:57:55.280 --> 1:58:00.480]  law kind of like a war of the world's thing where they announced it and uh didn't tell the people
