[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  We are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:14.280 --> 00:22.440]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on the Sunday June 19th 2016. I'm David Knight
[00:22.440 --> 00:28.040]  We're gonna be joined by Alex Jones in the next segment and we have a lot of news as well
[00:28.040 --> 00:33.280]  I don't know if you've noticed these stories have been going up on the drudge report last several days
[00:33.280 --> 00:38.920]  I've seen an ominous trend first. We've seen the Obama budget saying well
[00:38.920 --> 00:40.720]  You know we need to come up with a plan to fight ISIS
[00:40.720 --> 00:44.560]  Hey, I got one let's reduce the size of the army next year by 40,000 troops
[00:44.840 --> 00:49.560]  Okay, but then it gets stranger if you're starting to look at this and it comes out and says
[00:50.520 --> 00:52.520]  Well, we're going to hire
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.520]  Military leaders not just rank and follow but military leaders. We're gonna bring them in laterally
[00:57.520 --> 01:00.000]  We're not gonna let them go through military training or West Point or thing
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.720]  We're just gonna bring in the leaders straight from the private sector because they've got some expertise that we need you realize
[01:06.080 --> 01:10.520]  That is a very dangerous process. I think it's a very dangerous thing to have a standing army
[01:10.520 --> 01:13.800]  But we don't want to have a standing army that is going to be so easily
[01:14.560 --> 01:21.640]  malleable add to that the fact that the house is now rejected in an effort to ban illegal immigrants from military service
[01:21.640 --> 01:28.160]  Now we've had people who earned their citizenship in the past because they had special language skills or special technical skills or whatever
[01:28.160 --> 01:33.080]  But what the Obama administration is trying to do now is trying to use the dreamer act
[01:33.640 --> 01:36.360]  People who have come across the border simply because they want a free education
[01:37.360 --> 01:39.360]  Just having people that are part of that
[01:39.720 --> 01:46.760]  Act the dreamers, you know same ones you see rioting at all the Trump rallies flying Mexican flags saying let's make America
[01:46.840 --> 01:47.720]  Mexico again
[01:47.720 --> 01:53.320]  He wants to make those people go straight into the military. So we cut the size of military down by 40
[01:53.360 --> 02:00.720]  We bring in people who are illegal immigrants. We bring in people who have not gone through regular training as military leaders
[02:01.600 --> 02:07.840]  Does this sound like the National Civilian Service Army that Obama was talking about member?
[02:07.840 --> 02:09.840]  We got everybody so concerned about that
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.080]  Remember that is this how it plays out. I don't know. We're also going to talk about what's going on Brexit
[02:15.080 --> 02:17.080]  again, we see now that
[02:18.160 --> 02:26.600]  the people who want to remain in the bankers the large multinational corporations the politicians that are part of this globalist movement are
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.880]  celebrating in
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.320]  The wake of this woman dying and they're not celebrating there. They're they're crying tears
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.800]  They're they're mourning but these are crocodile tears. We saw over the weekend. We're seeing a dramatic reversal in
[02:40.800 --> 02:45.500]  The poll numbers here. We're going to look at this because I think this is a classic
[02:45.640 --> 02:52.280]  False flag it stinks to the high heavens all the signs are there including the Southern Poverty Law Center being right there immediately
[02:53.320 --> 02:55.820]  With receipts from a tiny obscure
[02:56.360 --> 03:00.400]  Neo-Nazi group in the United States saying he bought weapons from us going back
[03:00.960 --> 03:03.800]  16 17 years ago. They had those records just like that
[03:03.800 --> 03:11.760]  This group is basically defunct. It's being run by a former special forces guy. All of these operations are for the people
[03:11.760 --> 03:15.160]  who are living at the basement who are mentally defective like this guy and
[03:15.920 --> 03:23.000]  The FBI and the co-intel people who run them spend that way for a very long time and all of his neighbors are saying
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.040]  I don't know. This is so out of character with him. You know, he wasn't a racist. He wasn't even political
[03:28.040 --> 03:30.720]  I'm surprised that he could even think about anything like this
[03:30.720 --> 03:34.520]  This guy was just into gardening and he was a mental patient and he talked about all the
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.400]  Medications that he took and how therapeutic it was for him to be a gardener and all of a sudden he turns into this killing monster
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.320]  We've seen that type of thing in the United States before we know what happens with SSRI drugs
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.960]  Especially if you take somebody off of them reduce their dosage give them a placebo whatever what if you train them a little bit?
[03:52.960 --> 03:58.840]  We've had the CIA working in in K. Ultra for 60 70 years since they ended the World War two
[03:58.840 --> 04:04.400]  They've been working on this stuff. Look this has all the hallmarks of a successful false flag
[04:04.560 --> 04:12.680]  The worst part about it is the good people in Britain are allowing themselves be tarred and feathered as racist who have absolutely nothing to do with it
[04:12.680 --> 04:14.080]  just as
[04:14.080 --> 04:19.640]  honest gun owners in America are being blamed for the hate of this Muslim shooter and
[04:20.320 --> 04:23.640]  We're told that we have to give up our guns because the narrative
[04:23.640 --> 04:29.840]  You're also gonna be talking in the second hour to Paul Craig Roberts. He believes that that shooting is a false flag
[04:30.120 --> 04:36.680]  Certainly, there's a lot that is very interesting about that the fact that the psychiatrist who said she vetted him said
[04:36.680 --> 04:43.720]  I wasn't even in Florida at the time and of course she was this was paperwork coming from the world's largest private security firm
[04:44.120 --> 04:48.640]  This security firm was one of the bases that was quoted by the FBI for saying well
[04:48.640 --> 04:51.480]  That's one of the reasons we shut down those four investigations for him because he's vetted
[04:51.480 --> 04:54.600]  You know, everybody's it's a circular vetting process. Stay with us
[04:54.600 --> 04:57.560]  Alex Jones is gonna be joining us in the next segment. We'll be right back
[04:59.920 --> 05:07.840]  Good news in the battle for the Republic this morning as it looks like the Democrats do process violating gun bill is doomed
[05:08.280 --> 05:12.720]  Despite support by Barack Hussein Obama and the Justice Department
[05:12.720 --> 05:21.320]  The legislation would permit the federal government to deny individuals on a secret terrorist watch list the right to exercise
[05:21.360 --> 05:23.360]  The second amendment yesterday
[05:23.520 --> 05:29.840]  Democrat senator Joe Manchin went on the morning Joe show and said due process is a firewall
[05:30.280 --> 05:35.840]  Problem we have and really the firewall that we have right now. There's due process here. It's all due process
[05:36.240 --> 05:41.200]  So we can also yet we want the same thing, but how do we get there due process is what's killing us right now
[05:41.200 --> 05:47.040]  Currently, there are a number of terror watch list all in violation of due process
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.120]  There is basically no standard of evidence for being placed on a watch list
[05:52.120 --> 05:59.400]  And it's nearly impossible to challenge one's status and you can learn more right now at info wars calm
[05:59.400 --> 06:10.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[06:16.080 --> 06:24.160]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on the Sunday, June 19th 2016. I'm David Knight and joining us from the road is Alex Jones Alex
[06:24.160 --> 06:29.960]  David it's great to be here listening to your first five-minute intro. There's so much to talk about I discussed this
[06:30.480 --> 06:34.600]  Some on Thursday and I discussed this some on Friday, but there have been new communiques
[06:35.320 --> 06:44.080]  issued by different members of the German government and by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as you know starting last Thursday
[06:44.600 --> 06:46.600]  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
[06:46.600 --> 06:53.040]  In its 60-plus year history has never put out a statement as broad as bold or as dangerous
[06:53.680 --> 07:01.240]  As their statement claiming that any cyber attacks any hack attacks that they believe are coming from the landmass area
[07:01.520 --> 07:09.080]  Originating on the internet from Russia or any Russian held territories will be seen as physical acts of war
[07:09.080 --> 07:18.800]  Against any NATO member nation or NATO itself or the United States for that matter, which of course is the signatory or the founders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
[07:19.640 --> 07:26.120]  Obviously, I'm not pro-Russia or pro-NATO. I'm pro-human being and and not having a nuclear war
[07:26.920 --> 07:28.920]  But NATO has become a global army
[07:28.920 --> 07:40.400]  NATO has been allied publicly we won't it's been allied longer, but publicly with al-Qaeda with al-Nusra with ISIS
[07:41.080 --> 07:43.080]  For really more than a decade
[07:43.560 --> 07:51.920]  And they've been using it as a proxy army in Libya in Syria in Egypt in Iraq almost their areas NATO's been caught trafficking narcotics
[07:53.120 --> 07:55.120]  NATO is really
[07:55.120 --> 08:02.000]  At the end of World War two what the German power state and all the Nazi money did merging with the West
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.480]  It was an extension of what you could call something like operation paperclip. Now. I'm not saying the New World Order is a Nazi conspiracy
[08:08.480 --> 08:12.680]  I'm simply saying it's an inculcation of those different Nazi
[08:13.040 --> 08:19.520]  And collaborator intelligence networks with Western intelligence networks under an OSS slash CIA
[08:19.520 --> 08:27.080]  1947 National Security Act umbrella, and it's been operating above the law ever since we know the Bilderberg meeting at the
[08:27.880 --> 08:34.920]  Hotel there in Usterbeck Holland the Bilderberg hotel where they get their name in 1954 was only an extension of
[08:37.040 --> 08:38.600]  NATO meetings
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.400]  That were already being held in secret with private corporate directors previous to that
[08:43.400 --> 08:45.800]  So it is the heart of the world government project
[08:45.800 --> 08:51.840]  And it's sucking the energy the money the livelihood out of all the different member states that are in the EU and
[08:52.120 --> 08:57.640]  Controlled militarily by NATO which is the UN army and so it's a very parasitic organization
[08:57.640 --> 09:02.040]  So when we hear NATO wants to start a war with Russia regardless of any problems
[09:02.040 --> 09:07.160]  Russia has or any geopolitical activities they may be involved in Russia is not one one hundredth
[09:07.160 --> 09:12.120]  And I mean that conservatively one one hundredth the threat to human life
[09:12.120 --> 09:18.440]  Then the globalist Anglo-American world government eugenics-based project and so those stories
[09:19.160 --> 09:25.280]  From zero hedge and from info wars and from many other publications are up on info wars calm right now
[09:25.800 --> 09:31.280]  They have links throughout it to mainstream newspapers in Europe and from governmental statements
[09:31.280 --> 09:35.720]  We can all obviously go over some of those with top German ministers and others coming out and saying look
[09:35.720 --> 09:44.360]  This you these latest statements by NATO are our boot stomping their warmongering these are quotes and extremely dangerous and in danger
[09:44.360 --> 09:46.360]  Everyone's stability
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.600]  British troops
[09:48.600 --> 09:54.320]  US troops other real combat troops German troops have been massing in different areas along the Russian border
[09:54.480 --> 09:58.320]  They are moving armaments in from Ukraine to Poland
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.360]  To other areas. This is very very dangerous. We saw probing of Russia in
[10:03.360 --> 10:08.200]  in in 2008 on the on the kickoff of the Olympics when
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  tens of thousands of
[10:11.120 --> 10:18.360]  Georgian troops NATO backed attacked South Ossetia and emcasia to historically Russian held areas on the
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.960]  Georgian Russian border wiping out all the border patrol troops at those facilities murdering everyone as an elicited
[10:25.440 --> 10:27.600]  event to trigger the
[10:27.600 --> 10:34.080]  The Russians pouring in and then our media ran with a hose at the Russians that actually invaded Georgia
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.880]  I mean, I actually went on there and said Russia has invaded Georgia. This is crazy because I was still believing CNN
[10:38.880 --> 10:43.720]  I mean, I knew they lied but I could never imagine David that they would lie at that magnitude. So
[10:44.360 --> 10:50.080]  There is a lot going on. It'd be like saying, you know that the United States attacked Tokyo
[10:51.640 --> 10:55.800]  December 7th 1941 at Pearl Harbor. It's just an inversion of the facts
[10:55.800 --> 10:58.160]  Just like we see on every other case
[10:58.160 --> 11:01.800]  It's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse in the meanwhile
[11:01.800 --> 11:07.080]  We have our reporters all over the country from Phoenix, Arizona to Dallas, Texas the last few days
[11:07.560 --> 11:13.000]  Getting over the top video of people with huge Mexican flags and signs saying let's make
[11:13.600 --> 11:16.760]  America Mexico again and let's make USA
[11:17.320 --> 11:24.320]  Mexico again and the media actually saying how dare Donald Trump supporters not want to make the Southwest Mexico
[11:24.320 --> 11:27.440]  When it had you know, a bunch of different flags and the six flags of Texas
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.080]  We're actually eight flags over Texas, but you know, Mexico couldn't hold it Spain couldn't hold it France couldn't hold it
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.720]  On and on it's just that there's this whole idea that America is bad America's evil
[11:37.720 --> 11:41.880]  All of this is being pushed by globalists. So we'll give up our sovereignty and that's why
[11:42.680 --> 11:46.320]  The New World Order hates Russia so much is because Russia is paying down
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.880]  It's it's international debt to the IMF and World Bank at the fastest rate of any major nation
[11:50.880 --> 11:54.160]  Russia is paying people to have kids Russia has
[11:54.720 --> 11:59.640]  National news shows that even our media says are like Alex Jones with a national TV show
[11:59.880 --> 12:06.440]  Putin's best buddies like an Alex Jones and claims fluoride gives you brain damage and don't take the vaccines and and that they're
[12:06.640 --> 12:11.200]  Chemtrailing everybody and their geo engineering and then Putin's best buddies all have people
[12:11.200 --> 12:17.000]  You know what? It's amazing that Russia has actually found out about the world government found out about the New World Order because
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.880]  The Communist Bolshevik program was run out of London in New York
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Declassified over a hundred thousand
[12:24.600 --> 12:30.120]  Conscripts basically hired not conscripts, but happy you know folks to be funded as mercenaries
[12:30.440 --> 12:38.840]  To who were former Russian immigrants many of them Jewish to be shipped into Russia in 1917 with Lenin's train and Stalin's train of
[12:38.840 --> 12:46.000]  Gold with 25 million dollars of US gold on board to fund the Bolshevik overthrow of Moscow first took them years to get control
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.320]  The rest of the country, but once they got control of Moscow
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.200]  They had control the newspapers they killed the czars and they put in all the newspapers
[12:52.640 --> 12:55.160]  Turn your guns in and we'll give you amnesty
[12:55.320 --> 13:00.880]  Well when the military and others and the citizens turn their guns in what they got was murdered and put in forced labor camps
[13:00.880 --> 13:04.520]  So they traded out one form of slavery for something far worse and so
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.480]  It's very important to understand that we shouldn't be enemies with Russia in my view and and the globalist our ally with China
[13:11.480 --> 13:18.240]  Who is actually taking over the Panama Canal and our deep water ports and has our missile secrets and has taken most of our jobs and
[13:18.240 --> 13:24.120]  Tells Hollywood what movies can come out and lectures us all day long on about if we have Donald Trump or not
[13:24.120 --> 13:30.760]  I mean China is a billion 300 million people its people are slaves its people are in continued uprising against it
[13:30.960 --> 13:38.640]  It's in our business. It has 97% of rare earth minerals under its control. It's got military bases all over the world over a hundred of them now
[13:38.640 --> 13:44.720]  Russia's got three Russia is not the threat Russia's broken away from the world government project
[13:44.720 --> 13:49.160]  It's got its own corruption its own problems, but the new world order wants to take it down
[13:50.160 --> 13:57.000]  Because it's already got a deal with China and others and it wants to be able to go in and and have a same level social engineering
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.320]  In Russia they've had here to cut off the population growth
[14:01.600 --> 14:03.920]  Which they've actually obviously had negative growth there
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.600]  But Russia's trying to fix that and to put them under the same family killing process that we're now under in this country
[14:10.600 --> 14:13.880]  I also want to talk about some of the latest attacks on Donald Trump
[14:14.200 --> 14:20.400]  We have some videos coming up of I mean I played some of it on Thursday, but just this amazing man in Atlanta
[14:21.120 --> 14:26.280]  This black man yelling at another black man who's a Trump supporter, you know saying how dare Donald Trump?
[14:26.280 --> 14:28.600]  You know, he wants to ship the Africans back to Africa
[14:29.320 --> 14:32.680]  And then meanwhile this this this man's wearing a rainbow flag
[14:32.680 --> 14:37.880]  Button and talking about how Trump hates the gays when it's Hillary Clinton
[14:38.320 --> 14:44.880]  That is getting a hundred million dollars from Gulf War states that kills homosexuals just for being gay and
[14:45.560 --> 14:49.440]  That at the same time they're all running around angry angry at Donald Trump
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.200]  Because he says people should have a right to defend themselves and be armed and now even the NRA has come out and said well
[14:55.200 --> 15:00.780]  We don't agree with Trump that who we've endorsed that you should be well armed in a nightclub. The point is they had a
[15:00.780 --> 15:06.940]  A armed security guard who ran off the point is it took the the SWAT teams three hours to get there
[15:06.980 --> 15:09.900]  If you had folks armed in bars, will there be some problems? Yes
[15:10.540 --> 15:14.260]  But someone arm in a bar is gonna happen regardless of their planning something bad
[15:14.260 --> 15:19.260]  So I'm not even saying arm the bars, but but you have to understand that it leaves it as a vacuum
[15:19.740 --> 15:21.740]  for the shooters to come and
[15:21.900 --> 15:26.380]  Target you because the stupid SWAT team takes three hours to get there and that's the reality on
[15:26.380 --> 15:32.180]  On that front, but as people discover the reason they're demonizing Trump is his simple nationalism
[15:32.780 --> 15:36.140]  It's really a big deal. So there's this and a lot more today
[15:36.140 --> 15:40.660]  I'm only gonna be here for one more segment spending some time with the family also gonna be shooting some more ports on the road
[15:40.660 --> 15:57.260]  That'll hand the baton to David Knight and more. It's a big jam-packed global transmission on the Sunday edition info wars.com
[15:58.860 --> 16:04.580]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price
[16:04.580 --> 16:08.740]  You are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why my friends
[16:08.740 --> 16:14.980]  We already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen solar generators really do provide
[16:15.500 --> 16:19.820]  lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently
[16:19.940 --> 16:25.620]  I'm at no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the Sun whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts
[16:26.260 --> 16:30.500]  Intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep
[16:30.500 --> 16:36.540]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge

[20:17.740 --> 20:21.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[20:21.660 --> 20:30.260]  We live in only welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight here on this Sunday, June 19 2016
[20:30.260 --> 20:35.060]  I'm here live in Austin. We have Alex Jones joining us now live from the road Alex
[20:36.140 --> 20:39.980]  That's right, and I'm gonna be here just for one more segment than hand the baton to David Knight
[20:39.980 --> 20:42.740]  But I'll be hosting the broadcast here from the road tomorrow
[20:44.020 --> 20:45.860]  11 a.m. To 3 p.m.
[20:45.860 --> 20:48.620]  Co-hosting with David Knight and others
[20:48.620 --> 20:53.740]  But the big issue obviously is the globalists have taken the gloves off
[20:54.340 --> 20:59.780]  They're moving their program for world government in the overdrive right now, and we now have hundreds of
[21:00.820 --> 21:02.820]  different publications
[21:03.220 --> 21:08.020]  Coming out from Rolling Stone to the Associated Press saying it's time to ban guns
[21:08.020 --> 21:11.660]  It's time to repeal the Second Amendment, so they've gone from denying this
[21:11.660 --> 21:18.820]  For decades even though when they get control of a country the globalists take the guns they get control of a city
[21:18.940 --> 21:23.900]  They take the guns they get control of a state. They take the guns. They've always denied they want our guns
[21:24.780 --> 21:26.660]  Despite the fact that overall
[21:26.660 --> 21:31.100]  shooting deaths since the 1992 or down almost 60% or more putting on which
[21:31.860 --> 21:35.020]  Number you look at from the FBI despite all of that
[21:35.020 --> 21:42.260]  They're coming for our guns as they get more bodyguards and build bigger fences and armored compounds around government buildings
[21:43.060 --> 21:49.500]  people like Lynch at the Justice Department and then people like Johnson at the
[21:53.420 --> 21:58.780]  Democrats when they when they're protected by taxpayer paid bodyguards, they know they're dominating their slaves
[21:58.780 --> 22:03.980]  It's an act of supreme control to take your security away and not let you protect yourself show Lynch
[22:03.980 --> 22:11.460]  A partial transcript of Orlando 9-11 calls will have references to Islamic terrorism removed
[22:12.420 --> 22:18.260]  And so what is Homeland Security doing to taking control of Orlando's 9-11 call system and
[22:19.500 --> 22:25.860]  Saying we're gonna remove him saying I pledge allegiance to ISIS. I pledge allegiance for you know, you know, we have Islam
[22:26.380 --> 22:31.420]  This is why we do this. They won't even let us hear the so-called martyr
[22:31.420 --> 22:33.420]  Matton
[22:35.620 --> 22:37.620]  Tell us why he did it
[22:37.860 --> 22:41.460]  Because we're not allowed to be told that I mean the police already did their job and told us no
[22:41.460 --> 22:44.420]  He pledged allegiance to ISIS and called him to the 9-11 tapes
[22:44.420 --> 22:47.220]  They told us about 10 hours into it on that Sunday
[22:47.860 --> 22:54.780]  Because they knew the media was covering it up and saying that he was a you know, basically a right-winger or something and not telling you
[22:54.780 --> 23:00.540]  He was a Democrat and so now they don't want you to hear him though in his own cool calm collected voice reportedly
[23:00.540 --> 23:02.540]  On the 9-11 tape
[23:02.940 --> 23:04.260]  bragging about
[23:04.260 --> 23:08.420]  What he was doing and why he did it. So his declaration of why he attacked us
[23:10.340 --> 23:15.540]  His declaration of war you're not allowed to hear because it's emblematic of you not being allowed to know
[23:15.540 --> 23:20.260]  There's been a declaration of war against you because they're just gonna let these people in and let them come in here and radicalize folks
[23:20.260 --> 23:27.780]  They're already here and attack and then take our liberties. I know I've talked about that a lot, but this is so again thematic or
[23:27.780 --> 23:29.540]  Or
[23:29.540 --> 23:31.540]  Just highlights everything
[23:31.900 --> 23:33.900]  We're talking about in dealing with
[23:34.500 --> 23:36.500]  with totalitarian government
[23:36.900 --> 23:43.340]  Alied with totalitarian Islam and it's totally incompatible with Renaissance Western civilization
[23:43.340 --> 23:51.220]  And that's exactly why they're bringing these people in. It's why they're accelerating the death of the family
[23:51.220 --> 23:53.220]  You know, this is Father's Day
[23:53.220 --> 23:58.540]  That's why I took the weekend off and the next few days off partially to spend time with my children
[23:58.540 --> 24:03.460]  And to take them fishing and you know playing the sand and things like that because I do understand that at the end of the day
[24:03.500 --> 24:07.100]  We're really going to change the world at the cellular level politically
[24:07.500 --> 24:12.260]  Making our families better spending time with our children informing them about how the world really works
[24:13.180 --> 24:18.020]  So that they can't just be brought up by the state and brought up by their smartphones and brought up by this system
[24:18.020 --> 24:20.620]  That's designed to make them totally independent on the state
[24:20.620 --> 24:27.060]  And I just think about how the government has gotten involved and the relationships have been in women how they've turned us against each other
[24:27.060 --> 24:29.820]  How they've tried to make society as handicapped
[24:30.860 --> 24:35.060]  Financially as possible so that people don't feel like they have money to have children anymore
[24:35.060 --> 24:42.100]  And so the individuals that are out there just totally alone and are only allowed to organize into tribal units
[24:43.020 --> 24:48.500]  Under state sponsored or corporate sponsored systems that are really false that are really
[24:48.500 --> 24:54.820]  Prosthesis that don't even work that are that are artificialities that are designed to be unfulfilling
[24:55.260 --> 24:58.060]  Because what the new world order is building is so alien
[24:58.420 --> 25:04.500]  That's a normal human development. I mean think about how far humans have come in just the last thousand years
[25:04.740 --> 25:08.860]  The things we do today would be total magic or the thing of the gods
[25:09.700 --> 25:14.700]  The stuff of Mount Olympus or Thor's Thor's great tree of the world
[25:14.700 --> 25:22.220]  To ancients a thousand years ago and and imagine where we'd be going with technology in the future if it was based on free market
[25:22.420 --> 25:25.980]  If it was based on free will it was based on independence
[25:26.340 --> 25:28.340]  That would build a very empowered
[25:29.100 --> 25:35.340]  Futuristic society that would still have major hurdles to get over you know not destroying ourselves with mishaps or accidents or wars
[25:35.540 --> 25:42.180]  But with the globalist taking technology and bending it and twisting and pouring their menace and their hatred into everything
[25:42.180 --> 25:46.100]  They do with these Trojan systems. They are forming a
[25:48.500 --> 25:50.100]  System
[25:50.100 --> 25:57.260]  That is absolutely and totally designed on every front to dehumanize us and there's tons of news today to cover
[25:57.300 --> 26:00.100]  It's just at the end of the day. This is dehumanization
[26:00.100 --> 26:07.180]  We're seeing and then one of the final visible pieces of that is taking firearms from individuals and saying you're less
[26:07.900 --> 26:10.860]  Worthy you're less free you're less equal
[26:10.860 --> 26:15.500]  Than some government bureaucrat or some rich person who can hire a private security
[26:16.020 --> 26:21.060]  You the individual aren't trusted and aren't allowed to defend yourself
[26:21.060 --> 26:26.060]  You're not trusted with something that has power and then next it's not going to be guns
[26:26.060 --> 26:32.180]  It's going to be cars cars must be robot driven and controlled because you can't be trusted. They're already saying that I told people that 20 years ago
[26:32.180 --> 26:34.540]  Oh, you can't be trusted in your own home
[26:34.540 --> 26:39.620]  We got to have social workers come at birth and throughout your life and have a state appointed third parent
[26:39.620 --> 26:43.020]  This is all being announced as well that micro manages everything
[26:43.300 --> 26:47.540]  This is the parasites in government and corporations that are corrupt
[26:48.220 --> 26:49.300]  merging
[26:49.300 --> 26:54.300]  With a whole AI system to to to birth a new creation
[26:54.820 --> 26:58.660]  Here on this globe a a system meant to prop up a
[27:00.060 --> 27:07.020]  Terony the likes of which this planet has absolutely never seen so I just want to thank all the viewers and listeners for your support
[27:07.020 --> 27:09.660]  I'm gonna thank David knife for his great work on Father's Day
[27:10.220 --> 27:15.540]  Coming in but I know it'll probably tell you hey as a father of three children
[27:16.260 --> 27:21.220]  And as a person who cares about his family he wants to be here on Father's Day
[27:21.380 --> 27:28.260]  So do I because this is what it's all about is standing up for my children my three children as well and understanding that
[27:28.660 --> 27:31.340]  It's the animating contest of liberty. It's not a
[27:31.340 --> 27:37.980]  Negative to work hard and make films and and produce reports and articles and research
[27:39.180 --> 27:41.460]  in the quest for liberty that is
[27:42.460 --> 27:47.060]  The same motion is sucking air into your lungs and exhaling and it's not work. It's life
[27:47.060 --> 27:50.780]  It's what we're designed to do and when we're not involved politically
[27:50.780 --> 27:56.580]  We're not involved culturally when we're not involved and engaged spiritually at every level. We become to atrophy
[27:56.580 --> 28:02.500]  We become to fall apart. We begin to disintegrate as I've said many times. It's like space travel to Mars
[28:02.820 --> 28:08.660]  The best astronaut once they get there will still be a jellyfish and barely be able to walk because of not having gravity
[28:08.660 --> 28:11.380]  Even if they exercise with limited exercise on their way there
[28:11.540 --> 28:15.660]  There's so many positive things about the modern world and convenience is today
[28:15.860 --> 28:22.620]  But at the same time we are losing our intellects. We are losing our rugged individualism. We are losing our primal energies
[28:22.620 --> 28:29.300]  We are losing our basic instincts and what's left over instincts are being twisted and manipulated and turned against us
[28:29.980 --> 28:37.260]  Rediscover your life force rediscover your will rediscover the the the desire to have a quest and to have a vision
[28:37.460 --> 28:43.880]  In your life and to be seeking your destiny and you will find others that are seeking a greater human destiny as well
[28:44.380 --> 28:48.780]  That's what it comes down to so I'm gonna hand the baton to David night in Austin, Texas
[28:48.780 --> 28:55.340]  And I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. Central Standard Time with a full broadcast with David night coasting with me as well

[33:36.540 --> 33:43.780]  Saying that any kind of a cyber attack that they deem to be serious that they deem to be coming from Russia
[33:44.220 --> 33:46.620]  Would be the basis for starting World War three. I
[33:47.700 --> 33:52.500]  Find that incredibly chilling and of course, what are we talking about? We're talking about shooting in Orlando
[33:52.500 --> 33:57.220]  We're talking about the shooting in Britain, and that is very important
[33:57.220 --> 34:00.660]  Both of these are very key because the way they're being used and we're going to be joined by
[34:00.660 --> 34:06.020]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be joining us in the second hour to talk about
[34:06.540 --> 34:13.140]  He says he smells a rat in Orlando, and certainly there is a lot of suspicious stuff coming out of that the background
[34:13.300 --> 34:20.500]  Checks and and we're told that we have to surrender our freedoms or we have to surrender the 6th amendment to these watch lists
[34:20.500 --> 34:26.260]  Right. Yeah, 6th amendment says that you're going to have you're going to be confronted with the charges against you publicly
[34:26.260 --> 34:30.620]  You're going to be able to answer them. You're going to be able to compel witnesses in your favor
[34:30.620 --> 34:34.060]  You're going to be able to confront the people who are accusing you of something you're going to do this all
[34:34.380 --> 34:37.660]  speedily and in public and if you don't have the means to
[34:38.380 --> 34:40.380]  represent yourself you'll be given a
[34:41.380 --> 34:44.460]  Lawyer to help you with that process. Why did they have that?
[34:45.060 --> 34:49.700]  If we forget about the star chamber the things that were done
[34:50.500 --> 34:54.660]  throughout tyrannical governments in the past that led to the creation of
[34:54.660 --> 34:59.700]  What happened at runny mead the Magna Carta as well as our bill of rights?
[34:59.700 --> 35:03.140]  They knew what happens when you do precisely what we're doing right now
[35:03.540 --> 35:06.620]  It is a hallmark of tyranny. We've seen it in our lifetime
[35:07.340 --> 35:12.900]  Throughout the communist totalitarian blocks. We had writers like Kafka warn us about that a
[35:13.620 --> 35:18.380]  bureaucracy that accuses you of something what you don't know you're just going to get the punishment
[35:18.380 --> 35:23.140]  You don't know why you're being punished. You don't know what you're accused of you just know that they're doing something to you
[35:23.140 --> 35:25.140]  And in their secret proceedings
[35:25.940 --> 35:30.220]  They've worked it all out and they're satisfied that they can do whatever they want to to you now
[35:30.220 --> 35:34.860]  I watch Loretta Lynch Obama's newest attorney general
[35:36.060 --> 35:42.420]  Talking about how well we're not even going to give you a time limit on what we're going to do in terms of stopping people from being
[35:42.420 --> 35:45.540]  able to buy guns, you know the we've got the NRA
[35:46.020 --> 35:50.460]  Desperately trying to cling to some little remnant of the Second Amendment so pathetic
[35:50.460 --> 35:54.260]  So pathetic to see what they're doing along with Donald Trump saying no
[35:54.940 --> 35:58.060]  We won't let people on this mysterious list buy guns
[35:58.060 --> 35:59.940]  But but let's put a limit on it
[35:59.940 --> 36:04.900]  You can look at them for 72 hours and and then they'll be able to buy guns if they're not really
[36:05.980 --> 36:10.420]  Not really a terrorist. She says no no no no no we don't want to tie our hands that way
[36:11.380 --> 36:14.900]  See the Constitution was meant to tie your hands Loretta Lynch
[36:14.900 --> 36:22.620]  You swore an oath to the Constitution. It was meant to tie your hands. It was not meant to expedite
[36:23.260 --> 36:25.260]  Whatever you wanted to do as a government
[36:26.020 --> 36:31.740]  And so that's very concerning when we look at that. It's very concerning when we look at these the shooting that happened in
[36:32.300 --> 36:37.700]  Britain. Yes, it was a horrific thing a young mother young wife was murdered
[36:38.580 --> 36:43.300]  Do you find any of those circumstances suspicious? I certainly do I
[36:43.300 --> 36:47.220]  Certainly do we talked about it on Friday. We'll talk about a little bit more here
[36:47.220 --> 36:51.540]  What has happened with this and of course it has turned this around precisely one week
[36:52.300 --> 36:58.820]  Before the shooting and then this happens remember that this is nothing new when we look at what's happening with this cyber
[36:59.540 --> 37:01.780]  near declaration of war by NATO
[37:03.060 --> 37:08.340]  That should really cause you to be concerned. I remember when I was a small child. I remember the Cuban Missile Crisis
[37:08.340 --> 37:15.700]  I remember having the threat of a rapid nuclear war because I lived in Florida. This is all happening in Cuba
[37:15.700 --> 37:18.020]  I remember as a kid in elementary school
[37:18.020 --> 37:21.220]  It's like you're gonna have to bring your clothes to work because you may not be able to get home to your parents
[37:21.220 --> 37:23.220]  We just live down the block
[37:24.340 --> 37:26.340]  Everybody in the 50s had the sword of
[37:27.060 --> 37:30.500]  Damocles hanging over their head these nuclear weapons and now we've got NATO
[37:30.980 --> 37:34.940]  Putting that there again, and it's not a sword hanging by a thread over our heads
[37:34.940 --> 37:39.820]  It's a nuclear war that is hanging by a thread over our heads
[37:40.700 --> 37:46.660]  Understand how easy it is for the government to create a false flag cyber event
[37:47.060 --> 37:51.140]  That they then turn into a full-blown war. We see these types of things being done all the time
[37:51.180 --> 37:54.260]  They make these decorations like they did in the NDA. They say
[37:54.740 --> 37:58.900]  We're gonna have indefinite detention by the military without due process
[37:58.900 --> 38:03.980]  We're gonna take you wherever we want do whatever we want to you hold you as long as we wish and we're gonna call that an act of
[38:03.980 --> 38:07.540]  That's part of what we do during war now, but then in the NDA
[38:08.820 --> 38:10.420]  Not in the Constitution
[38:10.420 --> 38:16.300]  They then come out and say well if we have a cyber attack that we deem secretly to be an attack
[38:16.300 --> 38:22.940]  Then we'll we feel justified in starting a nuclear war. Let me talk about NATO and its false flags for just a moment here
[38:24.060 --> 38:26.060]  We go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis
[38:26.700 --> 38:31.700]  Go back to JFK and it's now been declassified. Look it up yourself
[38:31.700 --> 38:38.740]  please do please educate yourself unlike this idiot Gretchen Carlson who will get to in just a moment from Fox News who says that
[38:39.820 --> 38:44.500]  The second amendment was written when before guns were invented. Okay, that's what she tweets out
[38:44.500 --> 38:49.300]  She doubles down. She wants a gun ban for whatever she thinks assault rifles are and of course
[38:49.460 --> 38:53.420]  You know assault rifles as she defines them whatever it is in her mind
[38:53.740 --> 39:00.420]  They should be taken because guns were not invented when the second amendment was written. That's the blithering sellout idiot
[39:00.420 --> 39:05.340]  That is telling you I think her program is called real story or something like that on Fox News
[39:05.340 --> 39:10.260]  I mean, this is this is what Fox News gives you, you know, you can you can put lipstick on a pig
[39:10.260 --> 39:12.300]  You can even put a mini skirt on a pig
[39:12.300 --> 39:18.500]  But they're still a pig if they're that ignorant or if they're lying to you like that. Okay, come on
[39:18.500 --> 39:24.260]  She can't possibly be that stupid. She's simply lying to people, but let's go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis
[39:25.620 --> 39:29.420]  They desperately wanted to invade Cuba. They wanted to go to war with Cuba
[39:29.420 --> 39:38.980]  We had Admiral Limnitser who proposed Operation Northwoods, something very similar to 9-11. He said let's get some passenger
[39:39.420 --> 39:45.460]  Airliners. Let's fly them into buildings. Let's have terrorists blow up malls and let's
[39:46.100 --> 39:50.380]  Fingre Cuba. Let's say that it's all Cuba's fault. That'll give us a pretense to go to war with them
[39:51.700 --> 39:56.580]  President Kennedy's reaction to that was to fire him from being the chief for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
[39:56.580 --> 40:00.020]  Then that was shortly before he was executed
[40:00.620 --> 40:07.300]  Sacinated now Limnitser shows up in a few years as commander of NATO forces. It wasn't a career ender for him to
[40:07.900 --> 40:09.620]  propose a
[40:09.620 --> 40:14.900]  9-11 type false flag Operation Northwoods so that they could have an excuse to go to war against Cuba
[40:15.220 --> 40:17.220]  You know history rhymes, doesn't it?
[40:18.220 --> 40:19.820]  he goes to
[40:19.820 --> 40:21.820]  NATO becomes NATO commander and
[40:21.820 --> 40:27.620]  And after the Second World War they decided that they wanted to be able to equip people
[40:27.940 --> 40:31.620]  To fight a guerrilla war in case they were overrun by the Soviet Union
[40:32.180 --> 40:35.580]  They wanted their underground to have that equipment in place right away
[40:35.580 --> 40:39.180]  So they had pre-positioned a lot of stocks of weapons throughout Europe
[40:39.860 --> 40:41.860]  at in the 70s
[40:42.940 --> 40:50.660]  We had a lot of communists were really gaining ground in Italy very popular people were voting for communism and
[40:50.660 --> 40:57.780]  And the right and people like Admiral Limnitser were very concerned about that and they came up with a process
[40:57.980 --> 41:03.660]  That's called Operation Gladio with Operation Gladio what they did was I had these people who were loyal to NATO
[41:04.620 --> 41:12.260]  Created terrorist attacks attributed to them to the Red Brigade kidnapping the Prime Minister of Italy and other things and then
[41:13.220 --> 41:15.220]  Blaming it on the communists and
[41:15.220 --> 41:21.180]  And eventually this was all unraveled because they went after the Prime Minister all the moral and it was shown in Italian
[41:21.180 --> 41:22.940]  Corp, but they don't talk about it here in the United States
[41:22.940 --> 41:26.060]  So you can look that up as well. Please do please check me on that
[41:26.460 --> 41:32.020]  Please check me on that check me on that check me on Operation Gladio check me on Operation Northwoods and ask yourself
[41:32.500 --> 41:41.620]  Would our government do yet another false flag attack to try to start a war with Russia or with Cuba or to invade a country of their choice?
[41:41.620 --> 41:45.260]  There's Operation Gladio on Wikipedia is all over the place so you can look it up
[41:45.380 --> 41:53.140]  So that's a very concerning thing, but let's go now to what they're trying to do in terms of taking our guns because again
[41:53.140 --> 41:58.740]  It's not Islam. It's not this guy who was a homosexual had a lot of guilt
[41:59.340 --> 42:05.620]  Nothing to do with his guilt. There's no cross in Islam to put your sin. He's got to earn his way
[42:05.620 --> 42:11.900]  So he has to kill these people that he can't control his urges that he's been given this conflicted guilt about
[42:12.380 --> 42:17.500]  So he does this and we're gonna talk to Paul Craig Roberts. He doesn't think that even happened
[42:17.500 --> 42:19.500]  But let's go to the official story now
[42:20.060 --> 42:22.940]  He shoots people, but it's not his fault. It's not Islam's fault
[42:22.940 --> 42:28.860]  It's your fault if you're a gun owner and you need to have your rights turned into privileges and perhaps curtailed
[42:28.860 --> 42:30.420]  And so we've got people like
[42:30.420 --> 42:37.500]  Fox News's Gretchen Carlson and she says yes, I'm all for the assault weapon ban and she says things on Twitter when people start to
[42:37.620 --> 42:43.860]  Criticize her for this. She says well, you know same things that our new libertarian candidates say well the second amendment was
[42:44.540 --> 42:50.180]  Only about deer hunting, you know, it only protected hunting rifles things like that, but then she gets really crazy
[42:50.180 --> 42:53.300]  She says that guns were invented
[42:54.140 --> 42:57.980]  After the Constitution was written. We'll talk about that when we come back stay with us

[47:14.300 --> 47:38.220]  Welcome back to the alex jones show on this sunday june 19th 2016. I want to talk about fox news is
[47:38.220 --> 47:47.220]  Gretchen Carlson now she's made an amazing number of statements here about the second amendment going back and forth with people on Twitter
[47:47.220 --> 47:54.220]  And she's come out in in favor of banning all assault weapons and we're seeing this a lot from people on the right now
[47:54.220 --> 48:04.220]  We're seeing everybody embrace this tear watch list whether it is Donald Trump or Barack Obama or you name it
[48:04.220 --> 48:10.220]  People on the left and the right the NRA coming in and embracing the tear watch list the tear watch list
[48:10.220 --> 48:17.220]  Understand destroyed the sixth amendment it contradicts every aspect of the sixth amendment it takes away all your protections
[48:17.220 --> 48:24.220]  All the steps that they're supposed to go through that we just lump together and call it due process I hate to just minimize it to that
[48:24.220 --> 48:29.220]  Because people don't even think about all the steps of due process being able to know what the charges are you are against you
[48:29.220 --> 48:37.220]  Being able to answer them in a speedy trial in public to question the witnesses against you to question to have witnesses in your favor that you bring in
[48:37.220 --> 48:45.220]  To have a defense attorney all of those things and then being found guilty before you are punished not having some kind of a pre crime punishment
[48:45.220 --> 48:52.220]  Given to you before any of those steps happen and yet we see people on the left and right now all coming together
[48:52.220 --> 48:59.220]  From the NRA to Fox News to Barack Obama and his so-called Attorney General
[48:59.220 --> 49:05.220]  And then we've got Gretchen Carlson and she came out and said she supports the assault weapon ban
[49:05.220 --> 49:17.220]  She actually put up a poll on her show at a December 2015 poll that showed a majority of people supported assault weapon ban in that particular poll
[49:17.220 --> 49:25.220]  You know what Gretchen I don't really care one poll does not amend the Constitution so change it change it or obey it
[49:25.220 --> 49:31.220]  She says I'm with the majority today and I'm going to take a stand well you know you can get a poll to say anything you want to Gretchen
[49:31.220 --> 49:37.220]  And you can cherry pick the polls as much as you want and one poll doesn't change the Constitution we have a process for that
[49:37.220 --> 49:44.220]  And you want to ignore that process you want to ignore what the Second Amendment says and you want to not only ignore that but you want to ignore
[49:44.220 --> 49:49.220]  What the Sixth Amendment says and we've got a lot of people who are liberals we've got the LA Times
[49:49.220 --> 49:55.220]  We've got the Intercept we've got a lot of people talking about wait a minute these watch lists are really dangerous
[49:55.220 --> 50:06.220]  Anybody that cares about the Constitution that cares about individual liberty and due process doesn't want to turn this into some kind of a kangaroo court tyrannical government
[50:06.220 --> 50:11.220]  Anybody that cares about any of that stuff that understands anything about that is really afraid of the watch list
[50:11.220 --> 50:18.220]  You should be very afraid of the watch list as well and once they start applying punishments to that watch list
[50:18.220 --> 50:23.220]  The watch list is bad enough already has some punishments applied to it and they're just going to keep expanding this
[50:23.220 --> 50:26.220]  It'll be guns first but that's not where it's going to stop
[50:26.220 --> 50:30.220]  So she says she's with the majority of people when they confronted her on Twitter
[50:30.220 --> 50:36.220]  She said this she said the fact that you're even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons
[50:36.220 --> 50:44.220]  Shows me your ignorance says Greta Carlson don't you know she said that the Second Amendment was written before guns were even invented
[50:44.220 --> 50:53.220]  See this is a woman who is either profoundly ignorant about guns about history about politics about the Constitution
[50:53.220 --> 50:59.220]  And about individual liberty and the principles about it she's profoundly ignorant of all of those things
[50:59.220 --> 51:03.220]  To the extent this is about somebody in elementary school
[51:03.220 --> 51:07.220]  Or she's lying to people thinking she can get away with us to control the narrative
[51:07.220 --> 51:12.220]  She says when she's talking to Breitbart News she says at one point I even asked myself
[51:12.220 --> 51:20.220]  What was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people who think that the Second Amendment was written when they actually had guns
[51:20.220 --> 51:26.220]  When they actually used them against their government when all the muskets were state of the art military weapons
[51:26.220 --> 51:37.220]  Okay you say oh these are black powder rifles yeah there's more people dead in cemeteries all over North America killed by black powder rifle than by anything else folks
[51:37.220 --> 51:42.220]  And they're very deadly they should have big bullets and they can kill people left and right
[51:42.220 --> 51:49.220]  But she says I don't even know why I should be arguing with these people who don't possess the most fundamental knowledge of history
[51:49.220 --> 51:54.220]  I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who's illiterate
[51:54.220 --> 51:59.220]  I would love to have a discussion with Gretchen Carlson on nuclear physics
[51:59.220 --> 52:05.220]  That would really be a hoot that would really be a hoot I'm sure she knows a great deal about that
[52:05.220 --> 52:08.220]  Just like she knows a great deal about history in the Second Amendment
[52:08.220 --> 52:13.220]  She said it seemed like every single person replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong
[52:13.220 --> 52:21.220]  You mean because you think that the Second Amendment was written before people had guns before guns were invented
[52:21.220 --> 52:26.220]  And you don't understand their military weapons look you need to understand go back and look at your history Gretchen
[52:26.220 --> 52:29.220]  As a matter of fact when they first started instituting the first elements of gun control
[52:29.220 --> 52:37.220]  And I guess and that's not counting things like the Jim Crow laws where they took them away from the blacks because they're afraid of them
[52:37.220 --> 52:42.220]  But when we talked about the Supreme Court coming in with its first decision saying oh you can't have a sawed off shotgun
[52:42.220 --> 52:48.220]  What was their rationale? Their rationale was a sawed off shotgun is not a military weapon therefore it's not protected by the Second Amendment
[52:48.220 --> 52:53.220]  We flip that around now now you can only have weapons that aren't military weapons
[52:53.220 --> 52:56.220]  And even that was a lie and they knew that in the 1930s
[52:56.220 --> 53:05.220]  In the Civil War you had several different cavalry units that instead of using a sword used sawed off shotguns and their cavalry charges
[53:05.220 --> 53:10.220]  Okay, that's like I said there's a lot of people dead from black powder and pretty primitive arms
[53:10.220 --> 53:16.220]  But it was about a state of the art military weapons that's what the militia was about
[53:16.220 --> 53:21.220]  We were never meant to be protected by a permanent standing army
[53:21.220 --> 53:26.220]  We never had a permanent standing army until after World War II
[53:26.220 --> 53:31.220]  We had a permanent officer corps but we had a militia that was there to protect us
[53:31.220 --> 53:38.220]  And if it was a real justified war and people believed that you didn't need to draft them
[53:38.220 --> 53:44.220]  You didn't need to hold a gun to their head to get them to sign up to defend their home to defend the Constitution
[53:44.220 --> 53:49.220]  And then she goes on to say Gretchen Carlson says to Breitbart
[53:49.220 --> 53:55.220]  I mean I know the education our country isn't the best in the world but you think she's exhibit A isn't she?
[53:55.220 --> 54:00.220]  I'm wondering if Gretchen Carlson is the mother of Miss South Carolina
[54:00.220 --> 54:05.220]  I've never seen a more empty-headed blonde in my life than Gretchen Carlson
[54:05.220 --> 54:09.220]  Saying that the Second Amendment was written before guns were even invented
[54:09.220 --> 54:13.220]  I don't even know how to respond to somebody like that but of course she thinks that you're an idiot
[54:13.220 --> 54:17.220]  If you know anything at all because it doesn't, your knowledge doesn't match yours
[54:17.220 --> 54:22.220]  So therefore you must be wrong because she's a highly paid Fox News anchor
[54:22.220 --> 54:28.220]  So bow down and worship Gretchen Carlson and let them take away your Second Amendment
[54:28.220 --> 54:31.220]  Just like they've taken away your Sixth Amendment
[54:31.220 --> 54:38.220]  Let's play a clip today. We had on Fox News, we had Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions on Fox News Sunday
[54:38.220 --> 54:43.220]  And he came on to talk about the gun ban and I want you to hear what he has to say
[54:43.220 --> 54:49.220]  How leaders react after a tragedy like the Orlando massacre
[54:49.220 --> 54:50.220]  This is Chris Wallace
[54:50.220 --> 54:54.220]  Gives people an insight into what kind of a leader or what kind of a potential president they would be
[54:54.220 --> 54:59.220]  And I want to ask you about some of the things that Donald Trump has done in the last week, Senator
[54:59.220 --> 55:07.220]  First, his comments the day after the tragedy that seem to imply that President Obama is somehow sympathetic to the terrorists
[55:07.220 --> 55:09.220]  Here he is
[55:09.220 --> 55:12.220]  He doesn't get it or he gets it better than anybody understands
[55:12.220 --> 55:15.220]  It's one or the other and either one is unacceptable
[55:15.220 --> 55:24.220]  We're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart or he's got something else in mind
[55:24.220 --> 55:31.220]  Question, do you know what that something else Trump refers to that he thinks that President Obama has in mind?
[55:31.220 --> 55:33.220]  No, I don't. I don't know what he's referring to there
[55:33.220 --> 55:39.220]  But I do believe he is correct to raise the question that the policies of this administration
[55:39.220 --> 55:47.220]  From going back to 2011 when we were through all our troops from Iraq and allowed ISIS to form and become an entity
[55:47.220 --> 55:50.220]  Probably would never have happened otherwise
[55:50.220 --> 55:52.220]  It's certainly not spread as much as it has
[55:52.220 --> 55:56.220]  Forgive me, I just want to go to what Trump said
[55:56.220 --> 56:01.220]  He said either he doesn't get it or he gets it better than anyone understands
[56:01.220 --> 56:03.220]  He's got something else in mind
[56:03.220 --> 56:09.220]  I mean, that certainly seems to imply that somehow he is sympathetic to radical Islam
[56:09.220 --> 56:17.220]  No, I don't think he means that, but I think he's a criticising him, President Obama, for going too far
[56:17.220 --> 56:19.220]  To not understanding the threat
[56:19.220 --> 56:28.220]  The President and Hillary Clinton now says she wants to go from 10,000 Syrian refugees to 65,000 Syrian refugees
[56:28.220 --> 56:32.220]  When Mr. Brennan, CIA director says we can't do vetting on that
[56:32.220 --> 56:34.220]  We're talking about that when we come back
[56:34.220 --> 56:37.220]  You know what? It is not an issue of gun control
[56:37.220 --> 56:39.220]  This is an issue of border patrol
[56:39.220 --> 56:41.220]  And if you're not going to be able to control your borders
[56:41.220 --> 56:43.220]  If you have absolutely no interest in controlling your borders
[56:43.220 --> 56:45.220]  Then why would you take our guns away?
[56:45.220 --> 56:47.220]  We don't precisely why
[56:47.220 --> 56:50.220]  And we don't have to beat around the bush
[56:50.220 --> 56:56.220]  Alright, today we have a 15% sale off on Supermail Vitality, Brain Force and Secret 12

[58:52.340 --> 58:57.540]  over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[58:57.540 --> 59:03.540]  pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and
[59:03.540 --> 59:09.260]  water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is
[59:09.260 --> 59:14.100]  anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the
[59:14.100 --> 59:20.060]  refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are
[59:20.060 --> 59:23.620]  all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it. You
[59:23.620 --> 59:28.900]  have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a
[59:28.900 --> 59:33.300]  parasite cleanse at least twice a year. Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm

[59:53.620 --> 59:56.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.620 --> 01:00:09.700]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:19.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:25.740]  host. Joining us in the next segment, we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. And he has publicly stated
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:31.740]  that he believes that there's more to this Orlando shooting than they're letting on. I have looked
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:37.740]  at what's going on with Brexit, and I think it is absolutely amazing. I've never been more sure,
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:46.540]  more sooner than I have with this since I saw the Michael Hastings assassination. Look at what
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:51.860]  happened last week. Had like about Tuesday, we saw the gradual momentum building for the leave
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:56.420]  campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. And of course, this is a very key issue for them,
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.020]  very key issue for, and let me tell you what's at stake with it. Listen to some of these headlines.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.540]  We've got Germany. They say they fret about their EU dominance if Britain were to vote to leave,
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.780]  because they're using Britain as a beard to say, oh, no, you don't have to worry about us. We also
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:18.340]  got Britain as a counterbalance. The same time I saw this on a car website, a Daily Mail BMW
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:22.900]  urges voters to reject the Brexit to protect its investment in Mini and Rolls-Royce.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.780]  And they started out the article by saying the German car giant behind two of Britain's most
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.180]  famous car-making brands, Mini and Rolls-Royce, has once more urged the UK to vote against Brexit.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:36.900]  So they say it's all the big politicians, it's the big corporations, especially the German ones.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.620]  And I would have to say, if I was British, I'd have to look at this and say, you know what,
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:47.060]  yeah, Mini used to be a German company, not just a British company, not just a British brand.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.820]  And so did Rolls-Royce. The Germans have taken that over. And the Germans are taking over the rest
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.380]  of the economy here in Britain as well. Do you want financial independence in Britain?
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:02.340]  Do you want to be ruled not only by Germany, but by Brussels, by a bureaucracy that doesn't
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:06.980]  have your best interest involved? As we're talking about this, as you have this consolidation,
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:11.940]  from the national to the international level, and from the international level of the European Union
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:17.540]  to go to a kind of globalism that this transatlantic partnership will bring in,
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:22.900]  every time you go up another level, you lose so much about your individual liberty.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:28.980]  Look at what's happening in Sweden. They're saying, well, a British exit could lead to a
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:33.620]  Sweden exit. Brexit could lead to a Swags exit, they say. And it's because Sweden opened its
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:39.220]  door to Muslim immigration. Today, it's the rape capital of the world. That didn't happen in Japan
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:43.540]  or other places like that. That's an article from the Daily Caller, contrasting the two of those.
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:48.500]  Even the Federal Reserve is getting into the Brexit vote. The Federal Reserve says a Brexit is a
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:52.180]  factor. And considering what it's going to do with interest rates, they're holding those to see
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:58.580]  what's going to go on. So we've seen this go over and over again. Washington Post says Britain's
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.980]  European Union vote could bring Cameron's government crashing down. So you got James
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:07.380]  Cameron's government could crash. The Federal Reserve would feel like they were impacted.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:13.220]  The big German companies as well as multinational corporations that are pushing these things through,
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:17.540]  they feel like they would be affected. The banks, of course, the banks. Do you think these people
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:27.940]  who have trillions of dollars at stake would orchestrate the murder of a young MP in order
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:33.860]  to win this thing? Of course they would. And look at what's happened. June 13th,
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:40.660]  Leav takes a shocking 19-point lead in the Brexit poll. They were ahead by 19 points. But then,
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:45.780]  as soon as this murder happened, as soon as the mainstream media puts out this narrative,
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:50.980]  that this was a hate crime by somebody who was connected to white supremacist groups in the
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:57.060]  United States. And that hit the very day it happened. Immediately, Southern Poverty Law Center,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:03.860]  as well as some neo-Nazi group that I've never heard of that basically doesn't amount to anything.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:07.540]  All of a sudden, they've got all the receipts from where this guy bought everything
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:15.300]  15, 17 years ago, 1999, okay? All the stuff's surfaces. And we're told that he was doing this
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:21.220]  as a hate crime. And now what do we see? We now see that Leav is behind by three points, 42 to 45.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:26.820]  They're not allowed to talk about this. Only the people who want to remain talk about it.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:34.660]  They wave the bloody shirt. They talk about how this is a crime of hate. And they have stunned
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.300]  the Leav people into silence. They won't defend themselves. Just like in the past,
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.820]  we had people who were honest gun owners who wouldn't stand up and say,
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:47.860]  you're not going to hang that crime on me. It doesn't have anything to do with that as a crime.
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.980]  Stay with us when we come back. We're going to talk about this as well as the shooting
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.420]  in Orlando and how that's being used. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be right back.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:35.460]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. No one has put together a formula that

[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:28.260]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to Paul
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.180]  Craig Roberts right now. He's joining us. Of course, he served as the assistant secretary
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:37.540]  of the treasury to the Reagan administration. He earned fame as the co-founder of Reaganomics.
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:41.060]  He's a former editor in columnists for the Wall Street Journal and Business Week. He's written
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:47.220]  or co-written eight books and you can find his website at paulcragroberts.org. I want to talk to
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:52.980]  Dr. Roberts about these shootings and how we see them being used. Not only the shooting in Orlando,
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:57.300]  which is now being used again for gun control and we have people on both the left and the right at
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:03.620]  the top who are joining into this and saying, we need to, we've got these unconstitutional
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:10.340]  watch lists. Let's use them to apply pre-conviction penalties to people. Isn't that great? Isn't that
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:14.500]  great? And the first one we're going to do openly here is going to be take away your firearms rights.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:20.980]  And then we have this massive vote coming up in England on Thursday, something that has
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.620]  a big impact on whether or not the European Union is going to unravel from the bottom.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:29.540]  There were leaders from all of Europe's, as they like to put it in, Reuters. Because you know,
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:35.300]  if you want to support sovereignty and self-government, that makes you a far right extremist, okay?
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:42.020]  They're always identified as far right extremists. And you had people meeting this last weekend on
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:47.060]  Friday. You had leaders of Europe's parties, as they call it, they're far right parties,
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.740]  talking about the European Union, urging Britons to free themselves from what they called heartless
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:58.660]  EU technocrats. And remember, it was the big new Brzezinski that talked about how the world would
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:05.380]  be ruled by technocrats and also came up with the three blocks that they would then consolidate into
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:09.380]  a global governance. They would have a European block, a North American block, an Asian block,
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.820]  and then they would pull them all together into a world government, created the Council on Foreign
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.940]  Relations. I'm sorry, not the Council on Foreign Relations, a trilateral commission
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.340]  echoing those three areas. And now that's what we see with these trade agreements.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:25.860]  Here's a quote from Le Pen from France. She says, the fear mongering of people
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.980]  like Juncker and Schultz cannot sway us. She said this to a crowd of about 2,000.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:36.260]  They're worried that Britain might win back its freedom. We want Britons to set themselves free.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:40.180]  And so do we. Joining us now is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. Welcome.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:46.900]  Thank you. What do you make of this situation in the UK, first of all? Let's talk about that
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.900]  before we do Orlando. Do you think that Brexit is now going to fail?
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:59.140]  Well, it's hard to know what will happen because Obama went and told the British Prime Minister
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:07.300]  that they would not be allowed to leave. So he's been conducting, that is Cameron, this fear campaign,
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:15.060]  Little England, how can we make it on our own? And then there was this murder, which
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:21.940]  could have been arranged or could have been in it burned. And that is being used, which is the
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:28.100]  important part, I suppose, the part we know for sure. It's being used against the supporters of
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:41.140]  Brexit. Yes. And the importance of someone leaving the EU, England or anybody, is that the EU is
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:48.980]  the way Washington controls Europe. It's much easier to control an unaccountable EU commission
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:59.220]  than a whole bunch of separate governments. And as the professor, I think, was from Georgetown
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:08.740]  University in 2000, discovered in the National Archive, released CIA documents proving that the
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:17.300]  EU was a CIA creation. This was reported in the year 2000 in England by Ambrose Evans Pritchard
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:26.820]  and the London Telegraph. And so the whole political reorganization, reinvention of Europe
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:36.820]  is an American operation. And it's very much in Washington's interest, both as a control mechanism,
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:46.340]  but also as the political unity of NATO. Because without NATO, Washington doesn't have
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:54.660]  the foreign basis to exercise hegemony, particularly the hegemony of Russia that they're willing to
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:11:03.860]  risk World War III over. So for a country to leave would begin, I think, the unraveling,
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:13.140]  not only of the EU, but of NATO. And if we got NATO unraveled, the chances of the idiots in
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:20.580]  Washington precipitating a war with Russia or Russia and China would be greatly reduced.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:28.820]  People don't appreciate it. But right now, the tensions between Russia and the United States,
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:34.180]  due to Washington, are far higher than they ever were during the Cold War.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:40.580]  During my entire lifetime, the Cold War, every American president worked to reduce
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:47.460]  tension with the Soviets. You know, you had Kennedy working with Khrushchev to reduce the
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:52.260]  tensions over the missiles we had in Turkey and the ones the Russians put in Cuba.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:59.860]  You had Nixon opening to China, starting the salt talks, getting the Strategic Armed Limitations
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:06.420]  Treaty with the Soviets. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, you had Carter with Salt too.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:13.300]  You had Reagan negotiating the end of the Cold War with Gorbachev. So all the presidents until
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:24.260]  Clinton, but mainly Bush and Obama, worked to diffuse tensions. But now we have these amazing
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:31.460]  accusations, provocations of the Russians. It's an extraordinary thing to watch.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:37.460]  And the risk is very great of a nuclear war.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:44.180]  Yeah, exactly. The situation with the declaration that a cyber attack that they tell us happened,
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:48.580]  and we have no way to know if that happened, that they say came from Russia, we're now being told
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:52.980]  by NATO that that would be grounds for a war with Russia, World War III.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.780]  Yeah. So you see, that's why, I mean, the real importance of
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:07.060]  Brexit is that. It unravels NATO eventually. And therefore, it removes the ability of the
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:11.620]  United States to coerce the Europeans into a conflict with Russia.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:16.580]  Yes. And so this is the importance of it. It's not all the stuff they talk about.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:23.060]  They never talk about what's important. And so this is the real issue.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:28.980]  You know, if somebody can get out and we can start unraveling the CIA creation,
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:39.460]  then the chances of human life continuing, maybe working things out so that we don't kill each
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:47.140]  other off, those chances go way up. So that to me is what's important about the Brexit.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:55.540]  Of course, it's kind of hard to see the British simply dissolving themselves as a nation and
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:01.540]  becoming Europeans, because the English system of law is totally different. You know, it was
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:09.140]  the English who gave us accountable government. There was the English who made government
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:14.740]  accountable to law. They made law a shield of people rather than a weapon in the hands of the
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:24.500]  state. To see all that just disappear and British become some other entity. That's
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:30.100]  just kind of hard to imagine. Well, clearly I can see it happening even in America,
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:36.340]  Dr. Roberts, because we have this watch list is clearly something straight out of the star
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.660]  chambers. We've been warned about this by numerous authors who've talked about dystopian
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:47.060]  totalitarian societies where you are charged and you don't know you're charged. Punishments
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:51.860]  are applied to you without you ever being present at the trial and essentially that's what we're
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:56.660]  seeing now with these watch lists that they're trying to bring in. Well, it's really even worse
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:02.100]  than that with the suspension of habeas corpus because they just pick you up and throw you
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:06.180]  in the dungeon and never give you any explanation. That's right. Or they can simply
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:12.020]  assassinate you on suspicion that you might be in some way connected with terror.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:18.100]  And we've already seen that flaunted in our faces through the NDAA saying we can just pick
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.220]  you up. The military can pick you up. We don't have to give you any due process. We can hold
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:25.380]  you indefinitely. We can ship you to another country to torture you or whatever. I mean,
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.740]  this is right in our face and now they're doing it again and it seems to me like they've got
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:35.540]  everybody at the top, both left and right, complicit in this as well. We've got to take
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.620]  a break and we're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the assistant secretary of the treasury
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:43.220]  during the Reagan administration, father of Reaganomics. He's going to be joining us again
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:16:01.460]  when we come back. Stay with us. We'll be right back. A clean toxic free body is the foundation

[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:53.780]  to Dr. Roberts. Now, Dr. Roberts, we were talking and you mentioned in the last segment,
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:59.460]  that one of the key reasons for Britain to leave that is important for all of us worldwide
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:05.540]  is to put some controls on NATO. NATO is getting very aggressive. We've just seen that they said
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:10.100]  a cyber attack if they can identify it and tell us that they were attacked somehow and that they
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.860]  identified it as Russia, then they say they're justified to start World War III. We've seen
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:20.740]  this kind of aggression against Russia as they move into the Crimea as well. The same people who say,
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:27.380]  oh, we're all for Ukraine seceding from Russia, but Crimea can't secede from Ukraine. I mean,
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.700]  that should tell people something right there, shouldn't it, Dr. Roberts?
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:39.860]  Well, it's just part of the neo-conservatives is starting a world hegemony. So that's a very
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:46.100]  serious problem for peace because the Russians and Chinese are not going to submit to being
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:54.500]  American vassals like the European countries in Japan and Australia and Canada. So it's a recipe
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:02.740]  for conflict with two nuclear powers. There's no prospect whatsoever of the United States or NATO
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:11.300]  or both engaging Russia or China, much less both countries simultaneously in conventional war.
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:19.460]  Even the NATO command said that if a conventional war broke out with Russia, Russia would win it
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:26.660]  in 60 hours. Europe would simply be overrun and that NATO is incapable of doing anything about that.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:34.580]  So the war would be nuclear and there's no winners of that war. Life would simply cease. So
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:44.020]  it's very important in that sense that the political organization and military organization
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:54.500]  that Washington has set up and for its imperial uses for expanding its empire, posing its empire,
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:03.060]  be broken up. And so that's why it's important for Britain to leave because I think it would begin
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:11.860]  an unwrapping, particularly now that the EU is used by the richer northern countries,
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:20.580]  the Dutch, the Germans, to loot the poor southern countries like Portugal and Greece, Spain and
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:28.100]  Italy. So you probably have... They call them the pigs, don't they? Portugal, Italy, let's see,
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:32.740]  what was the other? Ireland, Greece and Spain, they call them pigs. That's their acronym for it.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:43.780]  That's the contempt. Well, it's much more than that because what they do, they go to somewhat corrupt
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:49.780]  governments and say, hey, borrow all this money and then you can borrow the same from us and his
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:57.940]  bank full of money for doing it. That's how Greece did it. And we've seen that for a very long time
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:03.540]  from the IMF and the World Bank under McNamara. He would go into these third world countries and he
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:07.620]  would loan them money that they would use not for building infrastructure, anything that would help
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:14.180]  them to make themselves wealthier, but to create a welfare state and people accuse them of being
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:19.220]  rent seekers. And now we see them doing that in Europe. This is a long pattern,
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:23.380]  something they've been criticized for decades for doing, but nobody ever stopped them from doing it
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:26.980]  throughout Central and South America, the developing countries, and now they're doing it
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:32.340]  in Europe to take away their money as well, aren't they? Well, they get them indebted so they can
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:40.260]  loot them. So to sell off their national assets to first world corporations that pennies on the
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:45.940]  dollar, like the Greeks are forced to sell off their municipal water systems, their ports,
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:53.300]  their protected national islands, they're forced not to have a welfare system, but to dismantle
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:59.940]  so that they can pay the banks. For example, the Greek pensions have been slashed to the bone,
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:08.500]  public employment slashed to the bone, medical care, education, and that money instead is transferred
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:15.460]  to the Dutch and German banks. So, you know, the whole process was described some years ago by
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:23.540]  John Perkins in Confessions of an Economic Kidman. So what we were saying is that with
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:31.220]  the EU now turning on its own members, you know, the Greeks, the Greeks, the Irish,
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:39.860]  the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Italians, there's plenty of reason for the system to unravel it. So
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:48.660]  if a major member were to vote to exit such as Britain, that would probably be the death
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:57.220]  of the EU, and that would in turn lead to the unraveling of NATO. And therefore, this would
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:06.580]  remove the ability of Washington to cause conflicts. It would tend to leave Washington more isolated,
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:13.540]  unable to control the other part of the Western world, which serves as a cover for Washington's
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:21.220]  aggression. So that is the real, most important reason for getting England out. I don't think
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:27.620]  England would be permitted to leave. I suspect that if the vote was to come out to leave,
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:35.220]  it would simply not be permitted. In fact, I doubt it would permit a vote to come to that
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:40.500]  conclusion. That's right. That's right. We're going to continue to talk to Dr. Roberts when
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:44.820]  we come back. We're going to talk about the aftermath of the shootings, both in the UK
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:50.100]  and in Orlando, and his analysis of both of those events and the impact that they can have.
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:53.380]  We'll be right back with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. I'm David Knight. Stay with us.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:29:06.260]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:13.380]  of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense. 60 years ago,
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:19.220]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own,
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:24.980]  air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:29.780]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:36.020]  vitality. Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:42.980]  this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:49.380]  herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[01:29:54.340 --> 01:30:01.380]  in our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex. Dr. Grip, you developed living
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:06.100]  defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:11.860]  waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:17.220]  don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:23.300]  massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:29.140]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:32.900]  everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:38.020]  are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:42.420]  recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:46.100]  back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense,

[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:07.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:36.900]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:40.980]  The former assistant secretary of the treasury during the Reagan administration,
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:46.820]  co-founder of the Reaganomics, and we had an article of Dr. Roberts back on June 14th,
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:52.020]  beginning of last week, saying it will be impossible to get any truth out of the Orlando
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:57.220]  shooting. I wanted to follow up with Dr. Roberts and get his comments on the many strange things
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:02.500]  that have come to light out of Orlando, as well as, of course, how it is being used to say that we
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:08.580]  have to take everybody's gun rights, not just this guy. And we can't do any background checks
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:13.460]  on the people that Obama is bringing in by the tens of thousands. No, we're going to take away
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:17.700]  your Second Amendment rights to protect yourself, to defend yourself against the government. Your
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:26.180]  comments, Dr. Roberts. Well, I don't think we know what happened and that's what should stun us
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:34.980]  because if you have 103 people shot, there has to be massive evidence all over the place.
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:45.460]  Yet we've not seen videos of the numerous ambulances, the numerous emergency medical
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:52.500]  technicians that would be tending to 103 casualties, half of them dead, half of them wounded,
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:57.540]  according to reports. I challenged my readers, which they're a great number,
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:06.420]  to help me to prove the official story. And we found we're unable to find any evidence for it
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:18.420]  other than statements of government officials. We don't see the massive evidence that would be
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:25.460]  apparent if such a mass shooting actually occurred. So what I see in this is the same
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:33.380]  sort of pattern I see in other instances. There's a story prepared and the minute the
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:41.460]  announcement of the event is given, the story is given. So we get the explanation with the
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:48.500]  announcement of the event. So somehow the government knows instantly who did it and all of that. So
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:53.060]  but in lieu of bodies, we get photographs and list of names.
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:00.820]  That's true. That's true. And of course, I were now finding out that the psychiatrist who supposedly
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:05.060]  evaluated him so he could work for G4S so he could get the statewide firearms license.
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:10.900]  She's now saying I wasn't that they put my signature on that form. I wasn't even in Florida there.
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:17.060]  I wasn't even working in Florida at the time. And yet that form was used to get him the license
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:21.300]  that he needed to work for the private security firm, the largest in the world G4S. Then it was
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.540]  used to get his statewide firearms license when he was being investigated by the FBI all these
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:30.820]  different times. And they kept shutting this down. One of the times the FBI Director Comey says,
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:35.940]  well, you know, he was also holding this license from this large private security firm. So all
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:41.140]  of this stuff is built on this house of cards. And yet these people tell us that they're going to
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:46.260]  vet everyone for firearms, even though we see the disaster that they did here. Even if you believe
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:51.860]  their official story, it's starting to unravel around the around the edges as far as this phony
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:55.060]  background check. And of course, a watch list is nothing but a background check. But they don't
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.940]  even want to do background checks on the people that they're bringing into this country. So the
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:03.300]  whole thing is based on a lie. It's based on smoke and mirrors, isn't it? The conclusions that they
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:14.980]  offer us? Well, my point is, how is it? We can't find out. Yeah. Yeah. So that's really what you
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:25.620]  puzzle people. It's how hard it is to get any kind of definite handle on it. I see from reports that
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:32.340]  the media flocked to the hospital, but only to interview one of the victims. This guy, Angel,
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:37.540]  whatever his name is. So you have all the press interviewing one victim. Where are the other
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:47.940]  victims? It's like saying you hook, we get photos and list of names. We don't see any body bags.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:53.700]  We don't see any ambulances, any emergency medical technicians. The whole thing,
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:38:04.180]  and what's so astonishing is that they feel confident to pull these things off over and over
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:12.740]  and over. And people seem to be okay that all they get are government statements. And they're
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:19.540]  repeated endlessly by the media. We don't ever get any investigation. Nobody ever shows any real
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:27.460]  evidence. They're always crisis actors on the scene. And what you see as a population that's
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:33.700]  just so gullible, there's no chance of protecting its liberty or its gun rights or anything else.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:41.300]  I said some time ago, I pointed out some time ago, David, that of all of the provisions in the
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:49.620]  Bill of Rights that make law a shield of the people, the only remaining one is the Second Amendment.
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:54.100]  That's right. The Second Amendment is inconsistent with the police state, which we now have.
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:39:00.660]  The Congress seems to be okay with the police state. The bulk of the population is okay with it.
[01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:10.100]  The legal community is okay with it. We continue to have the violation of habeas corpus due process,
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:16.500]  privacy, endless spying without warrants. All of these things are not only unconstitutional,
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:20.740]  they're illegal. I mean, you have statutory law, and yet nothing is done. There's been
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:28.500]  just the acceptance of a police state and aura to save us from terrorism that we really don't even
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:36.900]  know if it exists or not. I mean, what all the terrorist events seem to be FBI stings,
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:43.300]  you know, the FBI admits. Oh, the public was never in danger. We called them before they could do
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:52.100]  anything, but we all also get the story that the FBI organized them in this fake terrorist attack,
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:57.060]  so they could be arrested. And we find out the real reason the FBI does this is that Congress
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:04.820]  gave a supplemental appropriation, a several billion dollars a year for the FBI to be proactive
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:12.660]  and prevent attacks. And so there are no real attacks. They have to go out and organize them
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:17.140]  so they collect this several billion dollars. It's kind of like the watch list. We were talking
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:21.460]  about this on Friday and Rob Do came in with a list of all these people. Listen to all the people.
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:25.860]  We had a four-year-old, a five-year-old, a six-year-old, an eight-year-old, an 18-month-old
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:30.420]  toddler. All these people were on the no fly list. They were told they could not fly. So we're
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:35.620]  getting false positives. You had Ted Kennedy, who was on the no fly list as he was a senator.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:41.780]  You got all of these different things happening. And yet we're told that that needs to now be
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:47.700]  a checklist to take away people's rights. And even the FBI director said from a pragmatic
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:53.620]  standpoint, he told the Attorney General Loretta Lynch, he said, you're going, if we really are
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:58.340]  investigating these people, you're going to alert them to the fact that they're being investigated
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:03.060]  by saying, no, you can't buy a gun. So he says, even from a pragmatic standpoint, it doesn't wash,
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:07.620]  but it doesn't wash from a constitutional issue. David, there's nobody to investigate.
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:15.780]  Right. My name is a hoax. And the FBI knows it. Right. But we're just trying to reach out to the
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:21.460]  people who have one foot in the official story and one foot in reality. We had Dr. Roberts,
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:26.180]  we had Gretchen Carlson. I don't know if you saw this or not, on Fox News. And she comes out in
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:30.580]  favor of an assault weapon ban when she was questioned and people came after her on Twitter.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:35.220]  She made the amazing statement that they, well, first of all, the thing everybody says, well,
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:38.420]  it doesn't have anything to do with hunting weapons. But she said, the Second Amendment was
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:42.180]  written when we didn't even have firearms. It was written before firearms were invented.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.380]  You stupid people, I don't even know how to deal with you. You're so ignorant.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:49.540]  Yeah. Well, why did they say the right to bear arms?
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:55.540]  Yeah. I guess that was slingshots or crossbows or something in her mind. I don't know what
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:42:01.860]  she thought that was. Well, whatever she says, it's really not what's important.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:08.340]  What's important is the lack of skepticism on the part of the public of official statements.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:15.060]  And this enables the government to pull off the most transparent kinds of operations.
[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:20.820]  It enables the media never to investigate. I mean, why didn't the media go to the more
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:28.740]  or to the hospital? If we've got 103 casualties, they've got to be ambulances all over the place.
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:35.940]  Why don't they show them? Where are the emergency medical teams? Where nothing is ever shown,
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:40.500]  and the media never wonders or asks or says. Well, that's one thing we do need,
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:44.740]  and that is more skepticism. We need to say, show me the money, show me the evidence. We need to
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:48.420]  always question anything the government puts out there, especially when they're coming after
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:52.580]  individual liberty. Thank you so much for joining us. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, again, his website
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.620]  is paulcraigroberts.org. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:05.460]  Everyone, Obama and Trump, as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists, are saying the Orlando
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:10.500]  shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:15.540]  Democrats in Congress just ended a 15 hour filibuster. Republicans have caved and said they
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:20.580]  will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist. Remember,
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:26.420]  this is secretly and without trial. People are put on terror watch lists and no fly watch lists
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:31.300]  without their knowledge, without being told of the charges against them, without being able to
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:37.380]  confront their accusers in an open trial by jury. Now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:42.260]  against them. This is a star chamber process that the Bill of Rights was written to stop.
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:47.540]  Terror attacks are not a gun control issue. They're a border control issue. Without background
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:52.100]  checks for migrants, terrorists are free to use nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:44:13.100]  A rifle may be your only defense against that kind of weapon.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:27.060]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:33.140]  how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:38.740]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:43.860]  the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:48.100]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:54.340]  to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com,

[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:37.220]  Want to talk about what's going on with this, what I believe is a clear false flag
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:42.740]  and the Brexit vote, and what they're really trying to put out here as they're being labeled
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:49.220]  as racist and far-right extremists. They are not, and I'm going to tell you why in just a moment
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:53.700]  before we get to that. I want to tell you about our specials. We have the Alexa Pure water filters,

[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:19.380]  days away and there will be more memorial services tomorrow for the young mother and wife who was
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:25.780]  murdered last week, one week exactly before the Brexit vote. And as I pointed out earlier in the
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:30.260]  show, if you look at all the things that are involved, I mean, we're going to have David
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:34.100]  Cameron is going, his government will fall. He will lose his position as prime minister.
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:40.260]  The Germans, the politicians as well as the multinational corporations are not happy
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:47.940]  about Britain leaving. They want that counterbalance to their power, a perceived counterbalance to
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:53.300]  their power. And as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was talking about, the real thing that we
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:58.180]  shall be concerned about is what's going on with NATO as we see NATO pushing its way into
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:03.860]  the Ukraine and the Crimea, trying to create a conflict and then coming out this last week,
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:08.420]  talking about how a proven cyber security threat will have to take their word for it,
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:12.820]  just like we do all of these attacks. We'll have to take their word for it. There won't be any
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:18.340]  bodies. There won't be anything that we can see. They'll just tell us what we need to know for this.
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:25.300]  And then they will start World War III with Russia. It was the fear campaign that the people who
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:28.740]  want to remain in the European Union were pushing. They were saying, hey, there's going to be a war
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:31.620]  in Europe if you leave. There's going to be an economic collapse. There's going to be rising
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:38.340]  mortgages. I'm sure they will play with it. They had the LIBOR scandal, the London Interbank rate
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:41.300]  where they were rigging that. That's what all your variable rate mortgages are based on.
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:46.260]  Every year, when your mortgage comes up for reevaluation, it's that LIBOR rate. These people
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.620]  were playing games with that to make money hand over fist. They got caught doing it. They didn't
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:55.060]  go to jail. Got a long list of bankers who quote, unquote, committed suicide. We showed you at least
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:51:00.180]  three of those. Talked about that last week, one in great detail, how he was pushed out of a window,
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:06.500]  looks like. They found him on his back of the street. He was there for 20 minutes before he
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:10.420]  died. A couple of guys walked out of the building where he had fallen for three stories. And they
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.740]  say, hey, if you're jumping, you're not going to land on your back really. You're going to land on
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:18.580]  your front. He landed on his back. They had surveillance cameras, interestingly enough.
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:22.500]  And that's the new evidence that came out. They said he was beaten on the face,
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:26.420]  the front of his head. And these two guys in suits walk out shortly after he falls.
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:30.100]  They walk over. They say a couple of things to him. And then they calmly walk off. They don't
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:36.740]  call for help. A suicide note written to his wife where he writes her name in a way that he'd never
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:41.140]  written her name, never called her Tony. All these things happened as his bank was involved in a
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:45.540]  massive scandal. He was the scapegoat for this. So you don't think these people will kill somebody
[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:50.980]  for trillions of dollars? They've killed for a lot less than that. A lot less than that. And so
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:54.260]  when we look at all this, when we look at how they're playing this, just look at this corporation
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:59.700]  here. Look at Uber. We've had this fight here in Austin about background checks. They couldn't come
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.380]  to an agreement. So the city of Austin said, hey, we do background checks on taxis. We're going to
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:08.020]  do them on Uber as well because we've had some people here as well as other cities where you've
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:14.100]  got a taxi driver that works for Uber. Let's call them an Uber driver, not a taxi driver. Same thing.
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:18.980]  You get into their car. These people are criminals and they're not doing proper background checks on
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:22.020]  them. And we can't see those background checks. We've had a lot of situations where women have
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:26.660]  been raped or physically assaulted. We want to have background checks. They put background checks
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:31.460]  on us. We leave. So they shut down all of the Uber transportation here in Austin. And now Uber
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:36.580]  is coming out and saying, you know what? If you do background checks, it's racist. It's racist.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:40.500]  You're racist against Hispanics and blacks if you do background checks because, you know,
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:47.060]  it's racist if you have to produce photo ID to vote. Anytime they don't want you to do something,
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:51.540]  they always play the race card, don't they? Always play the race card. Very interesting.
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:57.380]  Even though the taxi industry has to do that, no background checks for Uber, okay? You can ban
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.780]  guns and say we've got to have a background check. But no background checks for the people coming in
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:08.260]  over the borders. Only when it's something that they want will they push for these types of checks.
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:11.460]  But if it's something they don't want, they'll say, yeah, we don't need that. All right. So let's
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:16.020]  talk about what's going on with Brexit. And again, I talked about this a couple of weeks ago. There
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:20.340]  was eight points that were out by Boris Johnson, who is trying to encourage people to leave the
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:24.100]  European Union so they can be free, so they can have their sovereignty against, so they can be
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:31.060]  more prosperous. Because the European Union is a nanny state parasite at the very least, okay?
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.860]  And of course, as Dr. Roberts pointed out, he didn't talk about the issue of NATO trying to
[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:40.020]  create a war, but we'll talk about some of the economic issues. And let me ask you this. Does
[01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:44.980]  this sound like far right extremism, or is this just level headed common sense? Here's some of
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:50.340]  his reasons. 350 million pounds per week more to spend as Britswish with their priorities. Another
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:54.100]  way to spend it on your welfare state or your national health care, whatever. Remember, we're
[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:59.060]  talking about pounds, 350 million pounds, multiply that by about one and a half for dollars. That's
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:04.580]  about half a billion dollars a week that they would have that they're currently sending to the
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:08.020]  European Union. You can take back control of your borders. You could stop the huge pressure of
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:12.820]  immigration on public services. He said, number three, we'd be taking back control of our democracy.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:18.100]  We'd be able to set our own laws and not be prisoner to the 2,500 EU regulations coming
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:23.620]  out every year from Brussels that cost us 600 million pounds per year to comply. Number four,
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:28.020]  we'd be able to do free trade deals with the rest of the world, even with America, he said.
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:32.500]  Number five, we'd be able to get from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.620]  You know, kind of like our Supreme Court is imposing all kinds of things on us that are not
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:42.020]  legal. He says it's increasingly arbitrating in questions over which we never thought it would
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:46.100]  have any power. Sounds like our Supreme Court, doesn't it? Like human rights, like asylum,
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:49.940]  like the right of the child. Number six, he said, if we stay in the European Union,
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:54.340]  they will continue to drag ever further towards a federal structure in which the UK should frankly
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:59.380]  have no part in supporting something called the Euro. Okay. Number seven, all the countries that
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:04.100]  have done really well in the OEC in the last few years have been outside of the single market. And
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:08.740]  there he is. This is what I'm summarizing this quickly from. And finally, number eight, he says,
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:12.980]  fundamentally, we'd be believing in Britain again. We'll be able to take back control and do things
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:16.660]  our way. And I think it'd be a galvanizing thing for British democracy, for our economy to take
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:22.740]  back control June 23rd and vote leave. Now, they were ahead 19 points before the shooting.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:28.660]  In the aftermath of that shooting, we have seen the people who are rational. There's no
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:32.580]  arguments in here that are racist. There's nothing here that is hateful. It's all about
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:36.340]  economics. It's all about individual freedom. It's about having control of their country and
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:40.420]  their destiny. Those are not things anybody should be ashamed of, but they've been shamed
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:45.220]  and portrayed as hateful people. Look at this headline from zero head,
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:50.260]  jerks, message, those who oppose EU membership are violent. That's what they've been doing since
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:53.860]  then. So since this happened, everybody said, well, we're going to just stop talking about
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:59.220]  leave and we're going to stop talking about remain those two issues because somebody said
[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:04.580]  that he said Britain first as he killed her. And there were people on site who disputed that.
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:10.260]  But because of that, the people who want to remain in the European Union have been holding
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:15.460]  her up in memorial and talking about the hatred that killed her for several days now.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:20.500]  And the other people have been put into silence, have been totally silenced. And we see that
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:24.820]  happen in the United States as well. That's something for us to remember. Don't ever let them
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:32.900]  falsely accuse you and put you into silence. And now we've seen they leave dropped by 22
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:36.820]  points. Now, one of the things Dr. Roberts was talking about that looks very much like a false
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:40.580]  flag. Whenever we see these false flags and immediately they find the guy, immediately
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:45.380]  they have the motive. Immediately they know everything about this guy. You should question
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:49.860]  that. You should say that looks suspicious. And that's precisely what happened in this case.
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:54.100]  And where did that information come from? You know, it's the United States who created the
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:59.140]  European Union along with some elitist in Europe. They want to keep NATO together. They want to
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:02.820]  keep the European Union together. And it was from the United States that we learned all this
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:08.340]  information about how he was a white supremacist from no one other than the Southern Poverty Law
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:14.660]  Center. These people who are always out there pushing this narrative of racism and hate.
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:22.100]  And so immediately, immediately as this happened, we have the actual documents going back to 1999
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:27.780]  from this little tiny organization that doesn't even have any subscription membership or anything.
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:33.620]  And since 2013, the guy that's there now, special forces operator, he says, hey, this is such a
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:37.940]  mess. We had no money. I couldn't find any records. But boy, I didn't have any problem finding this
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:43.780]  record from this guy. And yet everybody who knew him said he was a gentle soul. He never
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:59.780]  attacked anybody. His brother, who was half black, said he was incredibly gentle. Join us tomorrow.
