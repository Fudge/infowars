[00:00.000 --> 00:10.080]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:10.080 --> 00:13.080]  the Infowar.
[00:13.080 --> 00:25.520]  Alright, it's Thursday, January 10, 2019 and I was going to have a work day here on a bunch
[00:25.520 --> 00:31.440]  of projects that are behind schedule because of me not making time to get them done and
[00:31.440 --> 00:38.960]  Owen Troyer who hosts the Warrom every day at 3 o'clock Central, I was going to be hosting.
[00:38.960 --> 00:45.680]  But I'm just going to be here in the first two segments today and you got to forgive
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.180]  me too.
[00:48.180 --> 00:52.320]  When I start really using my noggin, I start sweating.
[00:52.320 --> 00:58.240]  I can sit out in the sun if I'm not thinking and it can be 105 degrees and I barely sweat.
[00:58.240 --> 01:05.440]  When I really start trying to look at all the information I seriously start sweating which
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.600]  is a normal reaction if your child say is going to have surgery or if you're being pushed
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.320]  the edge of a cliff and a lot of people try to stay away from facing things and that's
[01:16.320 --> 01:20.480]  one reason we live in this very, very dangerous society and culture with a bunch of delusional
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.960]  devil worshipers running around thinking they're God.
[01:23.960 --> 01:29.920]  But as everybody can notice, I'm not obsessed with being right every time but I don't want
[01:29.920 --> 01:31.120]  to be right about this stuff.
[01:31.120 --> 01:36.360]  The word is Trump was going to declare an emergency two days ago, evident shows were
[01:36.360 --> 01:43.480]  already in one but he didn't do it and now I see in hindsight he wanted to look measured
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.880]  and nice and have them overreact thinking the emergency was coming saying don't air
[01:47.880 --> 01:55.040]  it and acting all crazy so Trump again at least when it comes to things like that has
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.920]  a very good instinct but now you hear he's saying you don't do the deal and you don't
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.720]  build a wall and then they attack the idea of a wall, it's like they attack the idea
[02:05.720 --> 02:08.920]  of a border at all.
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.720]  You notice now that Trump is saying that he's set to declare an emergency and I don't think
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.600]  he's made the decision when to officially do it, that's why it's really hard to tell
[02:18.600 --> 02:26.440]  but I really think at the border today he's going to introduce the idea and really sell
[02:26.440 --> 02:32.360]  it to the public and he'll either declare it today or he will declare it I'd say next
[02:32.360 --> 02:35.520]  Monday, next Tuesday, next Wednesday, maybe even as early as Friday, Owen.
[02:35.520 --> 02:36.520]  What do you think?
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.040]  I think it's going to be a little more of an extended timetable.
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.720]  I expect it maybe to come in two weeks but I do think it's inevitable that there will
[02:43.720 --> 02:45.120]  be a national emergency declared.
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.200]  I think Trump has already decided that and I think he's just kind of measuring the waters
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.920]  and waiting for the right time to go ahead and go full throttle with it and the Democrats,
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.960]  you know the amazing thing Alex is to us we see the Democrats destroying themselves and
[03:00.960 --> 03:08.080]  they are but they have their ace in the hole and an entire game plan behind the socialist
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.120]  Sandy Cortez which is really kind of their safety net here.
[03:12.120 --> 03:17.520]  It shows their timetable is to make it a racial socialist Hispanic party but then bullies
[03:17.520 --> 03:21.400]  all the other Hispanics go along with it and then they'll have that key demographic locked
[03:21.400 --> 03:25.720]  in vote and take us the way of Venezuela which is the admitted globalist plan in the
[03:25.720 --> 03:27.560]  next 10 to 20 years.
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.560]  She's the prototype of the future total puppet being loaded information by the globalist
[03:32.560 --> 03:36.840]  that's set off shore and I agree with you and let's explain people go well the Democrats
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.720]  are losers they're inverting reality they're horrible demon people they want to sexualize
[03:40.720 --> 03:46.280]  our children yes they're a weapon system they're a demoralization bomb they're the reason
[03:46.280 --> 03:51.920]  they're a bunch of scum and physically look so ugly and hunchback to demonic is because
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.480]  this is the scum of the earth whether they be black whether they be white whatever group
[03:56.480 --> 04:01.400]  they are these are literal wicked witch demons and they know it and they don't like being
[04:01.400 --> 04:06.360]  called out for it these people are devil worshipers and when you get to the bottom of the barrel
[04:06.360 --> 04:10.520]  in Hollywood that's what they are they're devil worshipers and that's what these power
[04:10.520 --> 04:15.520]  seekers are devil worshipers and they're all about themselves and they're all about this
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.800]  me me me selfishness that's destroying civilization society these people are cancer.
[04:20.800 --> 04:24.960]  Alex it's funny you said that we didn't discuss this before the show but that was my big thing
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.760]  today is how the left is cancer to America and if it's not cut out and ended America
[04:30.760 --> 04:36.400]  will be dead and it's it I'm really in a bad mood today I guess you could say because I've
[04:36.400 --> 04:42.080]  realized it more than ever Trump has to do everything or this country is dead well that's
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.920]  right we keep even ourselves being mad at him like dad's supposed to do it all and then
[04:45.920 --> 04:50.760]  we realize to be there too but yeah that's why I feel I feel physically ill right now
[04:50.760 --> 04:54.200]  because you can cut the tension they're so afraid of him declaring the emergency and
[04:54.200 --> 04:57.600]  really going after him and he's really thinking about doing it so that's why the tension is
[04:57.600 --> 05:04.000]  so high whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want

[06:20.120 --> 06:25.800]  that's the headline at drugsreport.com shut down doomsday scenario we're going to be going
[06:25.800 --> 06:30.840]  over all of that paul joseph watson to be joining us for a hour starting at the bottom
[06:30.840 --> 06:38.320]  of this hour and of course i wish royer is going to be hosting the broadcast today because
[06:38.320 --> 06:46.920]  i have the conference room packed with crew on getting a bunch of key initiatives and
[06:46.920 --> 06:52.480]  things were launching done so that is why i am here in the office today but not on air
[06:52.480 --> 07:00.200]  and it is a momentous day trump is going down to the border i know that he's already declared
[07:00.200 --> 07:05.880]  an emergency to the military a few months ago and that he's shut at least in his thinking
[07:05.880 --> 07:09.840]  to declare an emergency he's having to remove people that says he doesn't have the power
[07:09.840 --> 07:16.560]  to do that when he 100% under just a constitution for a border and for an invasion it's his
[07:16.560 --> 07:21.040]  right and his duty i mean this is not like some special wonderful thing he's doing it's
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.920]  just in a sea of traitors and globalists they try to upside down world and have us live
[07:26.920 --> 07:33.240]  in that fantasy land but the headlines up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[07:33.240 --> 07:37.000]  are truly tomorrow's news today this is where you've heard in the last year and a half about
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.200]  we need an emergency obama put an emergency in place uh relevant saying two years ago
[07:42.200 --> 07:47.160]  uh he was president elect we've been saying that uh zero hedge has been saying that and
[07:47.160 --> 07:53.200]  that's it zero has been putting up the legislation the documents uh the laws uh we've been doing
[07:53.200 --> 07:58.280]  that as well i feel good knowing zero hedge is there uh no affiliation with zero hedge
[07:58.280 --> 08:03.480]  but that's that's there's some leftist leaning stuff in there i don't care about that but
[08:03.480 --> 08:09.360]  they talk about how the government works the c o g the university is on top of c i a uh
[08:09.360 --> 08:13.440]  how the whole program works how operation mockingbird has been carried out in a modern
[08:13.440 --> 08:17.840]  operation so we're gonna obsess over the fact that we're tomorrow's news today next year's
[08:17.840 --> 08:23.000]  news today is because the globalists are fighting around the clock to try to get us off the
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.520]  year because what we're saying is the blueprint and how it works and you know it's it's it's
[08:30.520 --> 08:36.880]  it's further along in some aspects of that i thought and uh just coming to grips with
[08:36.880 --> 08:42.120]  the true pure evil just wanting to destroy life and kill children and hurt innocent
[08:42.120 --> 08:47.440]  people uh and just rip innocence into pieces just coming up against that spirit and having
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.440]  that realization of that fallen thing that we're up against just uh makes me get on my
[08:52.440 --> 08:57.400]  knees to god and ask for a great awakening and a new renaissance on this planet and this
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.680]  is what we need so i was going to take over in the next segment uh it's up on drudgereport.com
[09:02.680 --> 09:11.000]  trump heads of the border uh emergency declaration test republicans texas landowners prepare
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.840]  wall fight things dims have funded that cost more drudges a lot of key articles up there
[09:16.840 --> 09:23.000]  that break all that down uh and then of course uh we also um have armstrong williams which
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.680]  is true spiritual illness crippling america this is a curse and that's exactly what it
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.360]  is you have the patriarch of the uh orthodox church uh coming out saying the cell phones
[09:34.360 --> 09:39.920]  are the devices that mesmerize you and tie you into the antichrist computer brain and
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.320]  that's what it is and so you hear elon must saying it the patriarch of the orthodox church
[09:44.320 --> 09:51.320]  saying it armstrong williams saying it that's what this is this is a curse and real evils
[09:51.320 --> 09:54.640]  being poured out in the world today and and i made some phone calls for us even on air
[09:54.640 --> 10:00.760]  today to some a few people just to let them know that um you know some of the evil people
[10:00.760 --> 10:08.080]  that they've been exposing they don't know how evil they are uh and it's it's it's it's
[10:08.080 --> 10:16.880]  painful to know all this but it's more painful if we deny it uh it's more painful if we do
[10:16.880 --> 10:22.160]  not resist it and it's it and the children don't know and so they're being snared at
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.520]  a very young age that's what these monsters do uh they target them when they can't fight
[10:26.520 --> 10:40.120]  it back and so i want to say this before i get into trump of the emergency everything
[10:40.120 --> 10:47.760]  that they do is about covertness and incrementalism everything it's the same blueprint and then
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.760]  they even admit it it's not even our opinion the hydrofluorosalicylic acid the weaponized
[10:52.760 --> 11:02.080]  electrified acid based fluoride the gmo the electromagnetic manipulation they admit gives
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.560]  you cancer and tell you the newspaper is going to kill you is going to scramble your
[11:05.560 --> 11:13.720]  dna and mutate you this is all a giant desecration of god's planet and of our genetics and our
[11:13.720 --> 11:21.880]  family lines our seed our genetics is literally being mutated into an ugly demonic form because
[11:21.880 --> 11:27.440]  that's what satan seeks to do to god's creation and so people have to understand everything
[11:27.440 --> 11:33.520]  is a soft kill covert up all these people that pose like self-help and you know all
[11:33.520 --> 11:39.400]  the modern timothy leary types uh who are out there know full well what they're doing
[11:39.400 --> 11:47.240]  and the the the vaccine pushing and the gmo and the cultural attack and the american psychological
[11:47.240 --> 11:55.720]  association saying men existing is bad and is a disease no they are the disease aliens
[11:55.720 --> 11:59.680]  if they showed up and that collaborators would would be making announcements your families
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.520]  are bad your men are bad get rid of your boys put them in dresses give them chemicals i
[12:04.520 --> 12:10.640]  mean this is a science fiction movie for real folks the devil is it is a damn alien okay
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.000]  the bible tells you the whole thing it's going on it's in it from another dimension you can't
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.240]  see it but it's all there all around us and it wants to kill you and your family period
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.680]  and this evil force in the universe is telling all these people like william shatner and joe
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.560]  rogan and all these other people join us and you will get eternal life you will get advanced
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.400]  technology you'll be uploaded uh you we're going to go through this great cleansing of
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.000]  the earth and then you're going to be on the other side of it they all know it and then
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  they pose like little kind of happy trendy people i use those as an example to make everybody
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.520]  not understand that they're predators and they know exactly what they're doing luring
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.280]  people into the drug culture luring people into the so-called new age luring people
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.360]  into this whole thing and it's all meant to get you like i'm walking out in front of
[12:59.360 --> 13:04.000]  a mac truck you don't see and you never know what hit you and so and of course these people
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.320]  are all slaves too i'm not even singling i'm out and say they're bad it's just that i realized
[13:09.320 --> 13:14.280]  people i've known a long time because i'm such a loyal person because i know them i decide
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.120]  to be blind and be delusional even though there's evil sitting right there and so it's
[13:19.120 --> 13:25.680]  good uh to see people pick sides it it's to be banned and attacked and persecuted and
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.560]  betrayed by these people is good because we're forcing their hand to come out in the open
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.280]  and show us who they are we're forcing these rats these roaches to come out from underneath
[13:35.280 --> 13:41.240]  their rocks and face us and that's what they can't stand to come out facebook is a total
[13:41.240 --> 13:47.520]  brainwashing cult their own employed literal it's all mk ultra stuff the universities
[13:47.520 --> 13:54.080]  the psychology departments are their own cults they're all pushing psychotropics and ayahuasca
[13:54.080 --> 14:00.280]  and dmt and then all these new synthetic super drugs coming out are being tested inside
[14:00.280 --> 14:06.280]  the universities everywhere mk ultra is on your television mk ultra is on your smart

[14:14.440 --> 14:24.520]  is a cult you understand and so they want to put you into the sensory deprivation tank
[14:24.520 --> 14:30.040]  of the internet and they don't want us jacking into it coming in and saying look we're not
[14:30.040 --> 14:35.120]  offering you some wonderland of the matrix but it's what'll make you strong and it's
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.720]  the real place and and i i genuinely care about you we're in this together i've had
[14:40.720 --> 14:45.720]  four children the globalists don't have children because they're selfish on average because
[14:45.720 --> 14:49.080]  they don't want to bet on the future they don't want to carry out that biological function
[14:49.080 --> 14:54.560]  that takes them closer to god and they've all signed on to death they're not going to
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.720]  get eternal life they're going to eternal death because they are death they are destruction
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.920]  they are slavery our country is under total attack europe is under total attack but the
[15:05.920 --> 15:14.360]  good news is italy's president and vice president prime minister have come out and said there
[15:14.360 --> 15:20.320]  is an axis of evil in germany and france allied against the rest of europe and the world it
[15:20.320 --> 15:25.800]  was set up by the nazis it's it's world war two part two two plus two was four world war
[15:25.800 --> 15:31.800]  four they're taking over with economic warfare and anti-culture warfare and anti-family warfare
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.560]  and now it's spreading and they're saying we must create an axis worldwide to defeat
[15:35.560 --> 15:40.320]  this new system so now all these presidents are sounding just like info wars not because
[15:40.320 --> 15:44.640]  they're even less than of course they are is because it's true so our chain reaction
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.480]  is now launching the resistance is now going into its main phase the enemy can feel it
[15:49.480 --> 15:54.400]  and it's going to put their full weight against us right now pray for trump and ask god and

[20:21.160 --> 20:28.040]  alex jones show that's right i'm filling in for alex today paul joseph watson is going
[20:28.040 --> 20:32.420]  to be joining us simon roche is going to be joining us stewart roads is going to be joining
[20:32.420 --> 20:43.840]  us dug hagman in the fourth hour tons of news to get to and i was going to come on
[20:43.840 --> 20:49.560]  today and the focus was going to be how the left is a cancer to america that will kill
[20:49.560 --> 20:57.840]  us unless we cut it out and i was going to talk about how i've fully identified the blueprint
[20:57.840 --> 21:04.920]  and the schematic that is behind alexandra ocasio cortez real name sandy or at least
[21:04.920 --> 21:08.120]  that's what they called her before she ran for office but that's too white so they went
[21:08.120 --> 21:17.680]  back to alexandria and then alex went next level in the last segment and i was actually
[21:17.680 --> 21:24.640]  going to do that in the war room today and maybe i still will and i've got a guest coming
[21:24.640 --> 21:29.160]  on the war room tomorrow that can break this down but this is actually something quite
[21:29.160 --> 21:37.600]  ancient and you can even read about this in the bible like alex was talking about and
[21:37.600 --> 21:44.440]  i don't even know you know i'm 29 years old i have not experienced everything there is
[21:44.440 --> 21:48.320]  to experience on this earth but i've experienced a lot for a 29 year old but i'm definitely
[21:48.320 --> 22:00.800]  not the leading expert on this but we are in a multi dimensional existence anybody
[22:00.800 --> 22:10.720]  who's seen it and experienced it knows it's true this is in the bible and famous philosophers
[22:10.720 --> 22:19.080]  and other people have talked about this most recently alan watt is one but in the bible
[22:19.080 --> 22:30.720]  talks about people having visions seeing things from higher dimensions and people that are
[22:30.720 --> 22:37.320]  experts in these fields talk about how you can skip it's like a cheat code like let's
[22:37.320 --> 22:46.880]  use the video game analogy of mario where you can skip entire levels and go into a warp
[22:46.880 --> 22:56.760]  zone and so the experts say that's what you do when you take the dmt or you do the ayahuasca
[22:56.760 --> 23:03.000]  and the shamans of this will warn you this is not something for recreation this is not
[23:03.000 --> 23:09.800]  something you do for fun this is a serious experience that you're about to have it's
[23:09.800 --> 23:13.960]  going to change your very existence it's going to change everything that you perceive it's
[23:13.960 --> 23:22.360]  going to change the way that you see things and so they warn all of this to you before
[23:22.360 --> 23:27.440]  you do it but there's this new cult and it's it's it you know and now they say it you know
[23:27.440 --> 23:31.800]  they have the whole micro dosing thing that's really just a distraction for all the designer
[23:31.800 --> 23:37.880]  drugs that the elites in silicon valley are on which who knows if we'll ever even know
[23:37.880 --> 23:43.160]  what that crap is i mean why do tim cooks eyes look like dinner plates and he's all fired
[23:43.160 --> 23:50.520]  up doing an interview uh with glasses from vice but it's funny because there was a story
[23:50.520 --> 23:57.240]  today i believe it was on drudge about a poker player who bet a hundred thousand dollars
[23:57.240 --> 24:04.800]  he could sit in sensory deprivation for 30 days and by week two he started hallucinating
[24:04.800 --> 24:23.080]  and seeing things devil worshiping cults have been in america for hundreds of years in fact
[24:23.080 --> 24:30.640]  it even was existent in native american culture this is all historical it came out of the
[24:30.640 --> 24:37.680]  illuminati of germany and so these were like people that were seeking lower dimensions
[24:37.680 --> 24:44.000]  people that were seeking power from lower dimensions because it's lower dimensions that actually
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.240]  will wield power or attempt to wield power here in the third dimension angels and spirits
[24:49.240 --> 24:54.320]  and saints and everything from higher dimensions and of course god doesn't really wield that
[24:54.320 --> 25:01.160]  power god has just he just created everything he has he's already decided everything but
[25:01.160 --> 25:13.000]  you can go back this is all ancient and so they have these group hallucination experiences
[25:13.000 --> 25:23.720]  where they take ancient rituals and they summon lucifer from the second dimension now i know
[25:23.720 --> 25:28.640]  this sounds crazy and to people who haven't looked into this or experienced it for themselves
[25:28.640 --> 25:38.640]  you just you you probably can't even comprehend what i'm talking about it literally happens
[25:38.640 --> 25:44.400]  and they summon lucifer and they communicate with lucifer and they take orders from lucifer
[25:44.400 --> 25:52.200]  and it's such a powerful thing and it's so real to them in that time you cannot help
[25:52.200 --> 26:06.000]  but fall to its just extraordinary existence and so this is what all these these occults
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.640]  and and cults and secret societies if you date back i mean hundreds of years this is
[26:10.640 --> 26:22.360]  all documented folks but see that's the cheat code that's how evil attempts to manifest
[26:22.360 --> 26:33.720]  itself in our divine ability to reach into the upper and lower dimensions while not actually
[26:33.720 --> 26:42.640]  existing in them now if you go back and you and you read the bible you can go to revelations
[26:42.640 --> 26:45.880]  you go to in fact there's a bunch of different chapters in the bible to talk about people
[26:45.880 --> 26:52.400]  having hallucinations in the desert and this seeing angels and all of spirits and everything
[26:52.400 --> 27:00.800]  you actually have the ability and this in modern day practice i guess you would point
[27:00.800 --> 27:06.960]  to you know Buddhist and Taoists and people that do long term meditation to reach higher
[27:06.960 --> 27:14.400]  spirituality to reach higher consciousness and to to see higher dimensions and you can
[27:14.400 --> 27:29.600]  do this your body naturally produces DMT so when these cults take DMT in a ritualistic
[27:29.600 --> 27:38.720]  way to summon and see lucifer that's like cheating it's like using steroids to enhance
[27:38.720 --> 27:47.320]  your spirituality it's like using steroids to enhance your consciousness you can actually
[27:47.320 --> 27:54.000]  see different dimensions without without having a drug induced experience that's the hallucinations
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.880]  that you experience when you're in sensory deprivation tanks that's what you read about
[27:58.880 --> 28:04.040]  in the bible when these people have visions of the horses and everything in revelations
[28:04.040 --> 28:11.320]  and everything in between and this is all ancient this is all ancient in fact this is
[28:11.320 --> 28:18.280]  this is in the even founding of america folks i mean if you really want to get into it just
[28:18.280 --> 28:29.240]  look at washington dc look at the washington obelisk look at ancient text with isis and
[28:29.240 --> 28:33.080]  look at the pentagram and look at all of it and you will find out what is really behind
[28:33.080 --> 28:42.240]  all of it ancient cult secret societies that have been channeling lower dimensions and
[28:42.240 --> 28:47.680]  channeling lucifer for power over the third dimension and they have to make deals with
[28:47.680 --> 28:52.600]  lucifer for this to happen and now you understand why we're living in the modern day sadham
[28:52.600 --> 28:57.200]  and gamora and why it's a national emergency to cleanse ourselves spiritually before the
[28:57.200 --> 29:03.560]  devil kills us all the united states of empire is a book that claims the united states is

[32:16.640 --> 32:22.560]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source
[32:22.560 --> 32:27.040]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals
[32:27.040 --> 32:32.800]  of pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the establishment trying
[32:32.800 --> 32:38.640]  to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[32:39.440 --> 32:43.600]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other
[32:43.600 --> 32:50.080]  compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it supercharges it and makes it even more

[32:59.520 --> 33:11.520]  you're listening to the alex joneshow
[33:11.520 --> 33:27.280]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow
[33:27.280 --> 33:31.200]  and now your host paul joseph watson
[33:33.680 --> 33:40.000]  you're live on the alex joneshow on this thursday edition i'll be taking over for the next hour
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.840]  with probably one of the biggest stories of what should at least be one of the biggest stories of
[33:45.840 --> 33:54.480]  the year so far which has received no mainstream media attention whatsoever in fact i just checked
[33:54.480 --> 34:00.960]  it as of the past hour there's one rt article about this apart from that you'll only find it on
[34:00.960 --> 34:06.880]  info wars dot com and what is that story well just to give a bit of backstory because back
[34:06.880 --> 34:13.440]  in november you'll probably remember the confrontation between cnn anchor cnn reporter jim acosta
[34:13.440 --> 34:20.240]  and president trump during that press conference in the white house where again acosta tried to
[34:20.240 --> 34:25.760]  make himself the center of attention by staying on the mic by asking question after question and
[34:25.760 --> 34:31.040]  making statement after statement after statement being an activist not a journalist of course
[34:31.040 --> 34:35.760]  there was a massive controversy over that because when the white house staffer tried to grab the
[34:35.760 --> 34:43.680]  microphone from acosta he accosted her by shoving her arm down and shoving her away everybody saw
[34:43.680 --> 34:49.440]  that on the video that was becoming a bit of a problem for the mainstream media so they crafted
[34:49.440 --> 34:56.800]  this giant narrative around how info wars and yours truly adopted the video of jim acosta's
[34:56.800 --> 35:03.520]  confrontation with that female white house staffer to make it look worse than it was they couldn't
[35:03.520 --> 35:08.400]  really decide whether i'd sped up the video or slowed it down couldn't really make their minds
[35:08.400 --> 35:13.840]  up they said both uh jimmy kimmel and a bunch of late night comedy hosts got up there the next
[35:13.840 --> 35:20.480]  night and said that oh he's removed the audio no i didn't remove the audio there was no audio
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.400]  because it was a gif image gif images do not have audio so there was this media narrative
[35:26.400 --> 35:32.720]  for about three days if not more it probably went on for most of the week actually now that
[35:32.720 --> 35:39.760]  i recall that we had deliberately doctored the video of this confrontation to deceive the american
[35:39.760 --> 35:45.360]  people and then the white house had then tweeted out that video for the same purpose to deceive
[35:45.360 --> 35:50.000]  the american people because if you look at the definition of doctored as it relates to video
[35:50.000 --> 35:57.200]  footage it means you deliberately have to change and amend that footage with the intention of deceiving
[35:57.200 --> 36:04.640]  the viewer so it can't be accidental it can't be incidental it has to be deliberate deliberately
[36:04.640 --> 36:10.640]  done in an attempt to deceive to mislead the viewer now of course as i've proven which you know after
[36:10.640 --> 36:16.720]  the fact i made two videos on this i did not deliberately doctor any footage i made that
[36:16.720 --> 36:23.200]  plane with evidence pointing out that yes it may have lost a couple of frames in the compression
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.600]  from a video to a gif file and then back to a video again but there was no deliberate
[36:27.600 --> 36:33.680]  doctoring of that footage they crafted that entire narrative to distract from acosta's
[36:33.680 --> 36:40.480]  bad behavior in accosting that woman so that was a media narrative for about four or five days that
[36:40.480 --> 36:47.840]  week in november they made such a massive deal out of it and then look what we have today and
[36:47.840 --> 36:55.680]  look how big of a deal has been made out of this we have a liberal staffer working for a
[36:55.680 --> 37:03.600]  seattle news station q13 fox caught red-handed doctoring footage of president trump as it was
[37:03.600 --> 37:11.600]  broadcast live to deliberately mislead the american people this news network and you see the footage
[37:11.600 --> 37:17.200]  here trump's talking he's doing his address to the nation on the border situation on tuesday night
[37:17.840 --> 37:24.640]  he finishes his sentence and then whoever's in control of this q13 fox station uses what looks
[37:24.640 --> 37:31.440]  like deep fake technology where they take two images of a person and synthesize them so again
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.840]  they've basically cut out his mouth and made it look as if president trump is sticking his tongue
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.600]  out and basically looking completely idiotic and not able to speak during a white alive white
[37:43.600 --> 37:50.320]  house address to the nation now this looks like deep fake technology which the mainstream media
[37:50.320 --> 37:56.960]  has been alarmist and hysterical about for well over a year claiming that russia that china the
[37:56.960 --> 38:03.280]  other bad actors that trump supporters themselves could use this technology to fake what public
[38:03.280 --> 38:09.600]  officials what politicians are saying to mislead the american public their main concern was around
[38:09.600 --> 38:17.040]  russia but now a left-wing anti-trump activist that's obviously who this is has done it in
[38:17.040 --> 38:23.280]  seattle during a live address to the nation and no no media at all in the united states
[38:23.280 --> 38:28.560]  is reporting on it there's one rt article i'll get to that after the info wars article
[38:28.560 --> 38:34.160]  which we put up this morning seattle news station called doctoring trump video to make president
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.680]  look stupid and it says the clip which was aired live on tuesday night shows trump finishing a
[38:39.680 --> 38:43.920]  sentence before appearing to stick out his tongue for an elongated amount of time the video then
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.520]  cuts to a generic station id screen again this is q13 fox in seattle the intent of the video is
[38:49.520 --> 38:54.400]  clearly to make president trump look ridiculous and you'll see that when you watch it and with
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.920]  the audio as well now there was a a blog called my northwest which first drew attention to this
[38:59.920 --> 39:05.440]  again no mainstream media coverage no corporate media coverage said that comparison reveals the
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.080]  q13 video creator the loop of the president licking his lips making it seem bizarre and
[39:10.080 --> 39:15.200]  unbalanced it also seems that someone distorted the president's face and may have added an orange
[39:15.200 --> 39:23.040]  tone to his skin so they've either used deep fake technology to insert a fake mouth that looks like
[39:23.040 --> 39:27.600]  trump sticking his tongue out for an elongated amount of time or they've just paused it and then
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.320]  done a loop because he does appear to stick his tongue out and then they've looped that and just
[39:32.320 --> 39:37.440]  replayed that section of the video where it's just his mouth to make sure that he looks dumb he
[39:37.440 --> 39:43.840]  looks ridiculous sticking his tongue out again for an elongated amount of time now q13 fox
[39:43.840 --> 39:48.800]  responded to the controversy by basically admitting it they released a statement saying
[39:48.800 --> 39:54.000]  the individual responsible for the stunt has been placed on leave pending an internal investigation
[39:54.720 --> 39:58.080]  their statement said quote we are investigating this to determine what happened
[39:58.640 --> 40:03.360]  this does not meet our editorial standards and we regret it as it's seen as portraying the
[40:03.360 --> 40:08.880]  president in a negative light so they admit it makes him look stupid the editor responsible for
[40:08.880 --> 40:15.040]  editing the footage is being placed on leave while we investigate further and again we saw this in
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.000]  france with the yellow vest protest which i'm going to talk about later in the hour where they had
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.520]  somebody carrying a an anti-president macron sign which basically meant uh macron uh f off that's
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.640]  what the sign meant in french and they removed the uh the cussing out of that sign so the sign
[40:32.640 --> 40:40.240]  just said macron so again you've got mainstream networks in france doctoring protest signs to
[40:40.240 --> 40:48.320]  protect their establishment and now after the mainstream media repeatedly made hysterical
[40:48.320 --> 40:54.960]  claims about russia using deep fake technology to mislead the american people an anti-trump leftist
[40:54.960 --> 41:03.440]  does it in seattle and its crickets they made a story about altering video in relation to president
[41:03.440 --> 41:10.480]  trump the top story or at least in the top three stories in america for nearly a week back in november
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.840]  they lied about me they lied about info wars claiming we doctored it that was a top story
[41:15.840 --> 41:23.440]  for about five days this happens nobody's even talking about it i expected them to at least
[41:23.440 --> 41:29.680]  have to mention this at this point i just searched on google news as of 20 minutes ago nothing there's
[41:29.680 --> 41:37.520]  one rt article and again this is despite back in september three lawmakers two democrats one
[41:37.520 --> 41:43.440]  republican sending a letter to the director of national intelligence warning a i deep fakes
[41:43.440 --> 41:50.800]  quote have the potential to disrupt every facet of our society so they're warning about it they're
[41:50.800 --> 41:54.720]  writing letters to the director of national intelligence basically saying this is a national
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.480]  security threat it they claim it happened with jim acosta even though it didn't they made it the
[42:00.480 --> 42:06.480]  top news story for about three or four days that was one of the biggest stories in the country that
[42:06.480 --> 42:15.280]  month this happens and then obviously an anti-trump liberal is behind it absolute lockdown on the story
[42:15.280 --> 42:21.760]  the only news outlet apart from info wars and the blog that initially drew attention to it is
[42:21.760 --> 42:27.840]  rt deep fakes in action seattle tv station accused of doctoring trump speech video i'm going to get
[42:27.840 --> 42:33.760]  into reading that story after the break and kind of summarize what this means and the sheer rampant
[42:33.760 --> 42:40.480]  hypocrisy behind it again making that a cost to controversy the top story for five days and completely
[42:40.480 --> 42:47.600]  ignoring this one this is an absolutely monumental story the fact it's got no press coverage is very
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.800]  telling indeed we'll get more into it on the other side of the alex john show live breaking news
[42:52.800 --> 43:02.000]  at info wars dot com don't go away we'll be back living in volcano may sound more dramatic than
[43:02.000 --> 43:07.760]  it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[43:07.760 --> 43:14.320]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[43:14.320 --> 43:20.880]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[43:20.880 --> 43:27.600]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[43:27.600 --> 43:33.760]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[43:33.760 --> 43:39.600]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[43:39.600 --> 43:46.400]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure
[43:46.400 --> 43:52.560]  raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[43:52.560 --> 44:00.000]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it stress is

[47:24.240 --> 47:34.560]  and now your host paul joseph watson i'm absolutely flabbergasted about the complete silence the
[47:34.560 --> 47:40.720]  complete media lockdown on this story and i've just looked on twitter i tweeted out this info
[47:40.720 --> 47:46.000]  wars story this morning about this news station doctoring live footage of president trump
[47:47.360 --> 47:52.320]  seven thousand likes nearly four thousand retweets two hundred thousand impressions on this one
[47:52.320 --> 48:00.560]  tweet alone and again the story is for over a year the media has been scaremongering calling it a
[48:00.560 --> 48:08.640]  national security crisis about russia potentially exploiting this deep fake technology which again
[48:08.640 --> 48:15.040]  is when they splice together two video files of a person talking mainly also obviously they use it
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.480]  in the porn industry in fact there's now a company and the rt article talks about it
[48:20.480 --> 48:27.600]  it where people can superimpose their friends or their lovers or their exes onto the faces of
[48:27.600 --> 48:34.880]  porn stars so they can watch people they know engaging in porn that's a big story it's a huge
[48:34.880 --> 48:39.840]  concern and it's a national security crisis that russia could exploit deep fake technology
[48:40.720 --> 48:45.920]  to deceive the american people to make it look like public figures are saying something they're not
[48:45.920 --> 48:53.040]  of course that is a drastic problem in terms of you know there could be a massive nuclear
[48:53.040 --> 48:57.920]  confrontation and you could have world leaders appearing to say something live that they're
[48:57.920 --> 49:04.480]  not actually saying i agree that's a big concern and it was a huge concern when i doctored some
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.520]  footage of jim acosta even though i didn't doctor it and they went on about it for days and days
[49:09.520 --> 49:17.440]  and days but when an anti-trump leftist in seattle does it remain stream tv station during a live
[49:17.440 --> 49:25.520]  presidential oval office address none of them even report on it how can they get away with
[49:25.520 --> 49:34.640]  not even mentioning this story this is absolutely huge rt headline deep fakes in action seattle tv
[49:34.640 --> 49:40.880]  station accused accused they've admitted to it of doctoring trump speech video and again
[49:41.680 --> 49:47.440]  they talk about in fact they've embedded my tweet in this article it says faking video
[49:47.440 --> 49:53.360]  footage has become easy in recent years thanks to the widespread availability of video editing
[49:53.360 --> 49:58.800]  software a combative press conference debate between cnn anchor jim acosta and president
[49:58.800 --> 50:05.120]  trump in november put the issue in the spotlight after internet detectives accused info wars
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.840]  editor apologize for what's in of editing video footage of acosta of course they had other experts
[50:09.840 --> 50:15.120]  come out and say that there was no editing or doctoring whatsoever again editing all video
[50:15.120 --> 50:21.680]  footage is edited that's what they go after james o' keaton when he gets like three hours long of
[50:21.680 --> 50:27.120]  him talking to somebody he edits it down for a youtube video oh it's edited it's edited you can't
[50:27.120 --> 50:32.480]  trust that it's edited all video footage is edited let's start talking about doctoring
[50:32.480 --> 50:38.240]  where it's edited deliberately to deceive which again i did not do i've proven all that in two
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.840]  separate youtube videos the rt article goes on to say the edited video was shared by the white
[50:43.840 --> 50:49.840]  house which it was sarah sanders tweeted it watson denied the accusation and eventually the debate
[50:49.840 --> 50:58.320]  was forgotten about yeah after a week of wall-to-wall press coverage now it happens in america during
[50:58.320 --> 51:03.920]  a live presidential address nobody's talking about it this story was out yesterday nobody's
[51:03.920 --> 51:09.680]  talking about it even though they've literally had congressmen lawmakers write letters to the
[51:09.680 --> 51:18.000]  director of national security warning about this warning that it could deeply disrupt society in
[51:18.000 --> 51:23.680]  their own words ai election meddling that's a big concern but when it actually happens it's
[51:23.680 --> 51:29.520]  admitted to it's proven nobody even cares like i'm not saying this is a national security threat
[51:29.520 --> 51:35.120]  but it's a massive news story especially if we're supposedly supposed to be really concerned about
[51:35.120 --> 51:41.440]  doctored video and ai deep fakes and yet nobody is talking about it maybe they will be forced to cover
[51:41.440 --> 51:47.200]  it over the next few hours but as of right now when we're doing this broadcast the only place
[51:47.200 --> 51:53.440]  as you can read about this or rt as of like an hour ago the blog that initially drew attention
[51:53.440 --> 51:59.520]  to it yesterday and info wars dot com this morning so absolutely incredible situation
[51:59.520 --> 52:05.440]  and if there is an update on that i'll revisit it before the end of my hour on the show but again
[52:05.440 --> 52:12.000]  absolutely flabbergasted that nobody's drawing attention to that now let's zoom out globally
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.360]  and talk about the yellow vest movement and i put up a youtube video last night about basically
[52:17.360 --> 52:22.880]  the latest on the yellow vest movement the fact that now there's a small but growing yellow vest
[52:22.880 --> 52:30.000]  movement in the uk and they're using stunts and media narratives to try and denigrate that group
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.320]  of people because god forbid they're called a politician and nazi here we are on the right
[52:36.320 --> 52:41.280]  we've been called nazis and fascists for years and years and years nobody bats an eyelid the
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.560]  media encourages it they encourage violence against us we saw the afd politician a few
[52:46.560 --> 52:52.720]  days ago beaten to a bloody pulp again because antifa thought well he's a fascist is a nazi
[52:52.720 --> 52:57.920]  therefore we have the right to basically try to assassinate him that is the ground that the media
[52:57.920 --> 53:02.800]  that's the environment the media has whipped up over the past couple of years of course intensified
[53:02.800 --> 53:10.160]  after charlotte's film and yet now in the uk the yellow vest movement have been de-platformed on
[53:10.160 --> 53:15.760]  paypal their facebook accounts are being shut down because one of them had the temerity to call
[53:16.320 --> 53:21.600]  a tori mp a nazi and i'll get into that in the video which we'll play in the next segment it's
[53:21.600 --> 53:28.160]  a seven-minute video but the latest on the yellow vest is this again out of rt officials worst
[53:28.160 --> 53:36.320]  nightmare yellow vests hope to trigger bank run with financial protest and this is slated to happen
[53:36.320 --> 53:41.600]  on saturday if it does it will be absolutely monumental because this is not a small group of
[53:41.600 --> 53:47.920]  people yellow vest protesters are hoping to trigger a bank run with a nationwide coordinated cash
[53:47.920 --> 53:52.960]  withdrawal by threatening the french financial system protesters say they want to peacefully
[53:52.960 --> 53:59.600]  force the government to pass their reforms now of course we had the footage on saturday they're
[53:59.600 --> 54:05.120]  claiming this yellow vest protest movement in france is diminishing if it's diminishing in
[54:05.120 --> 54:10.160]  numbers it's certainly not diminishing in violence there have been claims and counterclaims that the
[54:10.160 --> 54:16.000]  actual violence is actually being carried out by the more left-wing communist individuals and the
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.960]  massive migrants from the suburbs there in paris and other areas again claims and counterclaims
[54:22.960 --> 54:29.600]  on that but massive unrest in paris massive unrest in leon and numerous other french cities over the
[54:29.600 --> 54:36.880]  weekend can't look like a battlefield not a city but now the yellow vest is saying they're going
[54:36.880 --> 54:42.880]  to withdraw all their cash or as much as possible on saturday there's a quote here if the bank's
[54:42.880 --> 54:49.520]  weakened the state weakens immediately that's what yellow vest sympathizer tas song said on facebook
[54:49.520 --> 54:56.000]  it's elected officials worst nightmare protesters plan to empty their bank accounts on saturday
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.240]  withdrawing as much money as possible in a bid to undermine the french banks if not the euro itself
[55:00.960 --> 55:06.800]  the plan is to scare the state legally and without violence forcing the government to
[55:06.800 --> 55:11.440]  adopt the movement's citizens referendum initiative which would allow citizens to propose and vote on
[55:11.440 --> 55:20.480]  new laws bearing in mind that macron's approval rating is now at 23 percent on last count this was
[55:20.480 --> 55:27.120]  he was heralded as the saviour of globalism when he won the french election in 2017 now he's got
[55:27.120 --> 55:33.200]  23 percent approval rating and french people in paris are literally using forklift trucks to try to
[55:33.200 --> 55:40.080]  bulldoze their way into the city's government buildings globalism there in a wonderful state as
[55:40.080 --> 55:48.320]  we can see but now they're talking about withdrawing all their cash bear in mind poll show in france
[55:48.320 --> 55:54.800]  in france 77 percent of the french public support the yellow vest's movement even after all the
[55:54.800 --> 56:00.000]  violence and yes we had some looting yes we had some violence in terms of police officers being
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.840]  attacked but again the attacks coming from the police are just as sustained we had the arrest
[56:05.840 --> 56:12.080]  of the yellow vest leader or one of them at least in paris eric drew a back around a week ago they
[56:12.080 --> 56:17.120]  snatched him basically while he was having a dinner with his friends in a restaurant they're
[56:17.120 --> 56:22.480]  talking about introducing a law which would make it illegal to protest so you would have to get
[56:22.480 --> 56:26.960]  permission from the government to protest the government now they're going to take it one
[56:26.960 --> 56:32.320]  step further whether there are enough of them to actually have any effect or to force the french
[56:32.320 --> 56:38.800]  state into placing temporary limits on cash withdrawals remains to be seen we're going to
[56:38.800 --> 56:44.400]  get our bread back you're making money with our dough and we're fed up said protestor maxine nickel
[56:44.400 --> 56:49.840]  in a video message shared on youtube a well coordinated financial action has the potential
[56:49.840 --> 56:57.040]  to bring the french banking system and by extension the euro to its knees as banks always only hold
[56:57.040 --> 57:02.080]  fraction of the funds of the country's citizens have in their accounts fractional reserve banking
[57:02.080 --> 57:08.240]  of course most banks limit atm withdrawals to a relatively low amount meaning processes would
[57:08.240 --> 57:13.440]  have to line up inside the banks to withdraw the rest of their money now even if they could do that
[57:13.440 --> 57:18.240]  without triggering any kind of crisis if there are not enough of them to trigger a crisis
[57:18.240 --> 57:24.640]  the mere site the mere video footage the mere optics of people lined up outside french banks
[57:24.640 --> 57:31.040]  demanding their money is going to be another public relations nightmare for president macron
[57:31.040 --> 57:37.360]  and the french state and of course crucially the european union so even if it has no direct

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:14.000]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show and now your host paul
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.200]  joseph watson so we're going to play the latest on the yellow vest global movement in the next
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.120]  segment with that new video which went up on youtube last night but we're going to continue
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:32.160]  with european news right now and again out of our tea this is huge italy salvini suggests european
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:38.400]  spring to bring end to german french axis on continent so again over the past few days the
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:45.200]  populace government in italy basically came out and directly advocated and courage supported
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.880]  the yellow vest movement france wasn't happy about that they shot back and said you should
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.680]  basically clean up your own doorstep again this this is the government with a guy at the head of
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.640]  it with a 23 percent approval rating so i think they should clean up their own doorstep before
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.680]  they cast dispersions on anyone else but now italy's euro skeptic deputy prime minister
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.360]  mateo salvini has said he wants italy and poland to join together to create a european spring
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.520]  which could end the long-standing french and german domination on the continent now because
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:22.800]  him using that rhetoric amidst the yellow vest movement is no coincidence because many people
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.880]  have referred to it as the european spring speaking during a press conference with polish
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.720]  and teary minister jocke brudzinski and wasser on wednesday salvini said that poland in italy
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:41.840]  quote listen to this will be part of the new spring of europe the renaissance of european
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.520]  values which would create a quote new equilibrium where the dominance of france and germany is
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:54.240]  diminished he went on to say that the upcoming european parliamentary elections set for may
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.120]  where le pen at the moment by the way is currently the most popular leader in france
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.800]  once above macron by a significant stretch could lead away from a europe quote that is
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.520]  run by bureaucrats so now he's openly talking of a european spring as we head towards the european
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:17.600]  elections in may as the yellow vest movement becomes more and more visible as france debates
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.280]  passing laws to basically criminalize protest because again as i met the point in the video
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.200]  which we're going to play in the next segment authoritarians globalist authoritarians like macron
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.760]  the only response they know to disobedience is violence and we've seen literally people
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:41.360]  having their eyeballs blown out having their hands blown off the mainstream media is never
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.440]  going to show you any of that footage but it's been happening now for the past eight weeks minimum
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:53.840]  across france and people are beginning to describe this as a european spring even as salvini
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:00.800]  adopts that term as well as the bank run is planned for this weekend meanwhile in germany
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.200]  antifa group claims responsibility for attempted assassination of german afd politician yet another
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:13.040]  news story that was mentioned by the mainstream media but got nowhere near the top billing that
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:20.960]  it deserved imagine if a right-wing mob had almost beaten to death and attempted to assassinate a
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:28.080]  top member of angela merkel's party in germany that would be the top story across the globe it
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.560]  would be at least you know above the fold this again was buried they mentioned it it was way
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.400]  down the page on any front page of any mainstream website and in a now deleted post on a popular
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:47.040]  far left website an antifa group has claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:54.400]  on afd mp frank magnates saying they wanted to free him from his fascist ideas oh they were
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.840]  doing him a favor by leaving him with a eight inch gash down his forehead and his face which
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.240]  nearly killed him they were doing him a favor so again this is the environment the media has
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:11.040]  built up especially in germany by denouncing by dehumanizing afd politicians despite according
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:17.360]  to many polls it's now the second most popular party in germany denouncing members of that party
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:25.280]  as fascists as nazis justifying violent attacks on those individuals so again that's why the
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:31.200]  media is not reporting on it because they're partly to blame for it now the antifascist spring
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:38.320]  bremen has announced that they were behind the attack they deleted the post on indimedia shortly
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.240]  after it became public but now it does appear to be confirmed that antifa in germany which is again
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.160]  is far more aggressive far bigger than it is in america was behind what they're calling an attempted
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.440]  assassination for the first time in this century in germany of an afd politician will be back with
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.960]  more stylists show show live don't go away please whatever you do realize that we're all getting
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.760]  punched drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 twitter accounts they say affiliated with info

[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.920]  about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick but the globalists
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.480]  now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future i want to be
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:36.720]  troublesome and pesky i want to keep going i want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.080]  financially i want to push all the way i've committed to do that i've prayed for that and i've been
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:47.440]  told that's going to happen but you've got a back ish and i promise you this i will never falter

[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:15.120]  news analysis reports it's the alex joneshow and now your host paul joseph watson the french
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.240]  government is so terrified of the yellow vest movement they're debating new laws that would
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:26.560]  criminalize all unauthorized protests meaning you would need government permission to protest
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.360]  the government otherwise known as dictatorship or martial law protest leaders are now being
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.800]  handcuffed and abducted in the night like something out of starzy east germany yellow vest
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:43.520]  organizer eric drew a was arrested and faces trial for quote organizing an undeclared demonstration
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:50.640]  while meeting with friends at a restaurant call of duty modern warfare three 2011 paris 2019 when
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:57.040]  your city looks like a screenshot from an apocalyptic video game every weekend some things gone
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:03.520]  drastically wrong on saturday corn looks more like a battlefield than a city the virgin antifa
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:09.520]  rioter versus the chat french rioter hides behind a mask poses no real threat to authority
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:16.080]  just break with no purpose sports a sexy yellow vest caused actual change break because he's fed
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:21.440]  up with taxes now you know i don't advocate violence and this guy claims he was angry because
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:27.600]  his wife got tear gas but when christof dettinger despite being targeted by the media and authorities
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.160]  doxxed and having his home raided becomes an overnight icon you know whose side the public
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.560]  are on i don't want to see paris torn up but when antifa attacks banks the left cheers when yellow
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:46.960]  vests do the same it's a dark harbinger of a fascist takeover but president macron is a globalist
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:53.760]  authoritarian and the only way authoritarians know how to react to disobedience is with violence
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.960]  but the underpaid and overworked french police will eventually joy in their fellow countrymen
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:04.560]  from the king will have no clothes as tom luongo writes the yellow vest movement is coughing nails
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:10.000]  for the e you because it illustrates how the e you is a scam and all of its policies were designed
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.640]  to do exactly what it's done impoverish the working classes enrich the aristocracy and enforce it
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.080]  through a Byzantine bureaucracy that makes the world of terry gilliams brazil look like a toyota
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:28.560]  factory floor now yellow vest activists are tearing down e you flags when he was elected macron was
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:34.720]  hailed as the saviour of globalism little over a year later and his approval rating is at 23%
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:40.240]  while his citizens are using forklift trucks to smash into the ministry of finance and economy
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.840]  building meanwhile the establishment has set in motion a character assassination of the small
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:54.640]  but growing yellow vest movement in the uk remona mp anasubri was called oh my god she was called
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:02.400]  a nazi prompting a contrived hysterical media narrative that new laws need to be passed to
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:09.280]  prevent the abuse of politicians because anasubri would never smear ordinary working class people
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:16.160]  as nazis or fascists would she these are fascists fascists fascists fascists owing jones is the
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.840]  voice of the working class these gentlemen were just the wrong kind of working class yeah where was
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:30.800]  the outrage when jacob reese mox children were being abused by vile left-wing thugs how about
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.120]  nigel farage's family being repeatedly attacked and abused so there is a real double standard here
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:42.000]  that those of us that have taken on the establishment have to endure the abuse those within the
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.200]  establishment get a taste of it and suddenly they want the law changed the left has been pulling
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.600]  stunts like that for years but as soon as one establishment mp gets a bit of lip you all freak
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:00.240]  out and wet the bed give me a break a right-wing afd politician in germany is beaten almost to death
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.800]  by left-wing terrorists and it barely makes the news while every screaming top headline for two days
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:12.640]  was about someone being mean to anasubri and it was all part of a coordinated scheme to digitally
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.560]  assassinate one of the leaders of the uk yellow vest movement social media accounts banned paypal
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.160]  accounts deleted doxing journalists harassing their elderly parents thousands of jihadist
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.480]  roaming our streets every day people being stabbed to death every single day gotta get those dangerous
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.920]  13 year old girls off the streets though and there's this bizarre footage out of holland which shows a
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.440]  woman wearing a yellow vest being dragged away from a baby stroller by police the incident was
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:47.280]  apparently some kind of police training or social experiment but it's disturbing nonetheless
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:54.240]  basically the yellow vest is the new anonymous mask it's a unifying emblem for anti-establishment
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.320]  fervor across europe and it seems the only thing more provocative than yellow vests is german women
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.360]  who wear their hair in braids we are sitting here on the bar in holland and really from the
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:13.920]  police and i was really asked what i have for a political opinion if i don't have a right
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:20.080]  opinion because i have it there's also speculation raging which is unconfirmed at this point that
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.360]  governments are already conspiring with mainstream media networks to release pre-written stories
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.680]  if tensions escalate that will do everything possible to minimize the chance of events being seen
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.760]  as a european spring we've already seen mainstream tv channels in france photoshopping and censoring
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:45.040]  anti-macron protest signs the yellow vest movement utterly terrifies the elite because it unites aspects
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.640]  of both the left and the right as french philosopher alanda benoist points out the yellow vest movement
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.640]  is historic because it unites people with shared grievances from both sides of the political spectrum
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.720]  let's get one thing clear the reason the establishment hates the yellow vest movement
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.400]  is because the establishment hates the working class the reason why left-wing mouthpieces like
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  oan jones and lovey celebrities hate the yellow vest movement is because they hate the working
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.880]  class the working class are not capable of making important decisions that's why they are the working
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:24.160]  class instead of leaders and professionals you spent decades disingenuously pandering to the
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.400]  working class while feeling entitled to their vote while offering them nothing but political and
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:37.840]  economic betrayal in return standards of living sunk wage growth stagnated fuel prices skyrocketed
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:44.560]  and communities were destroyed thanks to your myopic insistence on importing millions of migrant wage
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.880]  slaves now the working class have finally got wise to it and withdrawn their support prompting
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:58.320]  your thinly veiled disgust elitism and snobbery to be fully revealed in all its fetid repulsiveness
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.560]  i don't know where the yellow vest movement is going but you can bet for a fact that the
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:08.400]  establishment's response is going to become more and more brutal proving once again that globalism
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:16.080]  can only be pursued at the expense of the freedoms prosperity and dignity of ordinary working class
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:26.080]  people that is what they're not telling you about the yellow vest it's up on youtube right now and
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.120]  in that video you probably heard a german woman speaking and we had this article up on infoz.com
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:38.720]  yesterday again absolutely incredible germany police ask woman if she has right wing political views
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:45.760]  because she's wearing braids yes she had her hair in braids she was wearing a beanie hat
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.600]  she was at christmas market in shemnitz which is where they have they've had a lot of anti mass
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:58.560]  migration protests the cops came up to her in a group of friends i think ostensibly because they
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.040]  wanted to breathalyze one of them even though they weren't even driving they were just
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.920]  having some mulled wine at christmas market event and then during the course of that confrontation
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:14.320]  they asked the woman if she had right wing political views because the reason they gave
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:22.320]  was because her hair was in braids why are they doing this well because as we reported last month
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.680]  the federal ministry for family affairs in germany this is a government body
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.560]  has been working with a berlin base group called amado antonio foundation which according to some
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:41.040]  people is has links to the old starsy in germany they call it a watchdog organization that tackles
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:47.440]  racism in hate speech so the federal ministry in germany is funding that group the federal
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:53.840]  ministry for family affairs being a cabinet level ministry of the german government and they put out
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:00.000]  a brochure for kindergarten teachers this left wing hate speech monitor group which encourages
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.600]  children to spy on their right wing parents one particular description of two children whose
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.440]  parents supposedly belong to a local right wing group was particularly disturbing because it
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:17.520]  portrayed children adopting natural gender roles as being a right wing trait and the girl wears
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:24.720]  dresses and braids you can't have little girls wearing dresses and having their hair in braids
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:30.720]  that must mean that their right wing extremists this is literally happening in germany even as

[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:53.120]  concentrating on little girls and women wearing their hair in braids absolutely absurd we'll be

[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:46.880]  preaching acceptance preaching tolerance has visited a dangerous country to spread those utopian ideals
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:55.680]  and they've disappeared likely abducted maybe tragically dead headline yeah another left-wing
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:02.320]  couple visits dangerous country to spread love disappears this was a canadian edith blase and
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:08.800]  her italian boyfriend lucca to kato or to techo were traveling in west african country of bachina
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:15.760]  fasso when all communications with their families abruptly ceased on december 15th it's thought the
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:24.080]  pair were kidnapped although their whereabouts remain unknown the woman edith blase that apparently
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.920]  posted on facebook now this is unconfirmed but it looks like her picture she's holding up a sign
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.560]  in arabic with iraq written on it on a piece of cardboard if you just scroll down a bit it's right
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:40.240]  there on facebook now it's unknown whether she wrote these words but it looks like her picture
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:47.120]  people are saying this is her again unconfirmed but it says hitchhiking iraq i just wanted to share
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:51.280]  that there is love and warmth everywhere in the world you just need the wisdom and courage to
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.680]  reach out and grasp it open your minds and hearts we are the people showing others that the world is
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:04.080]  a place in which solo females can travel to its far corners happy 2019 let's hit the road well she
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:10.560]  did that she traveled to bachina fasso she traveled to marley despite the area being riddled with
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:16.480]  terrorists and violent criminals despite canadian government travel advisories warning against
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.120]  or wanting to avoid all unnecessary travel to the country of both marley and certain areas of
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:28.000]  bachina fasso and now she's disappeared no contact with her family for nearly a month now
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:34.000]  they were on their way to the capital of bachina fasso despite the fact that six canadians were
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:43.360]  killed there by islamic jihadists who stormed a hotel during a 2016 terror attack now this
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.000]  article features a quote from gar party who is a former director general of the consular affairs
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:54.320]  and served as an ambassador to multiple countries he said quote canada's travel advisory for bachina
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:01.200]  fasso is about as explicit as you can make these things it's a very troubled country this is a country
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:08.080]  where terrorists and violent criminals will just randomly shoot at vehicles to carry out car jackings
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:14.560]  to carry out violent attacks quote armed criminals don't hesitate to shoot at vehicles to stop and
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:20.160]  rob their occupants such incidents can happen day or night on both main and secondary roads that's
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:26.320]  from global affairs canada the group that puts out the travel advisories so you have yet another
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:34.560]  left-wing couple by all accounts and other reports state that blaze was intending to travel to togo
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:40.240]  where she planned to volunteer with an organization attempting to reforest parts of togo so this is
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:47.600]  obviously an environmentalist she's got dreadlocks i think it's safe to say she looks pretty liberal
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:53.200]  and in the if this facebook post is true if it's her words she's holding up a sign in arabic
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:59.200]  basically talking about love and acceptance and the fact that females on their own even though
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:05.760]  she wasn't even on her own she was with a boyfriend can travel solo to far corners of the world this
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:13.920]  post was made after the islamic jihadist slaughter and beheading of two female scandinavian tourists
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:20.800]  who of course traveled to morocco to hike in the mountains of morocco as some of you may have seen
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.480]  the horrific video were basically raped and beheaded by isis supporters now if these were
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:32.960]  one-off isolated cases it wouldn't be a story they're not one-off isolated cases we had the other
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:39.680]  case of the left-wing couple who cycled through the middle east through the balkans they again
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.600]  preached love they preached that evil does not exist in the world and the conception that other
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:51.520]  cultures are more dangerous more bigoted less tolerant than our own that was just a product
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:25:00.320]  of our own bigotry our own western imperialism that we expect these countries to be dangerous
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.840]  they're not really dangerous everybody's friendly everybody just wants to spread love absolute bs
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:12.400]  and people are dying over and over again because of these utopian delusions that the world is just
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.560]  full of nice people who do not want to do you harm and because of this view that there aren't some
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.440]  countries which are more safe than others that there aren't some cultures which are better than
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:30.320]  others when there are and again this goes to the border point we have now breaking news story which
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.160]  says that the white house council's office is prepping legal justification for a national
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:39.520]  emergency where trump might declare the national emergency to build the wall we have people like
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:46.480]  anna navarro on cnn as guests talk about american citizens murdered by a legal alien she's literally
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:53.200]  filing her nails during this live interview showing complete disinterest this is why we have borders
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:26:00.720]  to keep out dangerous violent criminals to keep out dangerous terrorists yet the left has this
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.320]  utopian idea that everybody's accepting and embracing and tolerant and just wants to spread love
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:15.440]  like them no it's complete bs i put out a video about this called the tragedy of cultural relativism
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:21.600]  on christmas eve it's got nearly a million views on facebook i go through every single example
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.400]  not just the one today that we're talking about not just the two scandinavian female tourists in
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:33.120]  morocco raped and beheaded but people like pippa backer the italian woman who again hitched hike
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:39.280]  across all these dangerous countries said she was doing so to quote send a message of peace
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.880]  and marriage between different peoples and nations again another left-wing activist
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:50.000]  raped strangled murdered i'd went through a whole litany a whole list of these people elin
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.720]  kranz a swedish supporter of multiculturalism and a strong advocate of mass immigration
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:01.760]  she literally posted on a facebook page called we like diversity what happened to her raped and
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.920]  killed by an ethio in immigrant and dumped in a forest she didn't even have to leave sweden for
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:12.560]  that's happened to her 20 year old elie warren a left-wing environmentalist she visited mozambique
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.720]  for the pumping nightlife for the experience of all these great wonderful eclectic different cultures
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.200]  she went there to quote help others less fortunate than herself raped murdered dumped in a toilet block
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.120]  again it goes on and on and on in that one video i think i point to about a different
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:37.120]  examples of course the cyclists which i mentioned before they literally put out blogs saying the
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.840]  evil doesn't exist in the world our view the evil exists in these more dangerous parts of the world
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:48.720]  is just a product of our own imperialist bigotry they were cycling into jikistan isis terrorists
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.080]  mowed them down in vehicles and stabbed them to death there are literally dozens and dozens of
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.680]  these cases i probably covered about 10 or 12 in the video and there's a new one out just today
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:06.720]  again this is why we have borders to keep out these kind of dangerous violent criminals not to
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:13.760]  keep out legal immigrants to keep out illegal immigrants and protect our own people again why
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.880]  do you lock your door at night it's not because you hate the people outside it's because you love
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:26.400]  the people inside but they travel to these foreign countries with these utopian delusions
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:31.520]  they go to the to the worst s holes imaginable because then they think they can come back and
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.960]  that's a form of virtue signaling to say that they went to these remote horrific places where
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.520]  poverty is widespread where violent crime is widespread because they want to get some kind
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.920]  of reflection and say oh look at me i'm so open so tolerant i can go to these places and love them
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.720]  nothing happens to me it's great everyone's peaceful loving what happens in many cases

[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.440]  from swedelanders dot org now there's all kinds of stuff i can get into here with simon obviously
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:45.120]  what's going on in south africa uh where the democrats act like there's nothing going on
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.120]  there's no racism there's no attack against white people and their and their farmlands
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:55.760]  it's just not even happening according to democrats but then there's the kind of let's bring that issue
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:02.480]  home and say well how does this apply to the west what what what do we see happening in in south
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:10.000]  africa that we can try to avoid happening in the west of course the race war aspect is is one of this
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:17.040]  but it's also a culture war so so simon talk about the culture war that is happening in in south
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:26.560]  africa right now and what the west needs to be aware of to avoid it oan the most outstanding
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.640]  feature of what's happening in south africa now if you draw a comparison with the west
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:40.080]  is the similarity the simple reality is that the same methods are being applied in south
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:45.840]  africa albeit that we're a little bit further along the curve than you guys are in the northern
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:52.560]  hemisphere that is to say in canada and and the usa and in western europe the same methods as are
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.120]  being applied to you and they begin by telling you that your culture is wrong and your values are
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:02.320]  wrong and the things that your forefathers did are wrong and therefore you should atone for it
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:09.520]  and nobody else can be wrong anybody else can only be a victim but you as a to put it in
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:18.160]  stereotypical terms and not to exaggerate the comparison but you as a white male from the
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:25.120]  western european christian tradition are wrong and everybody else is a victim and therefore
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:31.520]  you must atone for it and you must compromise on other people's terms that is the salient feature
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:36.720]  of what you've just spoken about well and i was actually thinking about this because it's so it's
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:43.680]  like every day there's more and more racism against white people in the united states of america
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.600]  i mean whatever i'm not even sitting here saying there's not racism against black people or brown
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.560]  people or anything i'm just saying the racism against white people in the united states is the
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.720]  most publicly on display of any of it but then they say oh you can't be racist against white people
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:06.400]  but you just hit on what i was thinking last night the reason why they demonize white men in the west
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:10.000]  is because that's the only way you can tear down america's founding you see the founding fathers
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.040]  were white so what you do is you demonize the white man say the white man is the problem for
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.080]  everything then you can go back in time and say oh look it was white men that founded america
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:25.920]  therefore america must be evil racist and can't exist so it's the destruction of the white man
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.640]  in the west which is what they're going to use as part and parcel of a bigger plan to destroy
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:40.320]  the foundations of america you're you couldn't be more correct the the operative word though for me
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:48.320]  and what you've just said is the they they they the they is not the let's say african americans or
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:58.080]  mexicans or whoever you may be you may feel is that some kind of loggerheads with with the western
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:04.480]  european cultural tradition in the usa south africa and elsewhere it is our primary enemy
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:12.080]  in south africa as it is the case in in the usa is not the black african people of south africa
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:17.760]  it is the they the intellectual elites the academic elite the liberal elite and the other
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:24.480]  elites who come up with these fancy fancy ideas and then ram them down the throats of the the
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:30.640]  canon fodder as it were brainwashing them to believe in all sorts of things that they never
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.520]  believed before that never occurred to them before that are not intrinsic or inherent in their
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:43.360]  cultural understanding of of the paradigms of of the human condition and they adopt this stuff and
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.320]  then they as i say act as as canon fodder and i think that's a very important thing for people
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:56.960]  to understand both in the usa and in south africa our primary enemy in south africa is not the black
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:05.600]  man that the liberals stereotypically paint us with you know you hate black people full dust man
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:11.520]  these crazy ideas didn't emanate from within black african culture they emanated from the
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:19.680]  super intellectuals in the most elite universities and and there is clearly some orchestration if
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.800]  you look at it that way you begin to see that it's not spontaneous for what that's worth to you own
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.520]  no absolutely it's an indoctrination process i'm more familiar with it in america obviously than
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.160]  south africa it's an indoctrination process that happens in the public schools it happens in the
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.160]  media and so it just becomes kind of passe modern parlance to oh yeah just blame the white man for
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:47.440]  everything but but you hit on something that's key to to kind of make clear here i go to these events
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:53.360]  and the most of people attacking me because i'm white like you said they're not mexican they're
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.960]  not latino most of aren't even black i mean quite frankly when i get attacked for being white
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:05.040]  it's 90 of the time other white liberals uh that fall for the indoctrination of course you're gonna
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.920]  have some black people that hate white people of course you're gonna have some white people that
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:13.120]  probably don't like other skin color people you're gonna have that in any group but but it's the it's
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:20.240]  the idea it's the ideological left in america that has been primed and ready to go out into this
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.760]  into the physical world and launch this movement against white people and claim that every white
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:31.360]  man is is is racist and a nazi now white supremacist responsible for everything and so this is what
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:37.680]  they're pushing to destroy america so yeah it's really easy to deceive somebody and rip their
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:43.600]  prosperity out from under them if you can give them a common enemy and then you can say look at
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.760]  your common enemy that's the one that founded your country don't you see how your country's evil
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.160]  that's the propaganda they're engaged in and as you said south africa is ahead of this curve so
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.720]  so let's let's talk in the next segment where america is at in that curve defeat the globalist

[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:18.960]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was

[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:29.760]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and raw ux2 that's been incredible now
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.720]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.920]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.720]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:52.720]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see

[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:32.880]  i want to try to put a bookmark on where america is at right now culturally
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:42.080]  societally and we're going to get simon rosh's take on this where it compares in the in the
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:51.120]  overall curve of globalism and propaganda to south africa but basically what you have is
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:58.880]  because america has become so wealthy and prosperous most people have not had to really
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:06.640]  suffer or or go through any real strain to enjoy the wealth and prosperity and freedom and independence
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.360]  of being an american citizen and so they'll they'll paint the picture that oh that's just a bunch of
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:16.880]  spoiled white people no that's that's that's everyone that's everybody enjoying the prosperity
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.640]  and the wealth of america that's been created by the people that have suffered to get us here
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.600]  yeah that includes slaves that were black that includes slaves that were irish that includes
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.360]  white people that settled the place that includes all of america's history
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:42.720]  but now there's been an added ingredient which is mainstream entertainment media
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:49.360]  force feeding you the Kardashians force feeding you the real wives of Hollywood force feeding you
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:56.400]  all the glitz and the glamour so you see rich wealthy successful people getting boats living
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:02.320]  lavish lifestyles and those so that becomes the pop culture you see and then all the wealth and
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:08.240]  prosperity that has made america the richest most prosperous nation on earth is being sucked away
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.640]  and it's starting to hit the average american household but the youth still sees the media
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.480]  saying oh look at the Kardashians look at Hollywood look at the celebrities they're rich they're
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:23.040]  famous they got big boats they got big fancy cars they go on big lavish vacations they get the big
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.560]  you know million-dollar ring on their finger and so then the average america's like well why
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.960]  don't i get that well i didn't have to work for this wealth and prosperity america why don't i get
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:37.200]  the prosperity and wealth they get so then they get frustrated because they can't attain that level
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:43.600]  of wealth and prosperity at least in their mind and most people can't and so then they get angry
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.280]  and then they want everything for free and so then they need a scapegoat then they need somebody
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:54.560]  to blame and then the media comes in again and gives them the anti-white propaganda
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:03.280]  so that's basically where we're at culturally now you have a bunch of spoiled rotten brats
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:07.520]  in the west that expect to get everything for free because that's the propaganda that they've
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:13.200]  been given and they don't understand what it took for america to actually attain this level
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:20.320]  of freedom and prosperity and so now they're willing unwittingly to throw it all away in the name of
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:26.320]  social justice because they believe that will be their deliverance but in south africa they're ahead
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.480]  of where we're at right now in america they're actually taking land they're actually killing
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.840]  people and it's all being justified by the government so so simon just talk about where
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:42.800]  south africa is at on that curve of destroying uh you know south africa's culture and and just
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.360]  the people from getting along and what america needs to realize before we reach that level
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:56.480]  where we would differ with you guys quite strongly not because of any special intuition or
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:05.040]  anything like that purely because we have watched more of this movie than you have is in the idea
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:10.880]  that the superficial assessment is the right assessment we can see it happening in front of us
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:16.560]  therefore this must be what is happening whereas in fact we're much like an audience watching a
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:24.160]  punch and duty puppet show and being woken up to the realities of this puppet puppet show punches
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:29.920]  punching duty duties hitting punch back and completely failing to recognize the puppet
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:39.600]  masters above it and this is not as as insightful or intuitive or clever as it may seem over time
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:43.280]  this becomes obvious it becomes obvious that these things are not spontaneous
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:50.800]  they don't come from within the culture they appear to do so but with greater exposure
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:58.240]  and greater interrogation of of this thing you begin to see that it is injected into the culture
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:03.520]  so what you say about the Kardashians and so on is perfectly true on a superficial level it is
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:09.120]  exactly what's happening but it is not the root cause it is merely a symptom of something else
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:15.280]  you begin to tell over time that these things are worked out centuries or decades in advance
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:20.160]  and they are worked out by the brightest minds in the world whoever they may be whether you
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.440]  believe in this theory or that theory or the other theory is immaterial the point is to begin
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:32.080]  to understand that it is deliberate and that it is orchestrated once you can begin to understand
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:37.680]  that you can begin to fight it because if you fight it on a superficial level you just don't get
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:46.320]  anyway well and the proof of this comes from an old case McCarthyism where McCarthy a former
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:52.400]  congressman is saying hey look our government's been infiltrated by communists this is an immediate
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:58.000]  threat to our nation and you know he was laughed at joked about it became a joke McCarthyism well
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.040]  it turned out he was right there ended up being dozens if not even hundreds of communist embeds
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:07.680]  inside the United States government it all came out but it's the same thing so it's like here
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:14.320]  we are saying hey look we have globalist embeds in our government we have Chinese agents embedded
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:21.200]  in our government their goal is an anti-american propaganda machine via the media via the U.S.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:26.880]  government so that whenever the time is right they can come in and say America shouldn't exist
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:32.240]  here's why and the big here's why that they're going with is it was founded by white men so
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.960]  so that's a good point that's a good point to bring up how this isn't something spontaneous
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:42.720]  this isn't something organic this has all been manufactured over the course of decades if not
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:48.720]  centuries yes that's absolutely correct you're a hundred percent correct Owen and what we have to
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:55.040]  begin to do as black-minded people in the world is to create a critical mass of people who can
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:54:01.280]  see this thing and who can collaborate to oppose it because if we continue to make the
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:06.800]  mistake which we in South Africa have made far more extensively than you guys in the USA
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:12.320]  but which you are making more now than we are thank god we've gotten over it a little bit
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.640]  if we continue to make the mistake of believing that proselytizing and evangelizing and trying
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:23.360]  to draw people into our way of thinking is the answer we're not going to get anywhere if we
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:29.520]  try to convince people who to the marrow of their bones don't share this perception we're going to
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:36.880]  spend all of our time out there trying to cultivate some giant flock of you know right wing and it
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:45.600]  doesn't work that way we those of us who can see the problem for what it is must begin to put aside
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:52.080]  our differences and to focus on the commonalities between us and not the differences and to act in
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:55:01.280]  concert small though the critical mass may be to act in concert now and we will see a difference
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:08.160]  we will see a far greater difference than if we spend the next 40 years hoping to persuade 30 or 40
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:13.440]  or 50 percent or whatever percentage of the society to see this thing for what it is because it
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:22.400]  will not happen it's the it's the it's the the viewers of the alex jones show who are going to make
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:28.560]  the change that is necessary not the voters for donald trump i hope i'm not offending too many
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:36.480]  people here but people need to begin to recognize that you cannot achieve a drastic difference
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:45.040]  if you have a broad spectrum of people who are mostly half-heartened about the real severity
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:50.160]  of this crisis well i here's here's what i would say to that because i think that you you you set
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:58.080]  this up perfectly because south africa has seen the violence and the hatred and and the death and
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:04.480]  the gore of the the cultural divide and the racial divide so extremely people's eyes have finally
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.000]  been opened as an overall society could say wow i mean why are these people being tortured to death
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.680]  we're seeing these bloody bodies and everything america hasn't really hit that point yet we've
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:18.320]  had i mean yeah you you've had a there was a young white man that got kidnapped by some black people
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.200]  that were torturing him on social media okay it's a young thing stupid thing you've got people
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.960]  dragging white people out of cars and beating them saying oh you voted trump so they kick them in
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.840]  the street so so but it's it's kind of like they kind of have a political veil over it they won't
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:36.560]  say it's strictly based on race and they have the excuse with the media saying oh these are all
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.560]  racist white supremacists bigots but it hasn't reached the level in south africa where we're
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:48.400]  literally seeing hundreds of bloody dead bodies because of the racial war um we haven't reached
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.600]  that point yet we have to stop it from getting there yeah absolutely you have to stop it from
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.640]  getting there and my fear is that you guys are going to make the same mistake as we made in
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:05.840]  in spending too much time trying to get everybody to see what we see and think what we see and
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:11.360]  believe what we see and it just doesn't work well that way you waste a lot of time the people
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.960]  who can really see this thing in the usa are the people who should act now and i'm not proposing
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:24.720]  what the action is as you know st london's is the world's largest non-state civil defense
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.600]  organization we are legal and lawful and we've never had any case brought against us much
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:35.120]  less successfully so i'm not proposing anything radical or or just stupid i'm just saying that
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:40.080]  if you're gonna do anything at all do it with people who understand what's going on and the
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:44.400]  beauty of the beautiful thing is it's people of all skin color all backgrounds that do understand
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:49.120]  this this isn't a race issue the media makes it one it's really hard to have the energy at the end

[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:20.720]  fake news to say there are not it's fake it's fake news but if i would be s okay say that it's equal
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:26.240]  to the real data it's not bs but even if i were to even if i were to grant you that okay the point

[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:37.280]  can't do their nails are people who've been killed anna by dangerous known illegal aliens who've

[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:23.600]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones and now your host owin shroy i'll tell you what
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:31.360]  my guest stewart rhodes is a great guest to have on because of his expertise on what's happening at
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:35.840]  the border his experience down there his group oath keepers which is doing everything they can to
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:40.080]  protect the border and of course you've got just breaking news coming out president trump's going
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:45.280]  to declare a national emergency probably before the end of the month he has just decided to cancel
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:49.680]  his trip to davos because of the government shutdown so there's all this is going on that stewart
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:54.000]  rhodes is a great guest to have on but you know what i actually want to go somewhere else with stewart
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:02.880]  because i stewart is one of those gentlemen that he's already had enough okay he's already had enough
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:07.760]  of the leftist scum he's already had enough of the democrat traders and so that's why he started
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:14.480]  oath keepers that's why he takes action now stewart i don't even know how to properly
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:23.200]  place myself on a map when it comes to anger and disgust dealing with these leftists right now but
[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:30.400]  i'm telling you stewart we're going to reach a breaking point we're going to reach a breaking
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:37.280]  point in american history before long and conservatives and and just american patriots it
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:41.840]  doesn't even you don't even have to put a political label on it just just americans that are sick of
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:47.040]  the lies sick of the garbage sick of the race baiting just sick of all of it we're going to
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:52.080]  reach a breaking point before long and and i don't know what's going to happen okay i really don't
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:58.320]  even want to think and go down that road even but but stewart i'm telling you the left is not
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:02.560]  going to say i got a story today they're now in the huffington post telling you how to teach your
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:07.840]  kids how to masturbate before the age of five i mean you really think you're going to get away
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:15.520]  with this so so i'm like i mean i'm just sitting here just wait like when stewart roes of both
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:21.360]  keepers when do you think america is going to have enough of this garbage because i'm telling you
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:30.320]  we are reaching a breaking point and it's it is not far off my friend that's a good question um we
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:36.000]  are basically in a cold civil war i don't think it's a good thing to see and i think we needed to work
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:43.760]  to try to avoid it because the civil war would be brutal um but if the left continues to dominate the
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:49.520]  radical marxist left continues to dominate the democratic party and they continue to push their
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:55.280]  agenda which is a totalitarian agenda events is going to come the blows and that's just reality it
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:09:01.280]  always does um throughout history radical marxist and totalitarians have never stopped until they're
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:07.360]  stopped so that's what's going to happen and here's again this is just historically accurate here's
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.960]  what's going to happen stewart we're not going to be the first to shoot somebody we're not going to
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.280]  be the first to punch somebody in fact the left has already done this you had hodgkinson shoot
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:21.440]  steve schliece you have over 600 documented on record cases of political terrorism against
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.520]  trump supporter so the left is already engaging in the violence the left is already engaging in
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.480]  trying to murder people they're literally doing that and then they ignore all of it and place
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:36.240]  all physical violence on one guy james fields who yeah probably should be in jail for his life
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:42.320]  for involuntary manslaughter but but it was the left that caused that entire situation they manufacture
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:47.120]  that entire event and then they say oh look at conservatives how violent they are they killed
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:53.040]  heather hayer they have attempted to murder multiple conservatives they shot steve schliece
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:59.760]  over 600 documented cases of political terrorism by leftists so they don't understand we're literally
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:05.600]  sitting here just taking you trying to kill us we're not going to sit here forever we still
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  have a survival instinct it's just a matter of when it kicks in right i mean the right has
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:16.800]  not responded in kind um and i think that's actually a good strategy i think it's best for us to be
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.320]  restrain and take the high road at least for now but like you said events is going to go kinetic
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:26.480]  in the streets and when that happens it'll be a different ballgame you know anti-foul wearing
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:31.920]  black mask will only be a target indicator for for rifles but it's like what do what do you do
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:40.400]  what what it what it's like i have all of these people today threatening me because i put out a
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:47.280]  tweet saying that the media drumming up all the anti-trump hysteria is partly responsible for the
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.920]  death of heather hayer i can factually back that up i can logically back that up of course they are
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:56.000]  they know it that's why they want to place all the all the blame on james fields and so now all
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.040]  these people are threatening me saying they want to come after me so it's like what so i'm just so
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:07.440]  so that's what it is those two it they want us to sit here to sit on our hands and wait until
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.680]  they murder us that's what it is they want us to just sit here until they literally slit our
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:17.680]  throat so it's like we're in this zone where we ate where we're either just we're just either
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:22.000]  gonna sit here and say okay go ahead and slit my throat and kill us so the rest of the world can
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:27.520]  see who you are a bunch of evil scumbags or we defend our dignity and defend our life i mean
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:33.280]  that's where we're at right now right well the smart middle road is to be you know obviously
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:38.480]  prepared to defend yourself as you go about your day but don't cross the line as as he did
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:43.520]  unfortunately not on that day he crossed the line for first of all he was a neo nazi scumbag
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:47.600]  but like you said that he's the poster child now for supposedly you know this is the same
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:53.200]  conflation they do to all of us that because of one action by one neo nazi scumbag you know
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:57.040]  that we're all neo nazis and this is what they want to put out there this is what they want to
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:02.080]  believe this is what they their their foot soldiers and antifa want to believe also and i think it was
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:06.720]  i was sitting next to you not too long ago talking about this how a lot of these kids are so brainwashed
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:13.200]  to believe that anyone who's not a marxist who's not on the political left is automatically a fascist
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:18.560]  automatically a racist are being conditioned to believe this unless we can deactivate that
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:22.480]  brainwashing we're going to eventually have to fight them but when we do it'll be a different
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:26.720]  ballgame because they don't have the military skills we do they don't have the backgrounds we do
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:30.640]  they don't have the life experiences we do so they'll be you know behind the curve on on the
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:35.680]  well they don't have the humanity that that we have i mean if you really want to get down to the
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:43.360]  the the foundation of just survival instincts i mean i won't go down that road but when when they
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.280]  when they came out with the decision that james fields is going to be charged for murder anybody
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.040]  who watched the war room remembers how upset i got that day and again i'm not sitting here trying to
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:55.760]  defend james fields if i was a judge it would be my opinion i think he's in jail for involuntary
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:00.720]  manslaughter wherever the case is the point is they manufacture the whole thing place all the
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.680]  blame on james fields to now like you said say look all trump supporters are neo nazis and they
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.400]  murdered heather higher which is just not the case at all i mean i knew that this would happen i knew
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.240]  this moment would happen and now it's actually happening and i just want to defend myself to
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:19.600]  say hey look we're not neo nazis there's a situation in charlottesville that was bad there's multiple
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:24.720]  people to blame the whole thing was was was created and manufactured by the mainstream media here's
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:31.120]  my logic to prove it and then they just say oh you're just scum you're just a neo nazi and
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.880]  then i say well why don't you call into the show and debate me on this and then they never will
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:39.440]  i mean how so so how do we beat the brainwashing stewart when they won't even engage in a political
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:44.080]  discussion or discussion of any kind i think you have to let other groups like the walk away
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.680]  movement do that for you but as i said before we have to make sure that we don't fall for identity
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:55.520]  politics either it's a mistake to try to fight fire with fire by becoming racist yourself or
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:59.520]  identifying long racial lines that's what they want you to do they want to divide and conquer
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.280]  the american people i mean the big the big picture is is the globalist point of strings
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:07.680]  want black americans to hate white americans and vice versa and hispanic americans they hate you
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:11.760]  know they want us all to hate each other long racial lines and the worst thing we can do is
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:15.840]  fall for it so i think the walk away movement's a good indicator a lot of the black conservatives
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:20.320]  who are now speaking up and supporting trump is a good indicator all of this is what we need to
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:26.000]  support when we don't need to do though is is jump in the jump on all the way to the far the far
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.520]  right and say yes you know because the left is becoming identity politics racial focused
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:37.600]  we should also too i think it's a huge mistake all right well let's get into some of this border
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:42.160]  news of course you're not doing that you know and neither am i no i know but you're just saying
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:46.160]  it's just important to lay that out because that's what they claim you know that's that's the claim
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.240]  they try to pin on us when when it's none of it's true they never provide a quote you know that's
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:54.880]  what loves richard spencer they love their poster poster boy on the on the far right who's you know
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:59.280]  an enemy of the constitution as much as they are this was so bizarre about charlottesville you had
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:05.040]  two different groups of violent enemies of the constitution who hate the constitution attacking
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:09.840]  each other which was kind of hilarious frankly until someone was killed and then the whole thing
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:16.640]  gets spun out of context to blame trump supporters and used as as evidence that that were you know
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:21.040]  nazi's murderers yeah which you know we weren't there for for that reason we knew there was
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:25.280]  we could be a nazi's right full of like i said the domestic enemies of the constitution as
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:31.440]  bad as an economist so we don't uh we don't give time for anything this country is in such dire
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:35.440]  straits and it always will be that's the price of freedom is eternal vigilance i mean you know
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:40.960]  so but let's talk about how because let's let's let's let's let's bring it back to the border
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:45.920]  because really you can apply that to everything these people don't even want to have a border folks
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:49.440]  they don't even want to stop drugs and crime and rapists from coming into this country that's just

[02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:54.560]  sitting across from you at the dinner table kicking your shins under the table throwing food across
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:01.200]  the table at you trying to initiate a reaction and then of course denying it you know to to the
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:05.360]  parent sitting at the dinner table so you know they want to kick you throw food at you do anything
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:11.040]  they can to try to initiate a reaction out of you and then as soon as you react they point the
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:16.880]  finger at you and blame you for everything so that you get shut down that's the american left
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:24.320]  right now in the united states of america a petulant child a petulant antagonist that will
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:30.800]  disappear as soon as it's time to take roll call for responsibility and here's my issue because i'm
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:38.160]  sorry to focus on this steward but but here's my thing i am like i am locked in on the american
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:46.640]  left right now i mean i am like locked in cannot unlock myself until the target is destroyed but
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:51.840]  the problem is i don't know the weapon to destroy these people they don't like facts they don't like
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:56.720]  logic they have no common sense they don't know history they have no intellect and they won't come
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:02.960]  on air to actually debate this or discuss this so like i'm in this perpetual state of frustration
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:08.000]  steward where i'm locked in on the enemy i have them identified i have them targeted they must be
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:14.240]  destroyed or they will destroy america but there isn't i don't know how to beat the brainwashing i
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:18.800]  don't know how to wake them out of their trance i don't know how to get them to wake up and i
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:24.560]  don't think they want to so so i'm sorry to stay on this steward and and i mean it's just i don't
[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:28.960]  know what to do i'm so frustrated with these people because i know where this goes in in 10
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:35.840]  20 30 years america will be gone you will not have the freedom to build a business you will not
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:42.160]  have the freedom to speak your mind you will have nothing and they brag about it they brag about
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:46.800]  how they want to bring communism here so it's like how i mean steward i'm sorry again i'm not i'm
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:51.200]  sorry to dwell on this and if you want to switch roads just go ahead and do it but i just want to
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:59.040]  know what is the weapon what is the weapon to destroy this ideology that the left is trying
[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:04.000]  to bring to america i just i can't i'm so frustrated i'm so locked in i i identify these people i know
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.080]  everything they do i know all their moves i know how they think that's how i can defeat them in a
[02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:12.480]  debate so easily i just don't know what to do is love the weapon of the future no these people
[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:15.680]  don't even understand love that's another thing they don't even speak the language of love steward
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:21.040]  right well i think it still is the answer though and i think uh true both truth and love are the
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:26.960]  answer i think the walk away movement is is a key indicator of how you do it we have to always keep
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:31.840]  in mind there's a big difference between the leadership and the rank and file your average
[02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:35.920]  ignorant college student although they don't know history they don't know you know they don't
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:40.960]  understand anything they're still reachable the leadership of course it is you know not reachable
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:45.920]  bill ares the you know the old communist terrorist who's still around you're never going to change
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:50.560]  his mind except for the bullet but the young people he's trying to brainwash and trying to
[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:55.360]  turn into weapons and weaponizing um are reachable and the walk away movement shows that and the
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:59.920]  romp all movement showed that too he had immense popularity among the youth and college students
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:06.000]  in this country so there are ways to do it it might not be you're my best tactic because of
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  who we are but there are people out there i would say that you have to have young black
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.320]  conservatives talk to blacks for example and young Hispanic conservatives and libertarians
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:19.920]  talk to them that's the easiest way to do it is to let them take care of the race baiting in
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:24.000]  their own communities by going out there and talking to each other so that's what it's gonna
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:30.160]  take uh it's you know i don't give up on the right the rank and file average leftist out there on
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:35.600]  college campuses are being used they're useful idiots we need to educate them and and uh cure
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:42.000]  the ignorance it's a long hard fight yeah you're right and and and it they hate me i mean so it's
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:47.680]  like i i but you know what here's the thing because what you said is key and and let's bring this to
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:54.160]  the situation at the border president trump in his address the other night said what building a wall
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:58.160]  is not because you hate the people on the other side of the wall well maybe if you're
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:03.360]  nancy plosie or barack obama probably is but but building a wall at the border you know putting a
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:07.920]  wall at your home locking your doors at night that's not because you hate people on the outside it's
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:14.080]  because you love people on the inside steward i don't think these people understand the language
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:17.360]  of love i don't think they understand the language of truth i don't think they understand the language
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.920]  of facts or logic so how do i even communicate with that how do i communicate with them i mean i
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:25.600]  think that you're right i think president trump went with that message he said we love people
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:30.720]  inside america we want to protect them by building a wall i think trump is trying to use the message
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:38.160]  of love i just i just don't think it's working well like i said you have to do it from the inside out
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:44.000]  you can't do it by going there and doing it in a confrontational way you have to it's a long hard
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.320]  slog you got to be on the campuses you got to be in the public forums and you got to be the voice
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:53.360]  of reason i think jordan peterson's a very good example of how you do it keep your cool you state
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:58.160]  facts and and you let the facts speak for themselves and over time eventually they come
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:03.200]  around you know that's what you have to hope for if they're willing to listen but that's the that's
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:08.080]  the problem right a lot of them are so brainwashed that they just will not listen but i think the
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:12.400]  walkaway movement once again is a good example i think it's the best strategy and and you know i
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:18.880]  hate to say it but you have to put your um minority racial minority people out there you got to have
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:23.040]  your black conservatives libertarians go and speak about liberty to the blacks you got to have the
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:29.440]  hispanic ones do the hispanics that's the only way to counter the identity politics racism on the left
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.240]  you know that's but what's what's the demarcation line how do we know we're having success i mean
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:39.440]  the walkaway movement happened before the midterm elections the democrats still won the house that's
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:45.840]  because they stole 16 seats but this is what's going on i mean what do we do it takes time i mean
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:49.600]  they they did the long march they did the long march through our institutions as they called it
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:54.480]  the the communists did they took over higher learning we were asleep at the switch frankly
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:58.560]  and we let them do it and so we have to counter counter veil that we should be on the college
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:02.480]  campuses i mean i've been wanting to get on college campuses for a couple years now but a
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:06.240]  lot of my members are so you know they're older people and they just don't feel comfortable being
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:11.200]  on a college campus but until conservatives get rid of that fear of going out there well i got no
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.280]  fear i'd be glad to go to a college campus stewart what is going on at oathkeepers.org right now
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:20.720]  well we're still on the border but as i said before it's it's it's discouraging to see the
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:25.760]  border patrol being instructed to you know catch and release under the same old nonsense of the
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:30.800]  of the you know trumped up amnesty claims and i think what has to happen is the president must
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:35.040]  do the right thing and put the troops on the border i think he's making a mistake though
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:39.200]  and doing it the way he's doing it i understand what he's trying to do politically but by saying
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:44.640]  i'm going to do an emergency declaration if they don't give me the funding he's actually
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:49.920]  putting himself in the legally weakest position because then they can say in the courts well
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:54.800]  congress denied him the funding congress said no to a wall and he tried to do it through executive
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:59.520]  order through declaration of emergency puts puts him in a weaker position but i have to argue that
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:04.720]  he has an independent powers commander in chief to build the wall even if congress says no what he
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:09.280]  should have done is as soon as that police officer in california was killed by an illegal alien gang
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:12.880]  banger who's part of the cartel network he should have declared the emergency and said it's not
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:16.880]  going to do with my fight with congress if they want to give me funding great they don't that's
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:21.520]  you know we'll battle that out so would you agree with my analysis trump has to go full bore there's
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:26.240]  no other option absolutely i mean he should have done that day one of his inauguration he should
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:30.320]  um from the stage when since he was sworn in he should have said i am declaring an emergency we
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:33.040]  have an emergency on our border i'm going to deploy the troops and he should have done every
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:38.480]  day ever ever since then he's way behind the power ball behind the power curve on this um but i do
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:43.440]  think you know you look back at young's town cheating too the the decision is the pre-court
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:48.640]  decision about truman trying to nationalize the still mills is where you'll see the position's
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:54.000]  going to be in if he just makes us a political fight only all right steward roads oathkeepers.org

[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:36.240]  for the last 30 minutes before doug hagman takes over and then i'm gonna re-energize and just go
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:41.840]  full savage against the left on the war room today from three to six p.m central and i'm opening up
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:46.080]  the phone lines i'm just gonna do the whole broadcast because i have hundreds of leftists
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:49.760]  attacking me on twitter right now including riders at the washington post and buzzfeed and
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:53.360]  hovington post and all this stuff and i've asked them to come on air they won't they're all cowers
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:57.840]  and frauds but we'll go ahead and give them an opportunity because they all want to talk trash
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.640]  on twitter let's see if they'll do it you know in the actual conversation now they won't they're
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:09.120]  cowers and frauds but here's the good news and then i'm going to get outside of my own head and
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:17.280]  then just try to cover some of this news the the energy of earth is directly connected to human
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:26.320]  consciousness so anybody who knows about the metaphysics and the frequencies of our own reality
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:35.680]  basically there's ebbs and flows of energy so tuesday night when president trump gave his
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:39.200]  address from the oval office even though we were frustrated because it wasn't as hardcore as it
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:44.880]  should have been that was one form of energy blasting out into the universe that was devastating
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:50.960]  to the ideologies of the left why president trump gave up cold hard facts about what's
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:56.480]  happening at the border he did it in a very measured and loving fashion that was undeniable
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:01.040]  and resonated with with the average american that isn't totally brainwashed then chuck and
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:07.200]  nancy came out and gave their rebuttal address which was a total devastation of optics to themselves
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:18.240]  so that was a push of energy against a form of thought and consciousness in the west right
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:24.720]  now it's flowing back in the opposite direction and that's why i'm so frustrated today that's why
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:28.880]  i'm getting attacked so much that's why huffington post is telling you to teach your kids how to
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:33.040]  masturbate before the age of five that's why they're lying about what's happening at the border
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:39.920]  it's why they're lying about trump and then the biggest one that's why they're pushing sandy sweden
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:46.400]  formerly alexandra cortez as the biggest baddest thing right now in the united states because
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:53.920]  she is the answer to the failing democrat party the democrat party's dead cortez is the answer to
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:58.080]  that corpse and it's going to be socialism that's why they're building her up and i've identified
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:03.680]  their entire playbook and i may get to it today here on the joneshow or the war room but folks
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:09.920]  i can predict every single move they make with cortez she has been controlled whether she knows
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:18.560]  it or not from the very get go by bernie sanders backers and that's on record with disclosures
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:25.280]  from old websites run by bernie sanders people that they then gave to cortez so there's all of that
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:31.760]  going on but the good news is that means by the weekend or perhaps over the weekend there's going
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:37.920]  to be a major push of energy against these people so something big is definitely going to happen
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:44.400]  in the next 48 hours as far as just the the the consciousness of the west is concerned and the
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:50.960]  the flows of positive and negative energy but let me get outside of my head i've got some news and
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:58.720]  i've plugged once today all broadcast and i think there's probably 10 people that work on the alex
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:04.240]  joneshow here every day and there's you know five more people that work on the war room and five
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:07.760]  more people that work on the david night show and then there's a whole graphics department and then
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:12.320]  there's the whole shipping department the marketing department and great editors and camera people
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:17.920]  and crew people and i wish more people would actually come in the studio to see what info
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:22.720]  wars is all about because people come in the studio they see the 50 people that work here every day

[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:25.760]  let me just do a news blitz mexico finds 20 bodies is from roiders mexico finds 20 bodies
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:35.040]  17 of them burned at the us border the left says there's nothing to see here texas landowners
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:40.400]  prepare wall fight trump to visit border i actually know the answer to this so so here's what the ap
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:44.000]  did they found some landowners down at the southern border that that are anti wall and that's fine
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.320]  that's you don't want a wall on their land and you know eminent domain and everything okay that's
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:54.080]  fine they want the wall in their land this is what can happen so you have jimacost to go out at a
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:58.320]  portion of the border today that had a wall and he's like i'm down here at the border and there's no
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:04.880]  national emergency everything's fine and it's like yeah jim because you're at the wall go to the
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.760]  segment where there isn't a wall jim but he's too big of a coward and a fraud to do that so so jim
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:14.400]  actually proves trump is right jimacost approves trump is right today by going to a section of the
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:18.560]  border that has a wall and says there's no national emergency here yeah because there's a wall you jack
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:27.600]  ass but here's what trump can do trump should actually give up trump should actually give in
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:31.760]  on these landowners that don't want a wall on their land here's what you do
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:38.560]  that i'm telling you this is this is this is the 45 d 60 chess how you defeat these people's ideology
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.040]  build the wall first of all build the wall across the whole southern border
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:48.320]  and then the landowners that don't want the wall in their land you say okay fine you won't get the
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:53.520]  wall guess where all of the illegal immigrant trafficking is going to start happening ladies
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:59.040]  and gentlemen it's going to happen on the landowners that refuse the wall and guess who's
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:05.760]  going to make the biggest fuss about that when it happens the very landowners that rejected the wall
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:11.440]  so they have so once that situation plays itself out they just teed the ball up for
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:18.560]  trump to say see i told you so in triplicate and that's exactly what will happen but first you have
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:25.440]  to get the wall and trump is going to declare a national emergency to do so it's just a matter of
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:32.480]  time number of six from washington times number of sick kids sores at border
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:37.840]  tuberculosis flu infections land migrants in hospitals and then we pay for it
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:45.440]  but the disease spreads you've got outbreak of tb in the united states in the last three years
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:50.640]  in fact i i wonder if there's a line graph of that that could show how much it's really just
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.600]  skyrocketed tb and that's you know 100 because of the wide open borders tbs coming from central
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:02.160]  america from bright part or hey ramos border wall symbol of hate and racism for those who
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:06.320]  want to make america wide again so there's your propaganda coming from the anti american globalist
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:13.440]  again coming from the anti white racist again no mexico has a wall on its southern border
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:19.600]  that's what i'm saying like how does this guy i can't even i just or a ramos knows mexico has
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:23.920]  a wall on the southern border or a ramos probably has a wall you know blocking his his million
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:29.040]  dollar mansion from the from the peons of society so why is he such a lying fraud

[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:44.000]  the full thing i'm not sure if this is proving me right or wrong uh okay so yeah so foreign born

[02:47:55.440 --> 02:48:01.120]  stuff and so there's all kinds of stuff already out there but let's focus on this article and the
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:06.560]  crew is going to pull up other stories with democrat top staffers getting arrested for child porn you
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:11.520]  got all these pizza managers kidnapping kids getting arrested for child porn of course you
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:15.760]  have the wiki leaks talking about having young children in the hot tub for your entertainment
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:20.720]  the pizza related handkerchiefs the maps the dominoes on pizza all the pedophile code language
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:25.040]  but let's just go to this article from the huffington post today and i read directly
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:31.920]  masturbation is a really important part of human sexuality it informs our individual
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:38.640]  conceptions of autonomy pleasure identity and intimacy said sex educator teacher kim kaval
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:43.040]  on the huffington post trying to discourage shame or eliminate it does young people a
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:49.280]  tremendous disservice instead of seeing it as a problem to solve think of it as an opportunity
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:56.400]  to teach skills and concepts that empower young people to grow into sexually healthy adults
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:03.680]  i mean do i even have to get into the hyperbole of that statement an opportunity to teach sex
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:10.480]  skills and concepts to children and that's going to make them sexually healthy adults
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:19.440]  i go on sex educator lydia em bowers said we should also be talking about pleasure in
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:26.160]  non-sexual ways i like how the wind feels on my face the color purple makes me feel happy
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:30.240]  so children develop both language and the knowledge that feeling good isn't something to
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:37.040]  be ashamed of so so they're now comparing masturbation or sexual pleasure to the wind going through
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:44.240]  your hair kaval recommended talking to children about self-touching before the onset of puberty
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.520]  which typically starts at nine to 16 years old for many parents the conversation arises much
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:56.400]  earlier on because their children start to explore their bodies at a very young age do you see how
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:09.280]  sick this is children exploring their bodies teach your children about self-touching before puberty
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:18.960]  these are sick people i go on though we associate masturbation most commonly with teenagers
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:25.520]  infantile masturbation is also very common for children between the ages of one to five
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:34.080]  five what many small children touch their genitals as a form of self soothing much like
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:40.960]  thumb sucking kaval said masturbation at any age is not dirty shameful or illicit in fact
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:46.560]  it's a perfectly normal and healthy behavior for people to engage in this is so sick so
[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:54.560]  a child touches themselves and you call it masturbation you're a sick freak you're a sexual
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:51:02.480]  deviant you're probably a pedophile like i can't even believe this like do i really have to lay
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:10.080]  this out for you people don't masturbate i mean like what people masturbate for sexual pleasure
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:15.040]  and here is these sex experts in huffington post saying oh no it's normal for your kid to masturbate
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:21.360]  let them masturbate in fact teach them how to masturbate what and the cruise just pulling up
[02:51:21.360 --> 02:51:25.840]  all these leftist videos huffington post other crap yeah they just want to sexualize your kids
[02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:29.920]  devon the amazing they take them to gay clubs they throw money at them you know you know what i'm
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:36.960]  not even gonna say it folks in fact you you wouldn't even believe what's actually going
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:43.440]  going on behind the scenes with devon the amazing you wouldn't even believe it and i'm not going to
[02:51:43.440 --> 02:51:51.840]  talk about it right now but you but you will learn very shortly what's really behind it and it's
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:58.720]  it's sicker than you could ever imagine i go on from the huffington post that tells you to
[02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:03.920]  teach your children how to masturbate before the age of five and says it's normal masturbation at
[02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:08.800]  oh i'm sorry i already read that excuse me it's crucial for parents and caregivers to normalize
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:15.040]  masturbation by talking about it in a shame free way particularly if their child has already started
[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:24.560]  exploring self-touch discussed scolding and rejection do not help children learn lessons and in fact
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:32.480]  can grow into internalized shame and self-loathing later in life yeah good you should feel shame when
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:40.240]  you masturbate you should feel shame when you watch porn to masturbate duh like i mean that's
[02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:48.000]  that's the whole thing but they want to erase that from your children they want your children to

[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:14.560]  shame after parents have communicated that self-touch is normal and natural they can
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:18.880]  establish that it's also private this is particularly important for young children who
[02:53:18.880 --> 02:53:28.640]  may rub against objects like pillows furniture or toys i'm vomiting they're literally sitting here
[02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:34.960]  sexualizing children getting off on how children rub themselves against toys and and furniture this

[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:58.800]  something people do in private or in a safe space other people can't see then offer to take the child
[02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:03.120]  to their nearest private space and say here's a private space for you to touch your penis vulva
[02:54:03.120 --> 02:54:07.840]  anus you can be private in here anytime you want folks i'm just reading from the huffing to post
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:15.520]  article that's all i'm doing now let me bring it home because here's the real conclusion that they
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:21.680]  want reached parents sometimes worry that masturbation may be a sign of sexual abuse
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:26.320]  unless there are other concerns or red flags involved it is often not a cause
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:36.480]  here is what this article has just told people children are masturbating it's a good thing
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:43.360]  you should let them do it and you should begin teaching them about how to masturbate at the age
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:54.800]  of one now this is all in huffington post article but what is this actually doing this is creating
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:06.160]  a excuse really or it's creating an out it's creating a scenario where pedophiles are going to
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:12.960]  get away with sexually abusing their children and they're just going to say oh i was just
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:19.840]  teaching them how to masturbate it's a good thing read the article for yourself i just read it for
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:25.040]  you teach your kids how to masturbate here's the videos this is shocking this is the crew i just
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:29.120]  told the crew i was like hey pull up any stories videos there's videos they're showing kids how to
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:38.480]  jack off a dildo let me tell you something let me tell you something in a in a society that has any
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:44.720]  common sense in a society that has any men left in it anybody pushing the sexualization of children
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:57.120]  would get a nice hello but no not here it's considered normal to teach your infant how
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:02.400]  to masturbate and now the huffington post tells you and others the cut this is all over the place
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:10.720]  salon teach your infant how to masturbate it's all a grooming process to bring pedophilia
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:18.080]  into the world and normalize it so it starts here oh pedophile that's just a sexual preference
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:22.160]  oh that kid dressed as drag that's liberal that's loving we're taking him to gay clubs
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:28.160]  because we're tolerant liberals oh yeah mm-hmm there's something else behind that but now they say
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:34.640]  oh teach your kid how to masturbate take your kid to a private area and show them how to jack off
[02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:42.320]  and everything and touch their anus again this is from the huffington post and so then what happens
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:47.600]  some some pedophile they just arrested a foster care parent tell doctor pedophile i'm not trying
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:53.200]  to demonize foster care that just happened so but now some pedophile will come up and they'll get
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:59.520]  caught in the bathroom jacking off an infant and they'll say oh i was just teaching them how to
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:07.280]  masturbate no you're a pedophile you're a sexual deviant using the left's excuses that they gave

[03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:30.320]  the norm people love you and you win and when your son looks at you and says mama look you won
[03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:35.440]  bullies don't win and i said baby they don't because we're gonna go in there we're gonna impeach some
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:42.560]  other judicial watch has been sounding that alarm for some time now exposing the fact that your
[03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:49.840]  tax dollars are supporting your own demise george sorris's open society foundation's efforts to
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:56.480]  subvert the populism and anti-globalism sweeping the united states with marxist division and
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:01:04.160]  unyielding self-loathing should ring alarm bells from sea to shining sea judicial watch stated sorris
[03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:09.920]  with the help of american taxpayer dollars bolsters a radical left-wing agenda that in the united
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:15.120]  states has included promoting an open border with mexico and fighting immigration enforcement
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:21.840]  efforts fomenting racial disharmony by funding anti-capitalist racialist organizations financing
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:26.640]  the black lives matter movement and other organizations involved in the riots in furgus
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:33.040]  in missouri weakening the integrity of our electoral systems promoting taxpayer-funded
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:39.360]  abortion on demand advocating a government-run health care system opposing us counterterrorism
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:45.680]  efforts promoting dubious transnational climate change agreements that threaten american sovereignty
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:52.480]  and working to advance gun control and erode second amendment protections sorris moved last year
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:57.680]  about 18 billion dollars of his personal wealth into open society foundation that funds their
[03:01:57.680 --> 03:02:02.640]  kind of their overhead and overall operations right open society foundation and all of its
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:08.240]  affiliates and subsidiaries is very smart they know how to pick the lock on the us treasury
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:14.320]  and so they go to the state department they go to the usa id and they apply for grants and funding
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:21.600]  for programs activities older sort of pet rock stuff and they're the our state department and
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:27.200]  usa id is stupid enough to actually give them grants sometimes they're small sometimes it's
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:32.720]  10 or 20 thousand dollars but sometimes it's hundreds of millions of dollars and they essentially
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:39.200]  outsource our foreign policy to sorrows front groups now as i said george sorrows is a billionaire
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:49.280]  his groups don't need tax dollars to do their work advancing their left-wing agenda don't you
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:58.000]  think and we're also exposing that usa id and state department are funding these far-left groups
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:09.200]  to undermine the non-progressive or non-liberal or non-socialist policies of governments abroad
[03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:16.160]  add to sorrows is blatant subversion that of the washington post the jeff bezos run paper
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:22.960]  has had a distance itself from the kashogi katari propaganda debacle only to step in its own pile
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:29.280]  of disinformation yet again as the conservative review reported less than two months after he was
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:35.280]  given prominent op-ed space in the washington post a video has surfaced of hoothy rebel leader
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:41.840]  mohammed ali al-hoofi launching a shoulder fired missile and then reciting the hoofi slogan which
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:48.960]  calls for death to america whether it's the forced acceptance of pedophilia or the domination of our
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:55.280]  political landscape by foreign interests the moral and rational code of the united states is taking a
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:04:01.840]  severe beating we have no other choice but to prosecute and reject this invasion of intended
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:08.400]  mental illness spearheaded by enemies of our republic like george sorrows or find ourselves
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:24.320]  morphing into the madness as our nation enters the point of no return john bound reporting
[03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:40.240]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[03:04:40.240 --> 03:04:58.240]  the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:03.600]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers iq it literally
[03:05:04.240 --> 03:05:08.880]  dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[03:05:08.880 --> 03:05:14.880]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[03:05:14.880 --> 03:05:19.280]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[03:05:19.280 --> 03:05:24.640]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:30.640]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[03:05:30.640 --> 03:05:35.840]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:42.320]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges
[03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:48.640]  it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see
[03:05:48.640 --> 03:06:00.720]  it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's live dot com
[03:06:00.720 --> 03:06:03.600]  so
[03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:10.400]  through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones and now your host
[03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:19.120]  and welcome to this edition of info wars info wars dot com doug hagman
[03:06:19.120 --> 03:06:24.960]  joe hagman sitting in for alex jones and of course we've got so much to cover as usual it's
[03:06:24.960 --> 03:06:31.280]  never a slow news day that's uh that's to be sure you know everyone's talking about uh well
[03:06:32.480 --> 03:06:37.680]  we've got about five or six different battlefronts i i suppose we as patriots the patriots here in the
[03:06:37.680 --> 03:06:45.360]  united states are under assault we're under attack constantly um donald trump of course is the uh is
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:51.360]  the only stop gap between the globalists the agenda the globalists and the american people
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:56.240]  and we thank him for that and as we look back over the time here that we've seen
[03:06:57.600 --> 03:07:04.480]  here since donald trump was play uh was elected into office we're looking at day number 721 of
[03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:11.280]  the donald j trump presidency today dates 721 721 days in office and i would say based on
[03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:15.280]  the entirety of the accomplishments that you'll never hear about they've been stream media
[03:07:15.280 --> 03:07:20.240]  he has accomplished more in those 721 days and specifically the first 500 days in the other
[03:07:20.240 --> 03:07:25.360]  president america let's never forget that there will be detractors there there will be people who
[03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:31.120]  are saying look he's uh he's selling out well that's not true and if you believe that you're
[03:07:31.120 --> 03:07:38.240]  believing a lie this is also day number 604 for those keeping track at home uh of the special
[03:07:38.240 --> 03:07:45.280]  council investigation by robert meuller compliments of a recused jeff sessions from the uh the attorney
[03:07:45.280 --> 03:07:50.800]  general's office as well as rod rozenstein and of course comey so kind of putting it they
[03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:56.400]  putting things in perspective looking back during his campaign in the first 500 days
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:08:02.720]  where did he run on of course ran on strong borders strong economy hey look at the economy look at
[03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:08.960]  the economic numbers the economic growth tremendous yet there is a fight taking place obviously
[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:17.120]  and part of that fight involves the fed involves interest rate hikes involves the issues that of
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:24.400]  course would take uh donald trump's at the president trump that is his his wins and of course
[03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:31.200]  cause certain things to go sideways because of fed rate hikes and and such so you've got a bunch
[03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:36.960]  of globalists fighting against president donald trump but again look at this in the context of
[03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:44.880]  721 days in the office 604 under the direct assault of the globalist meuller regime unfettered
[03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:53.520]  just a tremendous illegal attack and attacks all the time now to among the battle fronts
[03:08:53.520 --> 03:08:58.240]  that we the people face and among the battle fronts that president trump is fighting on our
[03:08:58.240 --> 03:09:03.360]  behalf he's the commander in chief our commander in chief among things he's doing of course he's
[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:09.520]  calling out the democratic socialists on the border and you've heard oan and others talk about the
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:16.160]  bore border situation and and uh oath keepers steward rhodes great friend of the show by the
[03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:22.800]  way and for those who don't know me or my son uh we have a show it's called the hagman report we
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:29.040]  broadcast live seven to ten weeknights our home basis hagman report dot com that's hagman two ends
[03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:34.640]  hagman report dot com and we thank you for tuning in and of course go to hagman report
[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:39.440]  dot com for all of our all of the information about us but having said all of that one thing
[03:09:39.440 --> 03:09:45.680]  that really that that really caught our attention and i want to make sure that everyone really
[03:09:45.680 --> 03:09:52.240]  understands this situation because it's being misconstrued in the media it's being misconstrued
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:10:00.160]  and deliberately uh amunged by many on social networking and that's what i heard earlier oan
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:06.000]  was talking about this and uh it looks like obama looks like uh president donald trump will have to
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:12.960]  resort to declaring a national emergency with respect to the border crisis because we do have
[03:10:12.960 --> 03:10:19.680]  a crisis on the border but let me let me get some facts straight about these national emergencies
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:25.200]  and about a what a national emergency is because you hear a lot about you hear a lot about this
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:32.320]  but how many people really understand what a national emergency is what it does and the history
[03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:36.400]  of it and you might think well that's just it's boring and it really doesn't matter oh it doesn't
[03:10:36.400 --> 03:10:47.280]  matter because the um the national uh national uh emergencies act of 1974 is really what applies
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:53.600]  here and that was really done that was a law under president ford signed into law by president ford
[03:10:54.160 --> 03:11:03.360]  under that specific congress to rein in the powers of the presidency however having done that uh it
[03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:09.760]  also granted or further delineated or more specifically delineated the powers to our chief
[03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:14.800]  executive that being in this case president donald trump but when you look historically
[03:11:14.800 --> 03:11:20.240]  at this act uh currently and i don't know how many people know this i'm not sure how many
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:27.840]  if this was gone over but you have right now as as i speak 31 different ongoing national
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:34.880]  emergencies the first and oldest emergency took place under president carter back in 1979
[03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:42.000]  during the iran crisis or the iran hostage situation and that was one of two one of two
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:50.880]  declared by president carter next you have of the 31 you had uh uh or including the 31 you had
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:55.360]  president reagan who declared a total of six national emergencies during his time in office
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:12:01.600]  president george hw bush poppy bush declared four and then all of a sudden what do we see
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:08.240]  bill clinton as a member of the democratic party and of course the uh uh cuckoo i'm sorry the uh
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:15.040]  uh the the husband of hillary clinton i almost said something different uh the subservient member
[03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:20.720]  of the clinton family uh under bill clinton you had 17 national emergencies six of which are still
[03:12:20.720 --> 03:12:29.360]  intact or in effect moving to george w bush of course 9 11 happened george w bush instituted
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:36.640]  12 national emergencies under his reign 10 are still in effect and obama second only really to
[03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:44.800]  bill clinton a he declared 13 national emergencies seven are still in effect so when the lunatic
[03:12:44.800 --> 03:12:50.160]  liberals out there when these when these uh uh specified individuals out there talk about the
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:55.680]  national security act and it's it's uh not for presidents or the president can't do this with
[03:12:55.680 --> 03:13:02.320]  respect to the immigration and national naturalization act well they're full of it and i don't care if
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:09.360]  it's uh if it's the leftist from cnn the fake news members of the cnn uh group or whatever mainstream
[03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:14.560]  mediality listen to or even the political pundits including but not limited in the volatile on
[03:13:14.560 --> 03:13:20.880]  fox news the bottom line is he has every single right to to declare a national emergency as well
[03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:28.160]  he should in this case because we are looking at um again this is a humanitarian crisis but
[03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:35.200]  the humanitarian crisis was a manufactured or is a manufactured crisis it's manufactured by
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:40.320]  the globalists manufactured by the people who worship at the altar in the feet of george
[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:47.680]  soros who worship at the altar of the obamas and clinton's and such so as soon as people understand
[03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:55.440]  that we are all being gained that these people have created this situation along with the
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:14:02.480]  uniparty and when i refer to democrats and republicans as i do i don't want to continue
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:08.480]  to have to have disclaimers that republicans of course and democrats are of the same really
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:13.120]  the same party in essence with few exceptions they're members of the uniparty they're all
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:20.640]  globalist for the most part but it is because of their inaction over the years or action
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:29.520]  or delivered action that this has taken place we have signaled to foreign countries especially
[03:14:29.520 --> 03:14:34.720]  the south and central america as well as mexico hey our doors are open we don't want your finest
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:41.920]  brightest or whatever we want the people in this country to change the moral ethical and
[03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:47.760]  theological as well as the demographic makeup of our country and that's the intent all along
[03:14:47.760 --> 03:14:52.480]  is to take down the united states and of course this is one of five or six battlefields quickly

[03:17:56.800 --> 03:18:02.560]  it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[03:18:02.560 --> 03:18:09.120]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:15.680]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[03:18:15.680 --> 03:18:22.400]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:28.560]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:34.400]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:41.600]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[03:18:41.600 --> 03:18:47.760]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain
[03:18:47.760 --> 03:18:54.640]  water supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it we've taken
[03:18:54.640 --> 03:18:59.840]  thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and
[03:18:59.840 --> 03:19:04.480]  testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body

[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:45.200]  now before the before the break where i was talking about the wall and of course the border
[03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:51.920]  border security big news of course and president donald trump of course has the legal authority
[03:22:51.920 --> 03:22:59.760]  to declare a national emergency and specific to the immigration act of 1965 in that narrow ban
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:05.440]  i just before i cut the drill i want to i want to say one thing what i heard on cnn i believe
[03:23:05.440 --> 03:23:11.600]  it's attributed i believe it was cnn but i know it was attributed to uh jason johnson made me one
[03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:16.960]  of vomit in fact i think i threw up a little bit in my mouth when i heard this he stated and i quote
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:26.400]  quote the wall is a monument to white nationalism now how in the hell can and i'm asking this how
[03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:37.200]  what gall what unmitigated gall for for him or others to stand on the graves of children
[03:23:37.200 --> 03:23:44.800]  who have died crossing the border and say that this is a monument to white nationalism and if
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:53.120]  that's not good enough the others who have said and i'm referencing here in my notes those who support
[03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:59.920]  the wall are not sophisticated they're not that bright and they're racist that's how much the
[03:24:00.560 --> 03:24:06.160]  fake news media and of course you know that think of you but even more importantly that's how much
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:13.280]  the politicians the uniparty in washington think of you and it's sickening if you accept that
[03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:18.480]  joe is with me we're gonna be talking we've done so much so much in investigation on this joe i'm
[03:24:18.480 --> 03:24:24.400]  gonna kick it over to you i know i yeah first segment but i frankly i am really good just i
[03:24:24.400 --> 03:24:32.240]  am absolutely i'm done i'm done yeah we have people like ocasio we have people like uh the
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:37.040]  new senator new congressman ocasio court has suggesting illegal immigrants are more american
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:43.760]  than trump supporters and this is the liberal insanity being showcased by this 116th congress
[03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:49.440]  which is exactly what i expected to see and this congress is going to be a two-year reel
[03:24:49.440 --> 03:24:55.280]  for a donald trump 2020 reelection campaign and this wall and the immigration issue is front and
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:59.600]  center in this right now but there's a great piece from the hill yes trump has the authority to
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:04.560]  declare a national emergency for border wall and this article that is written by jonathan
[03:25:04.560 --> 03:25:10.560]  terley goes into a number of facts citing constitutional and other abilities that the
[03:25:10.560 --> 03:25:18.720]  president would be able to use under his authority to put the wall in place now what's very interesting
[03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:23.680]  about this these liberals who are those the schumars and the poloses who issued their response to
[03:25:23.680 --> 03:25:29.840]  trump's address to the nation which i want to talk about too if we have time this hour they
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:35.920]  issued this very silly uh disjointed response and the optics were terrible but an interesting fact
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:42.160]  democrats paid for a wall in jordan and listen to this uh you know chuck schumer he was one of the
[03:25:42.160 --> 03:25:49.520]  people who was sponsoring and signed this bill uh under brock obama funded a 287 mile wall border
[03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:54.160]  wall in jordan just last year but won't fund the border wall here in the united states because
[03:25:54.160 --> 03:26:00.640]  it's a moral according to nancy polosi but one year ago uh in the 2018 omnibus spending bill
[03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:05.120]  provides just enough funds to build 33 miles of fencing on the texas border but it also
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:10.240]  provides 500 million dollars to help jordan build the wall and defense line against jihad
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:16.960]  terrorists trying to cross its 287 mile border with iraq in syria so the omnibus budget says on
[03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:25.120]  page 394 section 9011 up to 500 million dollars of funds appropriated by this act for the defense
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:30.960]  security cooperation agency in operation maintenance defense-wide may use to provide
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:35.120]  assistance to the government of jordan to support armed forces of jordan and to enhance security
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:39.520]  along its borders democrats had no problem funding the wall in jordan and it was not
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:44.800]  an immoral wall then and now only 10 months and that was only 10 months ago uh that's a quote from
[03:26:44.800 --> 03:26:49.840]  jim hoff from the gateway pundit so uh even president trump went over to congress wednesday
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:55.760]  for a chat that uh deteriorated into uh him walking out in disgust because there is no
[03:26:55.760 --> 03:27:00.640]  negotiating uh apparently no more debates no more dialogues they have nothing to offer the
[03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:06.000]  democrats do have nothing to offer they refuse to add the funding they it was not even a lot of
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:10.320]  money we're talking five billion dollars we've given more aid to mexico and central america
[03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:15.920]  relative it okay we're talking five billion yeah it's not a lot of money relative to the budget
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:22.720]  okay i don't i don't have five right five billion dollars is a lot of money to me uh but yeah not
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:28.320]  to the uh when we're talking about a trillion dollar spending bills yeah but you got twiddle

[03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:46.320]  weeknight for our show but right now so important so many issues facing this country today the
[03:33:46.320 --> 03:33:51.360]  globalist you know alex says the globalists are on the run and it's interesting to watch the people
[03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:56.320]  freaking out say oh well no they're not on the run yes we've got them on the run it's because of
[03:33:56.320 --> 03:34:00.880]  info wars it's because of our show it's because of the people who are awake and who are telling
[03:34:00.880 --> 03:34:05.840]  other people out there that look this is the truth we're all getting gamed and it's them
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:12.720]  versus us it's really is that simple we've got enemies within the gate this is not hyperbole
[03:34:12.720 --> 03:34:18.080]  and this is not an overstatement but the fact is this we are right now in a civil war or not
[03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:24.560]  of our making and and i just i want to mention something i i um i just i you know i've said
[03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:30.400]  this so many times and i say this with a heavy heart but i ask you know what could be worse
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:36.480]  than the civil war because that would be horrific i suppose from an ideological standpoint maybe not
[03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:44.400]  having one if if there is a lack of any kind of uh congruity or if they see here's the problem
[03:34:44.400 --> 03:34:51.520]  the uh we are a country not arguing about the means or methods and think about this
[03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:59.360]  the divisiveness is the objectives it's not how to get to where we want to go where the
[03:34:59.360 --> 03:35:04.880]  division exists and please understand this in fact the professor i believe speaking in hillsdale
[03:35:04.880 --> 03:35:13.280]  college said this if we were a country who was divided over the methods of of fixing our country
[03:35:13.280 --> 03:35:19.760]  or creating our country if the division was how to that's workable but when we we are pulling
[03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:27.120]  in opposite directions with respect to the objectives of where we want to be is this going
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:34.880]  to be a communist socialist utopia is that what is that what this is going to be because it cannot
[03:35:34.880 --> 03:35:42.080]  exist in the constitutional republic so you've got on one side the red element and it's not a
[03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:50.240]  red wave as one would expect but it's a red as in communist crimson red and the objective is
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:55.760]  to get there by any means necessary the clappers and the brennans and the comies and the obamas
[03:35:55.760 --> 03:36:01.760]  and the rices and the lynches and you know the usual suspects and the clintons and on the other
[03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:14.640]  side it's us and and joe i know that we've talked about this border wall thing and the more i read
[03:36:14.640 --> 03:36:19.920]  into this the the the more i want to rip my own hair out watching polosi and schumer we mentioned
[03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:25.040]  trump's first oval office address to the nation which i gotta say i wish he would do more of
[03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:32.080]  of many things president trump does great one of the things that bugs me most about the president
[03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:37.760]  is not the fact that he does use social media a lot it's just he says a lot of things on there
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:42.960]  that he could go without saying but i like the idea of him sitting in front of the cameras
[03:36:42.960 --> 03:36:49.040]  and addressing the nation face to face as he did on tuesday now schumer and polosi
[03:36:49.040 --> 03:36:57.440]  uh issued a a response to that speech and they it was a joke and uh if you read that a piece of
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:02.800]  it was a pathetic it was and what was polosi's play if you heard and listened to what they said
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:06.960]  they laid out their own plan for border security what did they want to do oh they wanted to fix
[03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:13.440]  the roads and uh in ports of entries to make it easier for legal aliens to come in not addressing
[03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:19.600]  any kind of security in the areas where there are no fencing and are no borders and i mean it's just
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:24.880]  a joke and i have uh the transcript here which i'm not going to get into right now but um it
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:30.880]  unbelievably they uh as i said paid for the wall in jordan and trump does have the ability to use
[03:37:30.880 --> 03:37:35.600]  this constitutional under the constitution he has the power to declare a national emergency and get
[03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:41.120]  this done himself even though they are not willing and it will fight tooth and nail saying that it's
[03:37:41.120 --> 03:37:49.600]  unconstitutional but they want they the left uh they are refusing to acknowledge the severity of
[03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:54.480]  the problems of the southern border one it's a it's a humanitarian and security crisis and this
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:38:00.320]  is an article from npr fact checking trump's oval office pitch for a border wall and it's a joke
[03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:06.160]  obviously there there is no fact checking here that they are trying to spin their propaganda so
[03:38:06.160 --> 03:38:11.200]  they can uh you know promote their open border agenda but claim one humanitarian and security
[03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:14.640]  crisis there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border that's
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:19.520]  what president trump said well according to the fact checkers uh that's not true because the
[03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:26.080]  number of illegal aliens crossing is much lower than it was in 2016 or 2014 according to this
[03:38:26.080 --> 03:38:33.760]  article but that only is until september of 2018 but we've seen a huge surge since then of 60 000
[03:38:33.760 --> 03:38:38.400]  and uh both in october and november and yesterday we got the statistic that in december alone
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:45.840]  border patrol detained 29 518 illegal aliens crossing the border so yes this is a huge crisis
[03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:51.040]  i want to interrupt you here because you bring up an important point listen listen to this
[03:38:51.040 --> 03:38:56.800]  because the people that not caught at the border that got into the inside of this country outside
[03:38:56.800 --> 03:39:03.680]  of that 100 mile buffer zone around the uh around the coast and around the borders last year okay
[03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:10.720]  think about this because people are i mean this you've got to be absolutely out of your mind people
[03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:16.880]  if this is okay with you and the Pelosi's and the Schumer's and the fact checkers and the garbage
[03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:23.200]  in my view in my personal opinion now the garbage you know these uh right wing watch and the uh
[03:39:23.200 --> 03:39:29.680]  whatever whatever else kind of kind of uh pull the fact and all these these these garbage places
[03:39:29.680 --> 03:39:35.680]  again in my view that that attempt to massage the facts when in fact we're right now we are
[03:39:35.680 --> 03:39:42.400]  averaging 60 000 illegal and indomitable aliens per month on our southern border alone and that
[03:39:42.400 --> 03:39:48.160]  does not necessarily count uh they're not all counted there that's what we know of and guess
[03:39:48.160 --> 03:39:55.920]  what uh in last year well i'm sorry fiscal year 2017 and 2018 ice officers arrested
[03:39:55.920 --> 03:40:02.000]  approximately a quarter of a million illegal aliens on various criminal charges or convictions
[03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:08.080]  within the interior of the united states these are people who got in who went to 100 plus miles
[03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:14.240]  who are they live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Omaha, Nebraska, Cincinnati, Ohio or wherever think
[03:40:14.240 --> 03:40:21.680]  about that and by the way that includes over 100 000 for assault 30 000 for rape and sex crimes
[03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:28.240]  and another 4 000 for for homicides so there there's your fact checking yeah and uh you know
[03:40:28.240 --> 03:40:34.240]  that there the democrats in the left in the media are trying to downplay the uh the the true dangers
[03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:39.840]  of having these open borders one of the claims here in this npr article is about illegal drugs
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:44.160]  and and this is what the president said our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities
[03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:49.360]  of illegal drugs my administration has presented congress with a detailed proposal to secure the
[03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:54.480]  border to stop criminal gangs drugs smugglers and human traffickers it's a tremendous problem
[03:40:54.480 --> 03:41:00.880]  what did the npr say fact check according to the dea most illegal drugs imported to the u.s from
[03:41:00.880 --> 03:41:05.840]  mexico are smuggled through legal ports of entry only a very small fraction comes from the parts
[03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:11.600]  of the border that would be covered by the wall how do they know how do they know they get that
[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:17.040]  did they get that by watching the the he runs a border security episodes remember it's a joke
[03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:21.760]  i mean this is there's no way to substantiate it they have no idea what they're talking about
[03:41:21.760 --> 03:41:27.520]  and i'm sure much of the many drugs come through legal ports of entry but equally or more come
[03:41:27.520 --> 03:41:35.120]  through uh open areas that don't have any security uh sometimes and i know this from watching the uh
[03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:40.800]  documentaries and then shows like narcos you know they'll set up a shipment to be caught well you
[03:41:40.800 --> 03:41:46.160]  know of let's say uh uh you know five pounds of cocaine while they have a thousand pounds you know
[03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:52.240]  going in the other way so uh it the the there is no downside to having the wall but the left
[03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:57.360]  wants to make this an issue about civil rights about immorality the wall is immoral and that
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:02.160]  makes no sense whatsoever what's immoral are these politicians who are selling out their country in
[03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:08.320]  order to gain votes and add to their democratic base by giving a legal alien special privileges
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:13.200]  which hurts people who have come here legally we've interviewed uh just recently angel moms of
[03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:20.320]  bean dirton who lost her son to a an illegal immigrant in a hit-and-run drunk driving accident
[03:42:20.320 --> 03:42:27.920]  the illegal immigrant was already out on bail for a previous dui and after uh he was caught
[03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:33.360]  he was released on five thousand dollars bail and he fled the country and these illegal aliens
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:39.280]  seem to be getting more rights it's right yeah but he lied to the courts and he there's nothing

[03:47:54.160 --> 03:48:01.200]  get back into the uh into the really the issues at hand i saw a story this was published two days
[03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:07.600]  ago and uh oh and earlier was talking and by the way we met oh and and brentson had a great time
[03:48:07.600 --> 03:48:17.120]  with the oh and sure brenton missouri yeah fantastic fantastic asset to the uh to info wars to um
[03:48:17.120 --> 03:48:22.560]  to really to the movement but anyway uh i saw the story and i know oh and was talking about toxic
[03:48:22.560 --> 03:48:30.080]  masculinity and it amazes me because i look i'm an old guy all right i'm i'm an old guy i'm
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:36.960]  you know i'm not i'm honest i've been around the block a few times but when i was growing up
[03:48:36.960 --> 03:48:43.040]  here's the deal in my science class we were taught there were two genders two sexes whatever you want
[03:48:43.040 --> 03:48:49.760]  to call them a male and female uh real simple there's no i mean there's some scientific
[03:48:49.760 --> 03:48:58.080]  and now anomalies we i understand that i get that but now with the uh of course the the
[03:48:58.080 --> 03:49:05.120]  special classes being created for the purposes of what for division and throwing a good measure of
[03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:12.560]  toxic masculinity what are we seeing we're seeing the lack of men and i'm talking and i would i dare
[03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:20.960]  say this to the women out there look the some of the brightest people i know most intelligence
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:26.000]  people i intelligent people i know are women and i'm a kind of i'm the kind of guy who i believe
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:31.280]  i should open the door for a woman i believe i should uh um pull a cheer out for a woman take
[03:49:31.280 --> 03:49:36.480]  a woman's coat because frankly i believe women should be on pedestals i think that they do a lot
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:43.840]  for guys us guys i know my wife does and i appreciate that and and i think women
[03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:51.200]  appreciate strong guys right am i right women ladies am i right i don't know i i think so
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:58.320]  of course then you've got the other i don't know what you would call them in my life i know what i
[03:49:58.320 --> 03:50:05.040]  call them they're delusional where um they believe of course any kind of actions like that that's
[03:50:05.040 --> 03:50:10.720]  that's that's an affront to their whatever and to me that's just a bunch of bs but the fact of the
[03:50:10.720 --> 03:50:16.880]  matter is uh there's a bunch of soy boys running around here and in for a lot of reasons but i
[03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:25.440]  saw a story mother of arm robber shot dead by defending his children the bottom line story is
[03:50:25.440 --> 03:50:31.680]  us folks did you see this all right uh a guy a young man a 19 year old guy entered a Popeyes
[03:50:31.680 --> 03:50:39.200]  restaurant in san antonio last month pointed a gun at the customer's children that customer
[03:50:39.760 --> 03:50:49.760]  licensed to conceal carry shot the gunman dead now mom of the 19 year old the deceased 19 year old
[03:50:49.760 --> 03:50:56.480]  gunman that you got the picture right now the mother of the deceased 19 year old gunman is asking
[03:50:56.480 --> 03:51:04.080]  why the father who fairly shot her son chose to fire more than once Cynthia Ruiz said that her
[03:51:04.080 --> 03:51:09.600]  son anthony hurrah hurrah hurrah i don't know how to pronounce it i guess it's hurrah hurrah
[03:51:09.600 --> 03:51:16.720]  i guess pardon me i don't mean to be offensive um deserve to be punished yeah he deserved to be
[03:51:16.720 --> 03:51:25.200]  punished because after all he's holding the gun to this gentleman's kids um but uh while defending
[03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:31.600]  his family she admits that but she said why shoot him more for four more times so why did he shoot
[03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:38.000]  him five times all right i know the capacity of my magazine and i guarantee you someone holding
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:44.560]  the gun on my kids that that that magazine is going to be empty and i'm going to be looking to reload
[03:51:45.680 --> 03:51:51.760]  i think the wrong questions are being asked here and i think that this is a perfect example this
[03:51:51.760 --> 03:52:00.880]  is exhibit a look i i feel i feel i look i feel bad for mom i i as a parent i would never want to see
[03:52:00.880 --> 03:52:06.240]  i would never want to see any of my children harmed or hurt killed whether in the you know
[03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:14.400]  whether it's a legitimate uh killed situation or not so i i have a i feel for that that that
[03:52:14.400 --> 03:52:22.080]  parents but i think through all of his talk as oan had said before the toxic masculinity and
[03:52:22.080 --> 03:52:31.280]  making being a man and being protective of one's family making it almost a crime yeah and this is
[03:52:31.280 --> 03:52:36.480]  what we get so i wanted to make sure i covered that they're they're demonizing this and we
[03:52:36.480 --> 03:52:41.920]  covered this on the show yesterday the article on fox news toxic masculinity uh you know is the
[03:52:41.920 --> 03:52:48.000]  problem for all the world's violence and it adds to competitiveness and aggression things that men
[03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:53.760]  are supposed to have and they are are demonizing this meanwhile they were pushing perversion on
[03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:58.960]  children telling them they're able to be you know be a a sex other than what they were born with
[03:52:58.960 --> 03:53:05.600]  and any kind of attempt to you know rehabilitate that mindset is now a crime in california but
[03:53:05.600 --> 03:53:11.200]  you know here that they're saying men who are actual men who have testosterone that is the real
[03:53:11.200 --> 03:53:16.320]  problem and this is just the liberal lunacy uh being showcased front and center i want to make
[03:53:16.320 --> 03:53:21.840]  sure we come by the way by the way you lack testosterone go to info wars store.com and stock
[03:53:21.840 --> 03:53:29.520]  up it's male my super male vitality it's right sorry i had to do that right an important story
[03:53:30.080 --> 03:53:35.360]  we uh saw ruth bader ginsberg this week she was not on the bench for the first time in 25 years
[03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:40.880]  was not in the chambers to hear arguments on a number of cases instead she was receiving
[03:53:40.880 --> 03:53:45.840]  transcripts and working from home but an interesting article from politico today
[03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:51.680]  trump white house urging allies to prepare for possible departure of ruth bader ginsberg
[03:53:51.680 --> 03:53:55.600]  after an ailing supreme court justice ginsberg missed oral arguments that trump team began
[03:53:55.600 --> 03:54:00.080]  to early groundwork for another presidential confirmation battle or potential confirmation
[03:54:00.080 --> 03:54:04.480]  battle and folks pay attention to this because obviously ruth bader ginsberg has had a number
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:10.080]  of serious health related issues over the past few years she's 85 years old i believe and she
[03:54:10.080 --> 03:54:15.440]  had recently fallen and broken some ribs she also had a cancerous growth removed from her neck twice
[03:54:15.440 --> 03:54:24.080]  now uh in the last 10 years and when the cavanaugh confirmation uh happened and i saw her uh there
[03:54:24.080 --> 03:54:28.400]  she looked and reminded me of my grandma in the very last years of her life i lived with my grandma
[03:54:28.400 --> 03:54:34.000]  took care of her uh while she was sick and passed away and ruth bader ginsberg looks very similar
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:39.680]  to that very frail very weak almost anemic looking uh and people who've taken care of elderly relatives
[03:54:39.680 --> 03:54:46.160]  who have passed away no one i'm talking about you see that i am sorry look i i i know go for it but
[03:54:46.160 --> 03:54:51.120]  but some but some but sometimes you gotta know when it's time to hang it up okay i mean seriously
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:59.200]  even if she was dead say she was dead what i mean these people are not going to allow president
[03:54:59.200 --> 03:55:06.080]  trump to have another pick before 2020 and how they get away with that i don't know but i mean
[03:55:06.080 --> 03:55:10.480]  people are speculating oh yeah she's dead and they're just high i mean that's a very real chance i
[03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:15.360]  don't know i mean would that be illegal maybe but uh they're going to do everything in their power
[03:55:15.360 --> 03:55:20.960]  to make sure that trump is not going to another pick before uh the 2020 election i gotta tell you i
[03:55:20.960 --> 03:55:26.160]  think that's going to be the one of the few's flash points in this powder keg that we're looking at
[03:55:26.160 --> 03:55:32.960]  the election of not mary garland uh to a supreme court after ruth bader ginsberg you know does kind
[03:55:32.960 --> 03:55:40.960]  of uh you know his declare is called so uh old ruthy there and it's rough when you mix
[03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:46.320]  botox with a modeling fluid i you know mix get that mixed up but uh again we wish you i wish
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:52.320]  you're the best uh but but for crying out loud of course you know i mean enough's enough but go on
[03:55:52.320 --> 03:55:58.320]  joe uh we we got about a minute no that's just um that's something i am keeping my eye on as uh you
[03:55:58.320 --> 03:56:03.600]  know as just on the screen you saw her with her head down uh you know falling asleep and she's
[03:56:03.600 --> 03:56:09.040]  also uh tried to say she was intoxicated a few times there uh when you know when she was on the
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:13.840]  bench or whatever and she but she just does not look good she does not look healthy and i don't
[03:56:13.840 --> 03:56:19.440]  think she has long but how long can the left hide it how long can they prop her up and make it so
[03:56:19.440 --> 03:56:25.280]  they don't have to turn that they're they're using her so you see they don't they don't care about
[03:56:25.280 --> 03:56:31.280]  her they're using her it's all politics to them they don't give a damn about her her health or
[03:56:31.280 --> 03:56:38.080]  the humanity behind this they're using her and people on the left can't see it sorry i didn't
[03:56:38.080 --> 03:56:44.240]  mean to interject no no uh we only got about one minute left uh but still so much going on in the
[03:56:44.240 --> 03:56:50.960]  world of news i'm focused on uh looking to see who they plan on running in 2020 uh as far as a
[03:56:50.960 --> 03:56:56.320]  presidential contender against trump that them on the democratic side we see a lot of uh polling
[03:56:56.320 --> 03:57:02.240]  and and uh people are trying to throw their hat in the ring they're uh iowa the uh who was a beto
[03:57:02.240 --> 03:57:08.720]  roark um is is like you know in iowa getting stuff done bernie sanders approval in senate uh
[03:57:08.720 --> 03:57:14.320]  they're saying that bernie sanders basically he's not going to be uh a factor in this next election
[03:57:14.320 --> 03:57:20.000]  they're running uh people like elizabeth warn and joe biden's but who was a democrats put together
