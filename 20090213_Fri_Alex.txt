[00:00.000 --> 00:11.500]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.500 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:27.720]  Texas Alex Jones what's happening is the ambient background noise of
[00:27.720 --> 00:32.000]  tyranny is just being incrementally turned up but now they're turning it up
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.160]  faster and faster the other classic analogy is you have a pot of cold water
[00:38.160 --> 00:44.280]  if you put a frog in it it'll sit there happily believing it's safe in the water
[00:44.280 --> 00:50.200]  from you walking around the stove and if you turn the heat up on low if it's
[00:50.200 --> 00:55.920]  slowly heats up and I've talked to folks in Louisiana Mississippi that eat
[00:55.920 --> 01:02.440]  frogs actually had frogs legs that it's a really true if you put a bull frog or
[01:02.440 --> 01:10.400]  something else in a pot of water and slowly turn it up that it will sit there
[01:10.400 --> 01:17.480]  until it dies and I'm even being conditioned to accept this I see articles
[01:17.480 --> 01:20.960]  every few days about how they're trying to make elderly and prisoners and
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.720]  government officials and military take microchips not just in the United States
[01:25.720 --> 01:32.600]  but all over the world and I don't even cover them and the psych warfare chiefs
[01:32.600 --> 01:36.960]  know that they know that back 10 12 13 years ago when it was just in government
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.240]  documents we would freak out and say wow look they're planning to do this and
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.040]  here's how they're gonna push it through fads and security and all these other
[01:45.040 --> 01:48.960]  ways and people would laugh at us but now that it's just on the news for the
[01:48.960 --> 01:53.480]  last seven eight years constantly it's kind of like oh yeah and the head of
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.120]  Sega says we'll all be getting chips you want to play the game you're gonna take
[01:57.120 --> 02:02.400]  a chip oh yeah you know I play a bunch of video games where you're augmented
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.760]  with chips see they think as they play a video game that means that it's the
[02:06.760 --> 02:14.880]  same as being augmented with chips or we've all seen the matrix and now I
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.520]  just look at the news headlines on info wars.com right before I went live I was
[02:18.520 --> 02:23.800]  looking at them and I was going they're gonna charge us per flush of the toilet
[02:23.800 --> 02:29.200]  with government smart monitors on the toilets and if you don't think that
[02:29.200 --> 02:32.840]  that's not gonna happen I remember three years ago reading about some cities in
[02:32.840 --> 02:37.360]  California making residents take
[02:38.400 --> 02:43.560]  smart thermostats in their house
[02:43.560 --> 02:52.200]  and then guess what Tim who works here in the office walks up to me and says
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.040]  hey this just came in the mail city of Austin is coming next week to the
[02:56.040 --> 03:02.040]  office to put in remote control thermostats and it said you know smart
[03:02.040 --> 03:08.160]  thermostats on the flyer and I went and looked it up on the city of Austin and
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.120]  sure enough they're gonna control the thermostat in my office and it says oh
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.120]  there's a power shortage or something they'll just go ahead and you know turn
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.240]  things off and then they already admit in Europe and Canada and California where
[03:22.240 --> 03:26.000]  they've implemented this that they just when they feel like it say oh you don't
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.520]  need to have your office 76 we're gonna set it at 80 and all you don't you don't
[03:32.520 --> 03:37.640]  get health care you know once you're 55 then you have to go ahead and go blind
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.520]  or die of liver disease or not get that brain surgery that is in the new bill
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.000]  Tom Daschle that authored it wrote that in a book I mean there it's not us
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.520]  saying this they're saying it a decade ago they would deny that now they just
[03:52.520 --> 04:00.920]  admit it total micromanagement total control over every little facet of our
[04:00.920 --> 04:07.600]  lives shutting down the farms and ranches regulating everything and the
[04:07.600 --> 04:14.800]  examples go on and on and on and on tell you about all the informative guests
[04:14.800 --> 04:22.320]  we've got coming up after the break and then we'll get into his FEMA and DHS
[04:22.320 --> 04:26.560]  preparing for mass graves in Marshall law near Chicago from the Daily Newscaster
[04:26.560 --> 04:32.080]  DH Williams I want to get him on I know this is a true report because
[04:32.080 --> 04:36.680]  everything in it checks out with what I've already researched and there's a
[04:36.680 --> 04:44.240]  mass graves comment in here so we'll go over that Obama's energy secretaries
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.880]  just get ready for the carbon tax it's in the New York Times all these years
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.240]  they said there's no plan for carbon tax and now it's like of course we've got
[04:52.240 --> 04:57.640]  tax everything you do you're not against Obama or you're not a racist I mean
[04:57.640 --> 05:05.000]  come on companies continue to lay off thousands of people unemployment is the
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.400]  highest it's been in over 30 years statistics prove that in a recession
[05:09.400 --> 05:14.160]  crime rates go up everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.640]  becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times you need to prepare

[07:03.040 --> 07:06.080]  more precious than money you could be running out of time I want to share
[07:06.080 --> 07:10.680]  something with you about your body quote make no mistake about it parasite to
[07:10.680 --> 07:14.720]  the most toxic agents in the human body they're one of the primary underlying
[07:14.720 --> 07:19.200]  causes of diseases and are the most basic cause of a compromised immune system
[07:19.200 --> 07:24.520]  dr. hazel parcels PhD quote we have a tremendous parasite problem right here
[07:24.520 --> 07:30.160]  in the US it is just not being addressed dr. Peter Weina quote in terms of
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.040]  numbers there are more parasitic infections acquired in this country than
[07:34.040 --> 07:38.320]  in Africa dr. Frank Nova chief of the laboratory for parasitic diseases of
[07:38.320 --> 07:41.800]  the National Institute of Health as you can see parasites are more dangerous
[07:41.800 --> 07:45.120]  than you think for about a buck a day you can read yourself of all parasites
[07:45.120 --> 07:55.360]  get the t.com that's get the t.com call us 928-308-0408 that's 928-308-0408
[07:55.360 --> 08:02.520]  life change t make an investment in your life and PSI I really like it from his
[08:02.520 --> 08:07.400]  central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war
[08:07.400 --> 08:13.760]  continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[08:27.520 --> 08:34.560]  I had that flyer here on my desk we got two days ago and I must have I'm trying
[08:34.560 --> 08:38.880]  to clean my desk off every day I I can't find it then we go to one of the
[08:38.880 --> 08:41.680]  next-door businesses and ask for theirs where it told me we're getting the new
[08:41.680 --> 08:46.240]  smart thermostats in the office and most of the homes in Austin have been
[08:46.240 --> 08:52.560]  getting the the flyer telling them this and it's a remote control they read it
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.720]  to the radio waves remotely and they control the thermostat in your officer
[08:57.720 --> 09:04.040]  home so we printed up during the break a January 12th article out of the
[09:04.040 --> 09:12.080]  San Francisco Chronicle it says critics cool to smart thermostat proposal oh the
[09:12.080 --> 09:17.160]  critics they're for it now well here in Texas they just don't tell you they're
[09:17.160 --> 09:23.120]  gonna remote control your thermostat they just put them in see that's how
[09:23.120 --> 09:26.760]  this is done new thermostats and homes and businesses would be fitted with
[09:26.760 --> 09:30.600]  technology that would allow utilities to change a building's temperature by
[09:30.600 --> 09:34.320]  remote control under a proposal being considered by state energy officials see
[09:34.320 --> 09:38.360]  in California three years ago was when they started phasing in these
[09:38.360 --> 09:48.480]  thermostats they don't ask you they just say we're gonna come in and wire your
[09:48.480 --> 09:56.040]  air conditioning system your heating system into this can you believe this
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.400]  yet after public outcry by critics worried about big brother dictating
[10:00.400 --> 10:03.000]  home temperatures officials with the California Intercommission said this
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.360]  week that they will change the proposal regulations so that consumers would have
[10:08.360 --> 10:15.760]  the option of blocking outside control of their thermostats yeah right sure just
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.440]  let us put it in and everything will be all right the new smart thermostat
[10:20.440 --> 10:24.560]  supporters said could help ease summertime power emergencies by allowing
[10:24.560 --> 10:27.320]  officials to limit the use of air conditioning now let's stop right there
[10:27.320 --> 10:33.640]  remember six seven years ago when they got Schwarzenegger in they said Governor
[10:33.640 --> 10:37.840]  Gray Davis was involved with Enron running scams he was a gun grammar gun
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.760]  grabber I got behind the recall and then they baited and switched us and didn't
[10:41.760 --> 10:45.160]  put in a real conservative they put in Schwarzenegger the gun grabbing open
[10:45.160 --> 10:53.640]  borders New World Order individual and the news said that he was fighting Enron
[10:53.640 --> 10:56.400]  turned out he was involved in the meetings when he before he was even
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.360]  governor and of course it was gray Davis fighting in Ron and it turned out in Ron
[11:00.360 --> 11:06.880]  would charge billions and billions of dollars a week in fake charges claiming
[11:06.880 --> 11:10.480]  the energy just cost that much and they had fake trading computers and fake
[11:10.480 --> 11:15.320]  trading boards this came out just ripping people off well and their
[11:15.320 --> 11:18.640]  internal memos came out that well if we turn the power off a few hours a day
[11:18.640 --> 11:22.840]  that'll create the perception that there really is a shortage and people will put
[11:22.840 --> 11:32.480]  up with the tripling of their rates tripling and so now they'll just
[11:32.480 --> 11:38.920]  control again the government will control how hot or cold your house is in
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.480]  Europe they're banning fireplaces putting taxes on them restricting them
[11:43.480 --> 11:48.320]  banning outdoor gas heaters at restaurants and bars banning their sale
[11:48.320 --> 11:53.200]  banning their importation see what they tell you what type of light bulb you
[11:53.200 --> 11:56.120]  can have they tell you what type of toilet you can have they tell you what
[11:56.120 --> 12:02.120]  type of propellant you can have in your spray bottles it all sounds reasonable
[12:02.120 --> 12:08.480]  but then it's setting the precedent for total control and then they go to the
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.640]  level of oh we're going to remote control your car we're going to remote
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.400]  control your house we're going to look at all the prescriptions you get
[12:18.400 --> 12:27.600]  instantly with no warrant it just as all is uploaded to the government and then
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.560]  now they're announcing that if elderly people get Medicare Medicaid they want
[12:31.560 --> 12:41.040]  to put in their refrigerators a smart system where they have to scan in then
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.800]  it'll all be automated with RFID soon little tracker chips everything you're
[12:44.800 --> 12:51.560]  eating and doing and then scanners will be in the house to make sure that you
[12:51.560 --> 12:55.000]  are eating enough food and that you're taking care of yourself and that will be
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.200]  remotely monitored by the threat integration centers in the counties
[12:59.200 --> 13:06.000]  total big brother worse than THX 1138 worse than Brave New World worse than
[13:06.000 --> 13:18.200]  1984 and it's all just being set up around us so when you hear Barack Obama
[13:18.200 --> 13:21.640]  talk about we're going to have energy standards and we're going to build the
[13:21.640 --> 13:28.560]  new green economy it has nothing to do with the environment it's all to do with
[13:28.560 --> 13:36.600]  total and complete absolute control in micromanagement San Francisco Chronicle
[13:36.600 --> 13:39.520]  continues the special thermostats which allow utilities to adjust air conditioning
[13:39.520 --> 13:42.800]  in homes and businesses via radio signals are meant to be used only during
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.040]  emergencies of course as a way of avoiding costly and damaging blackouts
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.800]  when California has been caught running scams cheating people Chandler said she
[13:52.800 --> 13:55.560]  noted that several of the state's utilities including Pacific Gas and
[13:55.560 --> 14:01.240]  Electric Co already operate similar voluntary programs in some areas folks
[14:01.240 --> 14:05.760]  we all have to start putting in the supplemental solar to get around these
[14:05.760 --> 14:11.320]  people micromanaging us and controlling us you know they put controllers on the
[14:11.320 --> 14:17.720]  boxes in Michigan in other states on how much energy people can use and people
[14:17.720 --> 14:26.560]  are dying folks are found poor people are found by the hundreds I mean I saw a
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.040]  report last week that hundreds had died just frozen to death in their beds
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.240]  frozen to death at the kitchen table frozen to death around little wood
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.640]  burning stoves just freezing to death in America
[14:40.640 --> 14:48.280]  commissioner Arthur Rosenfeld a physicist's fame for his energy
[14:48.280 --> 14:51.280]  efficiency discoveries at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said he
[14:51.280 --> 14:55.640]  supports changing the proposal because of the public concern because he expects
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.680]  most consumers will agree to grant utilities the authority to control their
[14:58.680 --> 15:05.600]  air conditioners and emergencies oh see because the old proposal just said well
[15:05.600 --> 15:13.400]  you know well you don't need it to be set at 76 at night we will control it open
[15:13.400 --> 15:16.200]  your windows
[15:19.640 --> 15:25.080]  99 out of 100 will comply anyway he said see they know that adding that such
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.480]  emergencies occur only about once every 10 years yeah when in Ron or some other
[15:29.480 --> 15:33.320]  groups robbing you some lawmakers express strong misgivings I want to get
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.800]  somebody on about this because there is no debate about this in Texas and
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.080]  California and Oregon and New York and Illinois they just throw the gauntlet
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.240]  down to the slaves and say this is what we're doing and you'll comply anyways you
[15:45.240 --> 15:51.160]  just heard him but here they just do it now these are smart remote controlled
[15:51.160 --> 16:01.360]  systems they do come in and jack in to your heating and cooling system and they
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.720]  want to have a bunch of other things be remote control you know all the major
[16:06.720 --> 16:13.080]  new cars coming out by 2012 Toyota Chrysler GN they've all announced that
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.400]  they're gonna have infrared cameras in the dash standard that's hooked into an
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.760]  internal cell phone and that if there are pressure there's pressure sensors in
[16:22.760 --> 16:27.160]  the seats and that if there's pressure on the seats and the car is above 90
[16:27.160 --> 16:30.640]  something degrees I forget the exact temp I don't was 90 some degrees that it
[16:30.640 --> 16:34.360]  dials the police department and then they're watching on the camera and they
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.600]  said this will save the 30 plus deaths each year of children being left in
[16:39.600 --> 16:44.960]  cars well you're not for 30 children dying are you no but it has nothing to
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.960]  do with that it's about the cell phone on star platforms watching everything you
[16:50.960 --> 16:56.160]  do with a camera and I told you day one with on star the FBI was using it to
[16:56.160 --> 16:59.200]  dial and listen to people and now it's admitted in court cases without warrants
[16:59.200 --> 17:05.560]  I mean for heaven's sakes Google admitted three years ago that they're using the
[17:05.560 --> 17:10.320]  onboard microphones that are in all over the counter computers and video
[17:10.320 --> 17:15.560]  cameras in most Apple now is coming out with the screen itself as the camera not
[17:15.560 --> 17:21.880]  a camera above it the screen itself and they also the patent for the facial
[17:21.880 --> 17:25.480]  resignation through that where oh by law to make sure it's only an adult getting
[17:25.480 --> 17:28.920]  on the computer or whatever the you'll be face scanned every time you get on the
[17:28.920 --> 17:34.560]  computer the keyboards are coming out now most of them with thumb printers on
[17:34.560 --> 17:38.800]  it suddenly thumb printers are showing up everywhere at the gym at the salon at
[17:38.800 --> 17:45.240]  the mall the library the tent everywhere I mean do you see what the casual society
[17:45.240 --> 17:52.160]  control grid is critics cool to smart thermostat proposal oh the critics like
[17:52.160 --> 17:59.680]  it now isn't true but they tell the sheep oh listen other sheep like it they
[17:59.680 --> 18:08.560]  like the bed bag wolf let him in little piggies I say not by the hair of my
[18:08.560 --> 18:12.760]  chinny chin chin you can huff and you can puff and you can try to blow the
[18:12.760 --> 18:16.280]  house down but if we stand up it's a house of brick but people think they're
[18:16.280 --> 18:18.960]  in a house of straw so they open the door and let him in and don't even put up a

[24:53.160 --> 24:56.800]  operation the public's getting wise so the establishment is hitting us with
[24:56.800 --> 25:01.680]  everything at once and it's not just that all your homes are gonna be remote
[25:01.680 --> 25:06.640]  control with your thermostat it's your power system itself they're gonna
[25:06.640 --> 25:11.680]  remote control not just to switch it off when they want but to control the
[25:11.680 --> 25:18.080]  temp they say when they proposed it that you don't deserve to turn it down
[25:18.080 --> 25:23.200]  below 76 then it'll be 80 and it'll be you don't need air conditioning this is
[25:23.200 --> 25:29.160]  neofutilism you know surfs in England 500 years ago 600 years ago they weren't
[25:29.160 --> 25:34.040]  allowed to gather firewood they weren't allowed to hunt that's why they called
[25:34.040 --> 25:37.880]  the commoners the little people because they'd be a foot foot and a half
[25:37.880 --> 25:41.160]  shorter than the nobility that sat around pinging out doing whatever they
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.240]  wanted to and then the nobility wrote books about how they were doing it to
[25:45.240 --> 25:52.760]  control the population large portions of the children would end up having a
[25:52.760 --> 25:59.720]  brain damage from lack of nutrients it's the pleasure of the elite to control
[25:59.720 --> 26:05.080]  people you know in 1989 in Virginia and Texas and several other states the
[26:05.080 --> 26:09.200]  federal government tried to do a pilot program where everyone in the town they
[26:09.200 --> 26:15.880]  didn't small towns first would accept a box on top of their television set that
[26:15.880 --> 26:21.680]  would remote control the television set itself and then the cable systems as they
[26:21.680 --> 26:26.680]  came out they tried to have federal law where you would just have FEMA coming
[26:26.680 --> 26:33.080]  over during national emergencies but you would have the local government through
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.760]  FEMA transmitters and command centers doing it in the public center you
[26:36.760 --> 26:41.560]  kidding that's big brother they try to pass a federal law in 89 as well to make
[26:41.560 --> 26:46.800]  all radios and TVs themselves have a receiver to broadcast audio only of an
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.320]  emergency transmission now they're proposing that again and how do they
[26:51.320 --> 26:57.600]  roll it out in 1996 as the amber alert oh a little girl got kidnapped we need to
[26:57.600 --> 27:01.720]  put up billboards electronic at the government controls with federal money
[27:01.720 --> 27:05.240]  that are supposedly state that put up announcements for kidnapped children
[27:05.240 --> 27:10.520]  you're for saving kidnapped children aren't you and then now I drive down 290
[27:10.520 --> 27:16.000]  in Austin and it says report illegal guns report terrorism and we're looking
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.600]  for an elderly person driving a black money car low who came up missing and
[27:20.600 --> 27:29.680]  Plano Texas so oh you're not for finding the old people but see they mix it in
[27:29.680 --> 27:36.240]  all the Marines are out helping run checkpoints to catch DWI drivers they're
[27:36.240 --> 27:39.800]  helping local police in San Bernardino and other areas of the country I mean
[27:39.800 --> 27:43.720]  you're not for drug drivers are you all the armies announced 20,000 troops to
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.760]  deal with civil insurrection but they're also gonna help it car wrecks with the
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.480]  jaws of life I mean you're not you're not against getting people out of cars
[27:52.480 --> 28:00.160]  that have been wrecked I mean see how sick the psychology is and it's all
[28:00.160 --> 28:05.400]  happening everything in your home the remote controlled by the government your
[28:05.400 --> 28:08.880]  computers already are folks of their own cable modems are hooked up to the web
[28:08.880 --> 28:14.480]  it's all designed Google admits they dial in and have a AI computer system
[28:14.480 --> 28:18.560]  because they said don't worry humans not listening a computer listens and
[28:18.560 --> 28:22.520]  creates a transcript of all audible words and even what you're watching on
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.160]  television listening to on the radio to build a psychological algorithm profile
[28:26.160 --> 28:30.680]  on you to then put Taylor Google ads for your screen and to sell it to marketers
[28:30.680 --> 28:34.360]  I mean what's wrong with that and it's the outrageousness it's the over-the-top
[28:34.360 --> 28:42.840] ness of just announcing it three years ago like it was no big deal oh the
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.200]  camera will also watch you and it said let's it doesn't just recognize human
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.480]  words and the TV and the radio in the background and you and your wife if you
[28:50.480 --> 28:56.480]  have a dog barking you will have dog food ads and dog toy ads and dog health
[28:56.480 --> 29:03.120]  care need ads Google announced this themselves and people don't believe me
[29:03.120 --> 29:09.920]  when we linked to the articles that's big brother they'll never control my
[29:09.920 --> 29:12.840]  thermostat remote control and ever control my car by remote control and
[29:12.840 --> 29:16.240]  ever control my TV remote control they'll never control my computer Alex
[29:16.240 --> 29:19.400]  that's ridiculous TVO doesn't track what I watch and then they come out and
[29:19.400 --> 29:28.200]  admit they do this is big brother this is what the computers are doing we're
[29:28.200 --> 29:33.720]  being in folded sucked into the matrix right now but computers are double-edged
[29:33.720 --> 29:38.200]  they're inanimate objects just like a gun they can be used for good or evil you
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.080]  can use them for good right now but in the balance the architecture they're
[29:42.080 --> 29:47.840]  building with the computers is an evil architecture designed to carry out total
[29:47.840 --> 29:56.240]  human oppression we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[36:28.280 --> 36:32.320]  preparing for mass graves in Marshall Law near Chicago the answer is they're
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.520]  doing it everywhere this is out of the Daily Newscaster DH Williams great
[36:36.520 --> 36:44.000]  report we're gonna play some of the audio now that is coming up in T-minus
[36:44.000 --> 36:52.440]  five minutes then we have Bob Chapman joining us in 25 minutes
[36:52.440 --> 37:02.560]  representative Dan Ides isn't representative Ingbertson and George
[37:02.560 --> 37:07.520]  Humphrey in studio we got two new Hampshire reps coming on dealing with
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.600]  right to revolt and saying no to the globals and the feds and Marshall Law
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.360]  and there's no more excuses to sit on the couch or sit on the fence it is now
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.320]  openly announced that foreign banks were taking over the United States they're
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.400]  building FEMA camps that we're going into Marshall Law and ladies and gentlemen
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.840]  I'm getting reports from inside sources everywhere sitting out the window for me
[37:30.840 --> 37:37.880]  in the control room one of my trusted crew members
[37:38.320 --> 37:45.720]  mothers is a nurse at Seton and they were called into a meeting and they were
[37:45.720 --> 37:55.200]  told that everybody that comes in to Seton must be given a flu shot or a
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.800]  pneumonia shot that's the way it was phrased and then they added the caveat
[37:59.800 --> 38:07.200]  this is how they mind control their own people that it's offered but that they
[38:07.200 --> 38:11.400]  must give it or they get in trouble whatever that double thing means and
[38:11.400 --> 38:18.560]  that when people and this is the kicker when they are incapacitated and can't
[38:18.560 --> 38:26.840]  refuse they are to be given the injection now that's how it works with the
[38:26.840 --> 38:30.200]  schools and in businesses they say oh yeah we have a requirement you take
[38:30.200 --> 38:33.800]  hepatitis and all these shots every year to work here or that you take all these
[38:33.800 --> 38:37.480]  you know what's 10 shots now it's almost 60 shots they try to claim you have to
[38:37.480 --> 38:41.000]  take for school and they phrase it like God I have shots to be in school and if
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.680]  you know to refuse they might pull out the waiver form but there's no law so
[38:45.680 --> 38:48.600]  why is there a waiver for something's not a loss it's all it's just like animal
[38:48.600 --> 38:55.440]  ID premises ID only two states passed laws saying you had to do it one of them
[38:55.440 --> 39:02.920]  was shamefully Texas the feds just said it was guidelines but then the state had
[39:02.920 --> 39:06.120]  to back off and say okay it's not really the law it's unconstitutional but if
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.840]  you're in a 4-H club or in the county fair you bring your pig you bring your
[39:08.840 --> 39:15.520]  chickens you bring your goats you bring your your cow you're yearling to show it
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.600]  and they did this all over the country in Missouri and Texas and the Dakotas
[39:20.600 --> 39:26.480]  you know I've seen it everywhere it's done as a stunt they pick out whoever the
[39:26.480 --> 39:31.360]  winner is so that it's a done in front of everyone this is how evil government
[39:31.360 --> 39:37.920]  is and when you win second or first place they let you in but but but their
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.160]  regulations say to be part of the private group you've got to be have your
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.880]  premises registered with the federal government waving all your rights through
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.880]  contract fraud on your property basically and your animal ID agreement
[39:48.880 --> 39:56.280]  signed it's corporate fraud you they're tricking you to sign on and as soon as
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.240]  they win and we should in every case they're either second or first place and
[40:00.240 --> 40:04.320]  and there's a huge crowd there of hundreds or thousands to see it they
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.880]  then have the police come in and they announced sorry she or he did not fill
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.400]  out their forms and they say escort this young lady from the building and the
[40:14.400 --> 40:20.320]  officers grab them by the arm this has been in major newspapers and the young
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.600]  woman cries of the young man gets upset and they take them off and throw them
[40:25.600 --> 40:31.960]  off the property there's no law it's humiliation it's peer pressure it's
[40:31.960 --> 40:42.320]  shunning and then everybody runs out and they say well we better register our
[40:42.320 --> 40:45.840]  property we better do this but it's not registration it's waving your rights
[40:45.840 --> 40:50.360]  signing your land over to the federal government I mean the government is
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.720]  completely evil and completely corrupt and work for foreign banks taking over
[40:55.720 --> 40:58.440]  everything they're robbing and looting and they're tricking everyone to signing
[40:58.440 --> 41:02.920]  documents waving their rights so they can take your property
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.720]  ladies and gentlemen they're now all over the nation knowing after roadside
[41:13.720 --> 41:18.400]  stands selling firewood and watermelons and tomatoes and squash and cucumbers
[41:18.400 --> 41:23.080]  they're sending tax people after they're sending SWAT teams after them people
[41:23.080 --> 41:35.280]  selling eggs out of their house they want control do you read me now I'm going
[41:35.280 --> 41:40.000]  to get into this report and I want to be clear about this FEMA was set up in
[41:40.000 --> 41:46.480]  1979 and it is an arm of the National Security Council National Security
[41:46.480 --> 41:51.000]  Council itself has now declared total control over all federal agencies and
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.440]  Homeland Security and states under PDD 51 that the states have no rights and no
[41:56.440 --> 42:00.840]  authority and neither does Congress when Congress is co-equal with the
[42:00.840 --> 42:07.600]  presidency but the founders said it had more power over the president it
[42:07.600 --> 42:15.040]  decides when to go to war the president executes it so they're openly saying the
[42:15.040 --> 42:19.520]  Congress runs nothing now and when they wouldn't pass the bailout they threatened
[42:19.520 --> 42:26.400]  them with physical martial law they have built threat integration centers in rural
[42:26.400 --> 42:29.440]  areas will do it in three to five county areas in major cities will put it
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.640]  right in the middle of the city they give free buildings free housing massive
[42:33.640 --> 42:37.040]  federal grants I mean they gave Boston two billion dollars in grants for face
[42:37.040 --> 42:42.240]  scanning cameras hired tens of thousands of police officers and so the city's
[42:42.240 --> 42:47.000]  rollover do it they're basically federalized they can dial in to not the
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.600]  cameras you see the big ones on the highways but all the little ones the
[42:49.600 --> 42:54.160]  face scanners they can type in your name pull up your cell phone in live time
[42:54.160 --> 42:58.760]  hit another button dial into your phone and listen to you this is mainstream news
[42:58.760 --> 43:04.320]  now this is being done first time they admitted it was Wisconsin the Wisconsin
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.600]  governor said oh it's real great we just dial in and listen to your cell phone if
[43:07.600 --> 43:11.560]  you're in trouble the feds gave us this new system so it's totally federalizing
[43:11.560 --> 43:19.560]  everything they tried five years ago to order 14,000 first responders police
[43:19.560 --> 43:25.840]  firemen nurses doctors medical workers county city officials to take small
[43:25.840 --> 43:32.280] pox and anthrax shots only 4,000 officers took it under orders over a hundred
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.800]  died that's the LA Times oh yes caused some type of inflammation in the heart
[43:37.800 --> 43:43.040]  they had heart attacks mainly men 45 year old and older cops killed them
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.280]  better than a hammer was that NBC reporter took one in Iraq and fell over
[43:46.280 --> 43:50.640]  dead of a heart attack causes inflammation in the so the police said
[43:50.640 --> 43:56.520]  I'm not doing it so now they've publicly created this and again this is all in
[43:56.520 --> 44:04.120]  pieces all admitted need to put it all together that they have recruited millions
[44:04.120 --> 44:09.040]  of firemen and police and other quote workers to get a federal stipend payment
[44:09.040 --> 44:12.920]  and they've done drills with buses right here in Austin Texas but all over the
[44:12.920 --> 44:19.760]  country to go around forcibly and to inject you with vaccines during an
[44:19.760 --> 44:24.360]  emergency under foot and mouth release which the British released on purpose in
[44:24.360 --> 44:28.600]  2000 as a test that they admit they released it from a level 4 bio weapons
[44:28.600 --> 44:33.280]  lab and say it was an accident the US has adopted that rule it's been in the
[44:33.280 --> 44:37.200]  Minneapolis St. Paul paper I know that and others you covered it big time at
[44:37.200 --> 44:40.680]  the time that the army will lock everything down and kill all your
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.240]  livestock has nothing to do with their even contaminated a few hundred cows
[44:44.240 --> 44:48.200]  had it in a few areas it suddenly popped up in one day in every corner of
[44:48.200 --> 44:53.840]  England impossible they spread it they admit they released it then they killed
[44:53.840 --> 44:57.320]  four million or was it six million cows and eight million sheep and then wouldn't
[44:57.320 --> 45:03.720]  let them restock their cows and sheep for control to shut down the farms trying
[45:03.720 --> 45:08.840]  to break the back of rural communities this is Pentagon warfare Pentagon
[45:08.840 --> 45:15.480]  warfare their job under North comm is dominating getting control that's why
[45:15.480 --> 45:20.160]  they tore up most of the fields and the date palms and in Iraq claiming
[45:20.160 --> 45:23.280]  insurgents were hiding in the woods hiding in the bushes all over the
[45:23.280 --> 45:28.480]  Tigers Euphrates and they only let them plant GMO crops it's all about control as
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.640]  the UN says using food as a weapon and I remember the Rocky Mountain news in 2002
[45:32.640 --> 45:36.160]  the governor was in there saying yes we have a giant incinerator that can
[45:36.160 --> 45:42.000]  incinerate thousands of bodies an hour ready for the al-Qaeda bio attack no it's
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.440]  gonna be a globalist bio attack it'll be small at first to train everybody to
[45:46.440 --> 45:49.600]  give up their rights and have troops on the streets and oh see it worked out okay
[45:49.600 --> 45:52.560]  for those that said it would be a problem then the next one will be the
[45:52.560 --> 46:00.760]  big one you know that works well this is up on info wars dot com right now is
[46:00.760 --> 46:05.840]  FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves and martial law near Chicago an Indiana
[46:05.840 --> 46:10.480]  County municipal official in the city of Chicago under anonymity for safety but
[46:10.480 --> 46:14.760]  I'm here's them all the time reveals the contents of his meetings with FEMA and
[46:14.760 --> 46:17.800]  the Department of Homeland Security the initial requests seem reasonable enough
[46:17.800 --> 46:21.800]  when FEMA asked the county officials to prepare a hazard mitigation plan they
[46:21.800 --> 46:25.240]  say under law they have to that's federalization to deal with flooding
[46:25.240 --> 46:29.120]  fires high winds and tornadoes but as the requirement meetings and calls for
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.200]  FEMA and DHS continued over a two-year period the request became so unusual
[46:33.200 --> 46:36.760]  raising suspicions of county officials and they asked him do you have a place
[46:36.760 --> 46:43.000]  for mass graves now see remember eight years ago when they had fires out west
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.440]  and they said oh the army is helping regular army oh and some Mexican and
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.760]  Canadian troops are helping and then last year they signed deals to use Mexican
[46:51.760 --> 46:55.360]  and Canadian troops to quote engage the American people during insurrection
[46:55.360 --> 47:02.080]  that's mainstream news was mainly in Canadian and Mexican papers see oh you're
[47:02.080 --> 47:05.320]  not against the troops fighting fires are you not against Mexican troops
[47:05.320 --> 47:10.320]  giving soup out in New Orleans are you huge convoys coming across the border
[47:10.320 --> 47:15.080]  flying Mexican flags you're not against Norwegian AWACS helping after 9-11 over
[47:15.080 --> 47:24.800]  the U.S. are you see the scion during the legally mandated meetings held with
[47:24.800 --> 47:27.920]  FEMA and the DHS different disaster scenarios were revealed to county
[47:27.920 --> 47:33.000]  officials in late December 2008 municipal officers were invited to
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.520]  Indianapolis for a briefing on the state of Indiana they were told if
[47:36.520 --> 47:40.520]  industry were to collapse for example GM going bankrupt resulting in mass
[47:40.520 --> 47:43.760]  unemployment a depression would soon follow municipalities could expect to
[47:43.760 --> 47:49.280]  lose 40% of their funds so the feds are gonna be there with fiat money of course
[47:49.280 --> 47:53.240]  this is all designed every county and then see how they built all this up to
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.840]  this point now oh we gotta have a World Bank run everything now time magazine
[47:57.840 --> 48:01.760]  says and it'll knock the heads of the American people just fix things every
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.840]  county in the nation will be required to prepare a hazard mitigation plan a
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.720]  federalization plan the county should prepare a plan to vaccinate the entire
[48:09.720 --> 48:13.640]  population in 48 hours to participate and practice the plan several times
[48:13.640 --> 48:18.760]  FEMA inquired to where mass graves could be placed in the county and would they
[48:18.760 --> 48:22.840]  expect bodies from elsewhere the sheriff's department via this state
[48:22.840 --> 48:26.720]  sheriff's association was told that no two to three ammunition rounds will be
[48:26.720 --> 48:29.800]  available as the military would be purchasing all stocks that just means
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.280]  buying it up for five times what it's worth just so you can't have it they're
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.560]  already doing that the county was asked to make plans for hardening of police and
[48:37.560 --> 48:42.000]  fire stations putting in hardened bunker type buildings around town in case of
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.600]  kamikaze attack they mean the people they're building bunkers everywhere
[48:46.600 --> 48:50.800]  folks so the bankers can totally bring us into receivership and then reorganization
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.480]  and then Soviet extermination the county was asked to make plans for the
[48:54.480 --> 49:01.000]  possibility of 40 400,000 refugees from Chicago now we have the audio of this
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.360]  we're gonna play it when we come back from break but if any of you are in
[49:04.360 --> 49:10.920]  La La land denying this in 98 and 99 in 2000 I videotaped and my listeners

[49:54.320 --> 49:58.920]  what they're gonna try and then we have them not just doing drills but doing
[49:58.920 --> 50:03.040]  quasi drills where they would practice taking over cities like Swansboro
[50:03.040 --> 50:13.720]  North Carolina and actually was that Alabama got so many videos some police
[50:13.720 --> 50:18.040]  into the takeover searching people's cars for real people said oh no that's not

[53:07.920 --> 53:12.120]  engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to
[53:12.120 --> 53:16.040]  act as savior but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis
[53:16.040 --> 53:19.920]  will be on a scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty
[53:19.920 --> 53:23.440]  shelves will spread fear and panic across the land the insiders have

[54:23.880 --> 54:31.160]  and now they know there's no going back we're going for broke we're stuck in
[54:31.160 --> 54:58.640]  the metal we are back live okay let's go ahead and go to DH Williams
[54:58.640 --> 55:05.400]  interviewing a unnamed Indiana official right across from Chicago but we have
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.520]  this all separately confirmed each piece of this from other admissions that's
[55:09.520 --> 55:13.840]  why when I read this I know this is part of the official plan this official is
[55:13.840 --> 55:17.240]  just scared to speak out publicly about what they're being trained with behind
[55:17.240 --> 55:20.640]  closed doors I happen to have things like Kansas City police firemen and
[55:20.640 --> 55:23.760]  sheriff's deputies being taught the founding fathers are bad gun owners are
[55:23.760 --> 55:29.160]  bad it's in road to tyranny and that they're terrorist so we know what they're
[55:29.160 --> 55:55.240]  training to do and this is documented here it is
[55:59.280 --> 56:05.200]  yeah he's disappeared no one knows what I think he's just focusing on the
[56:05.200 --> 56:09.000]  family right now but you wrote a lot of things in your email why don't you just
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.480]  go through a lot of the time and break it down for us what do you see what's
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.880]  going on about a year and a half to two years ago we started being contact by
[56:16.880 --> 56:22.560]  team I'm saying you've got to put some plans together the first the first plans
[56:22.560 --> 56:31.840]  had to do with you know the the reason was avian flu now you know I don't know
[56:31.840 --> 56:36.200]  my brother's a doctor and a couple hundred people around the world have
[56:36.200 --> 56:43.520]  died from bird flu and not really a serious threat right now unless they
[56:43.520 --> 56:47.920]  know something that we don't but the point is the we were to put together a
[56:47.920 --> 56:56.720]  plan to vaccinate every person in county within 48 hours you're kidding me
[56:56.720 --> 57:00.800]  wow and then that plan has to be practiced two or three times I mean
[57:00.800 --> 57:06.960]  literally we've we've gotten every police officer we can and buses and and
[57:06.960 --> 57:12.960]  volunteers and and set it up and you know logistically it's just really not
[57:12.960 --> 57:16.560]  possible to do I mean we've we've run through this thing a hundred times and
[57:16.560 --> 57:20.800]  in our heads and several times dry rises just not logistically possible but the
[57:20.800 --> 57:28.600]  point is they want to be able to back make people very fast for some reason it
[57:28.600 --> 57:33.480]  might be bird flu but my brother's saying that you know bird flu really stop
[57:33.480 --> 57:37.600]  right there honey we're gonna come back and play the wrestling at Bob Chapman on
[57:37.600 --> 57:42.040]  this is the cover for federalization enforced inoculation that's what the
[57:42.040 --> 57:45.520]  pastors and the clergy response teams and we have the secret documents that we
[57:45.520 --> 57:49.520]  posted a year and a half before became mainstream news from the pastors and it's
[57:49.520 --> 57:54.040]  go to the FEMA camps take the force inoculations turn your guns in don't
[57:54.040 --> 57:57.720]  get upset when some people are being arrested and taken away but again
[57:57.720 --> 58:01.000]  they're gonna do this they're gonna have a biological event whether they claim
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.640]  it was naturally occurring or some terrorists did it and then only round
[58:04.640 --> 58:08.760]  up a few hundred thousand a few counting areas somewhere have a beta test have the
[58:08.760 --> 58:14.120]  army out show it on the news get everybody scared they'll fix it and then
[58:14.120 --> 58:18.760]  people will say oh my gosh you know martial laws good it saved us then
[58:18.760 --> 58:22.440]  they'll have another attack that's bigger it'll kill hundreds of thousands then
[58:22.440 --> 58:26.600]  they'll have martial law it'll get fixed then in a few years later they'll
[58:26.600 --> 58:30.880]  release the big one and they'll kill probably half the population of the
[58:30.880 --> 58:34.880]  United States so see that's why I'm fighting so hard even if they kill me
[58:34.880 --> 58:45.280]  what's the point I'm just gonna die down the road anyway anyways you are

[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:40.440]  finish up with the audio this is from DH Williams the Daily Newscaster and this
[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:46.240]  is documented here we go it might be bird flu but my brother's saying that you
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:50.800]  know bird flu really you know is an event right now unless they know
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:56.720]  something we don't know then the chairs department started getting long
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:02.400]  questionnaires I got one myself I didn't fill it out but and lots of questions
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:08.120]  that you know what kind of resources do we have what kind of how many officers
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:13.600]  what can we handle what are you going to do with if Chicago has an emergency and
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:20.840]  you have four hundred thousand people heading in your county where can you put
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:25.800]  mass graves we need to know spaces and mass graves can you how many can you
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:30.040]  handle can you handle bodies from surrounding counties and those types of
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:34.280]  things and what the heck do you guys talk about you know tell us what's going on
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:39.360]  hold up and what's going on we're just just contingency plans if something
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:44.160]  ever happened you know we just really need to know how to handle things and
[1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:52.040]  then I was contacted by Homeland Security through our what they've got
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:57.720]  what we have to do is have what is called a hazard mitigation plan right
[1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:01.600]  well that sounds good and what they're saying is female is saying that that
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:06.480]  disasters are costing them too much money so we've got to have a plan to
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:13.040]  mitigate the the damage from disasters stop right there see that's
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:16.960]  federalization of the county they're saying under law you've got to take our
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:22.160]  orders and carry out these plans and this is mainly to find out what counties
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:27.080]  and cities will go along with the system or what people are wise to it that's
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:30.040]  what the military's been doing for decades with these urban warfare drills
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:33.240]  is finding out who's aware who is and who they can work with who they can who
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:36.040]  they can pay off who they can't there's just how this is how they take over
[1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:39.960]  third-world nations they're just taking their time doing it here back to the
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:45.000]  tape happens and I understand you've got New Orleans you've got fires in
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:50.520]  California and you've got the tornadoes and in Oklahoma you have those things
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:54.080]  going on but we're looking at them but you know look we're in the middle of
[1:02:54.080 --> 1:03:00.720]  cornfield what kind of disasters are we talking about oh earthquakes and you
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:08.120]  know fires and flooding and tornadoes and what okay well what is that what are
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:12.800]  the real chances of those things happening to us oh it's very rare but
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:16.360]  still we want to have mitigation plans okay what kind of stuff you talk about I
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:21.480]  just I just had my last meeting today with them in fact and you know they're
[1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:29.440]  literally telling me that they want to harden our fire stations all right
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:36.800]  what do you mean by that well you know how when a 747 hits here's what he said
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:42.680]  today a 747 hits a nuclear reactor and just and his slides off of it that kind
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:49.680]  of hardening we're talking about what the heck oh my god well first off you
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:54.440]  know I mean what for what reason you know as a 747 lands in the middle of town

[1:06:00.440 --> 1:06:05.600]  The day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of
[1:06:05.600 --> 1:06:11.040]  war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the
[1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:15.780]  enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to the

[1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:24.360]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some
[1:06:24.360 --> 1:06:28.240]  US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:34.360]  spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:38.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi
[1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:42.320]  Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war
[1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:47.000]  games, the shadow government, and much much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at

[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:13.480]  Alright, finishing up with this clip of an emergency management official Indiana.
[1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:18.320]  They spread out this big map of the county and then it's totally detailed and
[1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:23.240]  they want to, quote, be told everything by the county officials. Of course, they
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:26.600]  already know everything. They have federal maps of that. They've quietly
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:31.000]  gotten this is to practice having them follow orders. They say it's a required
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.720]  meeting. You got to come to it and there's meeting after meeting after
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:36.920]  meeting and then always there'll be more meetings and they're really identifying
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:40.320]  who they can work with. Remember, FEMA went in and cut the communication lines,
[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:44.160]  jam the police cell phone system, cut their radio system in New Orleans and
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:49.440]  blocked aid from coming in and then sent in the military to confiscate guns from
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:52.600]  the high and dry area. Then they admitted it was all a laboratory test.
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:56.640]  Then by claiming FEMA screwed up, they then got even more funding and power.
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:25.640]  Let's finish up the clip and go to Bob Chapman.
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:55.320]  Okay, there you have it. Bob Chapman.
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:58.640]  I've reversed engineered this article. It's also from a good source and we
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:04.200]  already have confirmed every sub piece of it. This is nationwide, including rural
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:10.200]  areas. We know they've been building this for decades, but it appears they're
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:14.440]  bringing it to a head and they think the financial collapse is what's going to
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:18.680]  help them carry it out. That combined with some type of bio weapon release. Do
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:21.680]  you think there's any way to stop the globalists from doing this or do they
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:28.040]  smell blood? They're just going for broke to destroy the country. Well, first of all,
[1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:33.360]  you'd be commended for putting this kind of information out. There's very few
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:37.680]  entities that would be an attempted and it's something the American people have
[1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:43.960]  to know. This will be on info, won't it? Yes, it's there now. It is and because I
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:51.640]  want to carry that so make sure that I get it by email and it's hard to say
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:57.400]  what they're going to do and when they're going to do it. Yes, they could use the
[1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:02.480]  financial collapse, the chaos that follows as an excuse to implement the
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:09.120]  martial law. Those who disagreed obviously would be somehow subdued. I don't
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:13.320]  think that's going to be easy for them. A lot of the law enforcement people will
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:19.240]  balk at all of them and at the same time I think the attitude of the military is
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:26.320]  if we don't get shot at we're not going to shoot anybody and so the timing is
[1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:31.960]  very, very difficult. I mean something like this could happen next week or it
[1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:37.680]  could happen two and a half years from now but what we have to do is hope it
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.840]  takes time for them to do that so that we can get the word out to everybody
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:47.080]  that this is what they're up to and get these people out. They are climbing all
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:50.920]  over their Congress and saying why are these people doing this? What do they
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:57.560]  need to find out the best place to bury 400,000 bodies? Well they have all the
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:12:02.080]  FEMA coffins stored in Colorado and Georgia and Texas and New York and
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:06.760]  California and I mean they admit I have the mainstream articles where
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:10.300]  they say they've got mass graves ready and incinerators and coffins and then we
[1:12:10.300 --> 1:12:14.400]  go show the video of the coffins and people go that's not real. Sure it's a
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:17.480]  company that makes plastic coffins and there's a million of them out there but
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:23.360]  so what? They need the coffins and now the public saying well they just now are
[1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:27.720]  announcing martial law may be needed because of the financial crisis. Bob you
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:30.600]  worked in military intelligence before you became a successful stockbroker and
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:34.480]  then Golden Silver dealer and then one of the most publicized you know financial
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:37.480]  writers in the world biggest newsletter in the world till you retired and then
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:41.960]  came back. I mean for anybody studying history this is a classic creeping death
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:46.680]  takeover. This is the German Operation Valkyrie that Hitler set up to take over
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:51.200]  Germany and that they tried to reverse on him with of course what happened with
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:56.200]  the film Valkyrie. It's based on the true story but I mean there's no doubt this
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:59.880]  is going on. The army now admits they're preparing for it. You've got these
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:03.760]  poor compartmentalized county officials who were just now the light bulbs going
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:08.880]  off because the buzz is going on out there. The good news is we do now have
[1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:14.000]  25 states. It was 21 two days ago now it's 25 states moving who have passed or
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.120]  are passing legislation reaffirming the 10th Amendment states rights and in the
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:21.240]  bills it says no martial law, no gun
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:24.720]  confiscation. They're telling the state police and counties and others you will
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:28.920]  not break the law and follow the New World Order but then the state police
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:32.200]  are coming into the state houses and fighting them because they're really
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:36.200]  federal in Oklahoma and other places. We're having the state reps on. We are
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:41.840]  confirming this Bob. This is really happening but again the due sex here
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:46.640]  is the states. You know that is the cavalry and I agree with you. Everyone
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:51.840]  has to go crazy with these documents, with the army bills, have the facts go
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:55.880]  before your city council, bring two or three of your friends to give their time
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:13:59.880]  to you so you have time. Get up there and say this is happening. We know you're in
[1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:04.280]  consultation with them. Say no. The globalists will not implode the economy
[1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:09.800]  fully unless they think they can get away with this. You're absolutely right
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:18.800]  and your reference to Operation Valkyrie is a correct one. It's a slow
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:26.040]  moving program that is encompassing the entire nation and very few people know
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:31.520]  about and as you say a lot of people will say many people will say well what
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:36.400]  can we do about it or I don't believe you but Alex all we can do is what we can
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:42.760]  do and that is get the information out and try to get people to become active
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:48.960]  in going to the legislatures and telling them look we got to pass this
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:54.360]  sovereignty issue and we also have to stop the federal government for
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:58.920]  ordering our people around in our state to try to make them do that. Well Bob I
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:05.640]  have to every five minutes now restrain my instinct my survival instinct as I
[1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:09.840]  have small children to get out of the country. I understand that I'm a marked
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:14.000]  man. I understand that there's nowhere to run that it's a global order but I
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.400]  have to restrain my instinct. You of course left the United States years ago
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:23.640]  seeing this but you know you're grown up your children or adults you know but I
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:26.280]  guess that's why I've expanded our operation while we're even upping the
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:30.960]  game because you know that way I mean I'm just committed I'm going to the
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:35.600]  bitter end I just could the nightmare could all end if the dumbass and I'm
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:39.560]  sorry to use that term that's what it is if the dumbass public would just wake
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:48.560]  up man it's so horrible Bob. It's my 50th year in this believe me I believe you
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:52.800]  I've been there and incidentally if you want to hide your kids I'll hide them
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:57.680]  for you. Oh it's not even that I know there's you know what I put it all in
[1:15:57.680 --> 1:16:01.680]  God's hands it's just that primitive instinct Bob is just constantly get out
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:04.960]  of here get out of here get out of here get out of here get out of here I see
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:13.920]  the elite all leaving. It's five years ago Alex. Yeah. All we can do is what we
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:18.480]  can do we'll just keep on trying and trying and trying and maybe we'll be
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:23.760]  successful but we need the listeners help they've got to do something every
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:29.400]  one of you people out there must know somebody who's in state government. Take
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:36.360]  the time call email go to the state house do something please. You've got to
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:39.760]  put on a suit and you've got to go to that neighbor that's a state rep you've
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:44.760]  got to be professional and lay out all the bills the documents and we call
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:51.320]  man. It's just so real Bob it and it's not just a regular banana Republic
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:55.480]  corrupt L. Hefe general running things and they kind of leave you alone. This
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:59.440]  is the hardcore New World Order. These are the guys that when they got a
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:05.320]  country they kill half the population. That's right and after that they say
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:10.400]  this these are the people who are going to be allowed to go to school these are
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:13.560]  the people who are going to be accountants and these are people are
[1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:17.360]  going to be doctors and so on and so forth and they're going to tell you how
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:22.120]  you can breed if you can at all and they will tell you where you're going to live
[1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:26.360]  where you're going to work you'll have to have a passport to move from one town
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:33.080]  to another and that expression let me see your papers will be very very common
[1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:38.200]  and it's going to be horrible and they they laid it out years ago I had this
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:47.600]  conversation in 1964 and now that this is it they're ready to act they're
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:55.200]  looking for the right moment and there's all these good old boys that think
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:59.360]  they're part of the system they don't understand in a tyranny the majority of
[1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:06.680]  the public get looted including all of the little minions either do what you
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:11.560]  told or you liquidated along with your family yeah let me explain this to you
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:17.120]  police military FBI others who do you think the thugs running this are gonna
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:22.920]  know they're gonna know you who do you have scores with who didn't like you at
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:26.320]  Quantico going to school or who didn't like you in police academy or who didn't
[1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:30.000]  like you and I heard the governor of Alabama who they've had to release now
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:33.520]  they set up and it's now come out in testimony federally that Carl Rove just
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:37.120]  didn't like him because he'd said something rude to him decades ago so they
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:42.560]  just had him arrested I mean if they can do that to a governor Siegel they've
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:46.600]  now released him he did have like some seven-year federal sentence they
[1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:55.680]  diesel him for months I mean the point is that that most of you that serve the
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:59.600]  system they're gonna put you in prison and kill you because they know you know
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:07.080]  the crimes they've committed Bob you want to explain that to them well I
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:15.520]  think that you become part of the system we've used you and now we need to get
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:23.040]  rid of you because you know too much I think it's as simple as that and don't
[1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:28.040]  forget the law is what they say it is just like when I tell the people at the
[1:19:28.040 --> 1:19:31.680]  state look these are federal mandated meetings and you've got to come whether
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:34.280]  you like it or not
[1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:48.280]  speaking of Valkyrie here comes fly to the values in the morning yeah I love

[1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:24.680]  didn't get there on time and we're here we've been right along we've had the
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.840]  information the sources we understand what's going on it's horrible beyond

[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:50.880]  they get to reorganize everything and control it they're gonna go for broke and
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:56.840]  so because I do love this country and I do love humanity I'm committed to this
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:01.560]  you know we joke around we have fun here but sometimes I think I shouldn't
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:06.080]  even do that because it kind of downplays the seriousness of it all at
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:10.800]  the same time I'd go crazy if I didn't put a nice face on it sometimes I it's
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:21.000]  so real it's so historical it's so concrete Bob Chapman and I just don't
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:26.360]  know what else to say well I think we said as much as we can people have to go
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:31.640]  to info wars and get the information and and it will be there wanted Alex yes
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:35.120]  we have the article of FEMA and DHS preparing mass graves of martial law
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:41.000]  near Chicago and then under it we have links to previous articles of FEMA it's
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.720]  not about food it's about martial law it's not about floods it's about martial
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:48.360]  law FEMA sources confirmed coming martial law FEMA sources confirm martial
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:53.520]  law FEMA starts PR campaign with new YouTube channel governor proposes

[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:13.760]  preparing for domestic disturbances meet FEMA preparing for collapse of
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:21.000]  Mexico CIA preparing public for me goes on and on and all the bills all of it
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.720]  all the people didn't believe us when we have the the preacher documents they
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:28.920]  were being in preparing their flocks for martial law and then now it's mainstream
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:35.840]  news Bob that's right and but you know you're on the cutting edge well we both
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:40.520]  are but you more so than myself and we've just got to keep on doing what
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:45.600]  we're doing and we got to get the people out there as best we can to act upon
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:52.800]  the information which is bona fide and truthful and see what we can do with it
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:27:00.960]  I mean I I'm astounded that we have 26 states declaring a sovereignty issue I
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:05.600]  mean if you'd asked me a week ago or six months or a year ago if that was
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:11.360]  possible I would have said I I don't really think so and look what's happened
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:18.640]  what was the catalyst for that Alex we have educated the Patriots so many
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:22.440]  people and so many constituents have worn their state reps over and over again
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:25.040]  that now I have them on they go we didn't believe this till we looked at it
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:28.440]  it's all true you're right it's martial law FEMA camps I mean I some of these
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:32.680]  guys are former Army officers who have degrees in history they know as much as
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:37.240]  I do we get them on air I mean and they know everything and so it looks like
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:40.840]  folks have actually been doing their job and the states have found out under PDD
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:44.800]  51 and John Ward defense authorization act that they are to be removed they've
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:52.680]  learned that Congress has now been removed and is now ceremonial and so
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:56.840]  it's exciting but at the same time it's only introduced in most these states we
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:02.080]  need to have it pass in all of them and then act upon it but it just shows that
[1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:05.960]  that's what's so frustrating if we stand up and fight in the info war if we
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:12.000]  spread the word and say no nothing can stop us but it's in action ensures the
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.120]  enemy's victory and I mean this is a war ladies and gentlemen this is life and
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:19.280]  death we have the enemy coming against us and there's those of us standing
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:22.880]  against it and we are deciding to put ourselves in the way of the greatest
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:30.320]  crime syndicate on earth because we know that you can't kneel to it Bob there
[1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:37.440]  is no way to kneel to it they will destroy you they're evil evil people
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:42.640]  and you can't make deals with them and if you're going to get killed in the
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:47.080]  process that's just the way it's going to be you can't submit to these people
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:52.880]  because submission is death one way or the other so you may as well go down
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:59.400]  fighting well a lot of folks don't just say okay well they come for me I'll
[1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:06.040]  get them no ladies and gentlemen you need to educate them now because I'm
[1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:09.400]  talking to a lot of police and a lot of military and there is a buzz there as
[1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:13.400]  well Bob we got to push it over the edge I think the enemy may have overplayed
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:18.200]  their hand I think this could this could bring them down Bob I think you're
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:24.040]  right but we've got to get it to enough people the public but also as you say
[1:29:24.040 --> 1:29:31.000]  law enforcement and we got to make them understand what these people are up to
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:35.040]  all right let's get into the economy we come back Bob Bob Chapman the

[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:17.400]  remember we discussed starting about six weeks ago my idea that what they wanted
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:22.960]  to do was to denigrate the system throughout the world in which they're
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:29.760]  in the process of doing and at some point devalue the dollar and default on the
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:35.480]  debt and all other nations would do the same thing and then usher in the new
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:40.360]  currency and an attempt at one world government and so the things that you're
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:45.440]  seeing going on are not through incompetence they didn't happen that way
[1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:51.680]  they were planned that way when it's going to happen I don't know it's
[1:39:51.680 --> 1:39:59.880]  certainly up for conjecture but the events are being put in place the stock
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:06.560]  market has been kept from going down further than is right now by the
[1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:11.680]  government you can see them in there every day then they're not artful at it
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:16.960]  anymore they don't care what you think they're arrogantly rigging the market
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:20.760]  and they come in the last half hour and at the markets down they run it right
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:25.720]  back up again like they did yesterday market was down 250 points on the Dow
[1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:32.280]  and ended up off just several points on the day and of course when they feel
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:38.480]  like it they take a whack at gold and silver and other things oil oil I mean
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:43.840]  look what they've done to oil they've got it down to $34 a barrel I mean who
[1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:49.920]  would have ever thought at 147 per barrel that we'd be looking at $34 a
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:59.080]  barrel incidentally the oil sands in Canada are now unprofitable I think
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:06.120]  their break even is around $40 and so and it they are the number one oil
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:10.360]  exported to the United States so that's going to have some impact there but
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:15.280]  anyway they are in there manipulating the markets and they're not going to stop
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:19.880]  doing it and they don't care what we say they're going to do what they want to do
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:24.120]  because they think that they are going to be able to take over and accomplish
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:30.560]  what this they've set out to do so what can we expect now we can expect
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:35.440]  before the year is over and maybe quite soon that the stock market will break
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:41.600]  down to new low levels probably 6,000 6,500 on the Dow and it's around 79
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:49.080]  7,900 approximately right now if that happens I would expect that gold would
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:54.360]  move higher perhaps go up and test its highs perhaps go up to $1,200
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:42:02.360]  announced maybe $1,700 announced this year who knows all I know is that when
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:06.560]  you have a depression the only thing that holds its value against
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:12.520]  everything else is gold well Bob it's mine you said two weeks ago here when
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:17.200]  gold was at 840 that you thought it was going to go up and test 830 and then it
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:21.280]  went past that that it was going to probably go up to a thousand very soon
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:27.160]  it's hit what 945 this week and it's right up there right now yes that's
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:35.760]  correct it slipped back here this morning it's at 3.30 this morning was
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:49.520]  down 980 yesterday it was off a little bit and what they call this is a slight
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:57.160]  retracement and they call it technically filling gaps and that's what a gold is
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:43:01.160]  doing right now the technicians are allowing the debt gaps to get filled
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:08.720]  here for the next launch which will be against the former high in today 1,033
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:16.920]  dollars if memory serves me correctly and so fortunately especially for
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:21.840]  subscribers and listeners who are doing business with Midas when I made that call
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:26.960]  a couple of weeks ago I was dead on I am a little disappointed that I didn't
[1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:32.360]  actually pick the into-day bottom of 812 but that's okay I was close enough and
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:41.760]  we're in a very powerful move and the commercial shorts continued to increase
[1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:48.320]  their short position and they're short right now around 170,000 contracts long
[1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:55.560]  term they usually short 95 so whatever is beyond that is new not too long ago
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:44:00.400]  several months ago they show up positions were over 200,000 they they went
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:11.280]  to about 230,000 so we have that distance between 170 and 230,000
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:15.160]  contracts that speculators can commit them by gold speculators are out of the
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:20.640]  market and if they come in this thing's gonna whiplash and just go bang upward
[1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:26.000]  now so it looks looks very very good now Bob I'm looking at the chart right now
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:39.640]  gold went to a high of 946 dollars an ounce it's at 939 right now that is up
[1:44:39.640 --> 1:44:47.160]  over 130 dollars just in the last what month that's correct and since we made
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:53.880]  the call and I don't try to play the market short term I just try to tell
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:45:02.440]  people look this thing's ready to go go all in and many of them have and needless
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:07.760]  to say they're prospering because of it and but I think this this is gonna
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:14.400]  gonna reach and test and go through and then it's gonna be very powerful it's
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:18.760]  gonna be an awful lot of money made you know what Ted on there sorry Bob go
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:26.000]  ahead say that again please no saying it Ted offered on air two days ago gold
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:35.240]  that he bought in the market at 830 at the 935 level that was over $100 over
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:40.600]  when he bought the gold in the market beating even his previous deals I told
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:44.840]  listeners that he was gonna run out of that gold at that price he did it's
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:50.960]  gone but he was able to get a deal near that and he still has some silver at the
[1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:53.680]  old deal but the gold is gone at the old deal I wanted to bring Ted in
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:59.160]  briefly and if folks don't take advantage of it they're insane gold was you
[1:45:59.160 --> 1:46:04.360]  know 280 bucks five six seven years ago and now it's you know up at 940 it's
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:09.120]  been up to a thousand thirty all I know is they can play games with it but long
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:12.800]  term it's only going up in a hyperinflationary system I mean is it a
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:16.080]  hundred percent investment there's no such thing especially in this market but
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.760]  it is the safest bet out there is what the elites buy Ted Anderson tell folks
[1:46:20.760 --> 1:46:25.600]  the new insanely good offer well here's what it is I mean when when gold was
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:29.400]  down there at that 830 level I did pick up a bunch of stuff we're offering those
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:35.840]  Franks down there at 202 at that time now they're currently at 221 now you could
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.320]  say well they're up and it's too late to buy it not really because gold
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:43.760]  currently right now at this time this is the stuff that I picked up at 870
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:51.000]  gold Franks at this time are a 235 so I have my 221 a fabulous buy and then I
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.360]  have the British sovereigns right now we've been talking about those
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:47:00.160]  presently have those at at the price of 275 and the market right now is
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:04.400]  carrying them for 288 the thing that I have that's still down there when that
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:10.040]  silver was low at that $9 to $10 level I was picking up bags of walking
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:14.800]  liberties and and bags of mercury dimes and I have the walking liberties
[1:47:14.800 --> 1:47:20.640]  currently right now at 869 or 173 per roll they're gonna be up a lot higher the
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:27.440]  the mercury dimes currently right now at a buck 59 each or 1590 per units of 100
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:33.080]  face and both of those are a fabulous buy but we have we have we have older
[1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:38.160]  $10 liberties and $10 or $20 gold pieces I mean we have a whole array of things
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:42.640]  here that I that I you know when I see the market dipping and I watch what's
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:46.560]  going on in Washington DC and no offense to the people that are the
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:50.480]  supporters of Barack Obama but I'm telling you they're doing everything
[1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:57.280]  that they could possibly do right now a hundred percent wrong I mean they are
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:02.200]  thinking that the solution to this debt problem that we have right now is to
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:06.640]  create more debt and that is only one of the bankers Ted it's bad for all of us
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:09.840]  but good for the New World Order to further enslave everybody but but it
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:14.080]  hey Bob Chapman how good of a deal as a golden silver expert is that offered
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:20.360]  Ted is offering fantastic absolutely fantastic well the thing about it is Bob
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:25.600]  I mean if I can get in here and just take advantage of those market dips I mean
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:31.120]  like you said when gold was down there at that 817 and you're saying bye I'm
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:35.560]  right with you I'm like you know I need to buy as much as I can stack it up in
[1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:40.240]  my safe get as much coming to me at that price levels I can because I just know
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:45.920]  that with the president and the in Congress and everything that's going on
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:50.240]  the news that's out there that you can count on the fact that it's gonna go
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:54.200]  back up again and that's exactly what's been doing for the last year year and a
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:58.760]  half and there's no question about it in my mind that if I can get into and take
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.880]  advantage of it the one that that thing broke back down below that $900 level
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:08.640]  and started dipping around 870 I'm accumulating I know most of the people
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:11.920]  in the market are like getting scared and they're covering their mouth and
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:15.720]  going oh it's coming back down again I can't buy this that's just the exact
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:19.480]  opposite of what you need to do you need to buy it at that time so I can always
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:23.320]  tells you buy when it's low look at the chart it's only going straight up but
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:27.480]  people don't they buy when it's high so Ted does the best thing he buys it when
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:31.240]  it's low and sells it to you at the low price when it's high when he knows you'll
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:36.720]  act so it's just a win-win-win-win-win all around you cannot beat this deal so
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:42.200]  so you've got sovereigns you've got Frank's you've got $10 you got $20 gold
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:48.480]  pieces you've got silver dimes right now at the insane level of 870 with gold up
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:54.920]  there at 940 right now as we speak so folks please take advantage of this
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:50:04.040]  800-686-2237-1800-686-2237 Ted the old deal's gone now we told folks this is
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:08.240]  the next best thing how long can you hold this well I'm gonna be holding on
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:11.960]  all the way I mean I'm I know it's Friday so I'm prepared to go right through

[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:26.280]  more inventory after that I'll do it but I'm gonna have to keep an eye 800 686

[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:37.120]  how it is guess what Alex gets the new price but still the best price anywhere

[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:32.400]  And now they're one to pull a mass culling, as Prince Philip calls it, Queen Elizabeth's husband

[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Get a free online copy of it, or subscribe, get it twice a week, it's a huge intelligence report, invaluable information
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Or you can also call Ted Anderson at 800-686-2237 and get a free trial hard copy, 800-686-2237
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  We've got four minutes left, anything else you think is important to add, Bob Chapman?
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  Yes, I think next week, gold will be moving higher
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  I think that the stimulus program will probably levitate the economy for a few months, maybe as much as six and it'll be over
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  I think early next year we'll have a new stimulus program, because the first one wasn't powerful enough
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  And that'll be over $2 trillion, and all that we'll do is extend the problems that we have into 2012, particularly real estate
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  And I noticed the other day, the day before yesterday, just before the market was over
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  The administration was talking about helping people with their loans, whether they're going to get the money from, I don't know
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  They're finally coming out with some of the details on the stimulus package
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  And again, as Ted said earlier, it's just not going to work
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  And we've seen history, particularly the 1930s and the 1920s, and we know what to expect
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  We know the failure of the FDR administration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  The failure of the Weimar Republic during the 1920s due to reparations and other problems
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  And of course that brought to power people like Mussolini and Hitler
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  And I guess we're going to have our own version of that, or at least the insiders think that we're going to have our own version of that shortly
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  One point Bob, I don't see it going out to 2012
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  I mean the commercial real estate going belly up, the car market going belly up, all these companies going belly up
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  Stimulate the economy by refurbishing government buildings
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  And then Robert Reich is out saying, well we don't want to hire white men, that's actual quote
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  I mean so they're going to give the illegal aliens some jobs
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Well that's why I call him the evil dwarf
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  And I got a lot of flack from that when I did that, I guess it was about 15 years ago
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  And I've spoken to him and he says, I know who you are
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  But anyway, he's no dummy and he's part of this package of evil people
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  And they're pandering to the minorities and that's the way they hope to continue to get their brand of internationalism into power
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  And that's probably what George Bush was all about, make everybody as mad as you can so that the A team can come in and finish off the job
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  But I agree with you Alex, they're going to go for it and they're not going to win
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  And it's going to be very painful economically, financially, and there could be a lot of people who would get killed as well
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  But we will win at a price because we didn't do our homework earlier
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  And this time they're not going to get away with it
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  Bob Chapman always informative to have you on, Godspeed, we'll see you this time, Lord willing, next week

[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  Coming up later in the hour, we're scheduled to have two New Hampshire state representatives on
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  They've introduced House Concurrent Resolution 6, and has the strongest wording of any of the 20 plus bills we've seen
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  Some passing states, some on their way to passage if you can put pressure on them
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  Establishing martial law or a state of emergency within one of the states comprising the United States of America
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Without the consent of the legislature of the state
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  They're saying the state is going to secede if this happens
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  Requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service for the people
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Article 2, slavery
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  Article 3, requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service for persons under the age of 18
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  That's in the president's new public plan
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Article 4, surrendering any power delegated or not delegated to any corporation or foreign government
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  That's these criminal treaties signing authority over even private corporations
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  Not just governments or multinational groups
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  Any act regarding legislation or religion, further limitations on freedom of speech, political speech, or further limitations on freedom of the press
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Which is federal systems pushing for
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  Article 6, further infringes on the right to keep and bear arms including prohibitions on the type and quantity of arms and ammunition and
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  That should any such act of Congress become law or executive order or judicial order be put into force
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  All powers previously delegated to the United States of America by the constitution of the United States shall revert to the several states individuals
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  Any further government of the United States of America shall require ratification
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  Three quarters of the state seeking to form a government of the United States and shall not be binding upon any state
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  Not seeking to form any such government
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  We are live at prisonplanet.tv ladies and gentlemen and this is a session
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  And there's now 20 plus states with similar legislation introduced or passing
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  Now understand people like how dare them try to overthrow the federal government
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  The federal government is constituted by the states and by the people 10th amendment
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  We constituted the federal government's been hijacked decades and decades and decades and decades ago by offshore banks
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Now they're not intent to have trillions of fiat currency and own hundreds of palaces and jets and incredible power and companies
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  They want to micromanage our lives and run every facet of our lives and disarm us and social engineers and have remote control systems controlling our TVs, computers, thermostats
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  It's all announced shutting down farms and ranches. I mean you can't make up something this bad
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  Now technologies allowing us to get around their controlled media but it's also the double-edged sword they're using against the people
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  And that's what's happening right now. It's happening in a big way
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  So I beg and I plead for everybody out there to look at the evidence, to look at the information
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  You know we covered this article and I've researched it. I've researched what's going on around the country
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  It's an accurate story from a daily newscaster in FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves in Marshall Law in Chicago
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  And it gets into the mass graves, the Marshall Law, all of it. Folks, they're moving. The feds are federalizing everything right now
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Obama just grabbed the census away from any congressional overview and is going to use it as a way to make Americans report on themselves
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  And tell the government everything they're doing constantly. They're seizing the National Security Councils taking over all the federal agencies
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  And Congress has no oversight. PDD 51 that states the President is absolute ruler that Bush signed that Obama's continuing. Notice he's not reversing any of those executive orders
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  He'll say he's not going to hire lobbyists and frankly I've never seen an administration with this many lobbyists in it
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  He's saying he's going to end the war and he increases the graves massively and now says oh 23 months we'll look at pulling out. Maybe
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  It's gone from 6 months to 16 months to 23 months in a month. So I guess in a year it'll be 20 years till they leave. I mean not 2 years
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  That's what's going on. That's what's happening. We are live at prisonplanet.tv and very dark hours for the Republic
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  It's a corporate takeover of the United States, the state governments, the local governments, your bank accounts
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  They have got you in debt so they can implode it and have a fire sale and then own everything and then you'll be dependent on them
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  That's the plan, total domestication, total institutionalization, feudalism
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  Whether you're hunting, playing or responding to an emergency, the food in the 3-day responder is easy to fix and ready to go
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  Food is an everyday need. The 3-day responder is for the time when food should be the last thing you have to worry about
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  The 3-day responder, $21.95, sometimes the best things do come in the smallest packages. Call 800-409-5633 on thewebefoodsdirect.com
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom. PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information

[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria

[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  Thank you. We are back live. We have Representative Ingbertson joining us in about 25 minutes
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  We have Representative Dan Itza joining us here in just a few minutes from New Hampshire
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  It's always fun dragging these men and women off the floor when they're in session or busy
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  Before we go to the next guest, I just want to encourage the listeners to understand that Barack Obama is nothing but a frontman and a puppet of the New World Order
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  And I know you know that. I know you know he's lied about everything he said he would do. We knew that was going to happen
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  Look at who bought and paid for him. We have to get past his cult of personality
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  Remember Bush was a cult of personality at a 92%, 93% approval rating after they stayed in 9-11, but that dissipated quickly
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Because they need that messianic front leader to carry their agenda through to fool the public
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  I mean he'll sit there and go to old ladies and go, I'm stopping all the lobbyists. I'm stopping all the corruption. I promise you, I pledge
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  And then he's, we were trying to do voiceovers last night with all the lobbyists and we had to stop. There's hundreds.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  I mean they filled the first, second, third, fourth, fifth right down to the 20th post at every major department, Department of Defense, Department of Education
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  Health and Human Services. That's only one facet of the film. It's like 10 minutes of the film. It's just his lies on lobbyists.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  I mean I probably have to cut it down. The lies about the war, the lies about wiretapping, the lies about torture, the lies about
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  Because he'll say, I signed an executive order stopping it all and you read the executive order it doesn't, it continues it
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  But then there's the really scary stuff, the gun confiscation, the FEMA camps, the youth brigades, the socialism. I mean it's all covered in the Obama deception
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  Available at infowars.com
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  Right now you can order it on the secure online Yahoo shopping cart and then your order goes in the stack. There's a stack in there
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  And it, from the first order to the last, it goes in that order shipped out. We'll pretty sure have the video in probably a week, maybe even earlier before the release date
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  So you might have a little surprise and it might come before then, but that's doubtful. The point is they'll first come, first serve
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  We're going to have these suckers pre-packed, ready to ship March 15th to you, the Obama deception. It is so important to get these out to everyone
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  It is so important that this go absolutely viral. I want you to buy DVD burners. I want you to buy copies of DVDs, you know, blank ones
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  If you got to sell all the junk in the garage to do it, you don't need that crap anyways, the old jet ski rotting
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  And just, or have a duplication place to make a thousand copies. I don't, I don't want to say I don't care. I want you to make copies
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  I want this sucker to go to the four wins and it'll be up on prisonplanet.tv and super high quality, you can burn it to disk or to DVD
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  Prisonplanet.tv, get your membership there now, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month and this goes back into our war chest to expand the fight
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  And hire more people and get more done here in the fight against the globalist
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  So it's so important to pre-order the Obama deception today and don't wait, we've got all these other films we're carrying like Eye of the Phoenix
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  Part 3 of America's Secret Beginnings, just an amazing film available at infowars.com
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Endgame, Terror, Storm, all of them
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  We're joined by Representative Dan Itza, who is one of the sponsors, in fact his name is listed as first on the bill, so I guess he must have been the one that introduced it and wrote it
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  The state of New Hampshire, and it is House Concurrent Resolution 6
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  And it's the strongest and the best we've seen saying they have right to revolt under their article 10 in New Hampshire for your die, they will pull out of the union if this basically continues and happens that's the way I read the last page
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  If gun confiscation happens, if martial law happens, if they try to have youth brigades, which has all been announced
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  So Representative Itza, thank you so much for coming on with us
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  Well, I'm very proud to, I want to make sure that I'm perfectly clear about one thing, the objective of this resolution is not secession
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  The objective, the happiest resolution of this resolution would be a revitalized union within the confines of the Constitution
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  That said, if the general government could choose to aggress in a manner that nullifies the Constitution, it is impossible to succeed from something that doesn't exist
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  And the preceding language, which does talk about essentially nullification of the Constitution, is not my language
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  That was Thomas Jefferson, those are Thomas Jefferson's words
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  Well, I understand when the government becomes destructive of the aims of the middle of rights Constitution Declaration of Independence, it is null and void
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  It is not just a right, it is a duty to break it up and reform it
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  So, Policer, what made you write this legislation? What made you put Thomas Jefferson's words in there? I thought they, I recognize them
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  What has, and now this is really igniting a bushfire across the country, because we are seeing not just a federal takeover, Time Magazine in an article titled The New World Order last week said
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  A foreign global bank will control the US government and everything we do in the United States, so we're trying to head off a offshore banking takeover of the United States
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  Absolutely, and many other things. What inspired me? Well, I mean, this isn't something new on my agenda. I submitted a resolution calling for the repeal of the odious portions of the Patriot Act in, I think, 2003
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  I submitted a resolution last year, which was last term, declaring that anything like the North American Union would be unconstitutional, but then this summer when I was studying for my role as James Madison in the National Heritage Center for Constitutional Studies
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  Get that we do every year, I came across the Kentucky resolution and they are just such a perfect, perfect statement of all the principles involved. I knew that I had to take them and incorporate them into a resolution and then give that resolution some objectives
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  Are you talking about the Kentucky resolution from 96 against the UN takeover of National Parks?
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  No, I'm talking about the Kentucky resolution of 1798 against the Alien and Sedition Act, which were the 18th century version of the Patriot Act
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  This goes right back to the foundations of our government. Jefferson wrote it and submitted it to Kentucky. He had James Madison submit it to Virginia, which Madison wouldn't have done if he didn't endorse the principles enumerated
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  So you've got the gentleman who drafted the Declaration of Independence and the gentleman who drafted the Constitution for the United States of America and its first 10 amendments. These are their principles. These are how they saw the relationship between the states and the general government.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  The general government is not the final judge of the Constitution. The states are representing the people
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  Sir, and that's because of central government can be taken over by outside or corrupt forces within and so the states are obviously
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  It's because the states are the parties to the to the compact and to allow the general government to be the exclusive or final judge of its delegated powers and those who might delegate to itself is to make its discretion and not the Constitution the measure of its power
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  Representative, it's a let's go through the illegal activities them constitutional activities of the federal government that that that is exploding right now and then what your piece of legislation ACR six is a stating and and you know the ultimatum that the state is laying out here
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  Okay, I don't have it open before me so you can you probably do and you can correct me if I misstate but the first one deals with the making of martial law or emergency in any any not just any of the states because that certainly violates the guarantee of a republican form of government
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  You would have to have the consent of that state's legislature to do so as you know expressing the will of the people. The second one is involuntary servitude other than a drafter in a time of war and in fact there are good constitutional arguments against a draft because it would
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  deprive the states of their militia but involuntary servitude other than as a consequence of due process of law and an alternative to incarceration any involuntary servitude of a someone under the age of 18
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  Any further infringements on freedom of the press speech religion or any infringement on religion any expansion of prohibitions on the types of firearms or quantity or types of ammunition that might be owned a k a hr 45
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  All of these things violate the fundamental maximums that are are enumerated in our constitution either both in the bill of rights and in the bottom the main body itself and they are treason are they not this is treason
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  Absolutely and and you know once you you know it's you if you if you're in a divorce and and you're you're in America this is rocking and cruising for divorce you don't just show up one day or it's not right to just show up one day and hand the
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  divorce paper you you you're obligated to go to that other person and say look we've got problems we need to go to counseling if you do this again if you hit me again this is over so this is that notice it is the line in the
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  no we've tolerated the intolerable for some time now but you know what we're not going to tolerate it anymore and if you do it again you will have crossed the line if you're dealing with a bully you don't draw the line behind the bully you draw the line between
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  the bully so that's what this is this is the line in the fan representative stay there I want you to repeat that when we come back as we're going into break finish up with your comments and I've had other state reps on I want to see if you're aware I'm sure you are you some very informed
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  about PDD 51 and other things because they're definitely making their move
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  the United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt but the truth be told public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  the US economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve system in the year 2000 debt growth collapse to only 4.5% it's bad enough that the US citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce however shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio

[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  the day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his M.O.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  we have to look to the Middle East we have to look to his home of bin Laden fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more fabled enemies get the DVD at infowars.com foresee it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv

[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  by the way we started about a month ago really hammering this issue of the states and more of them declaring independence coast-to-coast AM had me on a few days ago Glenn Beck monitors that show in this show
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  he's going to have representative it's on his show tonight he's leaving in about 30 minutes to go beyond that show so vital what you get out of this show sir with all the Fox News folks that don't know what's happening
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  and I'm going to be on coast-to-coast three hours next Monday with a bunch of other state reps so thanks to you the listeners spread the word this is now becoming a major national story
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  and and and we don't have a hope the federal government is taking over right now FEMA camps FEMA camp legislation mass arrest mass inoculation news youth brigades representative Dan it's a please continue what you were saying
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  about you and you follow before obama was even an office i mean that's key
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  right i i file well i i filed it uh... last september i i crafted it last
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  july and august
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  um so this to me this is not a new idea this is this is vital for our times it didn't matter me whether it was
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  iraq obama or john mccain that would be elected i saw the same hammer handwriting on the wall um so now it is time for the states to assert themselves
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  there is no way that we are going to uh... take back the jet the general government in one giant gulp if we have any hope at all is to take it back one bite at a time fifty small bites
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  and it's important that the people know that the selection of their representatives at the state level is far more important than their selection at the federal level because the
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  the their state representatives and and executives are far more dangerous to them we can we can reach far deeper into their pockets in their household
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  but we are also their only defense against the general government uh... and against the overreaching to the federal government and and we have to now make this line in the sand
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  and say no you cannot violate the constitution if you do you have no authority here and in for instance uh... if some of these things become law
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  um and i should clarify that think about it like hr forty five which is the federal gun license bill notice i said hr not hb
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  hb or house bill refers to public law hr refers to a resolution which is defined as a communication and constitutes private law
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  it so it is entered into by an agreement with the two parties all these all these grants that we get you agree to get the money and in return you abide by these rules for that money
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  yeah it's federalizing uh... these state laws were psychological testing registration uh... they've got other bills to ban all semi-autos or to allow the attorney general to ban anything at will
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  uh... they're also said to put gun owners on no fly list just to ban you from buying guns i mean they're coming after us they're not playing games
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  but remember these are resolutions so it is perfectly legitimate for any state to say that resolution is not valid within our state
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  and anybody who attempts to enforce it we will arrest and prosecute do that what you will
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  and that's what your bill is saying uh... but explain how you will prosecute it flesh that out well you just if they were if they enact a federal gun license
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  and they attempt to enforce it we say anybody who enforces it is committing or attempts to enforce it is committing a misdemeanor a for instance which includes jail time
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  and we will prosecute them and we send another we create another resolution informing the federal government that we've done it
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  what comes on that the smoking
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  yeah and they're trying to bill obama as linkin he says he's gonna keep the union together
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  uh... that we know the feds are concerned about the states rebelling they know that the people are upset
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  eighty percent against the war ninety-nine percent against the north american union in polls ninety-nine percent against the bailout in polls ninety-eight percent depending on the poll
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  so PDD maybe he is linkin what was the result of the civil war what happened at the end of the civil war reconstruction federal control mass slaughter
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  one step before that there was forced repatriation of the southerners people were for were repatriated at the point of a gun
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  that is the end of government by consent
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  that's right that was breaking the back of the states for the world loves him so much
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  um... my point is
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  what does the 14th amendment do
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  it makes us it presumes to make us or it's been construed to make us federal citizens before we are state citizens
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  and it has replaced uh... you know in freeing the slaves we made everyone a slave
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  and it turns a right into a privilege granted by the roman civil government going back to the roman model
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  stay there sir wow what an impressive state representative so informed

[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  glad to have him on board gonna go to him in just a moment finishing up the point you were making
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  before the break PDD 51 signed by Bush last year said that in any emergency the Congress has no authority
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  the executive rules all in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act it states that they are preparing to engage
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  the states the American people and now the Army War Colleges announced and it's a Defense Department statement
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  four months old it's been all over the news 20,000 combat troops and it says the governors will serve
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  at the pleasure of the president the state guards are being brought unto the federal government
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  and that if the president so chooses the governor will serve as a dual-headed federal officer I mean this is
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  blasphemy to the 10th Amendment this is exactly what they did with Lincoln after the Civil War
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  under reconstruction putting in puppet governors it's what the British did that caused 1775 and 6
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  so I've set the table with that sir can you in your own words are you aware of all those nightmares and B
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  if not I hope you research it fast for going one back because it's real knowing that what does that say
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  no though it doesn't surprise me I guess one of the greatest travesties we have made mistakes we ever made
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  was to change the title of our chief executive from president governor in 1792 because that would have made
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  the the duality more apparent unfortunately at that time we foolishly put our trust in in the federal
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  government so and it's surprising that we did because we were actually very very to merit us about
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  ratifying the Constitution we were the the the ninth one to do so and it almost didn't pass in New Hampshire
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  it actually you know the area that I represent was anti-federalist well let me let me just so inform the
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  other issues more informed than I am sure and many let me just give you presidential decision
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  directive 51 John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 passed concurrently each year in the
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  defense budget and then I mean did you I'm sure you heard about the 20,000 combat troops and I'm aware of
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  that one but you know the idea that anybody could declare that the executive is superior to the legislature
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  is patently unconstitutional there's a reason why you know there's so much devoted to the legislature
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  in Article 1 a lesser amount to the executive in Article 2 and a scant amount and to the judiciary in
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  Article 3 is because the legislature is the supreme branch of government that's right first they lied to
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  us in the last 100 years and so they were co-equal but I've read the anti-federalist and federalist
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  papers the legislature because it comprises the greatest number of separated powers derived from
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  the people and is the hardest to take over with the tyranny it is supreme but it's absolutely PDD 51
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  says you ain't nothing it's the president well and that's why I mean you know and you don't have to
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  adhere or recognize or reverence a lie and we have the judicial decision that has given the
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  judiciary supremacy is actually New Hampshire judicial decision from 1819 and everybody has been
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  bowing to it ever since but if you analyze the decision the decision itself is a lie is a
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  misrepresentation of the fact sir is the federal government in representative is the federal
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  government completely morally bankrupt now and illegitimate I don't know that I would go that far
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  I mean is the federal government itself fundamentally illegitimate no are many of its acts illegitimate
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  yes and you have to separate the two it's like separating you know the sin from the center
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  there is a constitution to which we agreed that establishes a general government for purposes of
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  external affairs and mediation between the state I mean and that that is purpose but but
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  representative that is the meat of the issue by signing Bretton Woods to an international
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  agreements to cede final authority over major commerce and banking to an offshore bank that
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  will control the United States and to have North com taking over the states that is fully
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  breaking the compact and a new form of government tyrannous is being is being perfected and we
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  didn't stand up to it at the time that is the importance of something like a CR six coming
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  from each of the states notifying them that further acts of this type are intolerable
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  and constitute a nullification of the constitution that you don't just you don't just hit somebody
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  out of the blue and that's why there was an olive branch petition and a declaration of
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  independence and you know when when the war for independence started it it was not something
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  that the colonists wanted if you look at the answers first constitution in 1770
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  January 76 prior to the declaration of independence it was put it was established because the
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  governor quit the state he left got no little robot and went out to sea got on a big boat
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  and went over back over to England and we said my god we don't have a government and
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  so we established one but the the introductory paragraph say this is a temporary
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  constitution until we can be reunited with Great Britain there was no desire no I
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  understand nobody nobody wants war but you know Patrick Henry said you can hear the
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  clash of arms to the north why stand we here idle I agree to avert physical
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  confrontation so we need to get the word out though the great tyranny is upon us I I
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  want to bring what I want to be fair the next day represented stay there though sir
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  and in comment on what he has to say we're compatriots we're buddies okay let's bring
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  a representative of Ingbertson Paul Ingbertson joins us from New Hampshire as well he's
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  a co-signatory to this bill that's been put together by Congressman it's a you've been
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  hearing what we've been discussing sir your comments on what's going on well first
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  Alex I want to thank you for what you're trying to do nationwide I heard I saw you
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  many years ago I think we first started up and I want to congratulate you on the
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  education you've given yourself over the course of these years thank you have you
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  know I thought boy you need to learn a few things that I'm extremely impressed
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  worth where you've gotten and you are doing a tremendous service to the to the
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  to the cause of freedom I really honor you thank you very much for having me on
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  well thank you Paul we all we all learn you know I think the biggest thing is I was
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  silly and ignorant but I had guts and guts was enough and you guys you guys
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  aren't silly and ignorant and and you've got guts so it's great tell us tell us
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  what's happening here I mean this is history well I I can just give you my
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  view and the reason I signed on I think with you that we're way past the point
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  of tolerating we're we're actually abetting now as states this stuff has gone
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  on so long you know I'm looking at the line in the Declaration of Independence
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all obviously by this point
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  having a direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  and what was the conclusion of that statement at the Declaration of
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  Independence we have no choice in my opinion at this point to start looking
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  toward dissolving this government and since they're starting to see this and
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  they know this is happening and since they know it was will happen when they
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  begin to bring their the tyrannical tendency that you know laws and that
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  sort of thing they're you know they're trying to preempt it and so you know
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  bills like this are critical then is correct you have to the last thing any
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  of us want to see is blood even though Jefferson believed it was the only
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  we would ever keep our our freedoms but knowing people like this but no these
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  doing the right thing we're trying to we're trying to figure out a way to get
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  the state's back to conversation with each other and then to get us all
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  looking simultaneously at the federal government saying what is this monster
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  we've created and what should we do about it absolutely and in my central point
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  here is studying the federal government and what the military was preparing
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  what the Pentagon has been saying for decades they have always known that the
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  main legitimate threat to them was the states and they have been trying to
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  quietly federalize federally take over the counties in the cities and as you
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  said it's very very dark it's past midnight the tyranny is here and if
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  enough of a buzz is created and the people stand up and say no through their
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  states we may be able to avert this and back it off I mean when we look at
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  Madoff founder of the Nasdaq stealing fifty to a hundred billion and not even
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  getting in trouble when we look at the very bankers that have stolen trillions
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  now running the White House Bush had a running the White House they come with
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  Obama I mean it's clearly a completely bankrupt illegitimate group of criminals
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  that have hijacked the federal government so how do we get them out of there
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  and then get our republic back your comments on that representative yes well
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  you know that this is it the first part of this correspondence that is being
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  recommended in this resolution with the state have to begin to open up dialogue
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  with each other and analyze the problem we have to do this systematically we
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  have to do it now which way past time we are the authority the first thing that
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  happened to us that really started this problem with the loss of the representation
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  by the states in the federal government the states now no longer have
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  representation we have we have represented selected by popular but not by the
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  states bodies themselves there's no corporate representation and that's why
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  actions like this don't seem to make sense to a lot of people in the state
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  houses but the first part is to get back to a conversation with the states talking to the states
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  well we see through federalism they're creating regional governments in the states
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  that bypass state authority and the states seem to think it's free federal money
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  when it was state money to begin with I'd like to get a comment from the author of the bill
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  representative Dan it's a it's time to stop bribing me with my own money
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  yeah this is this is like parents who created a child known as the the general
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  government and left discipline for so long that it's become an incorrigible
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  child and it and it's time for the parent take the child to the woodshed
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  terrific it's true I mean every week we created this and now foreign bankers
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  hijacked it and are telling us we're slaves yes I said on the education
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  committee and of course I have communications with my own school
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  superintendent and that sort of thing and you know the federal government has no
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  role whatsoever in education period there's no role they have no they should
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  eat they can't tax for it they can't pass laws about it but instead what they do
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  is they raise these money and they get us tied to it and then they come on with
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  a bigger one a bigger bite now now no child left behind is the actual official
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  takeover of public education the schools by the step by the federal government
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  the total the whole package is absolutely outrageous and now with our money and
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  and believe it or not your local people believe that if we don't have the federal
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  money we're going to somehow go broke if they didn't get the stuff from us and
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  if not as if they were not siphoning it off into their own pockets all the way along
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  the way we're only getting a tiny portion of it back anyway it's a madness that
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  this is almost beyond belief well look at what they've done now they have by
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  federal law if the states take the money the army is in all the schools they're
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  threatening the children to arrest them and they don't sign up for the military
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  saying it's the law that's on record everywhere they are
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  I mean I mean it is serious go ahead well yes go ahead okay
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  not somebody I thought somebody's trying to reach me but apparently not
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  no I understand you guys in your office isn't busy
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  gentlemen you've got the floor both of you we have a dialogue about where this is going
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  people say oh we're not gonna have the states pass this all it doesn't matter
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  we'll just roll over and die then because the nation's been seized by offshore banks
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  if the fires of liberty are lit and in these times of adversity they are
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  we have a good chance of having a counter-revolution and taking our country back
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  and restoring it against these globalists who are the real revolutionaries
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  the real hijackers
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  well that's an interesting point one of my papers I write about
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  the new world order the new world order is what was created in 1776
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  for the new world but we're gravitating back toward now is the old world order
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  European style aristocracy and it's time for us to
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  hitch up our britches and as Pastor Garrett Lear the Patriot pastor says
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  somebody stole my country and I want her back
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  and a comment a further comment by the way this bill came into committee yesterday
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  I don't know if you knew about this Alex but
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  the Federal and State Relations Committee in New Hampshire's
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  State House and we had an account going on
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  we'd heard about the Democrats talking to each other and basically it had
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  almost uniformly agreed to go along with this bill
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  and with one exception that we knew of
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  the Republicans all were planning to vote for this bill
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  and an odd thing happened on the way to the forum I guess you could say
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  but when the bill came up
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  it just turned out that the speaker who's a Democrat
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  was standing at the door of that committee as they voted
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  and the vote went the other way we went up with 11-7 against
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  passage of this bill I suggest to you that you're already on top of it
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  and that is that certain powers that be in certain establishment players
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  are part of the problem and they're in the states they're all over the place
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  and the interesting thing is when that in preparation for that vote
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  you know somebody makes the motion of inexpedient to legislate
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  which was the Vice Chair and then there's discussion of the bill
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  there was not one
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  still an argument I don't believe any argument in favor of the motion of inexpedient to legislate
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  there were four arguments against it and then the vote was taken
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  and without any rational support for the motion it passed
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  and Alex that's what it's coming to we've seen this in the last couple years
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  we've been a Republican House for a long time the last two years we're finding that
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  we can stand up and argue the merits argue the logic argue everything
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  there's basically silence on the other side and then the vote just goes socialist
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  as you could say it just goes sideways
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  yeah they've spent decades setting this up
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  and they're now going for broke
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  and we're going to be reorganized
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  you know the big international banks did this in the Soviet Union they did it in Germany
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  they did it in China it's all now declassified and they're doing it here
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  and folks I'm not playing games we've shown you the documents have the guests on
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  they plan to really gut this country and do some bad things
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  so many people men are going to
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  if this goes bad if we're unable to stop this they're going to wish to God they
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  to join this people who serve the evil
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  I think are just so cynical and lazy and only into their own personal baubles
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  that they don't understand that this is historic
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  this isn't just corruption as usual Alex we have
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  you know as a support for that we've been called by a number of shows including
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  some people who do radio shows military individuals who do radio shows
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  there are people who are in all places in government
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  and other places that do understand what's going on
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  let's talk about that when we get back gentlemen if you could stay with me
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  five more minutes after the break we'll also want to give out your websites
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  and contact information for people that want to join you
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  or get the bill and try to get it passed in their state
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  the fight is ours and we'll take it up in our hands

[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  state representatives we beat this drum to rise the people up from every hill
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  and mountain from every church top from the lowlands to the seacoast telling the
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  people that 1776 is upon us yet again in closing with representative dan hit
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  some and the representative paul ingbertson gentlemen how do we help you get this
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  done a new ham sure contact the media make them cover it looks like it's already
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  starting to happen how do we get other states to do this I mean as you said
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  earlier representative ingbertson we need to educate the states the city
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  councils the counties I mean really it's education here isn't it
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  the first thing is that everybody who's listening to ham sure needs to
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  fail the government they need to call their representatives they need to call
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  the leadership of both parties in the legislature and let them know that they
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  are demanding the defense of their liberty from the federal government and I
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  and that's them and there's going to be a rally at the state house today that the
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  vote is taken presumably right now that's the march forth okay we need to get
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  other rallies going around the country don't wait for orders from headquarters
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  listeners start the movement now call the state reps have introduced it in your
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  state tell them you want to set a rally and help them buy radio ads do whatever
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  you've got to do going to representative ingbertson sure should people call you
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  guys should they contact you should they I mean how can we help well I I
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  recommend they do that but I think the most important thing is to call the
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  reps their 400 very easy to get all the addresses you can mail to them
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  simultaneously if you go to an h.gov it's not hard to find that stuff I tell you
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  this for one reason and one reason only I don't want people to be you know
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  overwhelmed out there with this but what we're getting in media here and then
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  can tell you more specifically he had a contact yesterday with the concrete
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  monitor I believe it was down you have to correct me if I'm wrong yeah they
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  simply said what in the heck are you bothering this kind of crap for we have
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  when we have real problems and I'm telling you folks that that's the media you're
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  talking about right now you can't get any leverage with stuff like this because
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  we have real problems my point to Dan was if this isn't a real problem folks I
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  think I'm going to quit government I don't even belong here this is the most
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  real and the most serious problem we've got facing us well that's the plan where
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  the media is handling around here anything they can do to become the media
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  these people out there with their phones and their emails all that stuff anything
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  they can do to become the media would be what I was about to say that's the plan
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  is the feds are bankrupting things by design we have their own documents to
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  then make everybody get on the government's tip here I mean this is to
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  sell us on an expanded way to go ahead I'd like to read you something from
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  our federal paper 46 written by James Madison besides the advantage of
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  being armed with the Americans possessed over the people of almost every other
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  nation the existence of supported governments to which the people are
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  against the enterprise of ambition more intermountable than with any which a
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  simple government of any form could admit of not withstanding the military
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  establishment of the several kingdoms of Europe which are carried as far as
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  possible as the public resources will bear the government are afraid to trust
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  the people with arm and it is not certain that with this aid it would alone be
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  able to shake off their yoke but with the people to possess the additional
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  advantage of local government chosen by themselves who could collect the national
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  will and direct the national force and of officers appointed out of the militia
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  by these government and attach both to them and to the militia it may be
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  affirmed with the greatest assurance that the throne of every tyranny in Europe
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  would be steadily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it let us not
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  insult the free and gallant citizens of America with sufficient that they would
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  not be less able to defend the right which they would be in actual possession
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  and all right we are out of time I want to have you both up again next week as I
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  know you have more to say so to both of you representatives Paul Ingbertson
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  and to Dan it's a thank you so much

[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  I'm not tuning my horn I am congratulating all of you out there for a month
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  we've been covering the rebellion of the states against the tyranny
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  the federal government has been completely hijacked and is illegitimate
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  they are bringing in one of the most vicious tyrannies ever seen on record
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  our worst analysis turned out to be less than what the truth was it was far worse than we thought
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  these are the times that try men and women's souls
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  and we just want to commend and thank all of you that are here and spreading the word
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  because this issue of the states saying no to the globalists this is the only hope we've got
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  they're bankrupting us by design to bring us into receivership
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  for the next hour he's going to be in the studio with us
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  George Humphrey my good friend I remember when I first started getting active
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  in like 1995 and I remember I was running around volunteering for Pat Buchanan
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  because he was speaking out against the new world order at the time
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  Levin were hating the point is we were just learning
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  and I went over to drop off a bunch of signs to another volunteer and it was at George Humphrey's house
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  and George is a former city council member successful businessman, agreed economist
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  that's why we have him here today in studio with us after the show's over
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  George Humphrey's the last interview we're doing for the Obama deception
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  because I want to insert him some into this film that you can already pre-order
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  it'll be done in a few weeks pre-order it now at infowars.com
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  today hope that you will do that
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  George I want you to recap what you said in that brief interview earlier this week
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  when you were just here visiting when you were on for 10 minutes
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  and then let's go through where you see the future and the different divergent paths
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  that the future can bring that we literally are the governors of
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  if we just simply take action and put our will into it
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  George Humphrey great to have you here
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  first of all I am so glad to be here
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  and Alex what you are doing and what you've done in this last six months is just awesome
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  and what you've been doing for the last 15 years is just incredible
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  it's been a real pleasure and honor to be your friend and ally in this period of time
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  I mean you know what when we first got involved in it we were kind of scared
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  we'd lose our friends and I just finished being a city council member
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  and I was wanting to run for US Congress and I said God if I talk about this stuff
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  I won't be able to run for Congress
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  and I went well what's more important telling the truth they're doing this
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  and so for the last 10-12 years there is a lot of ostracism
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  there's a lot of people who made fun who derided us
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  you know there goes Alex there goes George those are the crazy guys talking about the New World Order
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  but over and over and over and especially this last four or five months
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  more and more and more people are coming up to me
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  I was just at Starbucks on the way here
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  three folks just as straight as they can be you know frat guys come up to me
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  aren't you the guy did not and they knew all about your show and they'd just become aware of this stuff
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  everybody is becoming aware and information is the key
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  and that's what we're here to do we don't have to pump anything up
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  there's so much information this is not conspiracy theory
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  it's just the history of what's going on in our culture and what is happening right now
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  and we have a choice and the first thing is to become educated
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  and clearly clearly clearly our nation our culture is addicted to materialism
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  to the soft life to a very unhealthy way of going through life
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  we've forgotten God we've forgotten our families
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  and you know just like in alcoholics anonymous they talk about the different steps of denial
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:28.000]  and and derision and of anger and of fear and depression
[3:04:28.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  and then finally finally of acceptance
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  and it's my opinion that with this recession which is actually a depression that we're going into right now
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  is that a majority of the people in this country are going from derision
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  and they've been going through anger and now they're going into fear and depression
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  stay there gotta break George Humphrey our guest in studio will continue with this analysis on the other side as the resistance mounts
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future in these troubled times
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  one of the most important things your family can have is good health
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins and heavy metals
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection

[3:06:01.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  but who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  bin Laden
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:14.000]  this is his MO
[3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  we have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  the Israeli intelligence network
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  warnings and war games
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  the shadow government
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  and much much more

[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  or you are with the terrorists
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  people who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:34.000]  the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  do your part, alkalize and supercharge your body now
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops

[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  George Humphrey is our guest in studio filmmaker, author, resister of the New World Order
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:30.000]  he came up in that early 1990s wave that so many of us activated in
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  it was just we felt in our spirit all the evidence was there
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  now a wave I would say a thousand times bigger, a wavelength has begun
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  the enemy sees it, we've analyzed their attack profile George and it's all about stopping the states
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  and more and more I realize that is the key point and they are scared
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  and I think of the people just energize and realize they have victory
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  and the phony Christian churches have taught them this is the end
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  you've got to lay down to corruption, you can't stop it
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  that's the opposite of what Christ taught
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  absolutely
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  and regardless of the consequences we're always to do right
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  and the clergy response teams, the brainwash FEMA patrols, now it's all public
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  everything we said came true
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  now people that laughed at us are remembering and they're understanding
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  so now is the time of maximum effort
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  please continue
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  well absolutely and I think we should go back to our philosophy
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  about what life is and what you just said
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  the one that most people call Jesus who I call Yeshua
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  he taught individual freedom
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  he taught about spirituality, about divinity
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  that each and every one of us are powerful, we're divine
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  we're sovereign and that one person can make a difference
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  75 years ago we saw Mahatma Gandhi do the same thing in India
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  and that's what you and I and others are doing
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  is that not only are we sharing the information of the first awakening
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  but we're also sharing the information that every single one of us
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  is a part of the healing or the destruction of this culture
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  and I choose and I think you choose to be a part of the healing
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  and the first thing is to get the right information
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  and quite clearly, quite clearly
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  the culture of America has been
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  and the western cultures has been manipulated
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  very very cleverly to make people put people in victim consciousness
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  and to make us addicted
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  and we quite clearly have become addicted to mammon or materialism
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  or to the soft life
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  and in Alcoholics Anonymous they always say the first step is acknowledgement
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  and then they talk about the different steps of breaking through
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  and in most, in its denial, its depression
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  I mean derision and then its anger
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  and then fear
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  and then depression
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  and then finally acceptance
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  and for years and years the information that Alex and I put out
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  it was denied, denied, denied
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  and then there was a lot of derision
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  oh there goes Alex, oh there goes George
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  those crazy guys talking about conspiracy theory
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  and now with what's going on
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  people have gone through kind of the angry phase
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  but now they're going into the deep fear and depression stages
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  because they're losing their money
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  and as an economist I always like to look at
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  at the economy because it is always the precursor
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  to the political, cultural and environmental changes
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  and George you wrote a book
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  was it 10 or 11 years ago where you said with the derivatives
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  they were getting us all in debt, getting us leveraged
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:49.000]  they were buying up the world
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  while the fiat Ponzi scheme had value
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  and then they leave us holding the bag
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  and then they come in with the only currency as the saviors
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  and totally take over society, you're right
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  well, yeah, I mean it's not me being right
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  it's just the information is there
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  and I've written three different booklets
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  and you've written several different booklets
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  and twelve years ago, twelve years ago
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  we were laying this whole scenario out
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  I thought that the bubble was going to burst
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  three or four years ago
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  but very skillfully the masters of the deception
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  have been able to keep pumping, pumping, pumping up the bubble
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  but all bubbles eventually break
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  and this economic bubble through the structured investment vehicles
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  the derivatives
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  it's the biggest bubble ever in the whole world
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  bigger than the real estate bubble
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  bigger than any of the other bubbles that we have seen
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  and because these derivatives were unregulated
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  unregulated
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  our slave masters were able to take profits
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  at 20, 30, 50 and sometimes 100 to 1
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  as they pushed up these derived indexes
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  and that's what caused this huge
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  I mean it's so far past bankruptcy
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  that words don't even describe where we are
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  we were talking about bankruptcy 15 years ago
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  but as most of you are aware of
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  with a fiat currency it's designed to fail
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  with a fiat currency which is what we have
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  it is mathematically impossible to pay off the debt
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  and with this new bailout or stimulus package
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  that is being created for us by brother Obama
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  it is just the height of insanity to think
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  that we are going to be able to come out of this doldrums
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  of this depression by creating more debt
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  you can't come out of something by creating more debt
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  which is exactly what we are doing
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  and the figures that I have right now
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  not from some new age guy
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  or from some hardcore, you know, wild person
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  but from CNBC is that the stimulus package
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  this bailout is not 700 or 800 billion dollars
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  it's 7.3 trillion dollars
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  that's with the T
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  now remember our gross national product this year
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  is going to be about 10.5, 10 trillion dollars
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  and so what we are putting out is something
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  that in adjusted terms and adjusted inflation
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  is two and a half times greater
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  than all of the money spent on World War II
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  now that gum that's a whole lot of money
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  and we are just now getting into this
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  and the really truly wild part about all of this is
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  is that over 3.5 trillion dollars
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  of the 7 trillion dollars
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  is from the Federal Reserve Board
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  that is being issued to financial institutions
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  without, again, without the jurisdiction
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  or the vote of Congress
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  without accounting there is no transparency
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  Bernanke has refused to give the information
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  and this by itself, you know, this last week
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  they are talking about an 800 billion dollar stimulus program
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  and that's a heck of a lot of money
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  that is like twice as much in real terms as Louisiana purchased
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  but what we are talking about is four times that amount
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  that is being put into the hands of the financial institutions
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  the very, very folks who created the situation
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  without any jurisdiction
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  without any vote and without any knowledge
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  by the American citizens where this is going
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:05.000]  this is your money, this is our money
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  this is our economy and this is absolute criminal behavior
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  George, Monday, I don't want to get your take on this
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:14.000]  because it segues into what you were just discussing
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  or dovetails, Bloomberg Financial
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  that I have a lot of respect for compared to any other publication
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  it's New World Order but it's for real people in the system
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:25.000]  so they tell the truth
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  most of the time but it said the headline was
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  $9.7 trillion so far in Banker bailout
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  and then it showed the numbers that that was over 90%
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:41.000]  of all mortgages at 2008 levels when they were worth more
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:45.000]  so they made us think this was all about bailing out mortgages
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:49.000]  but when they passed the Banker bailout bill on October 3rd, 2008
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  the next day on Saturday, Paulson said
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:55.000]  oh, we're not even going to use it for that now
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:16:57.000]  because that's not what it's for
[3:16:57.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  so they've already generated enough money to them
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  and they say it's secret where it went
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  to pay off 90% of the mortgages in the nation
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  so it's a complete fraud
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  so comment on that and then they won't say where the money's going
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:14.000]  where do you think it's going
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  they have some leaks that they're buying up infrastructure
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:19.000]  and they're taking the cash but...
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:21.000]  Well, the very first monies went to J.P. Morgan
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:23.000]  and I cannot prove this
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  but J.P. Morgan is very connected with the metals trade
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  especially with silver
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:30.000]  and about four and a half months ago
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:32.000]  silver was selling for $18.70
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:35.000]  and within about two weeks it went down to $11
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  and then down to $8.70
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  now at the very, very same period of time
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:44.000]  over 60% of the silver that is traded in this country
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:47.000]  over the counter in the small gun shops
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:49.000]  in the trading areas
[3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  and suddenly all of the silver disappeared
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:54.000]  and it's still very, very difficult to buy
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:56.000]  or find silver bullion
[3:17:56.000 --> 3:17:59.000]  now in a free market society
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  if the silver disappears or if it goes away
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  or if it's difficult
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  the price of the product or the commodity
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  should go up and up and up
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:12.000]  and yet the price went down by over 55%
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:15.000]  now quite clearly that is manipulation
[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  and because silver is a relatively small market
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:20.000]  it is easy to manipulate
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  and all the figures that we're talking about
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  don't even include the hundreds of billions
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  if not several one to two trillion dollars
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  that has been put into the plunge protection team
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  in the last year and a half
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:39.000]  and yesterday the market was down about 300 points
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  in the last half hour the market went up 200 points
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:44.000]  and quite clearly it went straight up
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  markets don't go straight up
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  and that it was clearly the auspices
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:52.000]  of the plunge protection team
[3:18:52.000 --> 3:18:55.000]  now the problem and again we're supposed to have
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:18:57.000]  a free country
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  we're supposed to have a free country
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:01.000]  and the accounting of the monies
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:04.000]  is the foundation or the basis
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  of what's going on
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  and if you can't account for the money
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:11.000]  and whether the number is 7 trillion
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  or whether it's 9 trillion
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  or whether it's 12 or 15 trillion
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  we don't know
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  but just when I was a city council member
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:22.000]  I always thought it was kind of interesting
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  because when we'd have a project
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  that would go for a couple hundred thousand dollars
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  or five hundred thousand dollars
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  there'd be debate for hours and hours
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  about where it would go
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:34.000]  but when the projects would get up to
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  you know 15-20 million dollars
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:38.000]  that was a number that was too big
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  for a lot of people to understand
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  and they'd just go
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  you know what do you think just pass it
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:45.000]  you know go ahead
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:47.000]  and now instead of talking about
[3:19:47.000 --> 3:19:49.000]  hundreds of thousands or millions
[3:19:49.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  or even billions now
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:54.000]  is that what we're talking about is trillions
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:56.000]  got a break got a break
[3:19:56.000 --> 3:19:57.000]  I'm back with George Humphrey
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:19:58.000]  I'm Alex Jones
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:01.000]  this is Genesis Communications Radio Network
[3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:05.000]  it's a new year full of uncertainties
[3:20:05.000 --> 3:20:07.000]  people are being laid off
[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:09.000]  in record numbers
[3:20:09.000 --> 3:20:11.000]  the price of food continues to rise
[3:20:11.000 --> 3:20:13.000]  and the economy continues to falter
[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:15.000]  you know that you need to prepare
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  and maybe you've been putting it off
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:19.000]  but the time to act is now
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:22.000]  that's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com

[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  may I have everybody's attention please
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  I've come with a message of information
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  9-Eleven was an inside job
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  Do you like being a puppet sir?
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  How do the American people know
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  that 9-Eleven was a stage?
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  that's for a lateral commission to see for
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  Do we sit down and shadow?
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  The day that we stop asking questions
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  of despotism to grow at our own door
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  7 years after the attacks of September 11th
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  a global awakening has taken place
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  An inside job?
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  How dare you?
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  If you know that there's treason going on
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  and if the government has not told the truth
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  Truth rising

[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:21.000]  We all want liberty
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  Some give their lives for it
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  A price that cannot be taken for granted
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  We forfeit bites and pieces of our freedom
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  For what?

[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  There might still be time to turn this around
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  But it's up to you, ladies and gentlemen
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  What are you gonna do?
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  They still have time, but still goodbye
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  Every time I think about it
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  But I know this, letting the same bankers
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  that have robbed the daylights out of the center
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:34.000]  engineering the society into hell
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  aren't gonna fix anything
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  Because they're doing what they want to do
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  To them, it is working just fine
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  George Humphrey, my guest in studio
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  George, let's continue with the economic line
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  you were going down with
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  the billions and the trillions
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  to the quadrillions
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  Actually, that word, quadrillions
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  first came up about eight or nine months ago
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  when we were talking about the number of derivatives
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  that are out in the system
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  A quadrillionth
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  I mean, these are numbers that people can't even understand
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  A trillion dollars, just to put it in perspective
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  that Jesus or Yeshua was born
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  If you had a big kitty and put a thousand dollars in the kitty
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  every single day
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  for every day of his life
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:30.000]  through the time of the disciples
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  through the time of Rome
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  through the dark ages
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  into the Renaissance
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  into the discovery of the West
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  into the colonization
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  into right now
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  A thousand dollars a day for the last two thousand years
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  the total amount would be 670 billion dollars
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  not even a trillion dollars
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  That's how much money we're talking about
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  And a quadrillion is a thousand trillion
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  A thousand trillion
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  And they're not talking about
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  I mean, we would have financial guests on a year or two ago saying
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  it's up to one and a half quadrillion
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  and then now we're seeing in mainstream news
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  and the total derivatives may be two quadrillion
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  They're now using that term
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  And we don't know
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  I mean, the point is, is anybody who says that they do know
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  is blowing smoke
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  because we don't know
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  because that information
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  But whether it is 50 trillion
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  or 100 trillion or 500 trillion
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  or a quadrillion, it doesn't make any difference
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:39.000]  The bomb has already killed the patient
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  It's all gone
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  The system is broke
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  And until we go back to constitutional money
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  until we eliminate the Federal Reserve Board
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  until we have a hard currency
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  the situation is going to get worse and worse and worse
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  And oh, about eight or nine years ago
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  when the Asian countries went down
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  is the United States went in there and they said
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  you've got to get rid of all of your toxic debts
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  And they kicked and screamed
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  and they kicked and screamed
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  but they finally got rid of their toxic debts
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  They had two or three years
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  and now the countries like Thailand and in Vietnam
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  and Indonesia are coming back up
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  and they're coming stronger
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:26.000]  because they got rid of their toxic debts
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  Now, 20 years ago when Japan went down
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  they didn't get rid of their toxic debts
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  and they've had 20 years of recession
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  Right now, we're just feeding all this money
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  good money after bad into these financial situations
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  and there is no way to stop the bleeding
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  There is no way to stop the bleeding
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  and unless we cut out the toxic debts
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  unless we take our medicine
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  unless we go back to constitutional money
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  it's just not going to happen
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  Unless we invest in productivity
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  unless we invest in sustainability
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  unless we invest in our people
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  it's not going to happen
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  and these are the choices that Alex is putting out to all of us
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  and now we have to become aware of it through this information war
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  and then share this information with our friends and families
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  and change the paradigm
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  Now, George, when you look at what the globalists have done
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  they want us dependent
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  they want us domesticated
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  they want us institutionalized
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  and they say in their own documents
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  that's why they paid for decades for companies
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  to leave the United States tax incentives
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  that's why they did everything they could
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  and now you look at their stimulus
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  it's only to expand their power control
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  and accelerate the debt
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  while telling us on the news
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  it's our fault we did it
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  and it is our fault in that we let the globalists carry this out
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  but that's like a kid who's five years old
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:51.000]  and doesn't listen to mom
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  and gets tricked into the back of a van
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  and gets raped and tortured to death
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  still, you don't blame the five-year-old
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  you blame the guy that kidnapped the child
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  and the kidnapper is the bankers
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  Oh, there's no question about it
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:03.000]  and it's just not the bankers in New York
[3:29:03.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  this has been an international cabal
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  instituted by Adam Weisshoff
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  and the Rothschilds back in 1776
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  and again, this is not conspiracy theory
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:15.000]  this is just plain fact
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:19.000]  they instituted, you know, the brains of Rothschild
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:22.000]  is to institute fiat currency
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  and he took over the bank nationality of Paris
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  he took over the Bank of England
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  he took over the Bank of Italy
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:30.000]  they've taken over the city
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  they've taken over Chase
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  and they've taken over the full
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  economic supply system
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  the IMF
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  stay there, let's recap that
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:39.000]  and get into Obama
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  yeah
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  the ultimate Trojan horse
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  groomed from birth
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  the evidence is clear
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:46.000]  his mother, a foundation minion
[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  of Geithner's father
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  and now he is here to betray
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  prepare yourselves
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:05.000]  the new multipolar inline and portable water system
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:07.000]  new from hempusa.org
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  now you can restructure and degas your water supply
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  from any source
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  rendering chemicals harmless to the human body
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  by polarizing the molecular structure
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:18.000]  imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  that helps the nervous system and brain
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:22.000]  there are no filters to buy
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:24.000]  and it can be taken anywhere
[3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  making it our number one new product from hempusa.org
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  this water system will descale all piping
[3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:32.000]  hot water heaters and appliances
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.000]  due to heavy buildup of hard minerals
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  detoxification may result with restructured water
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:38.000]  by easily entering the fine capillaries
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:46.000]  and fruits and proved taste, color, size
[3:30:46.000 --> 3:30:49.000]  and yield with approximately 30% less water usage
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:51.000]  there are multiple sizes also available
[3:30:51.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  for farms and commercial use
[3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:55.000]  visit hempusa.org

[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:04.000]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:08.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[3:31:08.000 --> 3:31:10.000]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[3:31:10.000 --> 3:31:12.000]  but who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  bin Laden
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:14.000]  VCC Zamos
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:16.000]  we have to look to the Middle East
[3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:18.000]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[3:31:18.000 --> 3:31:21.000]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:23.000]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[3:31:23.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  inside the United States
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:28.000]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[3:31:31.000 --> 3:31:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:37.000]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[3:31:37.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:41.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[3:31:41.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  the Israeli intelligence network
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:44.000]  war games
[3:31:44.000 --> 3:31:45.000]  the shadow government
[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:46.000]  and much, much more

[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:34.000]  we are back live thank you for joining us
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:36.000]  now think of our few of our sponsors
[3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  and then go right back to George Humphrey
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  right here in studio with us today
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  okay I want to again just tell you about a few of the sponsors
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  that make this transmission
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:51.000]  possible
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  one of them
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  is mysolarbackup.com
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  a lot of things can cut off your electrical power
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:00.000]  hurricanes, snow, ice, storms
[3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  listers should move towards getting off the grid
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  and here's a good way to do just that
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  a solar power generator is now available
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  from our long-time sponsor Solutions from Science
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  it's designed to provide 1800 watts of power
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  on demand in the event of any disaster or outage
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  you get an emergency power backup kit
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  which consists of the power source 1800 power plant
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:22.000]  endless electricity
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  remember too that gas generators need gas
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  but in blackouts gas pumps can't pump gas
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:29.000]  because they run on electricity
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  the solar generator is like having a silent power plant
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  hidden in your home
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  it's the perfect emergency backup for trouble times

[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  non-gmo, non-hybrid
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  all their seeds date back over a century
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  their Mayflower bean came over from the Mayflower ship

[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:07.000]  okay George
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  first of all I'd like to say thank you to your sponsors
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  because those companies
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  I have solar on my house it provides about 30% of my power
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  and everybody has to be aware
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  you've got to start planting your victory gardens
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  right now
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  your food is going to be
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  the massive roadblock
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  and while you're out there planning it and enjoying it
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  you're meant to dig in the dirt and see earthworms
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  your children just love it they don't want to watch TV
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  give them a chance
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  and then while you're planting and doing this
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  you'll get spiritually centered and think about
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  how you're fighting the new world order and it's the journey
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  of a thousand miles starts with that single step
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  in a very small space
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  if you do it right
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  you can grow a tremendous amount of food
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  so just think about it
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  get some solar
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  get a car that gets at least 30 miles a gallon
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  get a victory garden
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  start becoming sustainable
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  right now and that's real sustainable
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  not their counterfeit sustainable
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:02.000]  which they mean control now George
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  let's get into
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  Obama
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  I mean if you were standing before
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:10.000]  a group of well-meaning Obama people
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  that new bush was bad
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  and evil the torture
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:16.000]  the secret arrest of wars
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  and then the media craftily
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  the same media that put him in power
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  transmuted all the hatred of bush
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  onto love of Obama
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  and then now he's completely already just a month in office
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  betrayed all that
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  layout as if you're speaking to a lot of them
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  but directly to them they're watching this
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  online they're listening to this on the radio
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  they're seeing this a month from now
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  when he's done even more horrible things versus the rhetoric
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  they have the phony right-wing attacking
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:42.000]  to make the left of fending
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  they have all these tricks
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  but breakdown as an economist
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  as a former city council member
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  as an author or researcher
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  what you see happening with Obama
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  well this is not a theoretical discussion
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  because I had this discussion just a couple of days ago
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  with some very very dear friends of mine
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  very well educated
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  they love this country
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  they're learning about things
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  they were very you know and they come from
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  families and they've done a lot of things
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  and they were so
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  opposed to what bush was doing
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  that they
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  and then they see Obama
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  quite clearly brother obama
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  is one of the most articulate
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  intelligent and charismatic
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  figures ever to come
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  in front of the american people
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  and I applaud the leaders
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  the Illuminati or the power leader
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  whatever you want to call these rascals
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  for creating this character
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  perfect
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  opposition to bush
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  who was clearly not the sharpest tool
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  on the shed and this Obama
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  man I want to like him
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  I want to like him
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  but you know what
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  a tree is judged by its
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  fruit
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  a tree is judged by its fruit
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  and brother in telling the truth
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  to me is
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  step number one and Obama
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  when he first came out
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  he got a lot of support from the left wing
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  because he was
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  supposedly opposed to the wars
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  in the Middle East
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  he voted against the war in Iraq
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  he's talked about Afghanistan
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  he said we're going to get out
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  of the Middle East
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  and we're going to be out of
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  out of Iraq and Afghanistan
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  he talked to us
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  about change and transparency
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  something that we all want
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  he said that he would do something
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  he would work
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  for the environment
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  he said that he would work to clean up
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  this financial disaster
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  he would work to help us
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  get better education
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  and health care for the people of this country
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  now
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  the son of a gun went you know
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  and again
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  knowing everything that I knew
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  and I knew where his money was coming from
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  but I listened and I listened and I listened
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  but within one month
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  he is
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  absolutely completely
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  betrayed 100%
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  betrayed the American people
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  and quite, quite clearly
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  brother Obama
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  is the most
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  fancy the most
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  the most decorated
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  the most expensive Trojan horse
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  in the history of what western culture
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  this guy's amazing
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  so let's just take a look
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  at his appointments
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  because you can always tell
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  a person by the company
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  he surrounds himself with
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  he said he was going to get us out
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  of the war in Iraq
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  well, he reappointed Bill Gates
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  one of the architects of the war
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  a guy who's a member of the CFR
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  in the Bilderberger and the guy who is a hard
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  line hawk
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  he's already broken his promise about
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  getting troops out of Iraq
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  and he is for
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  he is for more war
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  and sending
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  more troops to Afghanistan
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  he is for putting
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  nuclear weapons
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  in Poland and Ukraine
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  in Georgia
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  aimed at Russia
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  now this is a part of the puzzle
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  that's never talked about
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  and I'm not pro-Russian
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  but I can understand
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  why the Russians have a
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  bur under their saddle because
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  if the Russians were pointing nuclear weapons
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  at us they would be very
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  we would be very upset
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  and Obama
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  is supporting
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  putting short term
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  intermediate range
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  nuclear missiles
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  pointed at Moscow
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  in the Ukraine
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  in Poland and in Georgia
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  this is an act of war my friends
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  and this man is not a man of peace
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  his
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  director, his justice department man
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  Eric Holder
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  now the second amendment
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  was put number two
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  very very clearly
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  by our founding fathers
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  because they wanted us to be free
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  and the second amendment
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  is about us, we
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  the citizens of this country
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  defending themselves
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  Eric Holder is on record
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  saying
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  that the second amendment
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  was only intended
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  for the military
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  Obama clearly
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  is first going to go after the ammunition
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  and then he's going to go after the weapons
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  and
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  these weapons are what keeps us
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  free
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  my mentor
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  my biggest, the person I
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  I read more about
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  than anybody else is Mahatma Gandhi
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  I go to India every year, I believe in Satra Daha
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  and even Gandhi
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  said it is better
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  to join the army and die
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  fighting for your country
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  than to be a coward
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  and I don't think that we
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  clearly we don't want to go into violence
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  right now, that would play in the hands of the power elite
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  but we can't lie down to this
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  we cannot allow this to happen
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  it's the willingness to fight back
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  that keeps the enemy from going
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  for the full move because they know
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:10.000]  there's a large contingent of people
[3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  and I would say at least 10 million
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  who are ready to go
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:16.000]  and what's so wonderful is that in the gun stores
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:18.000]  all across the country
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  gun sales are up between 75 to
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  150%
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  in the last three months
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:26.000]  people of this country, good people of this country
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  people who are not violent
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:30.000]  people who believe in the republic
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  people who believe in the rule of law
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:34.000]  realize that they need to arm themselves
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  and so, you know, again
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:38.000]  none of us are advocating violence
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:40.000]  what we are advocating
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  is the protection of our bill of rights
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:44.000]  the protection of our republic
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:46.000]  the protection of the rule of law
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  and the protection of our families and our culture
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  well, George, they're building FEMA camps
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  they are militarizing the police
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:54.000]  they are building an army against us
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:56.000]  and we have to defend ourselves
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  well, absolutely
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  and, you know, and
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:02.000]  the reason that we're on
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:04.000]  radio and television and writing books
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:06.000]  right now is so it doesn't
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  come to that
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  and if you, if you're friends
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:12.000]  if you're family, if you're acquaintances
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  if the people in the grocery stores
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  become aware of this and stand up and say
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  no, it doesn't have to come to this
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  the choice is right now
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  either we can stand up and protect this country
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  right now, or it's going to come to this
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  come to a situation
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  that is very unpleasant
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:30.000]  and then we go into his appointment
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  secretary of treasury
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  this guy is just amazing
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  his name is Timothy Gettner
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  and this guy is
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  he is a true
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  work of art
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  he was the head of the
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  Federal Reserve in New York
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:48.000]  which is the most powerful of the
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  branch banks
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  he worked at the treasury
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:54.000]  he is close, close, close with Paulson
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  who in my mind is an economic Nazi
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:44:58.000]  he
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:45:00.000]  worked at the IMF but he was also
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  not just a member of
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:04.000]  but a paid employee
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  of the council on foreign relations
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  you talk about, you know, saying the
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  fox has been hired to guard the
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:14.000]  henhouse is such a lame analogy
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:16.000]  we're talking about
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  the criminals, criminals
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:22.000]  who created the situation
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  Paulson, Gettner, Goldman Sachs
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:26.000]  JP Morgan, Citibank, Chase
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:28.000]  the whole group of them
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  with the epicenter at Goldman Sachs
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  and JP Morgan
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  who created the structured investment vehicles
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:36.000]  who created these toxic waste
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  who created these derivatives
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  who made
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  millions and billions in some cases
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  trillions on the way up
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:46.000]  looting the American treasuries
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:48.000]  looting the value of this country
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:50.000]  are now making even more
[3:45:50.000 --> 3:45:52.000]  on the way down
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:54.000]  and this guy
[3:45:54.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  the fact that there is not more outrage
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  about this is just amazing
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  number four, secretary of state
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:02.000]  Hillary Clinton
[3:46:02.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  secretary of state
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  and I remember
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  15, 16 years ago
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  I was writing a book about
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:12.000]  called common sense and one of the chapters
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  was about the Clintons
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  and I went up to Arkansas
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:18.000]  and I heard a lot of rumors about
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  what the Clintons had done in Mina, Arkansas
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  and I know that Alex
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  has talked about Mina, Arkansas
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:26.000]  hundreds of times here
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  and I just didn't believe
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:30.000]  that the
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  shenanigans, not shenanigans
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  because it's not shenanigans, it's cold blood at murder
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  a lot of it's on record
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  it's absolutely on record
[3:46:38.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  is that there are 90
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:42.000]  and you can look this up
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:44.000]  on the web
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:46.000]  there are 93 people
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:48.000]  back in the 80s
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  in the 90s
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:52.000]  who were all in their teens
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  20s, 30s and 40s
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:56.000]  who all died violent deaths
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:58.000]  and their only common denominator
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:00.000]  was their connection with Clintons
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:02.000]  now the potential for this
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:04.000]  not to be connected
[3:47:04.000 --> 3:47:06.000]  is four and a half billion to one
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  and Hillary Clinton
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  yeah, she's very intelligent
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:12.000]  she's hardworking
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:14.000]  but how has this changed, he promised
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:16.000]  change, he brought in all the old Bush and Clinton guard
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:18.000]  he promised
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:20.000]  no lobbyist
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  he promised change
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:24.000]  every single one
[3:47:24.000 --> 3:47:26.000]  his appointments
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  the only change is a change in the names
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:30.000]  they're all members of the council on foreign relations
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  most of them are members of the Bilderberg
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:34.000]  they are all the status quo
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  from the 1990s
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  and folks
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  if you can't see this
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  no matter how handsome he is
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  no matter how sweetly he speaks
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  no matter how much
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  how much good rock and roll music
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  there is
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:52.000]  and I would have loved to go on to the inauguration
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:54.000]  because I love Shakira
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:56.000]  and I love Bruce Springsteen
[3:47:56.000 --> 3:47:58.000]  and I love all that stuff
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:00.000]  but it's just stuff
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:02.000]  words and actions are what are important
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:04.000]  then we go down to homeland security
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  and Janet
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  what's her last name
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  Napolitano
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:12.000]  another lobbyist
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:14.000]  he doesn't appoint anyone that isn't a lobbyist
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  and it's like 20, 30, 40 people deep
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  in the command structure
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:20.000]  this is the lobbyist administration
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:22.000]  and then you have the head of the CIA
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  Lou Panetta
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:26.000]  Leon Panetta
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  he is the biggest
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:30.000]  and he's rated as the biggest
[3:48:30.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  wall street lobbyist in the world
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:34.000]  what the heck is this guy doing
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  head of the CIA
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:38.000]  but the CIA and the Pentagon
[3:48:38.000 --> 3:48:40.000]  and the treasury and the IMF
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:42.000]  are all one organization
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  these folks are the power
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  elite mafia
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:48.000]  democrat
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  republican
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:52.000]  they're all mafia up there
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:54.000]  if you can't look at Joe Biden
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:56.000]  and see that he's a mafia down
[3:48:56.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  then you're not paying attention
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:00.000]  now the one appointment
[3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:02.000]  that gets under my skin
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  perhaps more than anybody else
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  is the fellow who walks around
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:08.000]  at his right hand hip 24-7
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:10.000]  the guy who is in his room
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:12.000]  at 6 in the morning
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:14.000]  and who stays with him
[3:49:14.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  until 11 o'clock at night
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  Ram Emanuel
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:20.000]  folks, if you don't know
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:22.000]  about brother Ram Emanuel
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:24.000]  he's brilliant, he went to
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  high school up in North Chicago
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  he's absolutely a brilliant guy
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  he's hard
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  he's a hard worker
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  and he knows the political ranks
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:36.000]  his father
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:38.000]  was an assassin
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  before
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  Israel was a country
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:44.000]  he would kill British envoys
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:46.000]  he wasn't just Palestinians
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:48.000]  he wouldn't just kill Palestinians
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:50.000]  he would kill Brits
[3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:52.000]  and not that one is more valuable
[3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  a Brit is not more valuable
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:56.000]  he was one of the heads of the Ergon terrorist
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:49:58.000]  absolutely he is
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  most of Ram Emanuel's family
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  has dual citizenship with Israel
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:04.000]  he is the political Zionist
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:06.000]  Zionist
[3:50:06.000 --> 3:50:08.000]  and a lot of people don't know
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  what political Zionism is
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:12.000]  it's not about anti-Semitism
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:14.000]  it's not about being Jewish
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  it's not about anything like that
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  it is a group of people who believe
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  that they are the chosen ones
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:22.000]  and who have this false persona
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  and who have absolute
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:26.000]  total control
[3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:28.000]  the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:30.000]  and what's going on
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:32.000]  Ram Emanuel right now
[3:50:32.000 --> 3:50:34.000]  wants to nuke Iran
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  not just the military bases
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:38.000]  he wants to nuke Tehran
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  and he wants compulsory national service
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  for us to be government slaves
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:44.000]  stay there, final segment George
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:46.000]  interview after the show for the film
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  and probably use some of this for the film
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:50.000]  so we can get to go back over all this again
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  as soon as we get off and more
[3:50:52.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  but to try to go through all that
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:50:56.000]  you've got the Deputy Secretary of Defense
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:50:58.000]  was the top Raytheon lobbyist
[3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  he's continuing the torture
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:02.000]  blocked the British from stopping it
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:04.000]  he just lies about everything
[3:51:04.000 --> 3:51:06.000]  there is growing evidence that Americans would have better health
[3:51:06.000 --> 3:51:08.000]  and a lower incidence of cancer
[3:51:08.000 --> 3:51:10.000]  if they consumed more iodine

[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  They're gonna be way down below it.
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:26.000]  Yeah, we're taking fight. We're never gonna give it up.
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  We're standing tall. We're getting up there in the catapult.
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:34.000]  Yeah, I see why it's so cool.
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:36.000]  Hey, man, you're gonna get fired up.
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  You too, man.
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  It's exciting fighting this tyranny.
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  Really being alive.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  This is where the action is. Where else, what other thing can you talk about except about freedom, the protection of your country, the protection of your family, the stopping of these pirates, and then you make all these great new friends, and then it opens you up to all sorts of different concepts.
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  And this is what's called the first awakening, the awareness that the whole political and economic structure is totally manipulated, and that there are pirates in control of the ship.
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:34.000]  And then, so we learn about ways to deal with this, and then is the spiritual aspect of this, because quite clearly, they've got more guns, they've got more money, they've got more soldiers.
[3:55:34.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  Now, we're growing.
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  But they admit 90% of the fight is the mind.
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:38.000]  Absolutely.
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:44.000]  If we just simply refuse to get outside the box, and folks, you don't have to defeat the whole New World War yourself in 10 seconds.
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:47.000]  It's deciding you're not with it. It's a spiritual decision.
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  Absolutely. It is a spiritual, psychological mental decision.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:54.000]  It is the law of intention.
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:56:05.000]  And if each one of us become aware of our own power, and the fact that God does not make junk, God doesn't make junk.
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:08.000]  Yeshua, Jesus talked about taking control.
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:10.000]  He said, you'll do greater miracles than I will.
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:26.000]  Be people of peace, but be strong, and be aware that through the law of intention, the law of creation, the law of allowance, and the law of harmony, is that we can create whatever type of world we want.
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:38.000]  Now, quite clearly, the wizards of the Illuminati, who are very, very advanced people, know about these universal laws, and they have been manipulating us through our food, through the chemtrails,
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  through our education, through our media, to make us feel that we are victims, to make us feel that we are weak.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:46.000]  To make us feel weak?
[3:56:46.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  Yes.
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:50.000]  But if you know you're under attack, you can actually use that attack to make yourself even stronger.
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  Well, that's the first thing, is to get some power in your heart, to bring up that fire, but to also understand that this is going to be more like to win.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:08.000]  And I'm here to win this thing, not to be a martyr.
[3:57:08.000 --> 3:57:21.000]  But if we go head to head with them right now, they're pretty tough, but it's like an Akito match, and we're going to use their power, just like Cassius Clay or Muhammad Ali did the rope-a-dope against Foreman.
[3:57:21.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  We let them use their power for them to dissipate their power.
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:33.000]  9-11 is horrible and as tragic as it was.
[3:57:33.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  It was a failure for the enemy.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  It was a total failure for them, and it allowed us, people like you and I and many others, to get the message out.
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:41.000]  And at first, we were derided.
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:42.000]  People would laugh at us.
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:44.000]  But we were willing to commit.
[3:57:44.000 --> 3:57:47.000]  You know, I lost most of my affiliates when I did that, and we built them back up.
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:49.000]  Now that I'm bashing Obama, some affiliates are dropping.
[3:57:49.000 --> 3:57:51.000]  I could care less.
[3:57:51.000 --> 3:57:58.000]  It's about the truth and never compromising and knowing that we'll reach even more down the road when it's proven that we were right.
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:01.000]  George Humphrey, we're going to do an interview here now after the show.
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:02.000]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[3:58:02.000 --> 3:58:06.000]  We had two state reps on today from New Hampshire.
[3:58:06.000 --> 3:58:07.000]  Very powerful.
[3:58:07.000 --> 3:58:08.000]  We had Bob Chapman on.
[3:58:08.000 --> 3:58:10.000]  I covered this amazing.
[3:58:10.000 --> 3:58:14.000]  Is FEMA and DHS preparing for mass graves in Marshall Law near Chicago?
[3:58:14.000 --> 3:58:16.000]  I covered that at the bottom of the next hour.
[3:58:16.000 --> 3:58:24.000]  And at the start, I got into how they're coming into everybody's houses in Austin and businesses and putting in remote control thermostats.
[3:58:24.000 --> 3:58:27.000]  You got to see no to them coming in your house and doing this, folks.
[3:58:27.000 --> 3:58:28.000]  They've got the same thing in California.
[3:58:28.000 --> 3:58:32.000]  So that's coming up in the retransmission right now at oneplaceinfullwars.com.
[3:58:32.000 --> 3:58:35.000]  See you back this Sunday with guests on the Chicago camps.
[3:58:35.000 --> 3:58:36.000]  4 to 6 p.m.
[3:58:36.000 --> 3:58:37.000]  George, thank you.
[3:58:37.000 --> 3:58:39.000]  Hey, brother.
[3:58:39.000 --> 3:58:40.000]  That's it.
