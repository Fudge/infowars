[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  We made it outside, we made it about a block. We made it at least two blocks, and we started running. Floor by floor, it started popping out.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  It was like they had detonated. Yeah, detonated. They took down a building. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  All the way down. I was watching it and running. We ran up West. And then you just sort of, this cloud of **** chasing you down.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  Alright, we've got other clips of Dan Rather and Peter Jennings saying looks like controlled demolition.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  But here is emergency worker Kevin McFadden on national radio. Two years ago, we just learned of this.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  There are so many witnesses talking about the controlled demolition of the buildings. Here it is.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]  It was surreal. It was surreal from the start, like immediately. I went to local stores.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  I got equipment that I could procure, tools, anything that I could put together, food.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  And I just ran over the Williamsburg Bridge and ran downtown.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  Actually, I ran to Betsy Street Church, I believe it was, where I was staging with the Red Cross.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  And that wound up being like a lot of bureaucracy and nonsense.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  But even then, they said, hey, you know, you've got to stay behind this line because they're thinking about taking this building down.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  They're not sure if it's a stable or not. So they were holding a line off because they had knowledge that something was going to happen.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]  Well, you know, they they pushed us back a little bit. About 15 minutes later, you know, actually a couple minutes later, they started coming down.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  They let the border through. People started coming back out into the street.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  We watched like five New York City buses jam packed with people wanting to do search and rescue head down there towards Building 7.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  People walked out into the middle of the street to see these people off like like Bon Voyage.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  And right then, Building 7 came down and it was a stampede.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  And people were just mowing people over, just trampling.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  I picked a woman up off the ground and I thought I maybe touched her the wrong way.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  And she turned around and took a swing at me. And I said, no, no, no, no, you've got to run that way.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  Like run like you never did before. I actually gave her a little kick in the rear.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  It was like about four, like three or four o'clock in the afternoon on the 11th.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]  I'm not sure exactly about the time because I was there for four and a half days.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  And all I could really attest to with time is that I woke up three times and everything else was.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  And we're going to continue to research these and get these individuals on.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  Let's be clear now. Let's be crystal clear here.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  The feds and Silverstein have tried to implicate the firefighters because they took orders.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  They told the fire department, i.e. Silverstein and the feds were running that drill,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]  oh, we don't know if this thing's safe, so we're going to go ahead and bring it down so it falls cleanly.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  And then when you talk about how the fire department said, get back, we're going to bring the building down,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  then the feds will say, the attack dogs, oh, you're blaming the firefighters for blowing it up.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  No, they were told to get back. They're going to bring it down for safety reasons.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  So that's Silverstein, knowing the stories out there, trying to plant that as an out for himself.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  As I said four years ago when this story broke, as I'm still saying today,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  and, you know, now we need to do this for a long time because we've interviewed so many,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  talked to so many, gotten so many clips, it's in Marshall Law, it's in TerrorStorm.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  We just have to go get all the clips and all the people and all the news articles and all the audio clips,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  there's probably 75 of them, guesstimation, and post them all in one big motherlode story on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  And then you've got to get it and just take it out there and, you know, headline. There can be no doubt.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  Scores of eyewitnesses told to get back that Building 7 was going to be brought down.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  Control demo. No debating it. Open and shut case. New world order operation.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  Grand jury should be calling people in for testimonies. Indictment should be zipping out everywhere.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  And again, people have a mind conditioning where immediately when they hear, they go, okay, well, they had to bring it down.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  Well, the point is they lied about it and they couldn't plant bombs in a few hours.
