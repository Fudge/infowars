[00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.408]  We made it outside, we made it about a block.
[00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:08.291]  We made it at least two blocks, and we started running.
[00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.253]  Floor by floor, it started popping out.
[00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:11.814]  It was just, it had detonated.
[00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:12.574]  Yeah, it detonated.
[00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:14.656]  You could have a player take down a building.
[00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:16.137]  Boom, boom, boom.
[00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:16.778]  All the way down.
[00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:18.199]  I was watching it, and we're on it.
[00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.200]  Just ran upwind.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.861]  And then you just sort of, this cloud of...
[00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:24.044]  All right.
[00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:28.448]  We've got other clips of Dan Rather and Peter Jennings saying, looks like controlled demolition.
[00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:32.993]  But here is emergency worker Kevin McFadden on National Radio.
[00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:39.179]  Two years ago, we just learned of this, there's so many witnesses talking about the controlled demolition of the buildings.
[00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:40.540]  Here it is.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.642]  It was surreal.
[00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.965]  It was surreal from the start, like immediately.
[00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:57.239]  I went to local stores, I got equipment that I could procure, tools, anything that I could put together, food, and I just ran over the Williamsburg Bridge and ran downtown.
[00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.588]  Actually, I ran to Bessie Street, Bessie and Church, I believe it was, where I was staging with the Red Cross, and that wound up being, like, a lot of bureaucracy and nonsense.
[00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.040]  But even then, they said, hey, you know, you got to stay behind this line because they're thinking about taking this building down.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.524]  They're not sure if it's stable or not.
[00:01:15.524 --> 00:01:19.450]  So they were holding a line off because they had knowledge that something was going to happen.
[00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:28.065]  Well, you know, they pushed us back a little bit and about 15 minutes later, they, you know, actually like a couple minutes later, they started calming down.
[00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.107]  They let the border through.
[00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:32.288]  People started coming back out into the street.
[00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:40.195]  We watched like five New York City buses jam-packed with people wanting to do search and rescue head down there towards Building 7.
[00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:45.939]  People walked out into the middle of the street to see these people off like Bon Voyage.
[00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:53.318]  Right then, Building 7 came down, and it was a stampede.
[00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:57.660]  And people were just mowing people over, just trampling them.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.202]  I picked a woman up off the ground, and I thought I maybe touched her the wrong way, and she turned around and took a swing at me.
[00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:06.182]  And I said, no, no, no, no, you gotta run that way.
[00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:07.903]  Like, run like you never did before.
[00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:10.684]  I actually gave her a little kick in the rear.
[00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:19.221]  It was like about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon on the 11th.
[00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:31.069]  I'm not sure exactly about the time because I was there for four and a half days and all I could really attest to with time is that I woke up three times.
[00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.932]  And everything else was just... And we're going to continue to research these and get these individuals on.
[00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:36.893]  Let's be clear now.
[00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.696]  Let's be crystal clear here.
[00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:46.957]  The Feds and Silverstein have tried to implicate the firefighters because they took orders.
[00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:48.738]  They told the fire department, i.e.
[00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:55.859]  Silverstein and the Feds were running that drill, oh we don't know if this thing's safe so we're gonna go ahead and bring it down so it falls cleanly.
[00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:03.481]  And then when you talk about how the fire department said get back we're gonna bring the building down then the Feds will say, the attack dogs, oh you're blaming the firefighters for blowing it up.
[00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:06.742]  No, they were told get back they're gonna bring it down for safety reasons.
[00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:12.940]  So that's Silverstein knowing the stories out there, trying to plant that as an out for himself.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.362]  As I said four years ago, and this story broke, as I'm still saying today.
[00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:20.224]  And, you know, now we need to do this for a long time.
[00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:23.005]  Because we've interviewed so many, talked to so many, gotten so many clips.
[00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.086]  It's in Martial Law.
[00:03:25.086 --> 00:03:26.807]  It's in Terror Storm.
[00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:30.628]  We just have to go get all the clips, and all the people, and all the news articles, and all the audio clips.
[00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:31.449]  There's probably 75 of them.
[00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:34.245]  Guestimation.
[00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:39.808]  And post them all in one big motherload story on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:44.091]  And then you've got to get it and just take it out there and headline.
[00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:45.732]  There can be no doubt.
[00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:49.594]  Scores of eyewitnesses told to get back that Building 7 was going to be brought down.
[00:03:49.594 --> 00:03:50.955]  Controlled demo.
[00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:52.496]  No debating it.
[00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:53.777]  Open and shut case.
[00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.057]  New world order operation.
[00:03:55.057 --> 00:03:57.699]  Grand jury should be calling people in for testimonies.
[00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.580]  Indictment should be zipping out everywhere.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.382]  And again, people have a mind
[00:04:03.903 --> 00:04:06.984]  Conditioning where immediately when they hear they go, okay, well they had to bring it down.
[00:04:06.984 --> 00:04:08.605]  Well the point is they lied about it.
[00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:11.806]  And they couldn't plant bombs in a few hours.
