[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.131]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.892]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.892 --> 00:00:09.653]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.234]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.774]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:16.977]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:21.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:31.773]  It's Wednesday, the 23rd day of March 2016.
[00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:33.834]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.496]  We'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:39.498]  I have another big broadcast lined up for you, obviously.
[00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:47.723]  Larry Nichols has big intel on the race war Obama's trying to basically stage slash class war.
[00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:51.719]  And he's been predicting it for the last year.
[00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.700]  He's out of the hospital.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.163]  He's going to be joining us for 30 minutes, the first half of the next hour.
[00:00:57.163 --> 00:01:08.111]  Dr. Kelly Ward, who is beating John McCain 3, 5, 8 and even 10 points in scientific polls there in Arizona.
[00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:14.295]  She will be joining us to talk about Obamacare, this election and more.
[00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:15.416]  Leanne McAdoo.
[00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:24.281]  He is going to be popping in on the broadcast as well, twice today.
[00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:41.956]  Wants to talk about some of their experiences here at the InfoWar, but also I want to get her in, because I saw her about an hour ago, 45 minutes ago or so, back in the office, and she was saying, did you see what Donald Trump was talking about last night on CNN?
[00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.018]  And I went and I actually, we're getting the transcript,
[00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:47.027]  And I specifically went and looked it up.
[00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:54.671]  We've got the video clip talking about all the surveillance, all the police state to keep us safe, and how great that's all going to be.
[00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:58.373]  Here's my problem.
[00:01:58.373 --> 00:02:02.995]  If we're going to make America great again, America has to be free again.
[00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:04.616]  And I think Donald Trump means well.
[00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:08.118]  He's right about the trade deals, the globalists hate him for real reasons.
[00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:10.439]  But we need to influence Trump to understand
[00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:13.785]  They have plenty of surveillance.
[00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:20.110]  The FBI knew two years before who the San Bernardino shooters were, and were ordered to stand down.
[00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.214]  Now, I've called the situation over in Brussels a false flag.
[00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:26.816]  It's a real terrorist attack, probably.
[00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:28.898]  There's real Islamic terror, but who brought them in?
[00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:29.818]  Who protected them?
[00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:34.542]  If you open the door, and you're part of it, then it's a staged government event.
[00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:36.184]  Even if there's real actors.
[00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.592]  But probably a better word is a stand down is probably better than a false flag.
[00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:48.133]  I saw a big debate in a video I shot for Facebook Mentions about whether it was a false flag or not.
[00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:52.594]  Most people agreed you could call it that, but really it'd be better to call it a stand down.
[00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:56.115]  Let it happen, which is just as bad.
[00:02:56.115 --> 00:03:05.778]  The point is they're bringing these people in unvetted and then acting like Donald Trump has 14 heads and then he's from Mars when he says we should just have basic border security.
[00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:11.335]  So I like Donald Trump, and I want to support him.
[00:03:11.335 --> 00:03:19.178]  But man, you know, this whole thing, I told you months ago the FBI can get into iPhones, and it was in the news Sunday and Monday.
[00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:20.918]  Oh, Fox News broke it!
[00:03:20.918 --> 00:03:21.498]  Guess what?
[00:03:21.498 --> 00:03:24.199]  They were already in the iPhone, they have ways to get around it.
[00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.460]  I've talked to tech people, it's not even that hard.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.421]  Especially with an older version.
[00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:36.103]  iPhones are harder than droids, but it can be done, and it's not even close to super hard.
[00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:38.347]  And that's now confirmed.
[00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:40.848]  Again, you heard it here first.
[00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:42.689]  Now, separate that though.
[00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.792]  I've got my concerns about Trump, but man, Ted Cruz.
[00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:52.115]  Goldman Sachs CFR, work for Bush Senior.
[00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:56.097]  His wife helped honcho TPP NAU.
[00:03:56.097 --> 00:04:01.061]  And he said it here last Wednesday, and it now came true last night and this morning.
[00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.523]  Jeb Bush, as bad as it gets.
[00:04:04.523 --> 00:04:06.344]  Mr. New World Order himself.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.542]  Has now endorsed Ted Cruz.
[00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:15.804]  Ted Cruz has supported NSA spying.
[00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:18.605]  Speaks out against it, but supports it.
[00:04:18.605 --> 00:04:24.248]  See, it's kind of refreshing to have Trump running around saying it's a great idea, even though I disagree with him.
[00:04:24.248 --> 00:04:27.209]  At least in his mind, he thinks, you know, stop the terrorists.
[00:04:29.653 --> 00:04:34.834]  But this is really, really another nail in the political coffin, in my view, of Ted Cruz.
[00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:45.856]  I mean, I can just see him getting into the presidency, and then George W. Bush was like, against interventionism and pro-gun and all this stuff, till he got into the White House, and then all that went by the wayside.
[00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:52.997]  We're gonna open the phones up, get your take on this as well, the latest on the terror attacks over in Brussels, Belgium, and more.
[00:04:52.997 --> 00:04:55.818]  Hey, did you know that one American was in all three bombings?
[00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:19.394]  I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times, because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer, and that all the very many adverse effects, which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:24.500]  That was a statement made in April 2014 by a French medical doctor, Bernard Delberg.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.886]  He's a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Merck, the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine Gardasil.
[00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:37.454]  And now, almost two years later, Dr. Sing-Hang Lee, director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in Connecticut, has proved these predictions correct.
[00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:39.094]  He published a letter sent to the U.S.
[00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:53.038]  CDC, the World Health Organization, and the Ministry of Health in Japan, and others, documenting scientific misconduct among the world's leading health organizations tasked with providing vaccine safety by deliberately misleading Japanese health authorities on the safety of the HPV vaccine.

[00:08:09.207 --> 00:08:14.728]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:20.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:28.011]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, freedom is what generates wealth and is what generates rates.
[00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:35.412]  Tony Montana and Scarface says, first you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the woman.
[00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:38.513]  Well, that's not really my experience.
[00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:47.445]  First you get the freedom, then you get the greatness, then you get the civilization.
[00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:57.332]  The problem is, then you get the corruption and the decadence that sets in from a great nation, a great society, a wealthy power.
[00:08:57.332 --> 00:09:00.615]  But even before freedom comes honor, even before
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.161]  We can make America free again.
[00:09:04.161 --> 00:09:06.462]  We must make America honorable again.
[00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:19.006]  I know so many people that think lying and twisting and engaging in disinformation is what gives them power to rule over and con ignorant people.
[00:09:19.006 --> 00:09:26.369]  That is the blood, that is the ether, that is the atmosphere of oppression and enslavement.
[00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:30.831]  And it will ultimately bring down the very parasites that use it to come to power.
[00:09:31.678 --> 00:09:32.643]  It is the plague.
[00:09:32.643 --> 00:09:34.551]  It is anathema.
[00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:36.981]  It is a total and complete fraud.
[00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:50.138]  I have a hat that I wear out in public only to condition the brainwashed, politically correct folks in liberal areas of Austin, Texas.
[00:09:50.138 --> 00:09:55.061]  It's a camouflage hat, Make America Great Again, that I got from the Donald Trump website.
[00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:59.503]  My son likes to wear the red one that says it has an American flag on the side.
[00:09:59.503 --> 00:10:03.726]  No, Trump's not a sponsor, I'm just making a point here.
[00:10:03.726 --> 00:10:07.268]  My older daughter also likes Trump and wears Trump T-shirts.
[00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.491]  That's their choice.
[00:10:09.491 --> 00:10:11.912]  And I say, don't completely trust Trump.
[00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:12.953]  He could have some problems.
[00:10:12.953 --> 00:10:15.614]  He could turn around and bite us in the rear end.
[00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:20.337]  But I still wear it so that people can ridicule me.
[00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:21.838]  I don't wear it in conservative areas.
[00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:37.048]  I wear it so my children can watch me not care when trendies get upset by something, so they can learn that what matters is what's going on inside of you that you know is right from your own research and your own history, not what jellyfish think.
[00:10:37.944 --> 00:10:41.267]  But I will say this.
[00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:47.673]  I'm backing Trump because the establishment is scared to death of him and he's right on maybe 7 out of 10 major issues.
[00:10:47.673 --> 00:10:49.755]  He's wrong on surveillance.
[00:10:49.755 --> 00:10:52.018]  He's wrong on police state.
[00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:55.201]  He is wrong on things like torture.
[00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:56.842]  And he's reversed himself on torture.
[00:10:57.563 --> 00:10:59.324]  Partially on the surveillance.
[00:10:59.324 --> 00:11:14.013]  I told everybody months ago, because it's known that they have a backdoor, not through the front-end encryption, but to break into the hardware and the hard drive of the iPhone.
[00:11:14.013 --> 00:11:15.794]  Especially if it's an older version.
[00:11:15.794 --> 00:11:17.635]  It's easy if it's an older version.
[00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.916]  It's harder if it's brand new.
[00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:20.517]  That's why they're always updating it.
[00:11:20.517 --> 00:11:23.779]  They've gone to a six-digit code if you're not using the thumbprint.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.684]  Apple's are some of the best because it's a closed system.
[00:11:30.684 --> 00:11:31.685]  Obviously.
[00:11:31.685 --> 00:11:32.866]  A very evil company.
[00:11:32.866 --> 00:11:34.548]  But I'm stating their security's better.
[00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:35.609]  I'm not an IT person.
[00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:37.211]  I just read the top reviews.
[00:11:37.211 --> 00:11:39.754]  I've experienced it myself.
[00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:42.597]  And they came out in the last two days and admitted the news.
[00:11:42.597 --> 00:11:44.920]  Okay, the FBI actually did get in the phone.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.542]  Okay, they do have a backdoor into it.
[00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:48.144]  And not just through the hardware or software.
[00:11:49.847 --> 00:12:01.870]  The apps, most of the big ubiquitous top apps, it's come out, have backroom deals with major governments and Interpol to have backdoors through the app.
[00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:10.357]  Just like hackers get into iPhones all the time, and get into the cloud, and you name it.
[00:12:10.357 --> 00:12:16.660]  They can get into your phone through the cloud, they can get into it through Spotify, they can get in through it through websites.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:22.142]  It's ridiculous to have the FBI claim that they couldn't get into it.
[00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:27.245]  And within a week, Apple came out and said, okay, we remotely accessed the phone, the FBI's already in it.
[00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:32.147]  It's total bull.
[00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:32.407]  Okay?
[00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:38.096]  And I just want to point out, we told you again first, because we know what we're talking about.
[00:12:38.096 --> 00:12:40.660]  I'm not bragging.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.762]  We've reverse engineered it.
[00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:44.326]  We understand it.
[00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:45.007]  Now that said...
[00:12:46.317 --> 00:12:50.918]  It's legal and lawful to have the NSA spying on targets overseas.
[00:12:50.918 --> 00:12:51.958]  It's its job.
[00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:59.040]  I've had William Binney, the top living codebreaker, top mathematician, fourth and fifth dimensional thinker.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.641]  And I've had two, three hour dinners with him.
[00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:01.381]  Talk about amazing.
[00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:02.881]  He didn't tell me anything secret.
[00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:13.284]  He just talked about quantum mechanics and mathematical overlays and things like fourth dimensional holograms.
[00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:17.294]  I'm not bragging.
[00:13:17.294 --> 00:13:21.538]  He couldn't believe, because I hadn't even read this in science books.
[00:13:21.538 --> 00:13:41.856]  I was sitting there talking to him, right there in front of some of the crew that went at a steakhouse, and I was talking about, in mathematics, how scientists a hundred years ago predicted that when a probe finally flew over Saturn, interdimensional forces of a gas giant that size would manifest structural
[00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:49.097]  Codes on the surface of the gas giant at the poles and would manifest a hexagon.
[00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:57.843]  Now I didn't envision that, they envisioned it a hundred years ago, and sure enough when the first probes, was it Voyager?
[00:13:57.843 --> 00:14:02.788]  Flew over it, there was the interdimensional manifestation.
[00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:09.935]  And I said, let me guess, is that how you break some of these really supposedly impossible to break codes, is an interdimensional shadow?
[00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:12.138]  And he said, that's, he goes, how do you know that?
[00:14:12.138 --> 00:14:13.939]  That's, that's incredibly classified.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:23.047]  And I said, but it's actually out there in mainline literature, and my dad, five or six years ago, said, you watch, it's gonna be holograms and interdimensional shadows.
[00:14:23.047 --> 00:14:24.408]  And I said, how do you know that?
[00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:26.630]  He said, oh, I just read scientific publications.
[00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.294]  So the truth is, it's just, there's nothing really hidden.
[00:14:31.294 --> 00:14:36.518]  And even someone like William Binney doesn't know that that knowledge is actually already out there in the general public.
[00:14:36.518 --> 00:14:39.401]  There's not much that isn't out there, okay?
[00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:40.502]  There isn't much that's out there.
[00:14:41.812 --> 00:14:45.796]  And they can have White House-run publications make fun of me when I make statements like that and things.
[00:14:45.796 --> 00:14:46.997]  That's fine.
[00:14:46.997 --> 00:14:52.023]  Because that's for their idiot audience that are pseudo-intellectuals and think they know everything.
[00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:59.550]  The reason I talk about our bona fides and the fact that we know so much is because people need to understand we're not playing games here.
[00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:02.319]  We mean to defeat the globalists.
[00:15:02.319 --> 00:15:07.083]  We mean to study the enemy, and expose their operations, and save human sovereignty.
[00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:09.445]  I want it for myself and my family.
[00:15:09.445 --> 00:15:12.007]  If I'm gonna get it, it means you need to get it too.
[00:15:12.007 --> 00:15:14.508]  We're in this together!
[00:15:14.508 --> 00:15:22.114]  I absolutely care about everybody, and not because I'm some sap, but because I'm a man, and because I am a warrior.
[00:15:22.114 --> 00:15:28.639]  When it comes down to being a warrior, that means raising strong kids, standing up for the culture, and being the best, most honest person I can be.
[00:15:29.952 --> 00:15:35.935]  Not because I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, but because I understand that's what builds a safe and good society.
[00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:43.400]  All you cheaters and crooks and the rest of you that think being dirty is so cool, you're nothing but chumps lying to yourselves.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.642]  And I'm sick of you.
[00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:55.587]  Now that said, I've got some issues with Donald Trump and his police state statements we're going to talk about at the bottom of the hour, play some clips.
[00:15:57.363 --> 00:16:02.545]  We have another clip from Roger Stone, the consummate Trump insider, last week with us.
[00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:06.446]  What, last Wednesday was it?
[00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:09.027]  Oh, look at the date we played the video.
[00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:13.308]  And he said, you watch, Jeb Bush will endorse him in the next few weeks.
[00:16:13.308 --> 00:16:19.430]  Jeb Bush has now endorsed, not Donald Trump, of course, but as he predicted,
[00:16:20.987 --> 00:16:26.012]  Ted Cruz and that is a big blow confirming he was a Bush sleeper cell.
[00:16:26.012 --> 00:16:37.503]  We thought it was really bad news when we saw Marvin Bush take over his financing of his campaign.
[00:16:37.503 --> 00:16:42.488]  We thought it was bad news his wife was CFR and ran and commanded the TPP ram through.
[00:16:43.254 --> 00:16:45.095]  When it was first being written four years ago.
[00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:55.901]  We thought all of that was bad, the Goldman Sachs connection, but let me tell you, I would go off his past votes, Neil Bush, Marvin Bush, you name it, get involved in this campaign.
[00:16:55.901 --> 00:17:10.070]  I would take his past votes and say he's pro-Second Amendment, you name it, I'm gonna trust him off his four-year record and ignore the previous stuff, but having them come in and support them now means I don't trust them at all.
[00:17:11.581 --> 00:17:13.192]  Let's go ahead and go to this Roger Stone clip.
[00:17:16.741 --> 00:17:25.348]  Sure, the fact that Donald Trump may have 1,237 votes, the majority on the first ballot, is almost irrelevant to the Kingmakers, to the party elites.
[00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:26.789]  Look, they're petrified.
[00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:28.190]  And here's why.
[00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.913]  Trump is uncontrollable to them.
[00:17:30.913 --> 00:17:39.600]  So, let's not assume that just because the bosses and the Kingmakers want to steal this, that they are going to be successful.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.022]  Trump has the most important power on his side.
[00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:43.803]  Public opinion.
[00:17:43.803 --> 00:17:48.506]  And as Abraham Lincoln said, public opinion in this country is everything.
[00:17:48.506 --> 00:17:53.690]  The big steal is going to be very difficult for the bosses to carry out.
[00:17:53.690 --> 00:18:05.117]  It's interesting to me, and I predict again, George W. Bush's clan, particularly Jeb Bush, will be endorsing Ted Cruz shortly because Ted Cruz is a Bush family retainer.
[00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:09.040]  Ted Cruz isn't the constitutional conservative you think he is.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.261]  He's a globalist.
[00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:11.822]  He's backed by Goldman Sachs.
[00:18:12.442 --> 00:18:18.244]  His wife and he are minor servants for the Bush family.
[00:18:18.244 --> 00:18:21.905]  She worked for Condoleezza Rice, getting us into the phony Iraq War.
[00:18:21.905 --> 00:18:24.785]  Then she went over and worked for Robert Zoellick, the U.S.
[00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:29.727]  Trade Representative, former president of the World Bank, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:18:29.727 --> 00:18:33.708]  And now the Federal Reserve's giving money to him and Hillary, but none.
[00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:36.869]  Zero to Donald Trump.
[00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:38.209]  Another incredible endorsement.
[00:18:38.956 --> 00:18:40.117]  Yeah, he's Dr. Evil.
[00:18:40.117 --> 00:18:46.062]  Look, if you ask me, Donald Trump has a long list of thank you notes that he has to write.
[00:18:46.062 --> 00:18:48.104]  He's got to send one to the Pope.
[00:18:48.104 --> 00:18:50.346]  He's got to send one to the Chinese government.
[00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:52.728]  He's got to send one to Vincente Fox.
[00:18:52.728 --> 00:18:54.169]  He's got to send one to Mitt Romney.
[00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:57.632]  Now he's got to send one to the Washington Post.
[00:18:57.632 --> 00:19:00.454]  All of these attacks are backfiring.
[00:19:00.454 --> 00:19:03.477]  All they're doing is winning votes for Donald Trump.
[00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:19.873]  We're going to put the full three and a half minute clip up the next twenty minutes to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because it's one thing to have the Bushes endorse them, but it's another thing to have the backstory of what this signifies and what this means.
[00:19:19.873 --> 00:19:23.373]  Ted Cruz is a surrogate for the Bushes.
[00:19:23.373 --> 00:19:24.474]  Their name is used up.
[00:19:24.474 --> 00:19:26.774]  Their name is blown.
[00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:29.735]  They are back.
[00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:33.376]  And it's even in the National Review, Ted Cruz, the Bush years.
[00:19:35.211 --> 00:19:41.134]  I'm sorry, Ted Cruz has got his old handlers running him, and I don't trust him now.
[00:19:41.134 --> 00:19:43.115]  I'm done with Ted Cruz.
[00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.035]  That's it.
[00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:53.399]  And of course, Benedict Arnold himself, the man that says you're going to hell if you don't vote for Ted Cruz, Glenn Beck is for him as well.
[00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:56.020]  I mean, we would be insane to be for Ted Cruz.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.041]  He's super bad news.
[00:19:59.145 --> 00:20:03.307]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:20:03.307 --> 00:20:09.509]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:11.249]  How is this even possible?
[00:20:11.249 --> 00:20:18.812]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:20:18.812 --> 00:20:26.555]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:20:26.775 --> 00:20:31.138]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:20:31.138 --> 00:20:39.904]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[00:20:39.904 --> 00:20:41.485]  But you must act fast.
[00:20:41.485 --> 00:20:46.028]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:50.451]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:52.252]  That's Greens75.com.
[00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:52.592]  Greens75.com.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.520]  Hey, everyone.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.721]  In 20 plus years as a radio host, I've seen about everything.
[00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:07.122]  One thing that keeps recurring, though, are these timeshare charlatans.
[00:21:07.122 --> 00:21:18.965]  These high-pressure salespeople who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer, then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a timeshare they don't need, they don't want, and they can't afford.
[00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:20.966]  And then they're stuck with that thing forever.
[00:21:20.966 --> 00:21:24.507]  Monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual fees that keep going up and up.
[00:21:25.007 --> 00:21:28.090]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things.
[00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.414]  You know, you can't get out of the contract, you can't get out of the deed or the membership.
[00:21:31.414 --> 00:21:32.755]  Well, that's not true.
[00:21:32.755 --> 00:21:38.401]  My friends at American Consumer Credit, a timeshare release company, can get you free.
[00:21:38.401 --> 00:21:40.504]  That's their personal guarantee.
[00:21:40.504 --> 00:21:45.409]  12 years in business, free consultation, A-plus rating with the BBB, they're the real deal.
[00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:47.611]  You want to get out of your timeshare contract?

[00:22:28.396 --> 00:22:31.457]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:22:31.457 --> 00:22:34.078]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:34.078 --> 00:22:34.818]  Croix River.
[00:22:34.818 --> 00:22:37.059]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:40.020]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.900]  His excuse?
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.241]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:43.841]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:49.603]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[00:22:49.603 --> 00:22:50.643]  Don't wait.

[00:24:20.371 --> 00:24:21.793]  Remember, you're in the InfoWars.
[00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:22.594]  You're the tip of the spear.
[00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:26.318]  You're just as important as I am in force multiplication.
[00:24:26.318 --> 00:24:28.180]  You are the resistance.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.705]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, our Facebook, our Twitter.
[00:24:33.117 --> 00:24:38.539]  Those are all platforms full of incredible interviews, incredible videos, incredible breaking news.
[00:24:38.539 --> 00:24:42.420]  So much of which I don't get to because I'm not good sometimes.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.401]  I get obsessed on little points.
[00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:51.463]  But believe me, there is a massive important intel and weaponized truth.
[00:24:51.463 --> 00:24:52.924]  Because truth is all powerful.
[00:24:53.757 --> 00:24:57.559]  At InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, that is amazing.
[00:24:57.559 --> 00:25:07.564]  Tim Kennedy, as high-level Special Forces as it gets, you know, the top secret units, you name it, just stuff that's beyond anything in movies.
[00:25:07.564 --> 00:25:11.587]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:25:11.587 --> 00:25:15.449]  Not that I've learned about it from him, I've learned about it here and there and other places.
[00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:15.949]  Amazing.
[00:25:18.328 --> 00:25:23.272]  And he comes out and says the government is letting terror attacks happen to take our freedoms.
[00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:28.036]  That interview, that 10 minute segment of the hour and a half interview is on Infowars.com.
[00:25:28.036 --> 00:25:30.158]  How important is that?
[00:25:30.158 --> 00:25:40.166]  He comes out and says the video showing him shoot up the car in the truck in Oregon is wrong.
[00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:42.188]  And that's not what you do.
[00:25:42.188 --> 00:25:43.549]  And that he knows the guys that did it.
[00:25:46.601 --> 00:25:50.263]  And then I'm not at liberty to tell the rest of the story.
[00:25:50.263 --> 00:25:56.866]  He didn't say what he wouldn't say or would say once he got on air and then he just talked about it on air.
[00:25:56.866 --> 00:26:09.393]  And understand folks, just him coming on air is a big deal because obviously he's been threatened repeatedly last time and this time and of course it's having the opposite effect.
[00:26:10.914 --> 00:26:14.857]  And he represents basically the general feeling of Army Special Forces.
[00:26:14.857 --> 00:26:15.858]  I can tell you that.
[00:26:15.858 --> 00:26:16.998]  And he said that on air.
[00:26:16.998 --> 00:26:17.819]  Wow!
[00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:23.443]  The most elite of the Army, on average, are as awake as I am or more.
[00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:33.534]  And are concerned to the point that basically one of their leaders, he's pretty much their mascot, their leader.
[00:26:33.534 --> 00:26:39.137]  The guy they look up to comes on this show and tells you that, that's not me bragging, that's dangerous.
[00:26:39.137 --> 00:26:46.401]  I was actually sick at my stomach yesterday about that interview for what it signifies, the level we've gotten to.
[00:26:46.401 --> 00:26:50.263]  I feel good about it and I've told you about this kind of stuff for years behind the scenes, but
[00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:55.530]  This is a real battle for the country, people!
[00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.730]  Underworld government!
[00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:04.175]  They're bringing in radical Muslims to let them attack us to take our freedoms!
[00:27:04.175 --> 00:27:05.475]  Tucker Carlson's a smart guy.
[00:27:05.475 --> 00:27:09.798]  He came on and said the left hates the West and just feels sorry for radical Muslims.
[00:27:09.798 --> 00:27:11.039]  That's why they bring them in.
[00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:13.760]  Yeah, grassroots liberals, but not the leadership.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.941]  They know full well what they're doing.
[00:27:15.941 --> 00:27:16.822]  Tim Kennedy's right.
[00:27:19.144 --> 00:27:25.893]  And there's just tons of powerful info like that on Infowars.com right now.
[00:27:25.893 --> 00:27:30.019]  The Tucker Carlson interview is called, Why the Left Loves Jihadists.
[00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:36.227]  And let me tell you something, there's all these mainline leftists that mean well out there, and I've got some problems with some of the right-wing positions as well.
[00:27:36.227 --> 00:27:36.908]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:27:39.952 --> 00:27:55.061]  But radical Islam is taking over Islam, and it is the most oppressive, twisted, bizarre, hateful, bullying, bossy, arrogant, in-your-face garbage!
[00:27:55.061 --> 00:28:07.149]  And the elites that we have, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, the Democratic Party, with the neocons, have run, turning
[00:28:08.737 --> 00:28:15.923]  The most evil, cowardly trash you can imagine, loose on more than 10 countries.
[00:28:15.923 --> 00:28:20.807]  Our military finally had a breaking point, as I told you five years ago, when this went operational.
[00:28:20.807 --> 00:28:27.312]  And they were told to deliver weapons to actual Al-Qaeda operatives, who would shoot their mouths off at them.
[00:28:27.312 --> 00:28:28.653]  And then I had the whistleblowers on.
[00:28:29.943 --> 00:28:32.705]  From the Justice Department and the CIA and you name it.
[00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:35.306]  People always said whistleblowers would never speak out.
[00:28:35.306 --> 00:28:36.627]  Oh, yes they will.
[00:28:36.627 --> 00:28:37.827]  They know they get persecuted.
[00:28:37.827 --> 00:28:38.968]  They know people come after them.
[00:28:38.968 --> 00:28:43.291]  There's a certain point where people go, listen, we're not working with Al Qaeda.
[00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:45.972]  You got that?
[00:28:45.972 --> 00:28:50.815]  And I told you we reached that point four or five years ago.
[00:28:50.815 --> 00:28:55.197]  And that's a good thing, but it's also extremely dangerous to realize that we were right.
[00:28:55.197 --> 00:28:56.278]  It was worse than we thought.
[00:28:57.438 --> 00:29:01.963]  And we're really controlled by people this evil?
[00:29:01.963 --> 00:29:05.266]  And it comes out in the open, and none of them are getting in trouble.
[00:29:05.266 --> 00:29:06.287]  That's the problem.
[00:29:06.287 --> 00:29:09.770]  Yes, our military has said no.
[00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:18.799]  That's why they want to have a civil war, because they know local governments are awake, a lot of state governments are awake, the military's awake, a lot of the police are awake, so they want a civil war.
[00:29:19.957 --> 00:29:29.788]  To overthrow the system so bad that government has to become tyrannical just to support civilization and then they think they can control the system at the top.
[00:29:29.788 --> 00:29:39.278]  That's why they're pushing us into chaos because out of the chaos they want to bring tyranny in just like Tim Kennedy said here yesterday.
[00:29:43.112 --> 00:29:45.096]  You know, that's what it comes down to.
[00:29:45.096 --> 00:29:48.081]  Will you listen to top Delta Force people?
[00:29:48.081 --> 00:29:49.444]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.444 --> 00:29:51.989]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.989 --> 00:29:54.653]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:19.502]  I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times, because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer, and that all the very many adverse effects, which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[00:30:19.842 --> 00:30:24.584]  That was a statement made in April 2014 by a French medical doctor, Bernard Delberg.
[00:30:24.584 --> 00:30:29.966]  He's a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Merck, the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine Gardasil.
[00:30:29.966 --> 00:30:37.768]  And now, almost two years later, Dr. Sing-Hang Lee, director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in Connecticut, has proved these predictions correct.
[00:30:37.768 --> 00:30:39.189]  He published a letter sent to the U.S.
[00:30:39.189 --> 00:30:42.210]  CDC, the World Health Organization, and the Ministry of Health in Japan,
[00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.750]  We're good.
[00:30:58.775 --> 00:31:02.277]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:07.861]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:31:07.861 --> 00:31:15.767]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:31:16.227 --> 00:31:22.349]  Sourced from top-leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:31:22.349 --> 00:31:31.433]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:31:31.433 --> 00:31:37.655]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:31:37.655 --> 00:31:43.958]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:31:44.398 --> 00:31:49.781]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:52.262]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:52.262 --> 00:31:54.303]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:58.536 --> 00:31:59.457]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:31:59.457 --> 00:32:00.037]  Good, brother.
[00:32:00.037 --> 00:32:01.978]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:32:01.978 --> 00:32:03.699]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:32:03.699 --> 00:32:07.741]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:32:07.741 --> 00:32:10.342]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:32:10.342 --> 00:32:12.764]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:20.628]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:32:20.948 --> 00:32:24.192]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.734]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:32:25.734 --> 00:32:28.637]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:32:28.637 --> 00:32:30.419]  Saved a ton of money there.
[00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:35.725]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:32:35.725 --> 00:32:38.268]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[00:32:38.268 --> 00:32:50.261]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:32:50.261 --> 00:32:57.209]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:33:08.976 --> 00:33:17.683]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.683 --> 00:33:20.626]  Monday through Friday, we're here from 11 a.m.
[00:33:20.626 --> 00:33:21.266]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:21.587]  Central.
[00:33:21.587 --> 00:33:23.448]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.448 --> 00:33:26.311]  Leanne McAdoo is joining us.
[00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:28.453]  She's going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[00:33:30.393 --> 00:33:40.863]  I'm going to go to her in just a moment to break down the latest election developments, Cruz being endorsed by Jeb Bush, and Trump coming back with more troubling police state statements that we're going to be going over.
[00:33:40.863 --> 00:33:44.686]  And again, I'm a Trump supporter, but I hold my nose sometimes.
[00:33:44.686 --> 00:33:49.611]  And if I get him back on the show, which he says he's going to come on soon, or I'm going to get his sons on, I mean, I'm going to raise those points.
[00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:52.913]  I like the fact that he's brazen out in the open.
[00:33:52.913 --> 00:33:54.334]  I don't trust the other candidates.
[00:33:54.334 --> 00:33:56.015]  I'll say that right now.
[00:33:56.015 --> 00:33:56.936]  But I've got some concerns.
[00:33:56.936 --> 00:33:59.458]  We're going to talk to Leanne about some of her concerns.
[00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:04.481]  She was raising them to me this morning, and I was already having them as well, so I thought we'd discuss it.
[00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:07.443]  Briefly, though, we are listener-supported.
[00:34:07.443 --> 00:34:11.326]  If people don't buy the products, we don't continue on and operate.
[00:34:11.326 --> 00:34:16.150]  And man, sometimes we get a whole bunch of orders of t-shirts, books, videos, water filters, and we're doing great.
[00:34:17.282 --> 00:34:18.222]  I'm hardly even plugging.
[00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:20.983]  And then sometimes I'm plugging and people aren't buying anything.
[00:34:20.983 --> 00:34:22.824]  We won't exist if that happens.
[00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.224]  Obviously, we're doing okay.
[00:34:24.224 --> 00:34:28.525]  I want to get a few more reporters, a couple more camera people, so I can have more people out in the field.
[00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:32.886]  We need to get five or six more people, and I think we're basically done at that point.
[00:34:32.886 --> 00:34:37.988]  Because, you know, I put on all sail here in the fight against the globalists, to use an old naval term.
[00:34:39.068 --> 00:34:40.409]  We really have great products.
[00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:41.809]  The spring is about to be here.
[00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:50.313]  We have the widest selection of more than, what, 14 different high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed companies at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:34:50.313 --> 00:34:59.038]  From fruit trees right down to heirloom tomatoes, you name it, the widest selection you're going to find at close to the lowest or very competitive prices.
[00:34:59.038 --> 00:35:01.759]  It varies, but I sign contracts with these well-known companies.
[00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:09.111]  That I won't even go below the prices I have, then it's in the contract that occasionally I can have sales.
[00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:12.852]  But you notice I don't ever really have seed sales because they're already as low as we can go.
[00:35:12.852 --> 00:35:14.392]  I'm a capitalist.
[00:35:14.392 --> 00:35:15.553]  I believe in it.
[00:35:15.553 --> 00:35:18.053]  Give them as gifts if you live in an apartment.
[00:35:18.053 --> 00:35:22.954]  I mean, plant them on highway, you know, green spaces.
[00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:24.355]  A lot of guerrilla farming's going on.
[00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:26.635]  It's very, very exciting.
[00:35:26.635 --> 00:35:28.956]  Get out there.
[00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:30.596]  If you have a farm, plant a garden.
[00:35:32.248 --> 00:35:33.609]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:35:33.609 --> 00:35:34.770]  Have your grandchildren out.
[00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:35.590]  Do it.
[00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.931]  Turn off the cable TV.
[00:35:36.931 --> 00:35:38.592]  Turn off the establishment media.
[00:35:38.592 --> 00:35:39.732]  Get back to the earth.
[00:35:39.732 --> 00:35:42.454]  This is such a big part of coming out of the system.
[00:35:42.454 --> 00:35:46.096]  Tim Kennedy was talking about it here yesterday.
[00:35:46.096 --> 00:35:47.497]  Go to the seed banks.
[00:35:47.497 --> 00:35:48.817]  Order those today.
[00:35:48.817 --> 00:35:50.699]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:50.699 --> 00:35:52.500]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:00.064]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site with the shortwave radios, the Hillary for Prison t-shirts, the Mulan Labe, the Survival Seed Vaults, the entire spectrum.
[00:36:01.394 --> 00:36:06.856]  The books, the videos, the shortwave radios, it's all there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:06.856 --> 00:36:13.918]  InfoWarsLive.com is a subsection that has the nutraceuticals that we produce and we put out.
[00:36:13.918 --> 00:36:18.879]  We believe Brain Force is the best nootropic that isn't $100 out there.
[00:36:18.879 --> 00:36:19.019]  It's $29.95.
[00:36:19.019 --> 00:36:23.920]  The leading competitor is $60 and is not as good.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.342]  I even had them call me up and say, oh, we looked at your formula, it's better than ours, and half the price.
[00:36:28.342 --> 00:36:28.902]  Why are you doing that?
[00:36:29.685 --> 00:36:31.025]  It's not to compete with them.
[00:36:31.025 --> 00:36:33.326]  Because we're not really in competition.
[00:36:33.326 --> 00:36:34.946]  The market's so big.
[00:36:34.946 --> 00:36:36.727]  Okay?
[00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:39.387]  It's that I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:36:39.387 --> 00:36:41.908]  And we still make a good profit on this to fund the operation.
[00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:43.048]  Maybe I should raise the prices.
[00:36:43.048 --> 00:36:45.509]  Rainforest, get a bottle today.
[00:36:45.509 --> 00:36:48.830]  We have a limited time specials at Infowarslife.com.
[00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.771]  20% off our new Ultimate Liver Cleanse Pack.
[00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:55.592]  The Liver Shield, the Deep Cleanse, and the Oxy Powder.

[00:36:58.547 --> 00:37:04.928]  Fifteen percent off when you get Ultimate Cleanse Pack of Liver Shield and Deep Cleanse together, or ten percent off with Liver Shield on its own.
[00:37:04.928 --> 00:37:06.069]  By the way, I talked to Roger Stone.
[00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:07.369]  He didn't even really plug it.
[00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:08.509]  He said, I love your Liver Shield.
[00:37:08.509 --> 00:37:08.969]  It really works.
[00:37:08.969 --> 00:37:10.110]  It gives you a lot of energy.
[00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.710]  It's amazing.
[00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:16.311]  Yeah, it's known concentrated herbs down to an oil level that are designed to really help you.
[00:37:16.311 --> 00:37:17.911]  So, check it out for yourself.
[00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:20.512]  In fact, one reason you were going to pop in today before the fourth hour, Leanne,
[00:37:21.736 --> 00:37:23.737]  Well, let's just do it now before we get into the news.
[00:37:23.737 --> 00:37:25.338]  I hadn't even thought of this.
[00:37:25.338 --> 00:37:31.102]  You and your good friend, and there's a video on the liver cleanse page on Infowarslife.com where you break it down.
[00:37:31.102 --> 00:37:34.884]  You did the liver and gallbladder cleanse without getting into details here, spending too much time.
[00:37:34.884 --> 00:37:36.425]  What did it do for you guys?
[00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:38.066]  Well, it pretty much changed my life.
[00:37:38.066 --> 00:37:39.186]  We're going to turn our mic on.
[00:37:39.186 --> 00:37:39.447]  Hold on.
[00:37:39.447 --> 00:37:40.387]  Go ahead and turn our mic on.
[00:37:40.387 --> 00:37:41.348]  Go ahead.
[00:37:41.348 --> 00:37:42.328]  It pretty much changed my life.
[00:37:44.551 --> 00:37:54.258]  What I needed to help give me that boost to be able to change my habits, because there you have six days where you're kind of... By the way, I want to start over and apologize.
[00:37:54.258 --> 00:38:00.482]  You don't like audio in your ear, so they weren't sending me your audio, and I apologize to you and the crew that I had forgotten that I had no audio.
[00:38:00.482 --> 00:38:00.902]  Sorry.
[00:38:00.902 --> 00:38:01.563]  Start over, Leanne.
[00:38:02.526 --> 00:38:03.467]  Well, thank you.
[00:38:03.467 --> 00:38:05.068]  Teleprompter free.
[00:38:05.068 --> 00:38:06.209]  This is not scripted.
[00:38:06.209 --> 00:38:06.669]  Go ahead.
[00:38:06.669 --> 00:38:08.771]  Well, I'm saying the liver cleanse changed my life.
[00:38:08.771 --> 00:38:14.054]  Like, it was six days where I had to dedicate myself to resetting my habits.
[00:38:14.054 --> 00:38:20.979]  And I had to prove to myself that I could avoid the propaganda with the commercials and like, I don't even like fast food at all.
[00:38:20.979 --> 00:38:21.560]  I never eat it.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:27.024]  But I got to the point where I was like driving and I'm like, hmm, maybe I should just pull into this fast food place.
[00:38:27.024 --> 00:38:35.310]  And because you really truly do have to bypass all of those things in your body that are trying to convince you to just fail, fail, fail.
[00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:36.831]  And this was awesome.
[00:38:36.831 --> 00:38:37.892]  It slimmed me down.
[00:38:37.892 --> 00:38:43.376]  I have by the way, tell folks how much weight you lost because you looked really good and you looked young, but I'm not kidding.
[00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:47.900]  You were glowing during and after and you guys literally look five years younger.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.680]  Yeah.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.521]  No, it was awesome.
[00:38:49.521 --> 00:38:51.982]  It like brightened up my skin.
[00:38:51.982 --> 00:38:57.386]  The thing for me was this little fat pocket in my upper belly that I could just not get rid of.
[00:38:57.386 --> 00:38:59.447]  I didn't know where it was coming from.
[00:38:59.447 --> 00:39:00.968]  And that was where it flushed out.
[00:39:00.968 --> 00:39:03.269]  It was right here around my ribs.
[00:39:03.269 --> 00:39:05.030]  And that has not come back.
[00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.751]  It hasn't come back.
[00:39:05.751 --> 00:39:07.272]  And that for me was key.
[00:39:07.272 --> 00:39:09.353]  What did your friend, what did she experience?
[00:39:09.353 --> 00:39:12.595]  Because there's a video about it on the site, but just break it down for folks, Leanne.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.141]  Well, the same thing with Emmy.
[00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:15.942]  I mean, she was just glowing.
[00:39:15.942 --> 00:39:17.543]  Tons of energy.
[00:39:17.543 --> 00:39:21.065]  And you can see she really slimmed down there.
[00:39:21.065 --> 00:39:22.486]  Her belly was just like, whoop!
[00:39:22.486 --> 00:39:24.708]  You could see all her little... And how fast did that happen?
[00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:25.589]  That was in six days.
[00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:26.391]  Wow.
[00:39:26.391 --> 00:39:27.512]  That was six days.
[00:39:27.512 --> 00:39:31.477]  Dude, you know, was an athlete, coaches basketball, had a college scholarship in basketball.
[00:39:31.477 --> 00:39:36.963]  He's not a fat guy at all, but he lost 12 pounds in one week just from what was stuck in his guts.
[00:39:36.963 --> 00:39:37.904]  Right.
[00:39:37.904 --> 00:39:38.205]  Right.
[00:39:38.205 --> 00:39:39.346]  And that's the, that's the thing.
[00:39:39.346 --> 00:39:44.952]  It's like, you know, everyone has to take care of themselves and take care of their digestive tract.
[00:39:44.952 --> 00:39:46.954]  And I would just like to point out my after picture.
[00:39:48.496 --> 00:39:49.557]  Leanne, I'm impressed.
[00:39:49.557 --> 00:39:52.059]  I mean, you looked great before, but you really did lose some tummy fat.
[00:39:52.059 --> 00:39:54.941]  You can see also under my chin, in my face.
[00:39:54.941 --> 00:39:56.062]  Yeah, let's put that back up.
[00:39:56.062 --> 00:39:56.762]  I lost some.
[00:39:56.762 --> 00:39:58.764]  Wow, you did lose weight under your chin.
[00:39:58.764 --> 00:40:06.550]  Under my chin, and you can see the little, like, on the before picture, you can see there was kind of like that little pudgy thing in the back, and it slimmed down.
[00:40:07.608 --> 00:40:08.829]  And that was six days.
[00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:09.869]  That was in six days.
[00:40:09.869 --> 00:40:12.251]  I'm doing it right now, but I'll be honest.
[00:40:12.251 --> 00:40:15.533]  It's not hard to do, but it is... It's not hard!
[00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:17.314]  You can eat... But it is kind of a hassle.
[00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:18.975]  I mean, I kind of got off it a little bit yesterday.
[00:40:18.975 --> 00:40:19.795]  I'm back on it today.
[00:40:19.795 --> 00:40:21.616]  I just have a problem doing it.
[00:40:21.616 --> 00:40:21.917]  Right.
[00:40:21.917 --> 00:40:28.721]  Well, that's the thing that I talked about in this video, is that how are you supposed to resist tyranny if you can't even resist the taco stand?
[00:40:29.461 --> 00:40:38.948]  If you can't let commercials program you and say, ooh, get this burger, do this, do that, how are you supposed to not allow other propaganda to take hold of your life?
[00:40:38.948 --> 00:40:39.948]  And that's what this was for me.
[00:40:39.948 --> 00:40:48.054]  It was like me being in charge, taking hold of my life, clearing out my system, getting myself awakened and my thoughts pure.
[00:40:48.054 --> 00:40:52.517]  Because, you know, we have all these jumbled thoughts from all the toxins that we're putting in our bodies.
[00:40:52.517 --> 00:40:53.557]  And by the way, I'm impressed.
[00:40:53.557 --> 00:40:56.038]  I mean, you guys aren't camera people, like I'm not camera people.
[00:40:56.038 --> 00:40:58.338]  You guys went and shot this all yourselves.
[00:40:58.338 --> 00:41:00.439]  So it's amateur, but it looks professional.
[00:41:00.439 --> 00:41:01.379]  And you did a great job.
[00:41:01.379 --> 00:41:11.021]  And people can go to Infowarslife.com, to the Deep Cleanse liver shield page, and see their informational video, Dr. Gribbs' video, my breakdown.
[00:41:11.021 --> 00:41:19.943]  Without getting into any details, 98% of people I talk to within a day have the big event happen.
[00:41:19.943 --> 00:41:21.584]  And did you guys have the big event happen?
[00:41:22.804 --> 00:41:23.245]  What do you mean?
[00:41:23.245 --> 00:41:25.026]  You know, the big cleanse, the big final day.
[00:41:25.026 --> 00:41:26.307]  What did you do on the sixth day?
[00:41:26.307 --> 00:41:27.808]  The seventh day, what happened?
[00:41:27.808 --> 00:41:31.530]  God rested on the seventh day, but with this cleanse... Well, see, that's the thing.
[00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.992]  You've got to follow the directions that Dr. Group puts out.
[00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:41.757]  Like I said, I did the wrong salt, and so it ended up that I didn't flush out all of that salt.
[00:41:41.757 --> 00:41:44.799]  So I had to do an additional day with the proper directions.
[00:41:44.799 --> 00:41:45.399]  That's right.
[00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:48.441]  You did it with sea salt instead of the Epsom salt.
[00:41:48.641 --> 00:41:57.595]  And I, when I did the oil, the olive oil, I laid down on my side and I immediately started hearing in my body and feeling it going...
[00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:05.815]  Like all these little globules like just coming out like I could hear them popping out of my gallbladder.
[00:42:05.815 --> 00:42:07.797]  It was the reason people's gallbladders burst.
[00:42:07.797 --> 00:42:10.519]  And so you did it right on the final day.
[00:42:10.519 --> 00:42:10.959]  Yes.
[00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:11.220]  Yeah.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.902]  And I mean, granted, I'm mostly a vegetarian.
[00:42:13.902 --> 00:42:15.823]  I eat a lot of vegetables and stuff.
[00:42:15.823 --> 00:42:16.784]  So I'm pretty healthy.
[00:42:16.784 --> 00:42:18.445]  So it wasn't super extreme.
[00:42:18.445 --> 00:42:21.628]  Now, Emmy had some that were like this big and they were black.
[00:42:23.169 --> 00:42:27.093]  I'm not going to say what happened to me, but let's just say it's like the movie Alien.
[00:42:27.093 --> 00:42:33.819]  And it really freaked me out because I was rolling my eyes four years ago when Anthony and Group were doing these and people were saying that it was the best cleanse ever.
[00:42:33.819 --> 00:42:37.162]  And I finally did it about a year and a half ago and then now I'm doing it again.
[00:42:37.162 --> 00:42:47.231]  And it is simply amazing how your body is battling and taking all these toxins in and then doesn't know what to do with them so creates these crystals.
[00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:47.431]  Right.
[00:42:48.177 --> 00:42:56.201]  Yeah, and that's the thing is, how are we supposed to have clear thoughts, empowered bodies, empowered minds, if our bodies are so weighed down with toxins?
[00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:58.462]  Folks, you should do the liver cleanse today.
[00:42:58.462 --> 00:43:01.804]  There's a big advanced one with what to eat and what to do for six days.
[00:43:01.804 --> 00:43:03.205]  I just did the basic one.
[00:43:03.205 --> 00:43:05.886]  It's pretty easy to do, and I had spectacular results.
[00:43:05.886 --> 00:43:09.008]  Now, I didn't do everything I was supposed to, so it took a day and a half for it to happen.
[00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.471]  Uh, because the same thing with me.
[00:43:11.471 --> 00:43:14.632]  I called, uh, GroupUp and I said, nothing happened in the morning.
[00:43:14.632 --> 00:43:16.793]  He goes, well, what kind of salt did you use?
[00:43:16.793 --> 00:43:17.953]  And I go, I didn't do the salt.
[00:43:17.953 --> 00:43:21.255]  And he goes, well, there you got to do the two or three capelets of Epsom salt.
[00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:21.535]  Right.
[00:43:21.535 --> 00:43:23.616]  So I did that the next night and olive oil again.
[00:43:23.616 --> 00:43:25.496]  And then, then, uh, yeah.
[00:43:25.496 --> 00:43:26.697]  And that's exactly what happened with me.
[00:43:26.697 --> 00:43:27.998]  I didn't use the Epsom salt.
[00:43:27.998 --> 00:43:28.958]  I used a different kind of salt.
[00:43:28.958 --> 00:43:29.838]  I just didn't do it period.
[00:43:29.838 --> 00:43:31.539]  And you can't do that.
[00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:32.819]  Well, it's amazing.
[00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:35.701]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:35.701 --> 00:43:37.201]  That's how we found the operation as well.
[00:43:37.201 --> 00:43:38.382]  So you can't lose.
[00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:38.722]  I mean, look,
[00:43:39.844 --> 00:43:41.305]  We're fighting for your Second Amendment.
[00:43:41.305 --> 00:43:42.807]  We're fighting for your property rights.
[00:43:42.807 --> 00:43:44.208]  We're fighting for your family rights.
[00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:45.670]  We're fighting for your religious rights.
[00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.712]  We're fighting together.
[00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:48.953]  We don't want to be thanked for it.
[00:43:48.953 --> 00:43:50.054]  We're all in this together.
[00:43:50.054 --> 00:43:54.799]  It's just that we need your support if you believe this operation is important.
[00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:56.200]  And again, a lot of you are supporting us.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.962]  I want to thank you for all you do.
[00:43:58.562 --> 00:44:02.183]  Become a PrisonPlanet.tv member, watch the nightly news, you name it.
[00:44:02.183 --> 00:44:07.065]  Okay, I want to shift gears now out of that, Leanne, into your concerns and my concerns about Trump.
[00:44:07.065 --> 00:44:15.628]  But first, let's just go over some of the news that's happened in the last 24 hours that ties into this to give folks kind of a background here.
[00:44:15.628 --> 00:44:16.248]  Shocking!
[00:44:16.248 --> 00:44:27.852]  Obama laughs and meets with, of course, Raul Castro, that was his second day in Cuba, at a baseball game and other events with the communist dictator after Brussels terror attack.
[00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:34.013]  Just a few hours, moments after giving his little heartfelt 40-second speech.
[00:44:34.013 --> 00:44:35.253]  And he's on ESPN.
[00:44:35.253 --> 00:44:37.634]  Show TV viewers this article in the photo.
[00:44:37.634 --> 00:44:38.514]  The video is amazing.
[00:44:38.514 --> 00:44:46.156]  Just laughing and giggling, talking for an hour about baseball, but 56 seconds about the terror attack.
[00:44:46.156 --> 00:44:48.336]  They take our freedoms in the name of fighting terror.
[00:44:48.336 --> 00:44:49.656]  He leaves the border open.
[00:44:49.656 --> 00:44:52.737]  He brings the jihadis in, but there's no discussion.
[00:44:53.837 --> 00:44:55.218]  Well, this is his dream job.
[00:44:55.218 --> 00:45:01.424]  He cannot wait to shake off the whole leader of the free world thing because really he wants to be in ESPN.
[00:45:01.424 --> 00:45:01.885]  Well, you're right.
[00:45:01.885 --> 00:45:03.066]  In fact, he said that.
[00:45:03.066 --> 00:45:05.008]  He wants to be in ESPN SportsCenter.
[00:45:05.008 --> 00:45:06.389]  Look, he's in his element right here.
[00:45:06.389 --> 00:45:07.911]  Look at that smile on his face.
[00:45:07.911 --> 00:45:09.392]  He doesn't want to be the president.
[00:45:09.392 --> 00:45:10.653]  So why can't he just get out now?
[00:45:11.638 --> 00:45:12.358]  He vacations.
[00:45:12.358 --> 00:45:15.579]  I mean, I thought Bush was bad watching sports.
[00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:16.840]  He's a total puppet.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.501]  I mean, even worse than Bush, if that's possible.
[00:45:19.501 --> 00:45:22.542]  But for me, the media is not mentioning with a dictator.
[00:45:22.542 --> 00:45:23.382]  Right.
[00:45:23.382 --> 00:45:27.323]  He's with a dictator at a dictatorship, telling us how great it is.
[00:45:27.323 --> 00:45:29.944]  But a lot of Cubans are very upset about it.
[00:45:29.944 --> 00:45:35.386]  Those that have actually been exiled here to this country or who came on rafts.
[00:45:35.386 --> 00:45:35.826]  Exactly.
[00:45:35.826 --> 00:45:37.727]  Plus the country is collapsing.
[00:45:37.727 --> 00:45:37.907]  Right.
[00:45:38.507 --> 00:45:41.091]  And then he takes a picture in front of Shea the day before.
[00:45:41.091 --> 00:45:42.492]  Shea Guevara.
[00:45:42.492 --> 00:45:43.354]  As if that wasn't enough.
[00:45:43.354 --> 00:45:48.560]  Who said that Indians, said that Native groups were basically subhuman idiots.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.663]  And black people, who's very racist.
[00:45:50.663 --> 00:45:55.830]  Oh yeah, I mean folks have no idea how racist the upper class in Latin America is.
[00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:56.990]  But he's a hipster here.
[00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:05.813]  I've been down there at, you know, the quote, upper class people's houses and they make these racist statements and it's happened in Mexico too and I'm like, hey, I'm not racist.
[00:46:05.813 --> 00:46:07.073]  I was raised in the U.S.
[00:46:07.073 --> 00:46:07.933]  I'm not into this.
[00:46:07.933 --> 00:46:22.637]  Che Guevara wrote a book where he called native Indians and blacks, I'm not going to even quote what he said, he called them, he called the natives roaches and he called blacks, well you know what the name is, he called them basically, go look it up for yourself, it's unbelievable.
[00:46:22.977 --> 00:46:23.177]  Yeah.
[00:46:23.177 --> 00:46:24.238]  Oh, it's very insulting.
[00:46:24.238 --> 00:46:26.379]  But this is what communists think of people.
[00:46:26.379 --> 00:46:28.159]  They hate the little people.
[00:46:28.159 --> 00:46:35.243]  You know, they call Appalachian people white trash, you know, white gorillas, and they call them bitter clingers.
[00:46:35.243 --> 00:46:36.963]  It's all the same crud, folks.
[00:46:36.963 --> 00:46:38.004]  They call us all scum.
[00:46:39.653 --> 00:46:55.225]  Well see, in that picture for me, because, you know, he's sort of the hipster hero, he's the revolutionary and everything, and then you've got a lot of these Black Lives Matter people out there protesting, not understanding that they're being orchestrated by George Soros and other billionaires to do their thing.
[00:46:55.225 --> 00:46:57.087]  And Obama agreed on this whole trip.
[00:46:57.087 --> 00:47:01.630]  This is all iconic, communist, his campaign stuff was communist, it's crazy.
[00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:07.615]  And he's not a communist, he's a fascist, coming in with select corporations like Google, who will have a monopoly in Cuba now.
[00:47:07.975 --> 00:47:08.335]  Oh yeah.
[00:47:08.335 --> 00:47:12.637]  Notice, they're keeping it tyrannical because they're going to control just like China.
[00:47:12.637 --> 00:47:13.138]  Oh no, I'm sorry.
[00:47:13.138 --> 00:47:15.159]  They're going to give them a free and open internet.
[00:47:15.159 --> 00:47:16.319]  Come on.
[00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:19.781]  Well, what's incredible is they're just going to let select companies in on top of it.
[00:47:19.781 --> 00:47:20.021]  Right.
[00:47:20.021 --> 00:47:23.923]  It really is fascism using communism and the left loves it.
[00:47:23.923 --> 00:47:26.484]  Jeb Bush backs Ted Cruz for president.
[00:47:26.484 --> 00:47:32.147]  CNN, this was predicted now seven days ago on Wednesday with Roger Stone.
[00:47:32.147 --> 00:47:32.847]  We played it earlier.
[00:47:32.847 --> 00:47:33.527]  What do you make of that?
[00:47:33.527 --> 00:47:36.589]  I mean, for me, that is a political nail in the coffin, Leigh-Anne.
[00:47:37.273 --> 00:47:47.563]  Yeah, well, and that kind of ties into what I wanted to talk about with Trump today because now, you know, Heidi Cruz has come out responding to Trump saying that he's going to spill the beans on her secrets as well.
[00:47:47.563 --> 00:47:49.765]  So she responds to him.
[00:47:49.765 --> 00:47:56.452]  And one of the things that she's really pushing is that Ted Cruz is the only candidate that is for the Constitution.
[00:47:56.452 --> 00:48:00.416]  And so now they're really going to be pointing out how he's there for the Constitution.
[00:48:00.816 --> 00:48:01.316]  That's right.
[00:48:01.316 --> 00:48:09.283]  Trump wants to act tough and blue collar and let's torture people and let's spy on the terrorists and that is going to blow up in his face with libertarians and others.
[00:48:09.283 --> 00:48:10.444]  He's got to stop it.
[00:48:10.444 --> 00:48:11.525]  Yeah, he really does.
[00:48:11.525 --> 00:48:16.289]  And so that's where they're going to really start playing them off because you think they say, Trump, oh, he's crazy.
[00:48:16.289 --> 00:48:17.270]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:18.551]  He's racist, this, that.
[00:48:18.551 --> 00:48:21.974]  But as soon as the terror attacks are going on, they don't even know the body count yet.
[00:48:21.974 --> 00:48:23.295]  They're like, let's get Trump on the phone.
[00:48:23.775 --> 00:48:25.977]  Like, let's let him talk and tell us what's going on.
[00:48:25.977 --> 00:48:26.738]  Sure, and he was right.
[00:48:26.738 --> 00:48:28.680]  He said Brussels is going to get hit.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.681]  He mentioned Brussels specifically.
[00:48:30.681 --> 00:48:32.463]  That's where the terrorists are living and staying.
[00:48:32.463 --> 00:48:37.087]  They've basically taken the city over of Brussels, Belgium.
[00:48:37.087 --> 00:48:42.392]  And so Trump's right about so many things and it's okay to use the NSA on non-citizen targets.
[00:48:42.392 --> 00:48:44.074]  Turns out the police knew these guys.
[00:48:44.494 --> 00:48:47.157]  They were involved in organized crime, connected to terrorists.
[00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:48.798]  Again, nothing was done, Leigh-Anne.
[00:48:48.798 --> 00:48:50.980]  Right, well, and the other guy was being protected.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:59.228]  Until they picked him up a week or so ago, he was being protected by people in the Molenbeek neighborhood for months.
[00:48:59.228 --> 00:49:02.451]  They knew he was walking around in the grocery store, and they didn't turn him in.
[00:49:02.731 --> 00:49:04.392]  And this was an attack on the United States.
[00:49:04.392 --> 00:49:10.234]  They targeted the American Airlines line, blew up a bunch of Americans, and I mean, I'm sick of it.
[00:49:10.234 --> 00:49:22.979]  I'm tired of these people that want to kill Americans, when most Americans have open arms, and Belgium is so liberal, and Spain and all these countries have let these people in, Germany, France, and then they attack them.
[00:49:22.979 --> 00:49:31.222]  They're just so arrogant, they're so entitled, they think they're on this jihad, and now the West will just use this to bomb innocent Muslim countries.
[00:49:31.883 --> 00:49:33.066]  Let's go to clip number one.
[00:49:33.066 --> 00:49:34.951]  This is what you're concerned about with Trump.
[00:49:34.951 --> 00:49:37.578]  Should there be added security at the TSA?
[00:49:37.578 --> 00:49:38.280]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:49:39.124 --> 00:49:46.088]  You're from New York City, where there are at least three major airports, the most trafficked train station in the country.
[00:49:46.088 --> 00:49:47.609]  Should there be added layers?
[00:49:47.609 --> 00:49:56.034]  I know security is always high in New York, especially after 9-11, but should there be added levels of security put in place right now?
[00:49:56.034 --> 00:50:01.298]  For example, at airport baggage claim centers, train stations, other places?
[00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:02.927]  Yes, sir, should.
[00:50:02.927 --> 00:50:06.572]  And, you know, we have a mayor who's doing a terrible job, and everybody talks about it.
[00:50:06.572 --> 00:50:09.576]  He's doing a terrible job in so many ways, de Blasio.
[00:50:09.576 --> 00:50:10.918]  He's a disaster as a mayor.
[00:50:11.756 --> 00:50:13.438]  And probably will be challenged.
[00:50:13.438 --> 00:50:18.382]  I can't imagine that he gets away with this, but he knocked out surveillance and so many other things.
[00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:26.709]  You know, we had the finest surveillance of the whole radical Islam situation that there is, they say in the world, the New York City Police Department.
[00:50:26.709 --> 00:50:26.969]  Alright.
[00:50:26.969 --> 00:50:29.191]  Which is an amazing department.
[00:50:29.191 --> 00:50:34.996]  Right, and so of course now he's talking about that secret NYPD surveillance program that they had to dismantle.
[00:50:35.609 --> 00:50:36.750]  That's right Leanne.
[00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:40.273]  Now again, he's right when he says shut it all off until you check them.
[00:50:40.273 --> 00:50:41.534]  Don't let them in.
[00:50:41.534 --> 00:50:43.496]  That's what you do at your border.
[00:50:43.496 --> 00:50:45.658]  That's what you do with people from these countries.
[00:50:45.658 --> 00:50:46.639]  You don't let them in.
[00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:56.888]  You don't then surveil everyone and spend $4 billion on surveillance equipment in New York, $2 billion in Boston since 9-11.
[00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:59.510]  The East Coast has spent over $10 billion
[00:51:01.076 --> 00:51:08.180]  In all sorts of spy gadgets and mobile x-ray vans and checkpoints and searches.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.681]  We're not against the police themselves.
[00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:19.847]  We're against the policy of the TSA groping our genitals, putting us in naked body scanners, and then they allow the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudis, that's in the news, to bypass it.
[00:51:19.847 --> 00:51:21.688]  It's all a fraud.
[00:51:21.688 --> 00:51:23.028]  It's all a hoax.
[00:51:23.028 --> 00:51:24.149]  That's why Trump's wrong.
[00:51:24.229 --> 00:51:33.731]  And they dismantled this secret surveillance program because it was a violation of the constitutional rights of the people there, but yet they're surveilling the rest of the country.
[00:51:33.731 --> 00:51:34.591]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:40.273]  Leave the radical Muslims alone, go after the FBI when they do their job, but then target the Tea Party and say we're the number one terror threat.
[00:51:40.273 --> 00:51:41.053]  We've got a bunch of clips.
[00:51:41.053 --> 00:51:42.333]  Let's go to this other clip.
[00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:44.814]  He says change the law on torture.
[00:51:44.814 --> 00:51:47.574]  So first he backs off torture because they say it's illegal.
[00:51:47.574 --> 00:51:48.695]  Now he says change the law.
[00:51:48.695 --> 00:51:49.275]  Don't like this.
[00:51:49.275 --> 00:51:49.575]  Here it is.
[00:51:50.155 --> 00:52:02.481]  I think we have to change our law on, you know, the waterboarding thing where they could chop off heads and they can drown people in cages and heavy steel cages and we can't waterboard.
[00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:08.164]  So we have to change our laws and we have to be able to fight at least on an almost equal basis.
[00:52:08.164 --> 00:52:12.066]  We have laws that we have to obey in terms of torture.
[00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:14.947]  They have no laws whatsoever that they have to obey.
[00:52:16.808 --> 00:52:26.214]  Look, we don't become, because Jeffrey Dahmer kills teenagers, or Ted Bundy kills women, we don't go out and do it because somebody else did.
[00:52:26.214 --> 00:52:31.257]  They're ISIS and Al-Qaeda because they target innocents, they torture people.
[00:52:31.257 --> 00:52:33.299]  We don't start doing that.
[00:52:33.299 --> 00:52:37.521]  George Washington didn't allow that because you lose the moral high ground.
[00:52:38.542 --> 00:52:39.843]  Let's expand on that.
[00:52:39.843 --> 00:52:41.224]  And I want Leanne to comment.
[00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:43.606]  He's meaning to say, let's get tough on terrorists.
[00:52:43.606 --> 00:52:46.828]  The problem is they're going to do it to us, folks.
[00:52:46.828 --> 00:52:54.134]  They're not going to do it to the terrorists who the establishment and who Hillary and who others have been arming and putting in charge.
[00:52:54.134 --> 00:52:56.756]  They're bringing radical Islam into attack us.
[00:52:56.756 --> 00:53:01.059]  Trump could not be more wrong on this, but at least he's honest and says, let's change the law.
[00:53:01.059 --> 00:53:01.279]  Go ahead.
[00:53:01.519 --> 00:53:05.985]  Well, I honestly do not feel as though Trump is coming from a malicious place.
[00:53:05.985 --> 00:53:09.009]  I honestly think that he wants to keep America safe.
[00:53:09.009 --> 00:53:15.999]  I think that he truly is wanting to talk tough and saying, listen, they're putting people in cages and electrocuting them and doing all this torture.
[00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:17.020]  Yeah, these guys are animals.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.382]  They don't deserve the same rights we've got.
[00:53:18.462 --> 00:53:20.683]  Right, and so why can't we treat them the same way?
[00:53:20.683 --> 00:53:25.685]  And so that's, I get it where he's coming from, where he truly feels like he wants... Sure, at least he's being honest.
[00:53:25.685 --> 00:53:31.867]  I mean, the other people just do the torture to get false confessions, and then basically say they're not doing it.
[00:53:31.867 --> 00:53:35.588]  But that was the big warning, don't trade your liberty for security.
[00:53:35.588 --> 00:53:36.788]  Because you get tyranny, absolutely.
[00:53:36.788 --> 00:53:40.850]  Let's go to this other clip, and you've got another list that we'll get pulled up and go to.
[00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.851]  We have a radical Islamic problem.
[00:53:43.991 --> 00:53:46.874]  Yeah, he's one of the only people that'll actually say it, so kudos to him for that.
[00:53:46.874 --> 00:53:47.714]  Well, it's beyond that.
[00:53:47.714 --> 00:53:50.917]  Islam has been taken over by the radicals in almost every area.
[00:53:50.917 --> 00:53:54.400]  Our government puts radical jihadists in to take over countries that aren't radical.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.762]  And then we'll never whisper the words.
[00:53:56.762 --> 00:54:00.545]  Yeah, our government and other governments are behind it, folks.
[00:54:00.545 --> 00:54:04.869]  Like Tim Kennedy said, they're bringing them in to attack us to take our freedom.
[00:54:04.869 --> 00:54:06.311]  That's what Trump doesn't get.
[00:54:06.311 --> 00:54:07.672]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:54:08.342 --> 00:54:16.649]  What do you say to the millions of Muslim Americans who are very patriotic, loyal Americans, many of whom have sons and daughters who serve in the U.S.
[00:54:16.649 --> 00:54:21.893]  military, who feel they would be discriminated against if these policies went forward?
[00:54:21.893 --> 00:54:23.374]  I say we have a problem.
[00:54:23.374 --> 00:54:26.556]  We have a radical Islamic terrorism problem.
[00:54:26.556 --> 00:54:27.297]  That's what I say.
[00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.458]  I have to say that.
[00:54:28.458 --> 00:54:31.060]  We have a problem like we've never had before.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.422]  There's a problem that has gone on.
[00:54:33.422 --> 00:54:37.525]  General Pershing had the problem in 1919 in the Philippines with
[00:54:38.005 --> 00:54:40.488]  Radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:54:40.488 --> 00:54:42.331]  And he handled it a certain way.
[00:54:42.331 --> 00:54:43.953]  I think you probably know that story.
[00:54:43.953 --> 00:54:45.154]  It's a very gruesome story.
[00:54:45.154 --> 00:54:46.075]  But you know what?
[00:54:46.075 --> 00:54:49.740]  The problem didn't exist for 48 years after that happened.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.963]  So, we have to be a lot tougher than we are.
[00:54:51.963 --> 00:54:56.048]  Right now they look at us as weak, soft, stupid people.
[00:54:56.616 --> 00:54:58.418]  Look at the scene on CNN right now.
[00:54:58.418 --> 00:54:59.939]  All the bodies all over the floor.
[00:54:59.939 --> 00:55:00.220]  Okay.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.841]  And we're worried about waterboarding.
[00:55:01.841 --> 00:55:03.223]  Talk about a dialectic.
[00:55:03.223 --> 00:55:08.067]  You know, the establishment comes in and says, torture everybody, take all rights, go out to the tea party.
[00:55:08.067 --> 00:55:11.310]  Meanwhile, they're funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS and turning them loose everywhere.
[00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:17.456]  Trump comes in and says, don't run Al-Qaeda, don't run ISIS, don't turn them over to Syria, don't do this to Libya.
[00:55:17.456 --> 00:55:18.277]  It's a disaster.
[00:55:18.277 --> 00:55:18.918]  You screwed up.
[00:55:19.258 --> 00:55:20.659]  No, they did it by design.
[00:55:20.659 --> 00:55:23.200]  Hillary admits Syria and Libya are what they want.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.141]  Quote, failed states.
[00:55:24.141 --> 00:55:24.781]  Okay?
[00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:25.742]  That's the facts.
[00:55:25.742 --> 00:55:27.883]  Then he says, let's get tough on these people.
[00:55:27.883 --> 00:55:29.124]  Don't bring them in.
[00:55:29.124 --> 00:55:30.625]  Stop them being brought in.
[00:55:30.625 --> 00:55:34.387]  And when we catch them, let's torture them to find out where the other ones are at.
[00:55:34.387 --> 00:55:34.527]  Right.
[00:55:34.847 --> 00:55:42.353]  Okay, well if we hadn't financed them and turned them loose and funded Saudi Arabia and bought trillions in their oil, this wouldn't be happening.
[00:55:42.353 --> 00:55:52.441]  So Trump, you cut off Saudi Arabia, you cut off their oil, you block bringing these people in, you deport everybody that shoots their mouth off about jihad,
[00:55:53.021 --> 00:55:55.903]  You throw their ass in jail, they're not a citizen.
[00:55:55.903 --> 00:55:59.786]  You put them on an airplane and send them back to their third world dirt hole.
[00:55:59.786 --> 00:56:01.467]  You send them back to their rat hole.
[00:56:01.467 --> 00:56:05.110]  That's getting tough and you turn the republic.
[00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:15.158]  And anybody, you got free speech, but when you say you want to overthrow things and put a monotheistic cult in, you're not an American, you're a terrorist, and you need to get your butt out of this country.
[00:56:15.158 --> 00:56:16.679]  That's how you get tough!
[00:56:16.679 --> 00:56:18.280]  That's what you do, Trump!
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:18.940]  Got it?
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.441]  That's it!
[00:56:19.781 --> 00:56:22.243]  Not butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution!
[00:56:22.243 --> 00:56:30.650]  Now, I respect Trump for saying what he wants to say and what he wants to do, but this is going to fall into the hands of the neocons and the fascist, communist, liberal filth.
[00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:31.710]  Sorry, Leigh-Anne, go ahead.
[00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:41.598]  No, I totally agree with you, and that's why I wanted to bring this up, is that they are going... You can even see Wolf Blitzer, he's like leading... Oh, so how far would you go with the torture?
[00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:42.159]  Oh, Alex Jones...
[00:56:42.879 --> 00:56:52.022]  Oh yeah, just look at it, and the establishment is just, this will be the thing that they'll say, you know what, let's go ahead and put Trump in, because he can convince all of these Americans to build their own prison.
[00:56:52.022 --> 00:57:11.827]  Trump needs to start talking about prosecuting Hillary and prosecuting the neocons for running Al Qaeda and ISIS and putting them in charge, and Merkel needs to be arrested, and Hollande, they brought him in, they aided and abetted, they opened the door, they stood down so they could take our rights, and they're doing it, and we see through it, and we're done!
[00:57:12.367 --> 00:57:13.147]  Absolutely.
[00:57:13.147 --> 00:57:13.748]  I'm sorry, Leigh Ann.
[00:57:13.748 --> 00:57:14.788]  I don't mean to be screaming while you're in here.
[00:57:14.788 --> 00:57:16.769]  Let's go out to break with one more clip.
[00:57:16.769 --> 00:57:18.090]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.011]  Be very vigilant, very strong.
[00:57:20.011 --> 00:57:22.031]  We're not going to have a country back.
[00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:22.872]  That's right.
[00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:31.396]  We need to be vigilant and point out that criminals run our country that are in alliance with radical, Sunni, Wahhabist, filth, garbage.
[00:57:31.396 --> 00:57:31.996]  Here's the clip.
[00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:39.519]  You look at what's going on in Germany, you look at what's going on even in a part of Sweden, where they're having problems like they never thought possible.
[00:57:39.519 --> 00:57:45.162]  Sweden never had problems like this, where a group came in and now all of a sudden they have a section.
[00:57:45.162 --> 00:57:52.405]  So, we can be nice about it, and we can be politically correct about it, but we're being fools, okay?
[00:57:52.405 --> 00:57:57.647]  We're being absolute... Alright, Ali, I'm gonna hold you over the next five minutes so you can talk before we, uh...
[00:57:58.988 --> 00:58:01.089]  Go to Larry Nichols and take some phone calls.
[00:58:01.089 --> 00:58:06.370]  And then we have the Senate candidate right now, the Republican candidate, a great lady, a doctor that's beating John McCain.
[00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.710]  But he's always getting beat and they just steal the election.
[00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.891]  Major election fraud news coming up as well.
[00:58:10.891 --> 00:58:12.971]  But Leanne, we should get mad though.
[00:58:12.971 --> 00:58:13.772]  You were mad this morning.
[00:58:13.772 --> 00:58:19.653]  I really am fundamentally mad that our government's run by people bringing jihadis in and their answer is take all our rights away.
[00:58:19.653 --> 00:58:23.574]  Yeah, and then they see where they can use Trump to push that surveillance state.
[00:58:23.854 --> 00:58:24.154]  Yeah.
[00:58:24.154 --> 00:58:25.135]  You made really great points.
[00:58:25.135 --> 00:58:30.960]  I'm going to try to shut up for four or five minutes when we come back to give you the floor to flush out more of your points and where you see this election going.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:38.205]  Then we've got Larry Nichols popping in with Inside Baseball on how they plan to start a civil war, which becomes clearer and clearer every day, second hour.
[00:58:38.205 --> 00:58:39.506]  Tell folks to call in.
[00:58:39.506 --> 00:58:41.948]  Tell your friends to listen right now, not call in.
[00:58:41.948 --> 00:58:44.910]  We're going to take the phones later, but tell folks to tune in right now.
[00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.231]  This is a war!
[00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:47.853]  We have the truth, we can smash the enemy!
[00:58:48.533 --> 00:58:50.616]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[00:58:50.616 --> 00:58:51.838]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:58:51.838 --> 00:58:53.420]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:56.524]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:58:56.524 --> 00:58:57.605]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[00:58:57.605 --> 00:58:58.587]  I'd been working all day.
[00:58:58.587 --> 00:59:01.090]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.512]  I get in here at 830.
[00:59:02.512 --> 00:59:04.415]  I was kind of run down.
[00:59:04.415 --> 00:59:06.137]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[00:59:06.337 --> 00:59:08.218]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:59:08.218 --> 00:59:10.040]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.100]  I popped two of them.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.382]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:59:13.382 --> 00:59:15.263]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:59:15.263 --> 00:59:16.844]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:59:16.844 --> 00:59:18.165]  People really love it.
[00:59:18.165 --> 00:59:18.766]  Read about it.
[00:59:18.766 --> 00:59:22.608]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:59:22.608 --> 00:59:27.892]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:59:28.072 --> 00:59:32.093]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[00:59:32.093 --> 00:59:38.235]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[00:59:38.235 --> 00:59:43.656]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:43.656 --> 00:59:45.317]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.927 --> 01:00:15.389]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.389 --> 01:00:32.494]  Hey, I'm not name-dropping right now, but I need to push people like Dave Mustaine and Billy Corrigan, other really smart people that are libertarians, free humans, not conservative, not liberal, especially when you're talking about Corrigan, to come on the show, because they're always making great points to me in text.
[01:00:33.294 --> 01:00:35.875]  And messages and stuff and then they're like, yeah, I'll come on.
[01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:36.835]  It never happens.
[01:00:36.835 --> 01:00:40.595]  And then there's Dave Mustaine in a bombshell interview on Fox.
[01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.776]  He gets obviously attacked when he comes out and speaks out.
[01:00:42.776 --> 01:00:46.457]  But Billy's making some really good points here in text about a show you want to host.
[01:00:46.457 --> 01:00:48.057]  Billy, we know you're coming to town next month.
[01:00:48.057 --> 01:00:49.377]  You've got to come in studio.
[01:00:49.377 --> 01:00:52.378]  Or we want you on to Mara via Skype or something.
[01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:54.298]  He's watching right now.
[01:00:54.298 --> 01:00:55.098]  I'm not name dropping.
[01:00:55.098 --> 01:00:55.918]  I mean, he won't mind.
[01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.359]  He's just such a smart guy.
[01:00:57.359 --> 01:00:58.499]  And I would call him a real liberal.
[01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:05.583]  Liberal means more freedom, more of your tax money, more right to self-defense, more choices, more tolerance.
[01:01:05.583 --> 01:01:07.184]  Like, I'm tolerant of everybody.
[01:01:07.184 --> 01:01:11.207]  I don't even dislike anybody, unless you're a radical jihadi that wants to cut my head off.
[01:01:11.207 --> 01:01:12.848]  And I don't mean to start screaming and yelling.
[01:01:12.848 --> 01:01:13.869]  That's not an act, folks.
[01:01:13.869 --> 01:01:16.571]  I'm genuinely... You've seen me today, and I'm in piss today.
[01:01:16.571 --> 01:01:18.092]  Yeah, I mean, and I would be too.
[01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:19.933]  It just, it gets so frustrating.
[01:01:19.933 --> 01:01:25.297]  And you are able to take that anger and channel it and, you know, put that force field out there.
[01:01:25.297 --> 01:01:27.078]  You do it better than I. Leanne, you've got the floor.
[01:01:27.078 --> 01:01:28.539]  You've got a lot of points for three and a half minutes.
[01:01:28.539 --> 01:01:28.779]  Go ahead.
[01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:29.104]  You
[01:01:29.738 --> 01:01:38.004]  Well, I just wanted to bring this up with Donald Trump because, you know, I do feel like he is someone who's on the outside and we've been watching how they've been attacking him.
[01:01:38.004 --> 01:01:39.245]  We've got to take him down.
[01:01:39.245 --> 01:01:40.827]  We've got to dismantle him.
[01:01:40.827 --> 01:01:44.770]  And at every turn calling him a Nazi, you know, he's Hitler.
[01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:58.861]  And then now when it comes to something like this, where he wants to increase the surveillance, change the laws on torture, they're just kind of letting him speak and letting him put himself in that position because so many Americans support Donald Trump.
[01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:03.545]  And I mean, there's signs where people are like, build that wall, I'll help you build it.
[01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:11.132]  And I know David Knight makes this point a lot, that if we have a wall, we're stuck inside of it, you know?
[01:02:11.132 --> 01:02:15.016]  And... No wall's a total stunt, there's a tunnel under it.
[01:02:15.016 --> 01:02:20.320]  But it's like, it's even the virtual wall, the cyber wall, this surveillance state, this security.
[01:02:21.141 --> 01:02:26.284]  I mean we're building, we're begging them to build a prison to keep us safe and we know that that's a choice.
[01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:35.289]  And we know it'll be used against us and not the foaming at the mouth criminals and jihadis who are leaving their own countries because they're constantly killing each other.
[01:02:35.289 --> 01:02:35.809]  Why would you?
[01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:38.171]  I'm not even against these people because there's some nice people in those countries.
[01:02:39.031 --> 01:02:48.733]  But a good percentage of them, a good minority of them are just psycho killers who absolutely believe it's okay to murder whoever they want and like keep women as slaves.
[01:02:48.733 --> 01:02:50.533]  I mean, as a woman, what is it like for you?
[01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:55.674]  Because I have daughters and the jihadists really punch my buttons now that I have daughters.
[01:02:55.674 --> 01:03:01.175]  I mean, let me tell you, you know, some jihadi like to do in Europe ever slaps my daughters around or bosses them around somewhere.
[01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:05.296]  You know, there's a reason all this dominating folks is going on in Europe.
[01:03:05.296 --> 01:03:08.657]  America's had its huevos chopped off to a certain extent, but not completely.
[01:03:09.357 --> 01:03:23.204]  Yeah, no, for me that's one of the most frustrating things that I'm having to watch and to see a certain regressive left, as Paul calls them, just making excuses and saying, well, why would you attack their ideology?
[01:03:23.204 --> 01:03:27.346]  And then some, I think it was a Bill Maher who comes out and says, well,
[01:03:28.467 --> 01:03:30.589]  Killing women who've been raped.
[01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:33.231]  I think I have a problem with that kind of ideology.
[01:03:33.231 --> 01:03:35.472]  Like it's the woman's fault that she was raped.
[01:03:35.472 --> 01:03:38.575]  But she disgraced, so she's gonna get acid thrown in her face.
[01:03:38.575 --> 01:03:41.777]  And we're seeing that now being imported to Sweden and Germany.
[01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:45.340]  And everybody that's upset about this needs to speak out against it.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.583]  And I know Billy has, and I know Dave has, and a lot of folks have courage.
[01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:52.265]  So many other big movie stars, TV people, rock stars.
[01:03:53.286 --> 01:03:54.107]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:54.107 --> 01:03:58.812]  And that's the thing that's frightening is because I'm seeing we are on this precipice here with Trump.
[01:03:58.812 --> 01:04:02.295]  I mean, he's such a, you know, the real American hero, you know, but then he's like, and he in his heart,
[01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:17.068]  I honestly think that he does want to protect us and keep us safe.
[01:04:17.068 --> 01:04:19.970]  Sure, well he knows the military's been torturing since Vietnam.
[01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:20.290]  Right.
[01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.951]  So he knows what's going on, so he says, yeah, we're going to do it.
[01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:24.852]  And you know what's going on.
[01:04:24.852 --> 01:04:27.894]  He's a realist about it, but he doesn't get the sophistication.
[01:04:27.894 --> 01:04:28.875]  Or maybe he does.
[01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:29.695]  I just don't know.
[01:04:29.695 --> 01:04:31.456]  Well, that's what he said to Wolf Blitzer.
[01:04:31.456 --> 01:04:34.238]  He's like, I don't agree that the military doesn't want to torture.
[01:04:34.858 --> 01:04:36.739]  He says they're saying that to be politically correct.
[01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:39.940]  Well, look, you don't put it in law and you don't do it occasionally.
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.541]  You know, a guy's got a bomb strapped to a five-year-old that's about to blow him up with him.
[01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:49.603]  I've talked to special forces people that went ahead and tortured the guy to get him to, you know, get the codes.
[01:04:49.603 --> 01:04:53.584]  But you don't sit there and write it down, and you don't just do it in a general system.
[01:04:53.584 --> 01:04:54.404]  Or take pictures.
[01:04:54.404 --> 01:04:55.304]  Leanne, exactly.
[01:04:55.304 --> 01:04:55.904]  Great job.
[01:04:55.904 --> 01:04:57.005]  Are you turning to the Monster Society?
[01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:19.411]  I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times, because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer, and that all the very many adverse effects, which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[01:05:19.731 --> 01:05:24.494]  That was a statement made in April 2014 by a French medical doctor, Bernard Delberg.
[01:05:24.494 --> 01:05:29.877]  He's a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Merck, the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine Gardasil.
[01:05:29.877 --> 01:05:37.682]  And now, almost two years later, Dr. Sing-Hang Lee, director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in Connecticut, has proved these predictions correct.
[01:05:37.682 --> 01:05:39.103]  He published a letter sent to the U.S.
[01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:42.105]  CDC, the World Health Organization, and the Ministry of Health in Japan.
[01:05:42.145 --> 01:05:42.645]  We're good.
[01:05:58.473 --> 01:06:01.994]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:01.994 --> 01:06:10.235]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:10.235 --> 01:06:15.637]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:06:15.637 --> 01:06:18.177]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:06:58.235 --> 01:07:01.436]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:01.436 --> 01:07:03.776]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:34.404]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:07:34.404 --> 01:07:41.486]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike Georex herbal processing technique.
[01:07:41.486 --> 01:07:46.868]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best.
[01:07:47.108 --> 01:07:52.352]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:52.352 --> 01:07:54.073]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.466 --> 01:08:16.307]  If you're a radio listener, you can obviously go to Infowars.com to see it.
[01:08:16.307 --> 01:08:20.148]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article, the full video.
[01:08:20.148 --> 01:08:23.069]  Obama was giving hour-long interviews on ESPN.
[01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:25.670]  He was at a baseball game for four hours.
[01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:31.832]  He was all over the place, meeting with Raul Castro, the dictator, the hereditary dictator.
[01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:36.493]  Like North Korea, they pass it to the family, the new royalty.
[01:08:36.493 --> 01:08:39.954]  Just laughing and had 56 seconds to say about
[01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:45.577]  What happened in Brussels, Belgium?
[01:08:45.577 --> 01:08:57.184]  Where our reporters were, a day and a half, two days after the terrorist attacks, which is an hour and a half away, and the terrorists had reportedly run there, they caught the mastermind last week.
[01:08:57.184 --> 01:09:02.367]  So as a diversion, obviously, they launched these attacks to be able to evacuate.
[01:09:02.367 --> 01:09:09.671]  Our experts believe, not just Joe Biggs, but counterterrorism specialists like Tim Kennedy, but Biggs is an expert as well, living through it,
[01:09:10.976 --> 01:09:13.737]  That there will now be more attacks.
[01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:19.159]  And when there are more attacks, the answer will be it's Donald Trump for criticizing Islam.
[01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:22.841]  And it's Donald Trump for blaming Islam.
[01:09:22.841 --> 01:09:24.501]  It's truly sick.
[01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:34.125]  There are Muslims that don't want to blow things up and that you would see as apostates or heretics according to mainline Sunni Shiite Muslims.
[01:09:35.265 --> 01:09:40.168]  Now, from my research, the Sunni Wahhabists are the most dangerous, virulent group.
[01:09:40.168 --> 01:09:41.850]  They're the dominant group out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:46.193]  They're running around bullying everybody worldwide, mainly Muslims.
[01:09:46.193 --> 01:09:49.695]  Alawites, Shiites, and others.
[01:09:49.695 --> 01:09:51.236]  And they're extremely oppressive.
[01:09:51.236 --> 01:09:56.900]  Shiites around the world let Christians and Jews live and operate in peace.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.863]  If they don't get political, the minute they do, they're deader than a hammer.
[01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.384]  They're the original Muslims.
[01:10:02.384 --> 01:10:03.685]  The Wahhabists are
[01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:15.159]  Sex trade, slave trade, scum, desert bandits that took over in 1901 and created Saudi Arabia by 1930.
[01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:17.821]  Set up the Royal House, British intelligence backed them.
[01:10:17.821 --> 01:10:20.484]  There's a double-cross deal now to bring them in worldwide.
[01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:24.847]  They'll attack, and then the West will be able to take its citizens' liberty.
[01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:27.610]  Tim Kennedy, again, anti-terrorism specialist.
[01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:29.912]  The highest levels of army counter-terrorism.
[01:10:29.912 --> 01:10:31.213]  I won't even get into what units.
[01:10:31.213 --> 01:10:33.235]  He won't even tell me, but I've looked it up and I know.
[01:10:35.089 --> 01:10:43.453]  He came on the show and said, our governments and the left are bringing them in to destabilize and bring in crises to take our freedoms.
[01:10:43.453 --> 01:10:44.754]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:10:44.754 --> 01:10:46.415]  That's the fact.
[01:10:46.415 --> 01:10:52.878]  Now, Larry Nichols, in his own right, was counterterrorism and a Green Beret in special operations in Latin America and Europe and you name it.
[01:10:52.878 --> 01:10:55.740]  He could speak to all this and he ran campaigns for the Clintons.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.680]  He was their big insider.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.041]  He was in the hospital last week.
[01:10:58.041 --> 01:10:59.062]  He's out by the grace of God.
[01:10:59.062 --> 01:11:02.884]  We appreciate him joining us, but we now have what we predicted
[01:11:03.877 --> 01:11:10.679]  Last week with Trump insider Roger Stone saying, look for the Jeb Bush to endorse Bush.
[01:11:10.679 --> 01:11:12.100]  Excuse me, Freudian slip.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:16.861]  Their surrogate, their minion, because their name is Freud, Ted Cruz.
[01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:20.323]  I like Ted Cruz's rhetoric, but boy, his pedigree is Bush all the way.
[01:11:20.323 --> 01:11:23.904]  I'm not going to get back into it, but we'll play that short clip.
[01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:27.325]  It's about a minute long, coming up a little bit later.
[01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:32.527]  We have Arizona primary with Trump wins Arizona, Cruz wins Utah.
[01:11:33.877 --> 01:11:42.398]  Brussels terror three suspects identified suicide bombers were brothers they came in reportedly posing as migrant refugees.
[01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:50.720]  There's evidence of election fraud up on DrudgeReport.com from Godlike Productions going through Utah caucuses.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:12:03.162]  Mastermind bomber who poses migrant attacked Paris last year is now chief suspect in Belgian atrocities police swoop in on home district in these no-go zones that they said Trump was lying about.
[01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:09.253]  They are also asking, who would be a better fighter of terror, Trump or Clinton?
[01:12:09.253 --> 01:12:12.755]  Clinton's running ISIS and Al Qaeda on record.
[01:12:12.755 --> 01:12:26.004]  Meanwhile, a teacher who witnessed his Muslim students celebrating in the classroom after the attack, Paul Joseph Watson reports on, was given a police visit for his free speech.
[01:12:27.082 --> 01:12:30.305]  Yoga instructor shocked at support for terror bombings.
[01:12:30.305 --> 01:12:37.030]  A Belgian yoga instructor who tweeted that Muslim children were celebrating the attacks in Brussels, later received a home visit from the police.
[01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:38.011]  Oh!
[01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:50.782]  On the same morning that the attacks unfolded, Ivar Moll tweeted, how do you remember a lesson if there is your class, this is translated, is applauded by Muslim children?
[01:12:50.782 --> 01:12:54.045]  The tweet was accompanied by hashtags and it went into the attack.
[01:12:55.103 --> 01:13:04.146]  Hours later, he tweeted that three police officers had visited his home and that there was no way he'd be tweeting in the future.
[01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:06.146]  Quote, no longer will be tweeting.
[01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:12.488]  The police said they visited him because we wanted to see what was going on and whether it was true that there was applause in the classroom.
[01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:15.769]  Yeah, right.
[01:13:15.769 --> 01:13:19.050]  Seven strange questions about the Brussels terror attacks.
[01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:20.730]  We'll talk about that as well.
[01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.631]  But joining us is
[01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:29.390]  Larry Nichols, the consummate Clinton insider, to talk about what's happening, what's unfolding.
[01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:31.071]  Larry, what do you want to tackle first?
[01:13:31.071 --> 01:13:38.275]  The election, the bombings, the latest inside baseball on the investigation into the Scalia death.
[01:13:38.275 --> 01:13:40.196]  What's front and center, my friend?
[01:13:40.196 --> 01:13:43.998]  Front and center, Alex, I believe is the election.
[01:13:43.998 --> 01:13:52.482]  Just before coming on this program, I received information about the strategy from the RNC, the new strategy.
[01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:57.257]  And pretty dastardly.
[01:13:57.257 --> 01:14:00.658]  But you know, Alex, I got to say this in front of your audience.
[01:14:00.658 --> 01:14:02.518]  I've done worse things in elections.
[01:14:02.518 --> 01:14:05.979]  I mean, I've written more elections than most people have voted in.
[01:14:05.979 --> 01:14:16.242]  What they're going to do, and this comes from what you saw with Jeb Bush endorsing Cruz, what they're going to do is they're going to go to all extremes to make sure
[01:14:17.222 --> 01:14:18.623]  That Trump does not get 1237.
[01:14:18.623 --> 01:14:21.525]  They're going to do everything they can.
[01:14:21.525 --> 01:14:22.726]  They're going to back him.
[01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:24.167]  They're going to support Cruz.
[01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:26.709]  They're going to look like they're on fire for Cruz.
[01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:30.692]  But it's simply to keep Trump from getting 1237.
[01:14:30.692 --> 01:14:36.336]  At that point, they've got a brokered convention.
[01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:40.591]  And you know Alex, I tried to tell people last time I was on with you.
[01:14:40.591 --> 01:14:42.491]  You said this 10 months ago on our show.
[01:14:42.491 --> 01:14:43.451]  I know.
[01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:48.053]  You know, these parties, folks, they're not government agencies.
[01:14:48.053 --> 01:14:53.294]  They can change the rules as they choose, when they choose.
[01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:55.654]  They're rigging it against Trump.
[01:14:55.654 --> 01:15:05.817]  Now, I would give anything if somebody in this audience had the ability to get Trump to call me because I can tell him what they're going to do and give a strategy against it.
[01:15:05.817 --> 01:15:06.657]  For example,
[01:15:07.296 --> 01:15:13.201]  They're fixing to start showing on the news that Trump's audiences are diminishing.
[01:15:13.201 --> 01:15:13.761]  That's right.
[01:15:13.761 --> 01:15:21.027]  They're going to start showing that his big speeches and all these people coming by the tens of thousands, they're diminishing.
[01:15:21.027 --> 01:15:24.650]  You know how they're doing that?
[01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:27.432]  They're doing that with George Soros.
[01:15:27.432 --> 01:15:31.516]  You see, these protesters that are showing up at Trump's speeches.
[01:15:31.516 --> 01:15:32.937]  They're blocking the people from getting there.
[01:15:33.777 --> 01:15:49.892]  Well, what they're trying to do, they're trying to get people to come out with violence, start ruckuses, because they know, they know Alex, that moral Christian conservatives, they're not into that.
[01:15:49.892 --> 01:15:54.036]  And so, why would people come to a speech when they run the risk of getting hurt?
[01:15:54.036 --> 01:15:56.939]  Why would you bring your children to something that would be irresponsible?
[01:15:56.939 --> 01:15:57.920]  Sure, it's a chilling effect.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.021]  It is.
[01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:02.444]  And then so, of course, guess what happens?
[01:16:02.444 --> 01:16:05.427]  You get to hear that his audiences are dwindling down.
[01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:06.748]  The magic is gone.
[01:16:06.748 --> 01:16:11.372]  So the answer is it's got to be bigger audiences for the First Amendment to counter that ballooning.
[01:16:11.372 --> 01:16:12.133]  Absolutely.
[01:16:12.133 --> 01:16:14.135]  You know, folks, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:16:14.135 --> 01:16:16.517]  I'm going to tell you how to counter that.
[01:16:16.517 --> 01:16:22.223]  Go to Trump's rallies when you see these paid protesters.
[01:16:23.283 --> 01:16:24.324]  Don't pay any attention.
[01:16:24.324 --> 01:16:26.344]  Don't get in a shouting fest with them.
[01:16:26.344 --> 01:16:27.225]  Don't do anything.
[01:16:27.225 --> 01:16:30.766]  Just pretend they are not there.
[01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:39.330]  Now the other thing, anybody that gets attacked, this is a little inside trick that I guess I can be shot for telling you, but I'll tell you.
[01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:44.832]  Anybody that gets attacked, they need to file criminal charges.
[01:16:44.832 --> 01:16:50.435]  But what's neat about filing criminal charges, Alex, these people are being paid to be there.
[01:16:50.996 --> 01:16:52.416]  They're being paid to be there.
[01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:57.278]  And so they go back and demand lawyers and all the rest of it and that exposes the racketeering operation.
[01:16:57.278 --> 01:16:57.958]  You got it.
[01:16:57.958 --> 01:17:08.902]  And whoever paid them to go to that speech and to protest and throw a fit and cause violence, that person is a co-conspirator.
[01:17:08.902 --> 01:17:09.602]  Sure.
[01:17:09.602 --> 01:17:12.043]  When are people going to start pushing back to Soros?
[01:17:12.043 --> 01:17:16.604]  I mean, that old ugly, you know, Nazi collaborator.
[01:17:16.604 --> 01:17:19.125]  I mean, I mean, why is that guy so above the law?
[01:17:20.765 --> 01:17:23.066]  Money, power.
[01:17:23.066 --> 01:17:25.888]  You know, he's right at the epicenter.
[01:17:25.888 --> 01:17:30.211]  You know, I told you, I told you until I'm sick of telling that they're not going to indict Hillary.
[01:17:30.211 --> 01:17:35.454]  I don't think there's anybody now that has any doubt they're not going to indict Hillary.
[01:17:35.454 --> 01:17:43.299]  And the RNC is doing everything it can to make sure Hillary wins.
[01:17:43.299 --> 01:17:45.881]  I know, I know it sounds crazy, but they are.
[01:17:46.738 --> 01:17:57.164]  They're going to pick their original candidate, I feel like, may still come back into the poll, because once they go to that broker convention, you understand they can pick anybody they want to.
[01:17:57.164 --> 01:18:01.267]  Sure, when you were on 9, 10 months ago saying they're their own group, they can do whatever they want.
[01:18:01.847 --> 01:18:05.729]  That's right, and you know, they go with this ruse that the first time around in the convention
[01:18:30.794 --> 01:18:34.397]  The delegates have to vote with the vote of their state.
[01:18:34.397 --> 01:18:37.679]  That is an out and out lie.
[01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:43.964]  The delegates that are elected, when they get to that convention, get to vote their free will.
[01:18:43.964 --> 01:18:46.706]  That is the actual rule.
[01:18:46.706 --> 01:18:50.609]  And all this is about is to strip Trump of 1237.
[01:18:50.609 --> 01:18:51.530]  They beat him at a 1237, Alex.
[01:18:55.467 --> 01:19:00.748]  And we're going to get an appointed presidential candidate for the RNC.
[01:19:00.748 --> 01:19:15.190]  And they're now openly admitting Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, and having liberal media even mainline that that's okay to now have appointed candidates, there'll be a backlash against the Republicans, and Hillary will sail into victory.
[01:19:15.190 --> 01:19:16.111]  That's exactly it.
[01:19:16.111 --> 01:19:18.151]  That's it.
[01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:22.452]  You know, folks, I'm going to tell you, we can stop this.
[01:19:22.452 --> 01:19:23.872]  We can stop it, Alex.
[01:19:24.747 --> 01:19:27.210]  But Donald Trump, now I'm not trying to get a job.
[01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:30.734]  I don't want to work for Donald Trump.
[01:19:30.734 --> 01:19:36.961]  I want to do what I do while I still have breath in my lungs, which may not be that long.
[01:19:36.961 --> 01:19:40.104]  I want to do what I do.
[01:19:40.104 --> 01:19:41.666]  He has got to call me.
[01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:47.710]  Because as you know, Alex, maybe you can convince him I've got inside tips on what's coming.
[01:19:47.710 --> 01:19:53.898]  Well, I'm able to get messages to him, but that's about it, and he's surrounded by some pretty good folks, but some of them are pretty young.
[01:19:53.898 --> 01:19:58.284]  But yes, definitely, he does get the info that's on this show, but let's come back and talk about it.
[01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:02.592]  Hey everyone, in 20 plus years as a radio host, I've seen about everything.
[01:20:02.592 --> 01:20:06.995]  One thing that keeps recurring though, are these timeshare charlatans.
[01:20:06.995 --> 01:20:18.804]  These high pressure sales people who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer, then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a timeshare they don't need, they don't want, and they can't afford.
[01:20:19.324 --> 01:20:20.824]  And then they're stuck with that thing forever.
[01:20:20.824 --> 01:20:24.885]  Monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual fees that keep going up and up.
[01:20:24.885 --> 01:20:27.966]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things.
[01:20:27.966 --> 01:20:31.286]  You know, you can't get out of the contract, you can't get out of the deed or the membership.
[01:20:31.286 --> 01:20:32.647]  Well, that's not true.
[01:20:32.647 --> 01:20:38.268]  My friends at American Consumer Credit, a timeshare release company, can get you free.
[01:20:38.268 --> 01:20:40.348]  That's their personal guarantee.

[01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:31.619]  The final phase of extermination is set to commence now.
[01:21:31.619 --> 01:21:37.123]  And as population die-off becomes evident, you know it is the time of punishment in all that is written.
[01:21:37.123 --> 01:21:43.327]  The cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming fraud, also used as false proof of their Christ.
[01:21:43.327 --> 01:21:46.970]  They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:51.833]  Now they claim to be his Christ, based upon blood type, DNA, and long lifespan.

[01:22:08.885 --> 01:22:14.129]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer
[01:22:14.369 --> 01:22:17.271]  No more than 18% utilization of protein.
[01:22:17.271 --> 01:22:20.373]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[01:22:20.373 --> 01:22:25.797]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.

[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:37.005]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years, I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[01:22:37.005 --> 01:22:40.828]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[01:22:40.828 --> 01:22:47.113]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[01:22:47.113 --> 01:22:50.235]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.

[01:22:59.582 --> 01:23:01.043]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:23:01.043 --> 01:23:03.784]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:23:03.784 --> 01:23:06.545]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[01:23:06.545 --> 01:23:08.706]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.

[01:23:29.297 --> 01:23:30.198]  Frequently in pain?
[01:23:30.198 --> 01:23:30.938]  Over-stressed?

[01:23:31.578 --> 01:23:37.342]  The solution is to oxygenate your cells because disease cannot survive in an oxygen-rich environment.

[01:24:03.695 --> 01:24:17.106]  I was back in the break room getting a glass of iced tea during the break and DirecTV
[01:24:18.871 --> 01:24:21.533]  We have cable and DirecTV, and I think DISH.
[01:24:21.533 --> 01:24:23.675]  We have a lot of different communications here.
[01:24:23.675 --> 01:24:29.960]  Bunch of different internet services, wireless links, you name it, to try to be redundant when power goes out.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.042]  We have generators, you name it.
[01:24:32.042 --> 01:24:42.831]  I mean, this is a defensive resistance operation set up basically around military doctrines of resistance during an occupation.
[01:24:42.831 --> 01:24:45.112]  And I've read the national emergency documents.
[01:24:45.112 --> 01:24:46.614]  We've been under martial law.
[01:24:48.266 --> 01:24:54.549]  Since 1933 with the War Powers Act and Franklin Roosevelt, but they've been slowly expanding them.
[01:24:54.549 --> 01:25:06.515]  And now under the different executive orders and civil emergencies that Larry Nichols talks about, that we've written articles about, they say we have, quote, re-education camps prepared for the Tea Party.
[01:25:06.515 --> 01:25:08.476]  I mean, that's in Army manuals.
[01:25:08.476 --> 01:25:11.478]  Why do you think military people are going public?
[01:25:11.478 --> 01:25:15.460]  Like Tim Kennedy about America's in trouble, we're not going to confiscate guns.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.061]  Because they got the military training for it.
[01:25:18.544 --> 01:25:30.696]  And just during the break, they had an EAS alert, and then I walked out and walked by and looked at cable TV, and it was on one of the channels there as well that was cable.
[01:25:30.696 --> 01:25:32.297]  I mean, they're practicing taking over.
[01:25:32.297 --> 01:25:34.099]  They've got the internet kill switch in place.
[01:25:34.099 --> 01:25:37.082]  I'm going to go ahead and have Larry Nichols with us until 50 after.
[01:25:37.082 --> 01:25:37.963]  This is a short segment.
[01:25:39.107 --> 01:25:43.550]  But it just hit me, we're under martial law when they have parties appointing candidates.
[01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:54.736]  I mean, they've had that on the books since 76, Democrats since 72, but the boldness of it, and the boldness of, don't use the word mother or father, and you use the wrong word, we're going to arrest you.
[01:25:54.736 --> 01:25:56.617]  And Europe's doing it.
[01:25:56.617 --> 01:26:01.780]  They've arrested the frontrunner, Marie Le Pen, who's a milquetoast conservative.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.343]  People didn't recognize Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia in the middle of it until later.
[01:26:07.343 --> 01:26:12.526]  We are entering sick stuff, and rolling over to it, folks, is not the answer.
[01:26:12.526 --> 01:26:15.048]  I want to talk about solutions and how to counter this in the next segment.
[01:26:15.048 --> 01:26:17.089]  We've got about three or four minutes left, Larry.
[01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:21.452]  You know, you were involved in all sorts of regime change in Latin America, black ops, and you can't get into it.
[01:26:21.452 --> 01:26:22.613]  It's classified.
[01:26:22.613 --> 01:26:27.316]  But that's why they hired you for dirty tricks, obviously, you know, with the Clintons and the Dixie Mob.
[01:26:27.316 --> 01:26:28.197]  It's all the same group.
[01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:32.030]  But you're a guy that's reformed, woke up to it, and said, I'm not killing kids.
[01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:34.473]  That's the backstory, folks, that just tuned in.
[01:26:34.473 --> 01:26:37.938]  You know, you found your soul again, as you said, and hit your knees, and that's great.
[01:26:38.974 --> 01:26:42.156]  But a lot of folks in government are doing that too right now.
[01:26:42.156 --> 01:26:44.478]  But the system's just moving forward.
[01:26:44.478 --> 01:26:46.279]  You talk about the Strong Cities U.N.
[01:26:46.279 --> 01:26:46.979]  initiative.
[01:26:46.979 --> 01:26:49.001]  That was in my local paper that the U.N.'
[01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:50.942]  's going to tell my government how to work.
[01:26:50.942 --> 01:26:55.965]  I mean, I'm living under world government now, and the average yuppie has no idea what they're living under.
[01:26:55.965 --> 01:26:57.626]  What's coming next, Larry?
[01:26:57.626 --> 01:26:59.668]  And everything you just heard me say.
[01:26:59.668 --> 01:27:00.688]  Is that wrong or is that right?
[01:27:00.688 --> 01:27:02.450]  No, that's all right.
[01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:03.530]  Excuse the dog.
[01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:05.031]  Somebody's walking by.
[01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:05.952]  But let me say this.
[01:27:07.868 --> 01:27:13.052]  Executive Order 13391, I know you've reported on it.
[01:27:13.052 --> 01:27:18.517]  It is the National Patriots Defense of Liberty Enabler Act.
[01:27:18.517 --> 01:27:27.744]  That thing calls, Alex, that thing calls for federal territories to fall, all federal territories to fall under Agenda 21.
[01:27:27.744 --> 01:27:29.946]  Number one.
[01:27:29.946 --> 01:27:31.627]  But here's the kicker.
[01:27:31.627 --> 01:27:35.951]  It also facilitates the President to bring in
[01:27:37.599 --> 01:27:41.463]  UN troops to this country.
[01:27:41.463 --> 01:27:46.088]  Now guys, if you don't think we're close, remember what I told you Alex about Cuba?
[01:27:46.088 --> 01:27:47.270]  It says it officially.
[01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:48.831]  It's been in the Washington Post.
[01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:52.996]  You said six months ago they were going to use Cuban troops as part of the invasion forces.
[01:27:52.996 --> 01:27:55.138]  They can mix in and speak Spanish.
[01:27:55.138 --> 01:27:58.162]  I mean, if it was Chinese troops or Russian, folks would fight.
[01:27:59.594 --> 01:28:02.276]  Listen, it is six hours.
[01:28:02.276 --> 01:28:08.601]  They can have 250,000 black cat troops in this country.
[01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:09.401]  I have fought them.
[01:28:09.401 --> 01:28:11.263]  They're formidable.
[01:28:11.263 --> 01:28:12.464]  They are.
[01:28:12.464 --> 01:28:15.886]  Now, add to that, that executive order.
[01:28:15.886 --> 01:28:16.807]  Where did it come from?
[01:28:16.807 --> 01:28:17.708]  Where did it come from?
[01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:20.390]  Alex, out of the blue, why would he do that?
[01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:24.993]  Then, Obama normalizes his relationship with Cuba.
[01:28:24.993 --> 01:28:26.054]  But here's the kicker.
[01:28:26.054 --> 01:28:27.115]  Why did he go to Cuba?
[01:28:27.668 --> 01:28:29.510]  I mean, go down there to watch the ball game?
[01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.292]  Uh-uh.
[01:28:31.292 --> 01:28:41.402]  You see, there are plans that have to be made, I believe, towards the facilitation of bringing those troops into this country that he can't make out of the White House.
[01:28:41.402 --> 01:28:43.684]  And I tell you, the left wouldn't worship that.
[01:28:43.684 --> 01:28:48.810]  They would love to see foreign troops kicking conservatives and veterans' guts out in the street.
[01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:50.852]  They just lust for our blood.
[01:28:52.552 --> 01:28:55.013]  I'm telling you, he's over there right now.
[01:28:55.013 --> 01:28:55.793]  I believe.
[01:28:55.793 --> 01:28:59.014]  I can't prove this in a court of law, but soon I will be able to.
[01:28:59.014 --> 01:29:01.415]  Castro looked like he was having an orgasm.
[01:29:01.415 --> 01:29:04.856]  The communists look like heaven has happened when he's over there.
[01:29:04.856 --> 01:29:11.318]  Yeah, and I'm telling you, they're working out the fine details of this operation.
[01:29:11.318 --> 01:29:11.478]  Now,
[01:29:12.344 --> 01:29:14.626]  We got to do what you were saying, Alex.
[01:29:14.626 --> 01:29:16.188]  We can't just talk about these things.
[01:29:16.188 --> 01:29:17.168]  We got to stop them.
[01:29:17.168 --> 01:29:18.209]  Stop them.
[01:29:18.209 --> 01:29:20.632]  There is a way to stop that executive order.
[01:29:20.632 --> 01:29:22.253]  The solution is... Stay there.
[01:29:22.253 --> 01:29:23.754]  Let's talk about it in a long segment.
[01:29:23.754 --> 01:29:27.638]  Stay there and how to get Trump informed of what's happening and where this is all going.
[01:29:27.638 --> 01:29:28.639]  Larry Nichols.
[01:29:28.639 --> 01:29:29.720]  And of course, you say Trump may...
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:35.002]  Be informed and stop them, but you're also saying Obama may double-cross Hillary.
[01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:37.064]  So let's talk about the different scenarios.
[01:29:37.064 --> 01:29:37.584]  Are there three?
[01:29:37.584 --> 01:29:38.124]  Are there four?
[01:29:38.124 --> 01:29:39.165]  Are there five?
[01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:42.207]  With the Consummate Insider, Larry Nichols, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:42.207 --> 01:29:46.950]  And make no mistake, the Republic has never been in greater danger.
[01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.011]  This is really happening.
[01:29:48.011 --> 01:29:49.331]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.331 --> 01:29:51.853]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:54.535]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.783 --> 01:30:08.430]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam, and that is the special relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:15.516]  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an interview with CNN.
[01:30:15.976 --> 01:30:26.065]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity, the way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there, and you target the gang members to get them off the streets.
[01:30:26.065 --> 01:30:30.950]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:33.812]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue.
[01:30:33.812 --> 01:30:40.639]  That is the creation, promotion, and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia and the United States.
[01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:55.046]  As a political opportunist, supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR, and the establishment, Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, omissions, and misrepresentations of the truth.

[01:30:59.944 --> 01:31:03.728]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:31:03.728 --> 01:31:11.455]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:31:11.455 --> 01:31:20.084]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:31:20.084 --> 01:31:24.128]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:31:24.488 --> 01:31:34.314]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:31:34.314 --> 01:31:37.736]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:31:37.736 --> 01:31:48.762]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:31:48.882 --> 01:31:51.747]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[01:31:51.747 --> 01:31:54.852]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[01:31:54.852 --> 01:31:57.756]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:59.231]  Uh, yeah.
[01:31:59.231 --> 01:32:05.055]  First of all, I want to say, Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[01:32:05.055 --> 01:32:06.015]  I use them all.
[01:32:06.015 --> 01:32:06.996]  They're phenomenal.
[01:32:06.996 --> 01:32:07.757]  They work.
[01:32:07.757 --> 01:32:08.577]  Buy them, folks.
[01:32:08.577 --> 01:32:09.078]  Thank you, brother.
[01:32:09.078 --> 01:32:11.299]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:32:11.299 --> 01:32:17.183]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:32:17.183 --> 01:32:19.205]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[01:32:19.205 --> 01:32:24.609]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:32:25.029 --> 01:32:25.770]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:29.554]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, DocuFX, uh, nascent iodine.
[01:32:29.554 --> 01:32:30.455]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:32:30.455 --> 01:32:31.496]  Have they worked for you?
[01:32:31.496 --> 01:32:34.359]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:32:34.359 --> 01:32:35.720]  What products are you taking?
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:43.728]  Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[01:32:43.728 --> 01:32:47.152]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[01:32:47.352 --> 01:32:52.397]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:32:52.397 --> 01:32:54.418]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:08.869 --> 01:33:13.230]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:13.230 --> 01:33:15.731]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.198 --> 01:33:38.520]  Things are geopolitically so dangerous.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:46.407]  There's so much open, classical, authoritarian, totalitarian behavior going on.
[01:33:46.407 --> 01:33:51.412]  The preparations are staggering.
[01:33:51.412 --> 01:33:52.253]  All over the U.S.
[01:33:52.253 --> 01:34:00.741]  they're spending billions to put cable highway dividers out in the most rural areas, so you can't turn around and jump on the other side of the highway.
[01:34:02.168 --> 01:34:09.556]  America is having extra highway dividers placed at key positions to lock down and cordon cities.
[01:34:09.556 --> 01:34:17.204]  And the only people that are awake are the military because they're being trained to do it and they are freaking out.
[01:34:17.204 --> 01:34:19.466]  And they're tuning into this show.
[01:34:19.466 --> 01:34:21.348]  I don't really know how valuable that is.
[01:34:21.348 --> 01:34:24.612]  I think it's valuable, but they don't know what to do because the public
[01:34:26.081 --> 01:34:35.111]  Only cares about Beyonce, who's saying let's have race riots at the Super Bowl, which is financed by the government again.
[01:34:35.111 --> 01:34:40.316]  All run by the system to bring the country down.
[01:34:40.316 --> 01:34:41.458]  I don't know how grave it is.
[01:34:41.458 --> 01:34:44.441]  I don't know this is a beta test for five or ten years down the road, but...
[01:34:46.488 --> 01:34:50.509]  No spy novel, no movie could come close.
[01:34:50.509 --> 01:35:04.413]  I mean, nothing I've seen in 25 years of being politically involved, 21 years on air, comes close to the confluence, the perfect storm, the lining up of the constellations on this.
[01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:13.076]  I've gone the last year from having a bad feeling in my spider sense being off the chart to now just, just, it's just, you're in it.
[01:35:13.076 --> 01:35:14.777]  I'm not even really nervous anymore.
[01:35:14.777 --> 01:35:15.677]  I'm just like, wow.
[01:35:16.650 --> 01:35:20.835]  What's coming next?
[01:35:20.835 --> 01:35:21.676]  It's crazy.
[01:35:21.676 --> 01:35:25.440]  We're going to go back to Larry Nichols here in a moment.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.825]  Also, they make a big joke out about this almost weekly on national news.
[01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:35.010]  And I want to show some of these articles soon and do a commercial showing it going with a laugh track.
[01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:40.366]  Look at the Washington Post saying Alex Jones is crazy, or look at this publication.
[01:35:40.366 --> 01:35:42.907]  He claims there's, you know, dangerous things in the water.
[01:35:42.907 --> 01:35:47.149]  And then I'll just cut to Glyphosate is in all water supply in the U.S.
[01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:48.230]  linked to massive cancer.
[01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:53.492]  Or, you know, even EPA and FDA say take fluoride out of the water, it's causing cancer.
[01:35:53.492 --> 01:35:56.033]  And then have a laugh track, you know, showing Reuters.
[01:35:56.033 --> 01:36:02.136]  And then I cut to super high quality, gravity-fed filters that reduce or completely remove over 300 pathogens.
[01:36:04.170 --> 01:36:10.933]  When I say reduce, like 99.9% of the studies, the third-party tests, are all up on InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:36:10.933 --> 01:36:12.814]  It's how we fund our operation.
[01:36:12.814 --> 01:36:13.635]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:36:13.635 --> 01:36:15.216]  It's 10% off promo code WATER.
[01:36:15.216 --> 01:36:19.078]  It's the vetted, tested, best filters that don't just take out bad taste.
[01:36:19.078 --> 01:36:24.000]  Maybe you don't care about yourself, you got this bulletproof attitude like most men do, that, ah, whatever, I can do whatever I want.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.381]  What about your kids?
[01:36:26.381 --> 01:36:30.263]  Our water, just look at what's happening up in, you know, Michigan and places in Flint.
[01:36:30.263 --> 01:36:30.944]  That's nothing.
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:32.903]  It runs the gamut.
[01:36:32.903 --> 01:36:34.448]  It is a nightmare scenario.
[01:36:34.448 --> 01:36:39.423]  They take healthy water, good clean aquifer water, and dump tons of poison in it right here in Austin.
[01:36:40.658 --> 01:36:41.778]  You need these filters.
[01:36:41.778 --> 01:36:44.239]  Shower filters, water filters, all of it.
[01:36:44.239 --> 01:36:49.801]  You need these and we've got all sorts of survival straws and life straws and other great systems.
[01:36:49.801 --> 01:36:51.161]  The very best systems.
[01:36:51.161 --> 01:36:52.382]  The whole wide selection.
[01:36:52.382 --> 01:37:02.185]  Bigger than you'll find at a huge department store or even a survival store at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:02.185 --> 01:37:05.246]  I sell things you need that fund our operation.
[01:37:05.246 --> 01:37:07.386]  It's extremely expensive to run.
[01:37:07.386 --> 01:37:08.087]  I'm not complaining.
[01:37:08.087 --> 01:37:08.587]  It's a mission.
[01:37:08.587 --> 01:37:09.147]  I'm very happy.
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:20.756]  But take advantage of the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com, the AnthroPlex back in stock, the Super Mel Vitality, the Brain Force, the X2 Nascent Iodine, and the dozens of other great products.
[01:37:20.756 --> 01:37:21.637]  The game changers.
[01:37:21.637 --> 01:37:25.202]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:37:26.894 --> 01:37:30.937]  20% off the liver shield deep cleanse and oxy powder for the six day deep cleanse.
[01:37:30.937 --> 01:37:32.318]  That's back in.
[01:37:32.318 --> 01:37:39.083]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com and a lot of specials running right now that will end next week.
[01:37:39.083 --> 01:37:41.264]  Again, some of the other specials just ended yesterday.
[01:37:41.264 --> 01:37:53.513]  I want to thank you all that took advantage of those because the whole establishment marvels in Infowars that we're able to be on 180 plus AM and FM stations, dozens of UHF, VHF cable stations and growing.
[01:37:54.153 --> 01:37:56.814]  Tens of millions of internet viewers and listeners every week.
[01:37:56.814 --> 01:37:59.675]  26 to 28 million per week, globally.
[01:37:59.675 --> 01:38:01.556]  About 15 million domestically.
[01:38:01.556 --> 01:38:09.659]  But the real power is you taking the videos, the articles, the information, what we put out, and sending it to everybody you know.
[01:38:09.659 --> 01:38:13.500]  That's the real solution, as I'm sure Larry Nichols will tell you.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:18.922]  Before he leaves us at the end of the hour, I also want to encourage you to check out what he's doing.
[01:38:20.122 --> 01:38:23.525]  And if you appreciate the work he's doing, support him as he is battling lung cancer.
[01:38:23.525 --> 01:38:24.766]  He doesn't like to talk about it.
[01:38:24.766 --> 01:38:26.568]  He was in the hospital last week, couldn't come on.
[01:38:26.568 --> 01:38:29.130]  And he's had a tracheotomy the whole nine yards.
[01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:33.353]  He's fighting for his life and lost pretty much everything he has fighting the establishment.
[01:38:33.353 --> 01:38:36.276]  And he's a great asset with his intel.
[01:38:36.276 --> 01:38:39.919]  And so with his medical bills and things, we're going to put up on screen for TV viewers in a little while.
[01:38:39.919 --> 01:38:44.643]  And also at the end, give it out verbally, his PayPal for folks that want to be able to visit that.
[01:38:44.643 --> 01:38:45.844]  So get a pen and paper ready.
[01:38:46.384 --> 01:38:52.289]  Going back to you Larry Nichols, I also want to open the phones up for a couple callers specifically for Larry Nichols and their quick questions 800-259-9231 800-259-9231.
[01:38:52.289 --> 01:38:53.630]  The system's running around wild.
[01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:05.411]  Just, just, just, just engaging in bizarre behavior.
[01:39:05.411 --> 01:39:06.772]  There's three different options.
[01:39:06.772 --> 01:39:10.615]  What Obama tries to stay, Hillary gets in, or Trump.
[01:39:10.615 --> 01:39:11.995]  What are the other options?
[01:39:11.995 --> 01:39:13.596]  Where do you see it all going?
[01:39:13.596 --> 01:39:23.503]  What do you expect to happen with the Soros folks trying to cause a quote racial slash class warfare 1917 Bolshevik deal?
[01:39:23.503 --> 01:39:24.703]  What are the different ingredients?
[01:39:24.703 --> 01:39:26.745]  What are the different areas of the perfect storm?
[01:39:26.745 --> 01:39:28.526]  Where do you see it going and how do we try to counter it?
[01:39:28.988 --> 01:39:30.950]  Alright Alex, there's no doubt.
[01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:34.953]  You've got two major events being facilitated right now.
[01:39:34.953 --> 01:39:40.098]  Number one is to create a centralized government power elite.
[01:39:40.098 --> 01:39:40.838]  That's Hillary.
[01:39:40.838 --> 01:39:42.460]  That's Hillary and Bill.
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:44.362]  That's their agenda.
[01:39:44.362 --> 01:39:47.644]  Complacent with that are the Republicans.
[01:39:47.644 --> 01:39:48.245]  The Republicans.
[01:39:49.093 --> 01:40:02.581]  You see, if Hillary takes over and she becomes king, and I say king versus queen, if she becomes king, all members of Congress get to be dukes and earls, like in the 1600s European models.
[01:40:02.581 --> 01:40:04.762]  So they get to be power players.
[01:40:04.762 --> 01:40:07.383]  Now, yeah, they're big fish in smaller ponds, but they're still big fish.
[01:40:07.383 --> 01:40:14.187]  And they'll leave after 20 years and their son or daughter, just like Raoul, or just like Kim Jong-un, will become the new viceroy.
[01:40:14.187 --> 01:40:16.469]  There's option one.
[01:40:16.469 --> 01:40:17.109]  Option two.
[01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:24.672]  Obama is trying to turn us into an Islamic caliphate.
[01:40:24.672 --> 01:40:26.132]  This country.
[01:40:26.132 --> 01:40:33.054]  And if he can do that, then he becomes, and will become, the global leader of Islam globally.
[01:40:33.054 --> 01:40:37.255]  Now, everything you've said has been total inside baseball and has basically come true.
[01:40:37.255 --> 01:40:39.416]  Is that from your high-level sources or your own analysis?
[01:40:39.416 --> 01:40:40.596]  You bet!
[01:40:40.596 --> 01:40:42.457]  No, it's not from analysis.
[01:40:42.457 --> 01:40:44.798]  Not on something like this.
[01:40:44.798 --> 01:40:45.858]  Number one, you just can't
[01:40:46.553 --> 01:40:48.654]  Hell, I couldn't even imagine this stuff.
[01:40:48.654 --> 01:40:54.798]  So tell me how high level, because I mean, I know some famous national people that, you know, say you were back at the beginning of the whole thing trying to take down Clinton.
[01:40:54.798 --> 01:40:58.100]  I mean, I know you've been there, have a lot of big contacts, you name it.
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:03.863]  How high level and specifically what are they saying about his plan to create a caliphate?
[01:41:03.863 --> 01:41:13.949]  Well, it's some of the former top generals in the military who were riffed out because they were not going to go along with the sinister plan.
[01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:21.094]  Then I have two ambassadors that were involved, believe it or not, with the plan.
[01:41:21.094 --> 01:41:25.155]  And then when they found out the trueness of it, they didn't think it was real.
[01:41:25.155 --> 01:41:26.676]  They didn't think it was coming.
[01:41:26.676 --> 01:41:28.117]  They called me.
[01:41:28.117 --> 01:41:33.699]  And then, as you know, I've got a person, must just say, on the Supreme Court.
[01:41:33.699 --> 01:41:36.580]  So I have pretty good deep inside information.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:40.522]  And about stuff like this, you would never want to speculate.
[01:41:40.522 --> 01:41:43.483]  And that's why I can tell you these things and you see them.
[01:41:43.483 --> 01:41:43.844]  Look at
[01:41:46.084 --> 01:41:46.884]  Look at him now.
[01:41:46.884 --> 01:41:47.745]  He's in Cuba.
[01:41:47.745 --> 01:41:49.246]  For what?
[01:41:49.246 --> 01:41:50.887]  For what?
[01:41:50.887 --> 01:41:52.007]  To watch a ball game?
[01:41:52.007 --> 01:41:53.808]  No.
[01:41:53.808 --> 01:41:58.310]  Why would you, out of the blue, normalize relations with Cuba?
[01:41:58.310 --> 01:42:01.112]  What did we get out of it?
[01:42:01.112 --> 01:42:02.573]  That's what people gotta ask.
[01:42:02.573 --> 01:42:05.794]  What did we get out of normalizing relationships with Cuba?
[01:42:05.794 --> 01:42:06.395]  They get a lot.
[01:42:06.395 --> 01:42:08.856]  We don't get anything.
[01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:13.458]  Look, these two options are on the table.
[01:42:13.458 --> 01:42:14.499]  The third option,
[01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:18.217]  He's the one we got to fight for.
[01:42:18.217 --> 01:42:20.138]  And that's Donald Trump.
[01:42:20.138 --> 01:42:22.079]  I'm sorry, I'm not trying to make Donald Trump.
[01:42:22.079 --> 01:42:22.619]  No, I hear you.
[01:42:22.619 --> 01:42:25.640]  He's not perfect, but listen, there's a reason they're pulling their hair out.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.580]  That is not an act.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.801]  They are having a conniption fit.
[01:42:27.801 --> 01:42:29.401]  Why?
[01:42:29.401 --> 01:42:32.122]  Well, because Donald Trump, they can't trust.
[01:42:32.122 --> 01:42:35.944]  You see, when you go to Washington, you've got to be pliable.
[01:42:36.809 --> 01:42:37.749]  Pliable.
[01:42:37.749 --> 01:42:45.792]  Now, everybody in Washington, that is probably per capita, you know this Alex, per capita, that's the filthiest group of people.
[01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:55.355]  Pedophiles, drug addicts, drunkards, you could not put that many people in one place if you tried, but that's where they are.
[01:42:55.355 --> 01:43:03.257]  So they don't have dirt on him, he's not ashamed of having girlfriends when he's divorced, he doesn't care, he's never stepped and fetched, he hasn't taken orders.
[01:43:03.917 --> 01:43:06.878]  He hadn't taken orders and more importantly, hadn't taken money.
[01:43:06.878 --> 01:43:11.379]  He hadn't taken money from the big power players.
[01:43:11.379 --> 01:43:12.480]  So that's Donald Trump.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:14.880]  That's why he may be the best.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.941]  Well, he is the best shot we got.
[01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:17.781]  Is he perfect?
[01:43:17.781 --> 01:43:18.742]  Is it absolute?
[01:43:18.742 --> 01:43:19.362]  I don't know.
[01:43:19.362 --> 01:43:21.563]  Won't know until he gets there.
[01:43:21.563 --> 01:43:24.503]  But then that brings us to what we got to do.
[01:43:24.503 --> 01:43:29.465]  Now, folks, if you want to shut down an executive order, let me tell you a secret.
[01:43:30.496 --> 01:43:36.601]  Congress has 30 days on any executive orders to rescind it.
[01:43:36.601 --> 01:43:42.865]  If Congress does not rescind that executive order in 30 days, Alex, it becomes a law.
[01:43:42.865 --> 01:43:46.448]  Just like if it went through the legal process, the House, the Senate, vote, and President.
[01:43:46.448 --> 01:43:47.729]  Same thing with signing statements.
[01:43:47.729 --> 01:43:50.231]  If they don't override that, it becomes a law.
[01:43:50.231 --> 01:43:50.911]  That's right.
[01:43:50.911 --> 01:43:52.172]  Now, we got 30 days.
[01:43:52.172 --> 01:43:54.074]  We're out of those 30 days.
[01:43:54.074 --> 01:43:59.598]  What I'd like to provide, Alex, is give it to you, probably tomorrow, and get you to put it up.
[01:44:00.282 --> 01:44:01.463]  A script.
[01:44:01.463 --> 01:44:05.405]  I'm going to tell people exactly who to call.
[01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:07.066]  What congressmen and senators.
[01:44:07.066 --> 01:44:09.207]  This is the time we got the most power.
[01:44:09.207 --> 01:44:10.748]  Alex, they're scared to death.
[01:44:10.748 --> 01:44:11.949]  They want their job.
[01:44:11.949 --> 01:44:13.570]  They don't care about us.
[01:44:13.570 --> 01:44:14.971]  They want to keep their job.
[01:44:14.971 --> 01:44:19.254]  Especially with the impending doom of the country as we know it.
[01:44:19.254 --> 01:44:20.594]  They want their job.
[01:44:20.594 --> 01:44:21.715]  So we have power now.
[01:44:21.715 --> 01:44:22.095]  That's right.
[01:44:22.095 --> 01:44:26.318]  They want their power to try to protect themselves during the takeover.
[01:44:26.318 --> 01:44:26.858]  That's it.
[01:44:26.858 --> 01:44:29.700]  So we're going to have got a script that I want to provide to you.
[01:44:30.592 --> 01:44:35.075]  And to all of you in the audience, I suggest you take that script.
[01:44:35.075 --> 01:44:37.477]  And with it will be who you call.
[01:44:37.477 --> 01:44:40.018]  And it tells you exactly what to say.
[01:44:40.018 --> 01:44:42.980]  Say those words exactly.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:49.725]  Don't, you know, don't expand, don't... Well, I mean, certainly you can write the script, but, you know, the basic call to action, but basically what is it?
[01:44:49.725 --> 01:44:52.567]  Just say, look... Basically, it's just right here.
[01:44:52.567 --> 01:44:57.069]  You know, hello, I'm, you know, I'm calling to say this.
[01:44:57.069 --> 01:44:59.311]  Mr. Congressman, or for the Congressman,
[01:45:00.177 --> 01:45:15.982]  There is an Executive Order 13391 which calls for all federal territories to fall under Agenda 21 and for the bringing in UN troops.
[01:45:15.982 --> 01:45:23.885]  So tell the Congressman that if he doesn't rescind that before the time expires,
[01:45:24.608 --> 01:45:30.470]  I will do everything in my power, everything my family can do, all of my friends.
[01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:35.071]  We will see to it that you never get elected to office again.
[01:45:35.071 --> 01:45:39.953]  Now, I'm telling you, we did it, as you'll recall.
[01:45:39.953 --> 01:45:43.514]  Remember, Alex, we did this same trick against that Dubai Ports deal.
[01:45:43.514 --> 01:45:47.155]  We called in, had them read a script, and guess what?
[01:45:47.155 --> 01:45:47.755]  Shut it down.
[01:45:48.675 --> 01:45:49.496]  Shut it down.
[01:45:49.496 --> 01:45:50.517]  We can shut this down.
[01:45:50.517 --> 01:45:53.719]  Sure, they shot on June 21 in the 90s and again in the 2000s.
[01:45:53.719 --> 01:45:54.820]  Now they're bringing in Bastille.
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:56.101]  That's right.
[01:45:56.101 --> 01:45:56.822]  I want to bring this up.
[01:45:56.822 --> 01:46:09.632]  A lot of experts thought that Clinton coming out and saying the disaster of the last eight years, the disastrous legacy, was a shot at Obama because he's getting where they're going to try to double cross Hillary and their return to full power.
[01:46:09.632 --> 01:46:11.493]  Let's play that clip and get your take on it.
[01:46:11.493 --> 01:46:13.835]  Here it is from two days ago.
[01:46:13.835 --> 01:46:16.698]  There may be many reasons that you all support
[01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:22.292]  Well, first off, Hillary was a big part of that legacy.
[01:46:22.292 --> 01:46:27.014]  Obama was one of their creations, though.
[01:46:27.014 --> 01:46:28.935]  They've been fighting, obviously.
[01:46:28.935 --> 01:46:31.276]  What is that statement?
[01:46:31.276 --> 01:46:32.196]  I mean, what does that mean?
[01:46:47.754 --> 01:46:49.054]  That is what Bill knows.
[01:46:49.054 --> 01:46:51.075]  Bill is the consummate politician.
[01:46:51.075 --> 01:46:52.775]  I know him because I helped train him.
[01:46:52.775 --> 01:46:54.916]  What he is doing is he's cutting.
[01:46:54.916 --> 01:46:56.916]  He knows the problem Hillary has.
[01:46:56.916 --> 01:47:00.837]  She has to cut away Alex from Obama.
[01:47:00.837 --> 01:47:01.978]  She's got to.
[01:47:01.978 --> 01:47:09.559]  Now, to keep her from being put in a situation where if she actually said something like that, there wouldn't be somebody jump her and say, what are you talking about?
[01:47:09.559 --> 01:47:11.040]  You were a part of it.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:11.820]  Bill said it.
[01:47:12.876 --> 01:47:14.437]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:47:14.437 --> 01:47:19.260]  They're building this divide between them and Obama.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:39.993]  And remember, while you and I are talking right now, Bill Clinton and Hillary and their minions are calling congressmen and senators left and right and saying, if you don't, if you go along with Obama in declaring a national crisis, state of crisis, we will destroy you.
[01:47:41.052 --> 01:47:41.692]  That's what they're doing.
[01:47:41.692 --> 01:47:43.174]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:47:43.174 --> 01:47:45.255]  Is Soros playing both the Clintons and the Obamas?
[01:47:45.255 --> 01:47:46.576]  We know he's funding both.
[01:47:46.576 --> 01:47:48.678]  Even a little bit to Sanders.
[01:47:48.678 --> 01:47:50.719]  Who is he, from your intel, fully behind?
[01:47:50.719 --> 01:47:53.461]  Because he's trying to start a civil emergency right now.
[01:47:53.461 --> 01:47:55.943]  That would mean he's working for Obama.
[01:47:55.943 --> 01:47:59.165]  He is, Soros is out for Soros, George Soros.
[01:47:59.165 --> 01:48:01.747]  Because I've asked that same question to people everywhere.
[01:48:01.747 --> 01:48:02.528]  It doesn't make sense.
[01:48:02.528 --> 01:48:03.429]  He's working with Hillary.
[01:48:03.429 --> 01:48:06.891]  He's working with, oh, jeez, he's working with the Republicans.
[01:48:06.891 --> 01:48:07.271]  He wants
[01:48:08.997 --> 01:48:13.643]  America to become a communist nation.
[01:48:13.643 --> 01:48:14.784]  He ain't in.
[01:48:14.784 --> 01:48:17.247]  He doesn't want to want it to be an Islamic caliphate.
[01:48:17.247 --> 01:48:18.509]  I can tell you that.
[01:48:18.509 --> 01:48:22.514]  But he believes in the consolidation of power.
[01:48:22.514 --> 01:48:25.657]  He believes that he should own this country.
[01:48:25.657 --> 01:48:27.840]  He's believed that for many years.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.341]  You know that.
[01:48:28.541 --> 01:48:30.423]  Let's break down some of the other angles.
[01:48:30.423 --> 01:48:32.024]  Who are the major power broker elites?
[01:48:32.024 --> 01:48:38.069]  The Anglo-American old banks, the big oil companies, big pharma, the big central banks are obviously chief.
[01:48:38.069 --> 01:48:46.896]  They wanted kind of a Karel Quigley merger of socialism and fascism into a managed capitalist system with socialism and communism to control the public.
[01:48:46.896 --> 01:48:53.422]  But clearly Obama has double-crossed, or our elite has, and is trying to put Saudi Arabia and the worst jihadist in power
[01:48:54.102 --> 01:48:56.965]  Our elite would actually do this?
[01:48:56.965 --> 01:48:58.426]  What is their problem?
[01:48:58.426 --> 01:49:00.488]  Those people will saw their heads off in a minute.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:07.562]  Now let me tell you, the power players, the oil, the banks, those people, they're not with Obama.
[01:49:07.562 --> 01:49:10.483]  They're not with him on turning us into Islamic caliphate.
[01:49:10.483 --> 01:49:12.344]  They got enough sense against that.
[01:49:12.344 --> 01:49:13.004]  And what's their problem?
[01:49:13.004 --> 01:49:13.944]  They're afraid.
[01:49:13.944 --> 01:49:18.606]  Well, they're afraid to come out overtly against Obama because he'll destroy him, Alex.
[01:49:18.606 --> 01:49:19.866]  So they got double-crossed.
[01:49:19.866 --> 01:49:22.047]  They didn't... They got... Yeah.
[01:49:22.047 --> 01:49:23.347]  I mean, he'll destroy him.
[01:49:23.347 --> 01:49:26.908]  He can still... He's like a rattlesnake, Alex.
[01:49:26.908 --> 01:49:29.009]  He may be dead, but don't get near those fangs.
[01:49:31.321 --> 01:49:36.587]  They want what Bill Clinton told me about years, years, years ago.
[01:49:36.587 --> 01:49:38.229]  He said, you know what the perfect government is?
[01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.870]  Nickelodeon.
[01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:39.911]  So what?
[01:49:39.911 --> 01:49:46.899]  He said, where all you have are the number of people you could count on one hand.
[01:49:46.899 --> 01:49:49.341]  And they, they got everything.
[01:49:49.341 --> 01:49:50.002]  They're in power.
[01:49:50.002 --> 01:49:51.524]  Everybody else is dirt poor.
[01:49:52.865 --> 01:49:54.086]  I said, well why are you going to do that?
[01:49:54.086 --> 01:49:57.028]  Well, because you only have to answer to four or five people.
[01:49:57.028 --> 01:50:00.990]  Sure, Carol Quigley wrote an 1100 page book and admitted that is their master plan.
[01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:01.531]  That's right.
[01:50:01.531 --> 01:50:04.753]  Everybody else is so dirt poor you don't have time to worry about politics.
[01:50:04.753 --> 01:50:05.533]  That is the U.S.
[01:50:05.533 --> 01:50:10.377]  CIA globalist policy that was adopted in 1967 from Carol Quigley.
[01:50:10.377 --> 01:50:13.539]  They admitted certified planetary plan neo-feudalism.
[01:50:14.498 --> 01:50:18.080]  And, guess who wants to be in that group?
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:19.260]  That small handful.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:19.721]  Clinton.
[01:50:19.721 --> 01:50:20.781]  George Soros.
[01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:29.225]  So Soros wants... Oh yeah, well the Clinton... Soros wants to... Soros believes that it needs to be him and a couple or three of his buddies.
[01:50:29.225 --> 01:50:35.408]  Now, you have some of the other bankers and all those people that think they need to be in it.
[01:50:35.408 --> 01:50:38.289]  But they're never fighting a global government because they all think they're going to control it.
[01:50:38.289 --> 01:50:40.310]  They're going to control it.
[01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:42.191]  They're not going to fight this.
[01:50:42.191 --> 01:50:43.492]  They're going to fight us, Alex.
[01:50:44.446 --> 01:50:45.887]  We're the target.
[01:50:45.887 --> 01:50:47.949]  Dear God, we're the target.
[01:50:47.949 --> 01:50:48.589]  I know.
[01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:50.851]  Three people, independent, under their control.
[01:50:50.851 --> 01:50:53.793]  We're going to take two different sections of calls.
[01:50:53.793 --> 01:50:58.156]  Debbie Santos, Santino, Judy, and others.
[01:50:58.156 --> 01:50:58.656]  Stay with us.
[01:50:58.656 --> 01:50:59.077]  We'll be back.

[01:54:02.091 --> 01:54:05.312]  Adolf Hitler called it the will to power.
[01:54:05.312 --> 01:54:07.233]  Or the will to take power.
[01:54:07.233 --> 01:54:11.475]  And these rotten oligarchs are completely and totally amoral.
[01:54:27.406 --> 01:54:30.267]  Like on 60 Minutes, George Soros said, yeah, I rounded up thousands of Jews.
[01:54:30.267 --> 01:54:31.528]  I'm not ashamed of it.
[01:54:31.528 --> 01:54:32.488]  I did it to survive.
[01:54:32.488 --> 01:54:37.070]  And I talk to Democrats and they go, well, it's okay, Soros did that.
[01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:39.031]  He did it to survive.
[01:54:39.031 --> 01:54:41.052]  You're like saying, I'll kill my mother to survive.
[01:54:41.052 --> 01:54:44.814]  No, I won't.
[01:54:44.814 --> 01:54:49.156]  And you read the Bible, how the kings of the earth get together in 10 regions.
[01:54:50.356 --> 01:55:01.900]  Three mega-regions, ten sub-kings, and they combined forces to bring in a world government because they all want the power, and then finally one entity takes it all over and it's the devil.
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:06.921]  And I talk about that and mainstream media makes fun of me and says he believes the devil's controlling it.
[01:55:06.921 --> 01:55:08.302]  If it isn't the devil, what is it?
[01:55:08.302 --> 01:55:09.102]  It sure fits the bill.
[01:55:11.411 --> 01:55:13.433]  Larry Nichols is our guest for this segment and one more.
[01:55:13.433 --> 01:55:14.654]  Let's go to your phone, Cliff.
[01:55:14.654 --> 01:55:15.474]  Can you hear me?
[01:55:15.474 --> 01:55:16.795]  I've lost audio.
[01:55:16.795 --> 01:55:17.556]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:17.556 --> 01:55:19.477]  Your audio just came back in.
[01:55:19.477 --> 01:55:20.038]  Oh, okay.
[01:55:20.038 --> 01:55:21.059]  Can you hear me?
[01:55:21.059 --> 01:55:21.719]  Yes, I can.
[01:55:21.719 --> 01:55:22.360]  Yes, I can.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.220]  Okay, thank God.
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:24.581]  I've lost audio for some reason.
[01:55:24.581 --> 01:55:26.703]  Yeah, there's a little bit of duplexing going on.
[01:55:26.703 --> 01:55:27.864]  Let's put, in fact, I forgot.
[01:55:27.864 --> 01:55:28.584]  I did this during the break.
[01:55:28.584 --> 01:55:33.168]  Let's put your PayPal up for folks so people can try to support you and keep you alive as long as they can.
[01:55:33.348 --> 01:55:33.648]  Possibly.
[01:55:33.648 --> 01:55:34.369]  I know you're struggling.
[01:55:34.369 --> 01:55:39.932]  It's 58 Kingsington Drive, Conway, Arkansas 72034.
[01:55:39.932 --> 01:55:42.733]  PayPal is NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[01:55:42.733 --> 01:55:45.835]  NicholsLive at AOL.com.
[01:55:45.835 --> 01:55:47.035]  Okay, can you hear us now, Larry?
[01:55:47.035 --> 01:55:49.497]  I can hear you.
[01:55:49.497 --> 01:55:52.118]  Okay, good, because there was some clicking and buzzing going on.
[01:55:52.118 --> 01:55:54.199]  Let's go to a phone call here.
[01:55:54.199 --> 01:55:57.941]  Let's go ahead and talk to Maya in Kansas.
[01:55:57.941 --> 01:55:58.922]  You're on the air with Larry Nichols.
[01:55:58.922 --> 01:55:59.182]  Go ahead.
[01:56:00.205 --> 01:56:01.025]  Hi, thanks.
[01:56:01.025 --> 01:56:09.847]  You know, I'm really kind of concerned and I'd like to get some input on the relationship between Glenn Beck and Ted Cruz.
[01:56:09.847 --> 01:56:24.631]  Now, I'm a Christian and I was a part of the same kind of Christianity that Ted Cruz follows years and years ago until I found out what was going on.
[01:56:24.631 --> 01:56:28.392]  And it's all based around this whole Dominion
[01:56:29.005 --> 01:56:31.606]  He says you're going to hell if you don't vote for Cruz.
[01:56:31.606 --> 01:56:34.366]  So, I mean, what's your question about the Bush endorsement?
[01:56:34.366 --> 01:56:34.966]  Let me ask this.
[01:56:34.966 --> 01:56:37.447]  Who is Ted Cruz from your sources?
[01:56:37.447 --> 01:56:39.327]  What do you think about him?
[01:56:58.310 --> 01:57:02.513]  Alex, Ted Cruz is an absolute fraud.
[01:57:02.513 --> 01:57:04.414]  An absolute fraud.
[01:57:04.414 --> 01:57:06.836]  Donald Trump wasn't kidding when he called him a liar.
[01:57:06.836 --> 01:57:20.044]  You know, Ted Cruz came up through the Bush Organization, the oil money, his wife, Goldman Sachs, she's now on the committee for the Central American Union or whatever.
[01:57:20.956 --> 01:57:22.176]  He's a fraud now.
[01:57:22.176 --> 01:57:28.178]  What gets me about Beck, and Beck's going to mess up and lose his audience, I'm telling you, especially that last trick they did.
[01:57:28.178 --> 01:57:29.959]  He's already lost half his audience.
[01:57:29.959 --> 01:57:30.979]  He's killing himself.
[01:57:30.979 --> 01:57:43.503]  He's going to lose more, especially when Ian Romney did that part, which is a Mormonism thing, saying that Cruz is coming to ride in on a white horse, which means he's the Messiah.
[01:57:43.503 --> 01:57:44.804]  Guys, these are sick people.
[01:57:47.312 --> 01:57:51.417]  I know it's hard to believe because it looks like Ted Cruz fought Alex.
[01:57:51.417 --> 01:57:55.681]  It looks like he fought on the floor for the Tea Party and such like that.
[01:57:55.681 --> 01:57:57.603]  He did that to grow him a base.
[01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:59.985]  That's all it was about.
[01:57:59.985 --> 01:58:01.747]  He's, you know, different than the others.
[01:58:01.747 --> 01:58:03.168]  Now, I got... Well, I know this.
[01:58:03.168 --> 01:58:05.471]  Jeb Bush came out and endorsed him this morning.
[01:58:05.471 --> 01:58:06.452]  That doesn't look too good.
[01:58:07.245 --> 01:58:08.386]  Doesn't look good, does it?
[01:58:08.386 --> 01:58:13.032]  And it kind of makes you wonder if he's really that distance to the power players, huh?
[01:58:13.032 --> 01:58:18.198]  Well, the word I was always told in Texas is that he was Bush run, so we wouldn't even interview him.
[01:58:18.198 --> 01:58:18.918]  He won it on the show.
[01:58:18.918 --> 01:58:20.360]  We did a TV interview.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:24.345]  And then he did some good stuff in the Senate, so I reserve judgment.
[01:58:24.345 --> 01:58:26.307]  Well, don't reserve judgment anymore.
[01:58:27.154 --> 01:58:29.155]  Know who these people are, Alex.
[01:58:29.155 --> 01:58:31.135]  Well, there's no doubt about it, ma'am.
[01:58:31.135 --> 01:58:31.856]  That was a great question.
[01:58:31.856 --> 01:58:36.197]  We're going to come back and talk to Debbie, Judy, Santino, and others.
[01:58:36.197 --> 01:58:36.637]  Stay with us.
[01:58:36.637 --> 01:58:39.158]  Larry Nichols is our guest.
[01:58:39.158 --> 01:58:42.219]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.219 --> 01:58:46.381]  Then we got the Senate candidate beating John McCain coming up.
[01:58:48.482 --> 01:58:49.303]  Hey, everyone!
[01:58:49.303 --> 01:58:51.585]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:58:51.585 --> 01:58:55.428]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:57.510]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:58:57.510 --> 01:59:07.779]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:07.779 --> 01:59:13.764]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:14.224 --> 01:59:29.138]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:59:29.138 --> 01:59:30.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.101]  Big Brother.
[02:00:13.101 --> 02:00:14.922]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:14.922 --> 02:00:16.804]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:16.804 --> 02:00:18.505]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:18.505 --> 02:00:20.167]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:20.167 --> 02:00:24.651]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.894 --> 02:00:33.796]  Final segment with Larry Nichols, then the doctor, the Senate candidate in Arizona, beating in most polls.
[02:00:33.796 --> 02:00:36.176]  John McCain's joining us.
[02:00:36.176 --> 02:00:43.538]  Debbie in Minnesota, you're on the air with the consummate Clinton insider who's been exposing him for 22 years, Larry Nichols.
[02:00:43.538 --> 02:00:45.258]  Larry, let's talk to Debbie.
[02:00:45.258 --> 02:00:46.479]  Debbie?
[02:00:46.479 --> 02:00:47.759]  Hi there, Mr. Nichols.
[02:00:47.759 --> 02:00:48.479]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:48.479 --> 02:00:49.999]  I just had a question.
[02:00:49.999 --> 02:00:53.900]  I just got some information yesterday about Claire Lopez.
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.981]  She was a former CIA trainer.
[02:00:57.233 --> 02:01:01.798]  Like as security analyst, weapons of mass destruction specialist in the Middle East.
[02:01:01.798 --> 02:01:07.143]  I was just wondering if you're familiar with her because they said she's coming to our small town in Minnesota to
[02:01:07.734 --> 02:01:11.878]  Kind of worried about the Islamic attacks in the coming months, the global Islamic movement.
[02:01:11.878 --> 02:01:12.779]  Yeah, I'm not aware of it.
[02:01:12.779 --> 02:01:13.540]  Let me see if he is.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:14.121]  I'm moving quick.
[02:01:14.121 --> 02:01:16.063]  I apologize for the time.
[02:01:16.063 --> 02:01:16.864]  Not at all.
[02:01:16.864 --> 02:01:20.768]  Okay, what about 5 million Islamists coming in from radical areas?
[02:01:20.768 --> 02:01:21.569]  Over a million in the US.
[02:01:21.569 --> 02:01:24.892]  They're keeping the number artificially low, but it's much higher than they're saying.
[02:01:24.892 --> 02:01:26.174]  I'd say a million.
[02:01:26.174 --> 02:01:28.516]  Clearly, is this a sleeper cell plan?
[02:01:28.516 --> 02:01:29.217]  Use the crisis.
[02:01:30.439 --> 02:01:38.686]  Alex, they're coming in, and if you look at what the Obama people are telling these people when they come in, they're telling them not to assimilate.
[02:01:38.686 --> 02:01:46.813]  Obama's people are telling these Islamic people, don't assimilate into a society here.
[02:01:46.813 --> 02:01:50.496]  And he's setting it up to where they will keep their society.
[02:01:50.496 --> 02:01:54.640]  He said, you know, what's going to happen when Dearborn, Michigan declares caliphate?
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:56.201]  It's coming.
[02:01:56.201 --> 02:01:58.403]  Alex, that's coming one day.
[02:01:59.190 --> 02:02:04.397]  We're going to wake up and Dearborn, Michigan is going to say, hey, we're no longer a part of the United States.
[02:02:04.397 --> 02:02:06.140]  We are an Islamic caliphate.
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:07.562]  What do you think anybody can do about it?
[02:02:09.798 --> 02:02:11.259]  It's the perfect balkanization.
[02:02:11.259 --> 02:02:12.119]  They're really doing it.
[02:02:12.119 --> 02:02:13.640]  You can see it in Europe and the U.S.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:17.703]  You criticize it when your daughter gets raped and then the police come arrest you.
[02:02:17.703 --> 02:02:19.664]  It's like, hey, they're God now.
[02:02:19.664 --> 02:02:20.805]  They're your masters now.
[02:02:20.805 --> 02:02:23.246]  Debbie, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:23.246 --> 02:02:28.870]  I mean, I had Tim Kennedy in here who's, you know, high level anti-terrorism units and stuff.
[02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:33.332]  And he said, look, they're bringing them in to attack, to then take our liberties.
[02:02:33.332 --> 02:02:35.654]  I think it's just that simple.
[02:02:35.654 --> 02:02:38.796]  Alex, next week I will have confirmation on something.
[02:02:39.662 --> 02:02:51.986]  That for the first time, I'll be able to tell you with absolution and verification of what this Syrian invasion's all about.
[02:02:51.986 --> 02:02:53.947]  What they're really doing.
[02:02:53.947 --> 02:02:55.147]  I know and I think you know.
[02:02:55.147 --> 02:02:59.149]  Isn't it creating a corridor to the rest of the Middle East to invade Europe?
[02:02:59.149 --> 02:03:01.970]  It's the takeover of America.
[02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:03.050]  Yeah.
[02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:04.110]  That's it.
[02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:05.271]  It's the corridor into Europe.
[02:03:07.003 --> 02:03:08.144]  That's unbelievable.
[02:03:08.144 --> 02:03:11.906]  Santo, or Santino, I'm saying it right, in California, right here with Larry Nichols.
[02:03:11.906 --> 02:03:13.646]  Go ahead.
[02:03:13.646 --> 02:03:36.438]  Yes, my question's for Larry Nichols, and I live in California, and my friend who is working at Disneyland recently told me that he was to get blackmailed from the company if he didn't train a Syrian refugee to take his job, and they threatened that
[02:03:37.031 --> 02:03:37.271]  Thank you.
[02:03:49.813 --> 02:03:55.577]  They're getting enlisted in all these job positions without even having experience for the job.
[02:04:20.213 --> 02:04:22.014]  I mean, this is a total invasion.
[02:04:22.014 --> 02:04:24.535]  And they're all military-age men, by the way.
[02:04:24.535 --> 02:04:27.276]  Is this part of the military invasion, Larry?
[02:04:27.276 --> 02:04:28.396]  Yes, it is.
[02:04:28.396 --> 02:04:38.580]  And, Alex, they've got these major corporations committed to give all of these quote-unquote refugees minimum pay of 15 an hour.
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:42.262]  When Americans that are doing the very same job that they're going to lose
[02:04:43.208 --> 02:04:44.570]  Get minimum wage.
[02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:45.452]  Economic warfare.
[02:04:45.452 --> 02:04:46.493]  Larry Nichols, God bless you.
[02:04:46.493 --> 02:04:47.295]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:04:47.295 --> 02:04:50.059]  Thank God you survived that bout in the hospital.
[02:04:50.059 --> 02:04:51.441]  Everybody pray for him.
[02:04:51.441 --> 02:04:55.067]  We're gonna be back with a major candidate going up against John McCain.
[02:04:55.067 --> 02:04:56.029]  This is a big deal.
[02:04:56.029 --> 02:04:57.210]  She's leading in the polls.
[02:04:58.553 --> 02:05:08.223]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam, and that is the special relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[02:05:08.223 --> 02:05:15.771]  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an interview with CNN.
[02:05:15.771 --> 02:05:18.814]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity,
[02:05:19.074 --> 02:05:25.836]  The way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there, and you target the gang members to get them off the street.
[02:05:25.836 --> 02:05:30.717]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[02:05:30.717 --> 02:05:33.598]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue.
[02:05:33.598 --> 02:05:40.400]  That is the creation, promotion, and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia and the United States.
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:54.826]  As a political opportunist supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR, and the establishment, Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, omissions, and misrepresentations of the truth.

[02:05:58.428 --> 02:06:04.811]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:06:05.271 --> 02:06:08.374]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:06:08.374 --> 02:06:12.297]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[02:06:12.297 --> 02:06:13.879]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[02:06:13.879 --> 02:06:14.860]  I needed a detox basically.
[02:06:25.948 --> 02:06:27.070]  We're good to go.
[02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:46.894]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[02:06:46.894 --> 02:06:48.656]  I was like really more natural.

[02:07:00.257 --> 02:07:01.499]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:07:01.499 --> 02:07:03.081]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:07:03.081 --> 02:07:06.185]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:07:06.185 --> 02:07:07.286]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:08.268]  I've been working all day.
[02:07:08.268 --> 02:07:10.731]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:07:10.731 --> 02:07:11.892]  I get in here at 830.
[02:07:11.892 --> 02:07:12.733]  I was kind of
[02:07:13.754 --> 02:07:15.996]  I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:07:15.996 --> 02:07:17.857]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:07:17.857 --> 02:07:19.699]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:07:19.699 --> 02:07:20.739]  I popped two of them.
[02:07:20.739 --> 02:07:25.002]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[02:07:25.002 --> 02:07:26.483]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:07:26.483 --> 02:07:27.824]  People really love it.
[02:07:27.824 --> 02:07:28.425]  Read about it.
[02:07:28.425 --> 02:07:32.247]  Find out why third-party news sites give it such high praise.
[02:07:32.247 --> 02:07:37.531]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:07:37.711 --> 02:07:41.756]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:07:41.756 --> 02:07:47.903]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:07:47.903 --> 02:07:53.810]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:09.898 --> 02:08:25.441]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the leading voice globally in the fight for human empowerment against the global technocratic tyranny.
[02:08:25.441 --> 02:08:29.802]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:29.802 --> 02:08:36.644]  That's right, we are here in North America under the NAU, under FEMA Region 6, under the Democrat Socialist Party.
[02:08:38.001 --> 02:08:41.406]  The Republican Party says they're going to try to steal the election from Donald Trump.
[02:08:41.406 --> 02:08:47.876]  Regardless what you think about Donald Trump, folks, they've never gone in and ignored the popular vote at a convention.
[02:08:47.876 --> 02:08:49.359]  It is unprecedented.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:52.561]  What is it that is scaring them so bad?
[02:08:52.561 --> 02:09:05.824]  Well, they're scared of populism taking on a Tea Party, conservative, libertarian bent, like people like Dr. Kelly Ward, who, depending on the poll, I've got a bunch of them, just type in, Kelly Ward beats John McCain in poll.
[02:09:05.824 --> 02:09:08.965]  There's a whole bunch of polls, Breitbart's got it, you name it.
[02:09:08.965 --> 02:09:11.786]  Scientific polls, where she has 45%, and he has 36%.
[02:09:11.786 --> 02:09:13.146]  We're talking 9 points ahead.
[02:09:13.146 --> 02:09:14.627]  Other polls, 8 points, 7 points, 6 points.
[02:09:19.148 --> 02:09:21.130]  She is trouncing him.
[02:09:21.130 --> 02:09:35.002]  But we need a total landslide against this rhino, warmongering guy that funded Al-Qaeda, ISIS in Syria, this anti-gunner, this Keating Five, because I've seen them steal elections in Nevada, folks.
[02:09:35.002 --> 02:09:36.604]  I've seen it.
[02:09:36.604 --> 02:09:38.846]  I mean, who doubts it now, what they're doing to Trump?
[02:09:38.846 --> 02:09:40.707]  So we need a massive landslide.
[02:09:41.638 --> 02:09:46.162]  We need everyone to turn against John McCain and just send the establishment a message.
[02:09:46.162 --> 02:09:53.248]  Dr. Kelly Ward was elected in 2012 to represent the people of Arizona's 5th Legislative District as her Senator and member of the Republican Party.
[02:09:53.248 --> 02:09:58.952]  She earned her doctorate at West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine and now practicing emergency medicine in Arizona.
[02:09:58.952 --> 02:10:03.456]  She has now resigned from the Arizona State Senate in order to focus on her efforts in the U.S.
[02:10:03.456 --> 02:10:04.437]  Senate race.
[02:10:04.437 --> 02:10:06.599]  Kellyward.com.
[02:10:06.599 --> 02:10:10.482]  And my gosh, I mean, John McCain, the ultimate
[02:10:11.744 --> 02:10:13.986]  Democrat in a Republican outfit.
[02:10:13.986 --> 02:10:16.247]  I am so excited and I just hope she wins.
[02:10:16.247 --> 02:10:21.391]  But I tell you, you know, it's like people beat Hillary by 20 points in New Hampshire and they give her all the points.
[02:10:21.391 --> 02:10:23.212]  I mean, I'm no doubt she's going to get elected.
[02:10:23.212 --> 02:10:31.878]  I don't mean to be negative here, Dr. Ward, but I tell you, it looks like you'd already be the new senator there from Arizona.
[02:10:31.878 --> 02:10:32.518]  But who knows?
[02:10:32.518 --> 02:10:37.401]  I mean, like North Korea, it looks like John McCain may be the hereditary dictator of Arizona.
[02:10:37.401 --> 02:10:38.062]  What do you say, Doctor?
[02:10:38.842 --> 02:10:42.443]  Well, hey, Alex, it is great to be here with you, and you are exactly right.
[02:10:42.443 --> 02:10:56.608]  He is the poster boy for the establishment, for inside the Beltway politics, for what everybody on both sides of the aisle is so upset about, so frustrated, so disappointed, so disgusted with in Washington, D.C.
[02:10:56.608 --> 02:10:58.829]  And things do look good here on the ground.
[02:10:58.829 --> 02:11:00.750]  We've got so much momentum.
[02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:01.970]  You know, the poll you were talking about
[02:11:02.711 --> 02:11:08.954]  That was a poll of 1,400 Arizona voters who mostly described themselves as moderate and independent.
[02:11:08.954 --> 02:11:23.281]  And I'm, you know, I am a true conservative, so, you know, it's kind of odd that moderate and independent would be flocking to me, but I think that my message of liberty and freedom resonates across the board, regardless of race, regardless of age, and regardless of political ideology.
[02:11:23.281 --> 02:11:28.204]  People are ready to retire McCain, and I'm here to help that happen.
[02:11:29.778 --> 02:11:35.583]  Well, let's talk about, I mean, the polls pretty much all have you ahead, and it looks like you're growing as time goes on.
[02:11:35.583 --> 02:11:36.844]  What has his response been?
[02:11:36.844 --> 02:11:47.572]  Because I've noticed national media hasn't given this a lot of attention, because if this consummate establishment dinosaur finally falls, that'll send shockwaves throughout the system.
[02:11:47.572 --> 02:11:51.816]  I mean, I would think your race has gotten some attention, but I think it should get even more attention.
[02:11:53.027 --> 02:12:00.353]  Oh yeah, I think obviously it's a race of national significance because if we are able to truly take down a D.C.
[02:12:00.353 --> 02:12:02.095]  dinosaur or a D.C.
[02:12:02.095 --> 02:12:07.059]  rhinosaur like John McCain, it is going to send a message to Washington, D.C.
[02:12:07.059 --> 02:12:10.722]  and those inside the Beltway to say, hey, we the people are awake.
[02:12:11.147 --> 02:12:14.529]  We the people are not going to be silent anymore.
[02:12:14.529 --> 02:12:19.471]  We are reminding you that you work for us, not the other way around.
[02:12:19.471 --> 02:12:24.414]  And so, you know, I think that the national media, especially the inside D.C.
[02:12:24.414 --> 02:12:29.097]  media, you know, they would love to ignore that I'm even in the race.
[02:12:29.097 --> 02:12:31.358]  John McCain would love to ignore that I'm in the race as well.
[02:12:32.139 --> 02:12:44.377]  They want to make it a matchup between John McCain and Ann Kirkpatrick, the Democrat in the race, who is one of our Congresswomen here from Arizona, who votes with Barack Obama nearly 100% of the time.
[02:12:44.377 --> 02:12:45.819]  She is extremely liberal.
[02:12:45.819 --> 02:12:47.442]  She is extremely progressive.
[02:12:47.842 --> 02:12:51.607]  And she has not done anything during her time in Washington.
[02:12:51.607 --> 02:12:53.069]  She's 65 years old.
[02:12:53.069 --> 02:12:54.711]  People are looking for a change.
[02:12:54.711 --> 02:13:02.741]  They're looking for the next generation to come into Washington, not the same generation to stay there and lob themselves over us.
[02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:09.862]  I think that truly, the true matchup is Kelly Ward versus Anne Kirkpatrick.
[02:13:09.862 --> 02:13:14.384]  And in that same poll, I beat her by 6 or 7 points.
[02:13:14.384 --> 02:13:16.845]  So the momentum is definitely with us.
[02:13:16.845 --> 02:13:19.906]  I hope that the media is going to start paying more attention to the race.
[02:13:20.726 --> 02:13:23.808]  And to me in particular, because I am.
[02:13:23.808 --> 02:13:26.610]  Well sure, they know that it'd catch on even bigger.
[02:13:26.610 --> 02:13:31.072]  So they've got to try to ignore a huge, probably the most important Senate race in the country.
[02:13:31.072 --> 02:13:36.195]  And I follow the news every day and it's really hard to see unless you're looking at Drudge or Breitbart or Infowars.
[02:13:36.195 --> 02:13:37.956]  I mean it's just crazy.
[02:13:37.956 --> 02:13:38.357]  But look.
[02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:47.166]  They're trying to appoint Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney now to the Republican primary.
[02:13:47.166 --> 02:13:48.468]  They're at the RNC.
[02:13:48.468 --> 02:13:49.088]  Who knows?
[02:13:49.088 --> 02:13:54.414]  Maybe they'll just appoint McCain and retire him into the nomination.
[02:13:54.414 --> 02:13:56.617]  Maybe he should run against Hillary.
[02:13:57.908 --> 02:14:00.190]  You know, I'm sure he would love to be the president.
[02:14:00.190 --> 02:14:03.992]  However, he failed in both of his attempts to become the president.
[02:14:03.992 --> 02:14:06.213]  And I don't think he fought nearly hard enough the last time.
[02:14:06.213 --> 02:14:07.494]  Sure, he was obviously a wrangler.
[02:14:07.494 --> 02:14:08.494]  I was being sarcastic.
[02:14:08.494 --> 02:14:12.837]  But I'm saying if we're going to appoint Paul Ryan as the nominee, why not just appoint John McCain again?
[02:14:13.562 --> 02:14:14.503]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:14.503 --> 02:14:15.964]  It's basically the same thing.
[02:14:15.964 --> 02:14:21.408]  And if the party tries to pull those kind of shenanigans at the convention, really there will be an uprising.
[02:14:21.408 --> 02:14:26.671]  And I think that the GOP, as we know it now, will go the way of the wig.
[02:14:26.671 --> 02:14:27.892]  The people are speaking.
[02:14:27.892 --> 02:14:29.313]  The people are speaking loudly.
[02:14:29.313 --> 02:14:31.795]  That they want someone different.
[02:14:31.795 --> 02:14:33.036]  That they want an outsider.
[02:14:33.036 --> 02:14:34.177]  That they want a non...
[02:14:34.724 --> 02:14:36.025]  We're good to go.
[02:14:57.183 --> 02:15:05.827]  I, you know, I'm fighting fiercely here to make sure that there aren't any kind of, you know, there's no kind of funny business like what happened down in Mississippi here in Arizona.
[02:15:05.827 --> 02:15:09.389]  Well, there's been funny business before, but people are pretty aware of it.
[02:15:09.389 --> 02:15:13.471]  But I've never, I mean, seen leads this big against whoever McCain's against.
[02:15:13.471 --> 02:15:16.292]  He seems pretty entitled.
[02:15:16.292 --> 02:15:18.533]  What is he doing to try to counter you?
[02:15:18.533 --> 02:15:20.154]  What are you doing to counter him?
[02:15:20.154 --> 02:15:26.077]  And what can my listeners across the country do to try to really get behind you right now to push you over the top?
[02:15:27.014 --> 02:15:30.417]  Well, I love for people to come to my website, which is kelliward.com.
[02:15:30.417 --> 02:15:32.998]  K-E-L-L-I-ward.com.
[02:15:32.998 --> 02:15:35.200]  Kelli with an I, because I care about the people.
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:37.141]  Also, join me on social media.
[02:15:37.141 --> 02:15:44.246]  Twitter and Facebook are on fire with, you know, people who are really looking for change in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:44.246 --> 02:15:48.149]  And we all know we can't change Washington unless we change the people we send there.
[02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:49.791]  And so, come on to Facebook.
[02:15:49.791 --> 02:15:50.951]  Kelli Ward for Arizona.
[02:15:50.951 --> 02:15:51.652]  Come on to Twitter.
[02:15:51.652 --> 02:15:52.352]  Kelli Ward, A-Z.
[02:15:52.352 --> 02:15:55.415]  You've got to remember that Kelli with an I, because I care about the people.
[02:15:56.015 --> 02:16:02.961]  You can find the right Kelly Ward, because there is a Kelly with a Y who works for the DNC, and we definitely don't want to be on her team.
[02:16:02.961 --> 02:16:13.229]  But that would be a great way to get involved, because my biggest challenge is not showing that I'm a competent, qualified, capable person who's going to hit the ground running in Washington, D.C.
[02:16:13.229 --> 02:16:20.575]  It's increasing my name recognition to the point where I'm able to go up against a guy who has nearly 100% name recognition.
[02:16:20.575 --> 02:16:24.898]  Luckily for me, he's got about a 26% job satisfaction, so people are looking for an
[02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:29.711]  And so I've got to show them that I'm out there and I am the alternative.
[02:16:29.711 --> 02:16:31.872]  Well, America needs a doctor.
[02:16:31.872 --> 02:16:32.812]  I mean, this country's sick.
[02:16:32.812 --> 02:16:34.753]  Oh yes, we do.
[02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:35.733]  We do, we do.
[02:16:35.733 --> 02:16:36.673]  I've got the cure.
[02:16:36.673 --> 02:16:40.394]  I've got the cure to the John McCain-itis, that's for sure.
[02:16:40.394 --> 02:16:41.355]  The rhinovirus.
[02:16:41.355 --> 02:16:43.575]  We need to cure that rhinovirus.
[02:16:43.575 --> 02:16:45.596]  And Dr. Ward has the cure.
[02:16:46.371 --> 02:16:52.934]  Now, Senator McCain is actually doing a lot more things than he has for years and years and years.
[02:16:52.934 --> 02:16:58.036]  He's showing up in places in Arizona that he hasn't been for decades.
[02:16:58.036 --> 02:17:02.458]  And the people that are there are kind of, you know, they're funny because they say, wow, he's actually coming.
[02:17:02.458 --> 02:17:06.040]  He thinks that we're going to buy his story.
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:06.400]  We'll see.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:15.964]  He's going to be in Arizona this week, coming to several events, holding some coffees with Jeff Flake, that other strong Republican that we have here in our state.
[02:17:16.693 --> 02:17:24.600]  And I'm interested to see if they're actually going to answer questions from the people who are very frustrated with the representation that we've been getting here in Arizona.
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:28.984]  Yeah, I know in the past he hardly campaigned, he just expected to be given to him as a crown.
[02:17:28.984 --> 02:17:36.951]  He's now having to fight you because of the incredible anti-establishment fervor that's going on, but plus you've been running a good campaign.
[02:17:36.951 --> 02:17:40.234]  I just want you to watch your back because that guy is just such a gangster.
[02:17:41.431 --> 02:17:41.791]  Yes.
[02:17:41.791 --> 02:17:47.093]  You know, I've had people who tell me, you know, to get an auto starter on my car, that I should never be starting my own car.
[02:17:47.093 --> 02:17:53.556]  I really hope that things haven't gotten that far out of control, that I should be fearful for my life.
[02:17:53.556 --> 02:18:00.679]  But we are very cautious, and I always have, you know, people around me who are providing security, which is great.
[02:18:00.679 --> 02:18:11.203]  It makes me feel very confident and comfortable whenever I go out to speak to the people, because I'm more than willing to speak to all of the people, answer their questions, spend hours answering questions,
[02:18:11.543 --> 02:18:14.926]  Not just having planted questions.
[02:18:14.926 --> 02:18:19.431]  Cheryl, you've been very successful countering him for our nationwide audience.
[02:18:19.431 --> 02:18:26.457]  Please, soon-to-be senator from Arizona, Dr. Kelly Ward, how have you been countering McCain?
[02:18:26.457 --> 02:18:27.858]  How are you hitting him in 60 seconds?
[02:18:28.962 --> 02:18:29.442]  Right.
[02:18:29.442 --> 02:18:36.989]  Well, you know, he's never faced a well-educated, well-spoken, down-to-earth, Constitution-loving woman, and so it's very difficult for him to overcome.
[02:18:36.989 --> 02:18:38.310]  So we're pointing out his record.
[02:18:38.310 --> 02:18:40.992]  I point out his record day after day after day.
[02:18:40.992 --> 02:18:52.181]  He is a big government Republican, voting for tax hikes, bailouts, massive new spending, amnesty, liberal judges, calling the people who want to stop Obamacare a wacko bird.
[02:18:52.181 --> 02:18:53.162]  You know, all of those things.
[02:18:53.773 --> 02:19:00.057]  The thing that's going to be most important from people in your audience is to get on my website and to donate to this campaign.
[02:19:00.057 --> 02:19:05.681]  Whether it's $5, $15, $20, $2,700, the maximum.
[02:19:05.681 --> 02:19:11.045]  Because that money is going to enable me to fight Senator McCain, who has a lot of money himself.
[02:19:11.045 --> 02:19:12.926]  So I've got to have money to be able to win.

[02:19:15.368 --> 02:19:20.291]  I will personally, I'm not even really a drinker, but I'll pop a bottle of champagne if McCain goes down.
[02:19:20.291 --> 02:19:22.973]  He is one of the nastiest people, even compared to Democrats.
[02:19:23.553 --> 02:19:24.054]  Uh, out there.
[02:19:24.054 --> 02:19:24.694]  We're going to come back.

[02:19:37.385 --> 02:19:46.113]  I'd like to hear directly from you why you've been criticizing Obamacare and why you're so upset because I've seen your speeches against McCain who acts like you're crazy.
[02:19:46.633 --> 02:19:52.479]  To not want double and triple healthcare prices, and to have a big scam written by offshore insurance companies.
[02:19:52.479 --> 02:19:57.285]  I mean, how dare Dr. Ward not want to have this horrible screwjob for the American people?

[02:20:29.652 --> 02:20:33.514]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:20:33.514 --> 02:20:36.775]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:20:36.775 --> 02:20:45.978]  I was tired and lethargic, but after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[02:24:02.246 --> 02:24:08.211]  Welcome back, final segment here with our guest, hopefully Dr. Ward will end up being the senator.
[02:24:08.211 --> 02:24:14.276]  I mean, she's only 9, 10, 12 points, 8 points, 9 points in the lower polls against McCain.
[02:24:15.097 --> 02:24:26.329]  But in this day and age, I mean, fraud's so out in the open, they make them out and say, he has awarded it for life, and then his children, you know, his daughter has it, like North Korea, then maybe her daughter or her son.
[02:24:26.329 --> 02:24:31.855]  It's crazy, but kellyward.com certainly shows the fact that she is surging.
[02:24:31.855 --> 02:24:33.176]  Kellyward.com's the site.
[02:24:33.797 --> 02:24:35.338]  But think of the movie Idiocracy.
[02:24:35.338 --> 02:24:41.820]  I was noticing one of these big national scientific polls and then one of voters showed 45% for Kelly Ward.
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:42.541]  It's now closer to 50.
[02:24:42.541 --> 02:24:46.182]  36% for McCain and unsure 20%.
[02:24:46.182 --> 02:24:49.184]  That's from the movie Idiocracy.
[02:24:49.184 --> 02:24:52.285]  How could 20% be unsure or not sure?
[02:24:52.285 --> 02:24:54.746]  Here's a clip of some of those voters from the movie Idiocracy.
[02:24:54.926 --> 02:24:59.069]  Please speak your name as it appears on your current federal identity card.
[02:24:59.069 --> 02:25:00.269]  Document number G-2-4-L-8.
[02:25:00.269 --> 02:25:04.672]  You have entered the name Not Sure.
[02:25:04.672 --> 02:25:05.513]  Is this correct?
[02:25:05.513 --> 02:25:06.614]  Not Sure.
[02:25:06.614 --> 02:25:07.934]  No, it's not.
[02:25:07.934 --> 02:25:08.675]  Thank you.
[02:25:08.675 --> 02:25:10.196]  Not is correct.
[02:25:10.196 --> 02:25:11.937]  Is Sure, correct?
[02:25:11.937 --> 02:25:12.998]  No, it's not.
[02:25:12.998 --> 02:25:16.200]  Already confirmed, your first name is Not.
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:17.621]  Please confirm your last name.
[02:25:18.121 --> 02:25:19.202]  Sure.
[02:25:19.202 --> 02:25:21.744]  My last name is not sure.
[02:25:21.744 --> 02:25:22.164]  Thank you.
[02:25:22.164 --> 02:25:25.527]  What I mean is my name is Joe... Confirmation is complete.
[02:25:25.527 --> 02:25:31.511]  Please wait while I tattoo your new identity on your arm.
[02:25:31.511 --> 02:25:33.312]  That's basically where we're going.
[02:25:33.312 --> 02:25:39.637]  So, Dr. Ward, let's talk about Obamacare in the four or five minutes left we have and how we reach out to the 20% that's not sure.
[02:25:40.763 --> 02:25:45.208]  Oh my goodness, that was so funny, but so sad that it almost is true.
[02:25:45.208 --> 02:25:48.932]  You know, Obamacare really is an abomination.
[02:25:48.932 --> 02:25:50.594]  You have to know.
[02:25:50.594 --> 02:25:57.963]  I'm a practicing physician, which I think we need more practicing people of all different kinds of people that have jobs to go to Washington.
[02:25:58.403 --> 02:26:03.586]  And every time I work in the emergency department, I used to say I see the good, the bad, and the ugly of Obamacare.
[02:26:03.586 --> 02:26:04.807]  But really, there is no good.
[02:26:04.807 --> 02:26:06.728]  I see a lot of bad and a lot of ugly.
[02:26:06.728 --> 02:26:09.929]  I see a lot of people who have no skin in the game who show up.
[02:26:09.929 --> 02:26:15.632]  Just the last time I worked, I saw a girl who was 27 or 28 years old who has been to the ER 30 times.
[02:26:15.632 --> 02:26:17.273]  Now, not 30 times in her life.
[02:26:17.273 --> 02:26:19.995]  30 times since June.
[02:26:19.995 --> 02:26:22.116]  And there's no accountability whatsoever.
[02:26:22.116 --> 02:26:25.478]  So we've got to fully repeal Obamacare.
[02:26:25.478 --> 02:26:27.579]  I've got a plan out called the Patient Power Plan.
[02:26:28.078 --> 02:26:37.101]  It's my first policy proposal, because we need new, fresh, bold ideas in Washington, D.C., and we aren't getting those out of people who are there, especially not out of Senator McCain.
[02:26:37.101 --> 02:26:39.622]  The last idea I think he had was McCain-Feingold.
[02:26:39.622 --> 02:26:42.563]  It was over a decade ago, and it was a terrible idea.
[02:26:42.563 --> 02:26:49.385]  So my Take Your Power plan, it is a full repeal of Obamacare, including all of the taxes and regulations that go along with it.
[02:26:49.385 --> 02:26:52.186]  That's going to save us billions, if not trillions of dollars.
[02:26:52.706 --> 02:26:56.428]  And more importantly, it puts the power of healthcare back where it belongs.
[02:26:56.428 --> 02:27:04.513]  It takes it away from insurance company executives, and politicians, and bureaucrats, and puts it smack dab in the hands of patients.
[02:27:04.513 --> 02:27:13.918]  Because we all, as patients, deserve the healthcare that we want, and the healthcare that we need, rather than having to settle for what little tiny bit the government is willing to give us.
[02:27:14.617 --> 02:27:34.515]  And so, if we can get that enacted, get the free market back into healthcare, you know, get some responsibility back into healthcare, and clear out the murkiness that the hospitals and the insurance company have inserted into our healthcare process, we are going to have a lot more healthy people in this country, and our economy is going to soar.
[02:27:36.032 --> 02:27:38.393]  Well, I remember hearing about Obamacare eight years ago.
[02:27:38.393 --> 02:27:41.195]  It was going to be free when he was running for office.
[02:27:41.195 --> 02:27:49.779]  And then I read the bill five years ago, and it got worse and worse, and death panels, and doubling and tripping prices, and can't keep your doctors.
[02:27:49.779 --> 02:27:57.723]  And then I go to a clinic or something, and I see these people coming in saying, well, last time, once this was being implemented a few years ago, my bill was half this big.
[02:27:57.723 --> 02:27:58.323]  Now it's double.
[02:27:58.323 --> 02:28:00.024]  And they say, we're sorry, ma'am.
[02:28:00.024 --> 02:28:00.824]  We're sorry, sir.
[02:28:00.824 --> 02:28:01.625]  It's Obamacare.
[02:28:02.185 --> 02:28:10.192]  And then my dad himself was in health care management, not just a doctor, and he got out of it not because of profits not being good, but because it was so corrupt.
[02:28:10.192 --> 02:28:19.520]  He said, if you're part of the establishment and join with it, you rip people off, but it's designed to shut down smaller hospital groups, smaller clinic groups.
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:21.101]  It's just a giant screw job.
[02:28:21.101 --> 02:28:22.462]  And since then, I've talked to big.
[02:28:23.343 --> 02:28:27.905]  Hospital group owners and they say, man, we've never been making more money.
[02:28:27.905 --> 02:28:32.067]  This is the greatest scam on earth, but we can't see it going on forever.
[02:28:32.067 --> 02:28:34.268]  We can't believe they made this legal.
[02:28:34.268 --> 02:28:38.310]  I mean, I don't think the public understands how criminal this was.
[02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:45.474]  A dream of big mega hospitals and foreign bank owned insurance companies to screwjob the American people.
[02:28:46.034 --> 02:28:55.958]  Even the Wall Street Journal had to admit in the first year of its implementation, globally insurance companies had a 47 plus percent increase in profit just on fleecing us.
[02:28:55.958 --> 02:28:59.760]  This is the definition of industrial level looting.
[02:29:00.874 --> 02:29:16.378]  Right, and you can see that it's at its end of its rope because you've got big companies like UnitedHealthcare and Aetna who are saying that they're thinking about getting out because even with all of those subsidies, even with all of that money flowing into their pockets and into their coffers,
[02:29:16.798 --> 02:29:18.139]  They are losing money.
[02:29:18.139 --> 02:29:20.879]  Last year, UnitedHealthcare lost $720 million.
[02:29:20.879 --> 02:29:24.541]  And they're coming out and saying, we don't know if this Obamacare is sustainable.
[02:29:24.541 --> 02:29:24.961]  That's right.
[02:29:24.961 --> 02:29:32.563]  They want a 3-4 year screw job, then act like they're against it, get out of it, and then the system's already wrecked, then they got a single payer.
[02:29:32.563 --> 02:29:33.184]  It's amazing.
[02:29:33.184 --> 02:29:34.324]  Well, you know what you're talking about.
[02:29:34.324 --> 02:29:35.704]  KellyWard.com.
[02:29:35.704 --> 02:29:36.845]  Kelly Ward, you're amazing.
[02:29:36.845 --> 02:29:40.286]  I'm going to pray you get into the Senate, and I want everybody to donate immediately.
[02:29:40.286 --> 02:29:41.166]  God bless you.
[02:29:41.166 --> 02:29:42.687]  And hey, come on once you're a senator.
[02:29:42.687 --> 02:29:43.087]  We love you.
[02:29:44.085 --> 02:29:45.247]  Hey, I will, I will.
[02:29:45.247 --> 02:29:47.009]  You're awesome, thank you so much.
[02:29:47.009 --> 02:29:48.491]  The revolution continues against tyranny.
[02:29:58.763 --> 02:30:08.412]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam, and that is the special relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[02:30:08.412 --> 02:30:15.338]  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an interview with CNN.
[02:30:15.939 --> 02:30:26.041]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity, the way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there, and you target the gang members to get them off the streets.
[02:30:26.041 --> 02:30:30.923]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[02:30:30.923 --> 02:30:33.783]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue.
[02:30:33.783 --> 02:30:40.585]  That is the creation, promotion, and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia and the United States.
[02:30:40.985 --> 02:30:54.676]  As a political opportunist, supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR, and the establishment, Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, omissions, and misrepresentations of the truth.
[02:30:54.676 --> 02:30:57.178]  And you can read more right now at Infowars.com

[02:33:03.867 --> 02:33:11.112]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[02:33:11.112 --> 02:33:16.656]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.656 --> 02:33:18.518]  Well, you can tell I didn't write that liner.
[02:33:18.518 --> 02:33:22.040]  It's a good one, but I'm not quite that smart.
[02:33:22.040 --> 02:33:31.047]  For every question they don't want you to ask, I tend to understand why they don't want that question to be asked, and I have a live spectrum of reasons historically that it may be.
[02:33:31.047 --> 02:33:32.448]  Put it to you that way.
[02:33:34.121 --> 02:33:40.084]  Let's crank this up a minute.
[02:33:40.084 --> 02:33:44.986]  They want us under their thumb where we use the language they want.
[02:33:44.986 --> 02:33:46.407]  We don't say mother and father.
[02:33:46.407 --> 02:33:51.649]  We get bossed around by third world jihadis that keep women like farm animals.
[02:33:51.649 --> 02:33:58.232]  They get in our face and tell us how bad the West is all day and how racist we are and all this crap.
[02:33:58.232 --> 02:34:01.674]  Says you haven't studied other countries.
[02:34:01.674 --> 02:34:02.815]  I'm not saying we're perfect.
[02:34:02.815 --> 02:34:03.275]  Lord, no.
[02:34:05.109 --> 02:34:10.210]  But it's the West, historically, that usually said, hey, maybe we shouldn't act like this.
[02:34:10.210 --> 02:34:13.031]  Maybe we should value human life.
[02:34:13.031 --> 02:34:18.933]  Maybe we should uphold women.
[02:34:18.933 --> 02:34:24.674]  So, I'm just tired of it.
[02:34:24.674 --> 02:34:28.415]  Alright, I got a bunch of economic news that I haven't gotten to that's huge.
[02:34:28.415 --> 02:34:30.036]  A video we haven't played yet coming up.
[02:34:30.036 --> 02:34:31.496]  Dissidence Disrupt.
[02:34:31.496 --> 02:34:34.037]  ESPN Cuba broadcaster drug away and disappeared.
[02:34:35.438 --> 02:34:36.179]  But that's okay.
[02:34:36.179 --> 02:34:37.720]  That's what the controlled left would like.
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:40.282]  They can just get off on the power of that.
[02:34:40.282 --> 02:34:47.869]  They can't wait to have no iPhones or cars and just live in caved-in cities and have guys with machine guns walking around bossing them about.
[02:34:47.869 --> 02:34:48.390]  They love it.
[02:34:48.390 --> 02:34:49.170]  They get off on it.
[02:34:49.170 --> 02:34:50.652]  It's fun.
[02:34:50.652 --> 02:34:52.574]  The latest on the terror attacks as well.
[02:34:54.252 --> 02:35:07.337]  And I want to take a few of your phone calls, wide open phones, whatever you want to get into ahead of Leanne McAdoo coming in in the fourth hour to host the fourth hour with a lot of breaking news, special reports, and more.
[02:35:07.337 --> 02:35:14.800]  But before I do that, I want to play a special report, the truth about the Brussels attack, and I'm also going to air one.
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:18.421]  Brussels massacre, New World Order puppets fatal by John Bowne.
[02:35:18.421 --> 02:35:19.962]  In fact, I'm going to air that one first.
[02:35:23.922 --> 02:35:28.224]  But before I get any further, did I just see Paul Watson on that TV screen?
[02:35:28.224 --> 02:35:32.426]  Or am I going crazy?
[02:35:32.426 --> 02:35:33.507]  Oh, that's fine.
[02:35:33.507 --> 02:35:34.688]  So is Paul coming up the next hour?
[02:35:34.688 --> 02:35:37.549]  Oh, cool, cool.
[02:35:37.549 --> 02:35:38.469]  I thought I was going crazy.
[02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:42.271]  I look over and Paul's on the Skype TV, and I was like, hey, Paul, are you supposed to be on?
[02:35:42.271 --> 02:35:43.792]  Anyways, I like Paul, like my whole crew.
[02:35:43.792 --> 02:35:45.613]  It's always smile and get happy.
[02:35:45.613 --> 02:35:52.497]  When I see the reporters, they may not be happy to see me sometimes, but getting serious here.
[02:35:53.717 --> 02:36:01.404]  We have an amazing nutraceutical combo package, 20% off right now on Oxy-Powder, this higher level oxygen.
[02:36:01.404 --> 02:36:04.727]  Take five to six pills a night, four to six pills.
[02:36:04.727 --> 02:36:06.629]  It opens up the upper and lower intestines.
[02:36:06.629 --> 02:36:10.653]  Just cleanly, safely blast everything out.
[02:36:10.653 --> 02:36:12.254]  You do it for six days.
[02:36:12.254 --> 02:36:18.140]  You take the liver shield and the deep cleanse, two or three squirts, four times a day in water, purified water.
[02:36:19.418 --> 02:36:19.858]  I don't
[02:36:35.367 --> 02:36:35.587]  I think?
[02:36:56.505 --> 02:36:57.725]  Everybody I know that's done it.
[02:36:57.725 --> 02:36:58.986]  It takes six days to do it.
[02:36:58.986 --> 02:37:06.169]  The sixth night, you go to sleep, you wake up the seventh day, and you lose a lot of weight, get really healthy, detox, it's amazing.
[02:37:06.169 --> 02:37:12.191]  Or just take Liver Shield by itself for a week, do four or five squirts in the apple cider vinegar with the water.
[02:37:12.191 --> 02:37:15.692]  That does a lot in and of itself.
[02:37:15.692 --> 02:37:18.914]  Just to let you know what it's doing, don't drink when you're on it.
[02:37:18.914 --> 02:37:23.135]  I remember hearing this three years ago when I first did it, and I said, oh, let me just drink a couple beers, see what it does.
[02:37:23.135 --> 02:37:24.916]  A couple beers does nothing to me.
[02:37:25.916 --> 02:37:28.377]  Couple beers, boom.
[02:37:28.377 --> 02:37:30.658]  Seriously, don't drive a car.
[02:37:30.658 --> 02:37:32.719]  That's because it just opens your liver up.
[02:37:32.719 --> 02:37:37.201]  Be real nice to your liver when you're on this because it opens it up, the herbs and things that are in it.
[02:37:37.201 --> 02:37:38.461]  It's amazing.
[02:37:38.461 --> 02:37:41.162]  Find out more at Infowarslife.com.
[02:37:41.162 --> 02:37:47.125]  20% off on the full Deep Cleanse combo pack right now on the Ultimate Liver Cleanse pack is what it's called.
[02:37:47.785 --> 02:37:58.795]  15% off when you get the Liver Shield and Deep Cleanse by themselves without the Oxy Powder and then other amazing products like Super Female Vitality, Anthroplex is back in stock and so much more.
[02:37:58.795 --> 02:38:03.080]  Also, Chris Matthews' new article on Infowars.com by Paul Watson.
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:06.483]  Stop talking by MSNBC during anti-Wall Street rant.
[02:38:07.822 --> 02:38:16.807]  MSNBC host Matthews was told to stop talking by someone in his earpiece in the middle of an anti-Wall Street rant during a show last night, agreeing with Bernie Sanders.
[02:38:16.807 --> 02:38:20.289]  See, they happened to pipe it through wrong, though.
[02:38:20.289 --> 02:38:21.649]  There's nobody telling me what to do here.
[02:38:21.649 --> 02:38:33.416]  They pop my ear and say, hey, the computer crashed maybe once a month, we can't go to break, or, you know, your cousin just showed up, or, oh, Matt Drudge is walking into the control room, or, you know, stuff like that.
[02:38:33.416 --> 02:38:34.857]  They don't tell me what to say or what to do.
[02:38:36.038 --> 02:38:42.020]  They correct me maybe every day or something when I say the wrong name or the wrong number or flip something in my head.
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:45.042]  But everywhere else, folks, you're told what to say and what to do.
[02:38:45.042 --> 02:38:47.142]  And that dovetails with the video coming up.
[02:38:47.142 --> 02:38:50.724]  Video Dissidence Disrupt ESPN Cuba Broadcast.
[02:38:50.724 --> 02:38:53.645]  So we're going to play that, take some calls, and more.
[02:38:53.645 --> 02:38:53.705]  800-259-9231.
[02:38:53.705 --> 02:38:53.765]  800-259-9231.
[02:38:53.765 --> 02:38:53.945]  But first,
[02:39:00.989 --> 02:39:02.536]  Brussels Massacre.
[02:39:02.536 --> 02:39:04.605]  New World Order puppets fail.
[02:39:04.605 --> 02:39:05.790]  Here's the John Bowne Report.
[02:39:06.607 --> 02:39:22.379]  Immediately following the Brussels-Belgium airport and subway bombings, killing at least 30 and wounding 230, world leaders raised their voices to once again demonstrate their true lack of understanding of the perspective of the people.
[02:39:22.379 --> 02:39:30.525]  Instead, bleeding out like sheep, the same old message of vigilance and security theater we have all grown to loathe.
[02:39:35.339 --> 02:39:40.283]  400 extra police officers have been deployed in the airports in the Ile-de-France area, that's Roissy and Orly, and in public areas.
[02:39:40.283 --> 02:39:47.468]  All levels of government in Germany are working towards the goal to provide maximum security for the people of Germany.
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:17.791]  The Charlie Hebdo, Paris and San Bernardino massacres should be a clear indication that the claims of ISIS that this is only the start of the storm aren't to be taken lightly.
[02:40:17.791 --> 02:40:24.397]  And these attacks were undertaken by a wave of ISIS that was allowed to grow in the belly of Europe like a cancer.
[02:40:24.397 --> 02:40:27.740]  A caliphate disguised as the huddled masses.
[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:37.926]  But it was Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump whose comments flew through the fog of New World Order drivel to alert those with ears to listen.
[02:40:37.926 --> 02:40:47.471]  With the chopping off of the heads and what's going on, the brutality, you've got to hit ISIS so hard and you've got to take them out and not play tiddlywinks like we're playing right now.
[02:40:47.751 --> 02:40:49.672]  There's something going on, Maria.
[02:40:49.672 --> 02:40:50.833]  Go to Brussels.
[02:40:50.833 --> 02:40:51.994]  Go to Paris.
[02:40:51.994 --> 02:40:53.755]  Go to different places.
[02:40:53.755 --> 02:40:55.215]  There's something going on.
[02:40:55.215 --> 02:40:56.516]  And it's not good.
[02:40:56.516 --> 02:41:02.460]  Where they want Sharia law, where they want this, where they want things that... You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:03.620]  There is no assimilation.
[02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:05.722]  What do you think of the New York Times?
[02:41:05.722 --> 02:41:08.383]  They took you to task about your assessment of Brussels.
[02:41:08.383 --> 02:41:09.664]  Were you right?
[02:41:09.664 --> 02:41:10.164]  Of course.
[02:41:10.164 --> 02:41:11.425]  I mean, you take a look at it.
[02:41:11.425 --> 02:41:12.986]  Brussels is a disaster.
[02:41:13.266 --> 02:41:24.453]  Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz played his hand early, immediately demonizing Trump's rhetoric, while the body count in Belgium continued to rise.
[02:41:24.453 --> 02:41:38.961]  It is striking that the day after Donald Trump called for America weakening NATO, withdrawing from NATO, we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered,
[02:41:40.063 --> 02:41:43.664]  The subject of a radical Islamic terrorist attack.
[02:41:43.664 --> 02:41:55.067]  President Obama, not to be ignored, asked to be indulged on the matter and then proceeded to spew out more divisive and failed leadership rhetoric.
[02:41:55.067 --> 02:41:55.967]  Please indulge me.
[02:41:55.967 --> 02:42:01.908]  I want to comment on the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels.
[02:42:01.908 --> 02:42:04.669]  And this is yet another reminder that the world must unite.
[02:42:07.071 --> 02:42:17.041]  We must be together, regardless of nationality, or race, or faith, in fighting against the scourge of terrorism.
[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:29.047]  Clearly, the elite speak a completely different language than the average citizen, and their New World Order motives are blatantly obvious at this point.
[02:42:29.047 --> 02:42:41.735]  Are we all truly prepared to endure exponential suicide bombings on the scale and scope witnessed for decades in the Middle East, now shifting to Europe and the United States?
[02:42:41.735 --> 02:42:44.157]  Or will we finally hold the globalist puppets
[02:42:44.577 --> 02:42:51.800]  ...that have kidnapped the globe's governments accountable for the unyielding horror they are ultimately responsible for.
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:55.142]  John Bound for InfoWars.com.
[02:42:55.142 --> 02:42:57.883]  Very important report up on InfoWars.com.
[02:42:57.883 --> 02:42:58.803]  Brussels Massacre.
[02:42:58.803 --> 02:43:00.964]  New World Order puppets fail.
[02:43:00.964 --> 02:43:04.186]  That video's up there right now for you to spread to the four winds.
[02:43:04.186 --> 02:43:08.508]  And our affiliates are welcome to air any of our reports anytime they want in their other shows.
[02:43:08.508 --> 02:43:11.369]  Whether you're AM, FM, UHF, VHF, cable,
[02:43:11.909 --> 02:43:13.529]  Everything we put out is free to air.
[02:43:13.529 --> 02:43:16.490]  We just want to stop what's happening.
[02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:25.872]  Because they want global government to cut off the resources, to cut off competition, to end lower tax havens, as they call it, so there's nowhere to run.
[02:43:25.872 --> 02:43:27.112]  It's so diabolical.
[02:43:27.112 --> 02:43:34.674]  I want to go to Bill, Sherry, Jerry, Andrew, Terry, and others before Liam McAdoo takes over later in the next hour.
[02:43:36.377 --> 02:43:40.981]  But talking about censorship, talking about visiting Cuba, in a few minutes we'll play excerpts.
[02:43:40.981 --> 02:43:45.425]  It's a long video, but dissidents disrupt ESPN Cuba broadcast.
[02:43:45.425 --> 02:43:52.030]  They just walk around behind the screen some, and then they get drug off and arrested.
[02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:56.754]  And the issue is they lock you up in forced labor camps there, and our media isn't even saying anything.
[02:43:56.754 --> 02:44:00.838]  But first off, here's an article on Infowars.com that just went up.
[02:44:00.838 --> 02:44:01.699]  It's so newsworthy.
[02:44:02.861 --> 02:44:04.122]  He'll probably get no attention.
[02:44:04.122 --> 02:44:09.106]  Chris Matthews told to stop talking by MSNBC during anti-Wall Street rant.
[02:44:09.106 --> 02:44:10.767]  And he actually might lose his job.
[02:44:10.767 --> 02:44:13.069]  He actually, I guess he thinks he's a good little globalist.
[02:44:13.069 --> 02:44:14.150]  He shouldn't be told what to do.
[02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:18.613]  He starts saying, what, what, I can't talk?
[02:44:18.613 --> 02:44:21.475]  Quote, those in power?
[02:44:21.475 --> 02:44:24.358]  So, this is what short little leashes they're on.
[02:44:24.358 --> 02:44:30.683]  Network boss previously told Cync Nurick, that's how we say his name, to stop channeling those in power.
[02:44:31.698 --> 02:44:43.121]  The Miss NBC host Chris Matthews was told to stop talking about someone in his earpiece in the middle of an anti-Wall Street rant during a show last night agreeing with Bernie Sanders' policy on the free college tuition.
[02:44:43.121 --> 02:44:45.201]  See, they don't want him to be too strong.
[02:44:45.201 --> 02:44:49.162]  They want that as the promise, like the worm on the hook for the bass.
[02:44:49.162 --> 02:44:51.683]  There's not really, you know, anything but a hook waiting for you.
[02:44:54.721 --> 02:44:57.142]  Just like Cuba or China or anything.
[02:44:57.142 --> 02:45:03.544]  All that's waiting for you is multinational corporations who are above the law coming in and your slave labor for them.
[02:45:03.544 --> 02:45:13.668]  Selective companies coming in, not competition, not companies battling over getting you to work for them and paying you more, but screwing you over.
[02:45:13.668 --> 02:45:17.809]  And so, he wants to look like the good little populist commie and say he's all for it.
[02:45:17.809 --> 02:45:18.429]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:45:18.429 --> 02:45:19.110]  You don't do that.
[02:45:19.110 --> 02:45:20.630]  You don't promise free stuff.
[02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:22.831]  And see, they want to blame Wall Street in general.
[02:45:24.011 --> 02:45:29.275]  Most of Wall Street's just companies and businesses and, you know, there's a company of a thousand people that's publicly traded.
[02:45:29.275 --> 02:45:30.717]  It's on Wall Street.
[02:45:30.717 --> 02:45:39.904]  No, it's Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and a few other mega banks that are consolidating and rigging the stock market, the interest rates, the currencies, the flash trading.
[02:45:39.904 --> 02:45:41.646]  It's all admitted to be rigged.
[02:45:41.646 --> 02:45:43.287]  Remember 10 years ago, I was crazy.
[02:45:43.287 --> 02:45:45.409]  I told you it was all rigged, the gold market, everything.
[02:45:45.409 --> 02:45:46.050]  Now they admit it.
[02:45:46.050 --> 02:45:50.093]  Remember I told you I was a crazy man?
[02:45:50.093 --> 02:45:51.074]  I told you that, uh,
[02:45:52.517 --> 02:45:55.739]  Well, just basically all this was happening, but now it's out in the open.
[02:45:55.739 --> 02:45:57.560]  Chris Matthews told us to stop talking.
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:45:58.721]  Here's the amazing video.
[02:45:58.721 --> 02:46:01.243]  See the whole thing at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:46:15.121 --> 02:46:16.722]  And that's what they do.
[02:46:16.722 --> 02:46:20.966]  I've been there on CNN, MSNBC, you name it, where they're going.
[02:46:36.974 --> 02:46:41.215]  Well, they're talking to you, and then they'll just shut the segment off, end it, and kick me off.
[02:46:41.215 --> 02:46:43.016]  So I'm like, don't blame guns.
[02:46:43.016 --> 02:46:48.678]  You just had a couple different serotonin reuptake inhibitor Prozac ads, and they're linked to all the shooters.
[02:46:48.678 --> 02:46:50.058]  They make you go psychotic.
[02:46:50.058 --> 02:46:50.859]  It's on the insert.
[02:46:50.859 --> 02:46:51.499]  Whoa, whoa.
[02:46:51.499 --> 02:46:51.919]  We're over.
[02:46:51.919 --> 02:46:52.559]  We're done.
[02:46:52.559 --> 02:46:56.140]  And people walked out red-faced that they were going to physically attack me at CNN.
[02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:57.081]  I just laughed at them.
[02:46:57.081 --> 02:46:58.601]  You little nobodies.
[02:46:58.601 --> 02:47:00.282]  Like, I'm scared of you, you punk.
[02:47:02.631 --> 02:47:08.437]  I mean, these people are nothing but sell-out trash, cowards from bad families.
[02:47:08.437 --> 02:47:22.471]  These people come from families of servile, cowardly filth, and they want to make us all poor, those of us that have morals and that are honorable, so that we can beg to them for food.
[02:47:22.471 --> 02:47:23.352]  Are we ready with the Cuba Club?
[02:47:24.673 --> 02:47:25.113]  I know it's long.
[02:47:25.113 --> 02:47:27.614]  We're trying to find the spot so we can condense it.
[02:47:27.614 --> 02:47:28.775]  Let's go to video.
[02:47:28.775 --> 02:47:31.036]  Dissidents disrupt ESPN Cuba broadcast.
[02:47:31.036 --> 02:47:36.819]  I'll narrate this for TV viewers, but there's some young people jumping around behind and then all of a sudden they come and drag them off.
[02:47:36.819 --> 02:47:37.919]  Here it is.
[02:47:37.919 --> 02:47:42.122]  And Bob, as we heard the president say, I mean this was about much more than a baseball game.
[02:47:42.122 --> 02:47:45.023]  What do you believe this day accomplished?
[02:47:45.023 --> 02:47:47.824]  Well, Lindsey, this was about more than just more than just more than just
[02:47:53.957 --> 02:48:00.323]  We have a moment here with a political demonstration on our set, so let me throw it back now to the studio.
[02:48:14.451 --> 02:48:18.093]  Let me ask you guys, I don't speak Spanish, and there's lighter footage when I drag him off.
[02:48:18.093 --> 02:48:19.634]  What are they saying in Spanish?
[02:48:19.634 --> 02:48:20.734]  What's he saying?
[02:48:20.734 --> 02:48:24.016]  Stand by, our Spanish-speaking crew member had to go help Leanne set up.
[02:48:24.016 --> 02:48:27.098]  Alright, well let's pull it back, watch it, and figure that out.
[02:48:27.098 --> 02:48:28.018]  Thank you.
[02:48:28.018 --> 02:48:29.759]  Let's go to a phone call right now.
[02:48:29.759 --> 02:48:31.600]  That's more of what's coming here.
[02:48:33.012 --> 02:48:38.934]  And when they're done, there'll be no diversity of jobs, of information, of food, of clothing.
[02:48:38.934 --> 02:48:41.135]  You're gonna get, all of you, what you want.
[02:48:41.135 --> 02:48:43.996]  And I'm not talking to our listeners, I'm talking to the establishment minions.
[02:48:43.996 --> 02:48:52.580]  Even though you're too stupid to know, once you're in tyranny, how you got there.
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:54.100]  Let's talk to Ivan in Florida.
[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:55.241]  You're on the air, thanks for calling.
[02:48:55.241 --> 02:48:57.582]  Hello.
[02:48:57.582 --> 02:48:58.982]  Yes.
[02:48:58.982 --> 02:49:00.323]  Yeah, my question is,
[02:49:01.484 --> 02:49:10.349]  Obama went to Cuba to try to get, I guess, the Cuban army to go against us here in the state.
[02:49:10.349 --> 02:49:11.970]  What did he do?
[02:49:11.970 --> 02:49:16.853]  And then we could catch Obama and all his allies.
[02:49:16.853 --> 02:49:18.514]  Yeah, your audio is a little distorted.
[02:49:18.514 --> 02:49:22.336]  I'm not quite making out what you're saying.
[02:49:22.336 --> 02:49:25.118]  Okay, sorry.
[02:49:25.118 --> 02:49:26.839]  Yeah, I can't understand a word you're saying.
[02:49:31.650 --> 02:49:32.651]  That's the thing in America.
[02:49:32.651 --> 02:49:33.971]  The phones even work worse.
[02:49:33.971 --> 02:49:35.572]  Someday there won't even be audio on them.
[02:49:35.572 --> 02:49:36.613]  I gotta let you go.
[02:49:36.613 --> 02:49:38.213]  I just don't understand a word you're saying.
[02:49:38.213 --> 02:49:39.754]  I'm not frustrated with you.
[02:49:39.754 --> 02:49:42.536]  I just, I'm frustrated with everything.
[02:49:42.536 --> 02:49:46.818]  With the fact that our president goes and grovels in Cuba that is a third world dictatorship.
[02:49:46.818 --> 02:49:48.999]  Far worse than Venezuela.
[02:49:48.999 --> 02:49:53.361]  And Cuba has to make no reforms to be opened up.
[02:49:53.361 --> 02:49:54.341]  But it's not opened up.
[02:49:54.341 --> 02:50:01.005]  It's to select corporations and to select people to then go exploit the population of Cuba.
[02:50:02.529 --> 02:50:04.959]  It's sick.
[02:50:04.959 --> 02:50:07.890]  And then, Raul Castro...
[02:50:09.938 --> 02:50:18.944]  sits there and lectures us about what we need to do in America, and Obama says, this is a quote, thank you, please give us more advice.
[02:50:18.944 --> 02:50:30.752]  It's just all about, let me bow to the Saudi king, let me bow to this elite, let me bow to the radical Muslims, let me bow to the communists, let me, oh, just give us all your immigrants you want, we'll give them all free welfare, thank you, we're sorry, we'll do better.
[02:50:30.752 --> 02:50:37.437]  All about rubbing our faces in and breaking our will, conditioning us to just put up with anything you can imagine.
[02:50:37.737 --> 02:50:41.481]  We're going to test the phone system and see if it's on our end here during the break.
[02:50:41.481 --> 02:50:43.023]  Probably isn't, but we're going to find out.
[02:50:43.023 --> 02:50:44.324]  Sherry, you're up next.
[02:50:44.324 --> 02:50:46.346]  Then Bill, Terry, Andrew, and others.
[02:50:46.346 --> 02:50:47.387]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:47.387 --> 02:50:50.270]  This is the tip of the spear of resistance to tyranny.
[02:50:50.270 --> 02:50:51.292]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:50:52.478 --> 02:50:54.480]  I mean, remind your children, folks, about history.
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:56.422]  Communism is not a utopia.
[02:50:56.422 --> 02:50:58.683]  It's a dystopic hellhole.
[02:50:58.683 --> 02:51:03.508]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[02:51:03.508 --> 02:51:04.609]  Are you ready?
[02:51:04.609 --> 02:51:07.391]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[02:51:07.391 --> 02:51:09.533]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[02:51:09.713 --> 02:51:13.514]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[02:51:13.514 --> 02:51:18.596]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[02:52:07.861 --> 02:52:08.141]  I think so.
[02:52:28.217 --> 02:52:35.002]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[02:52:35.002 --> 02:52:39.265]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[02:52:58.058 --> 02:52:59.159]  This is Sharon Hunt.
[02:52:59.159 --> 02:53:03.021]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:53:03.021 --> 02:53:06.263]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:53:06.263 --> 02:53:07.804]  I was tired and lethargic.
[02:53:07.804 --> 02:53:15.489]  But after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.
[02:53:15.489 --> 02:53:17.170]  Thank you, Heart and Body Extract.

[02:54:24.517 --> 02:54:30.468]  I want to go back to your phone calls in this segment, the next to the short one, then I'm handing the baton to the intelligent, the lovely...
[02:54:31.397 --> 02:54:35.639]  The patriotic, the freedom-loving Leanne McAdoo.

[02:54:59.737 --> 02:55:11.907]  But continuing here, they did find the part of the clip, it's like a long clip, where they then drag off the couple of youth that dared to get up on TV and speak out against their Lord and Savior Fidel Castro.
[02:55:11.907 --> 02:55:12.228]  Here it is.
[02:55:13.892 --> 02:55:22.158]  ...are plainclothes policemen, those all thrown up in the air here, and astonishingly, as soon as they hit the ground, they made several arrests.
[02:55:22.158 --> 02:55:32.165]  They were taken off here, dragged off, one dissident was taken off, police restraining him by the neck, putting him in a car, so they've been taken away, and then the police descended on our...
[02:55:33.539 --> 02:55:39.323]  And ESPN is very pleased that folks are roughed up, taken away, cured for torture and years in prison.
[02:55:39.323 --> 02:55:40.423]  They'll teach him a good lesson.
[02:55:40.423 --> 02:55:42.284]  That's what they do, and that's freedom!
[02:55:42.284 --> 02:55:43.725]  That's liberal!
[02:55:43.725 --> 02:55:44.626]  Ah, liberal!
[02:55:44.626 --> 02:55:46.507]  Remember the university professor?
[02:55:46.507 --> 02:55:48.668]  You don't have free speech in this park!
[02:55:48.668 --> 02:55:50.189]  Get me some muscle!
[02:55:50.189 --> 02:55:52.211]  Ha ha ha!
[02:55:52.211 --> 02:55:54.452]  Get me some muscle!
[02:55:54.452 --> 02:55:58.915]  They're gonna live in a collapsed house and work 18 hours a day and eat squid five times a day.
[02:56:00.401 --> 02:56:05.244]  With a Chavano on every corner telling you how to speak and what to eat and where to live.
[02:56:05.244 --> 02:56:09.727]  Are you a communist?
[02:56:09.727 --> 02:56:11.908]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sherry in Colorado.
[02:56:11.908 --> 02:56:12.989]  Thanks for calling, Sherry.
[02:56:12.989 --> 02:56:13.569]  You're on the air.
[02:56:13.569 --> 02:56:15.710]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:16.951]  I've never got you before.
[02:56:16.951 --> 02:56:17.712]  It's an honor.
[02:56:17.712 --> 02:56:18.772]  I want to say thank you.
[02:56:18.772 --> 02:56:20.974]  It's an honor that you put up with me, ma'am.
[02:56:20.974 --> 02:56:22.575]  Go ahead.
[02:56:22.575 --> 02:56:24.856]  I have two quick questions.
[02:56:24.856 --> 02:56:29.479]  If the military is awake and a lot of the, you know, important brass is awake,
[02:56:30.627 --> 02:56:37.733]  I understand, you know, the FBI said they'd bring charges but she can, you know, blackmail everybody.
[02:56:37.733 --> 02:56:39.815]  Why aren't they doing something?
[02:56:39.815 --> 02:56:44.198]  Especially if he can call martial law and our election will be stopped.
[02:56:44.198 --> 02:56:46.901]  Because they've got criminals in all the big political positions.
[02:56:46.901 --> 02:56:48.862]  They've purged thousands of brass.
[02:56:48.862 --> 02:56:54.127]  They've actually put operatives in with no combat experience but who were communists and went to Harvard.
[02:56:54.127 --> 02:56:55.067]  They're actually putting
[02:56:56.167 --> 02:56:58.308]  Known communist into the Pentagon now.
[02:56:58.308 --> 02:57:00.349]  I mean, we are completely overrun.
[02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:01.909]  And now they're going to come after the states.
[02:57:01.909 --> 02:57:05.070]  They're going to indict most of the Patriot governors and their attorney generals.
[02:57:05.070 --> 02:57:05.871]  It's already started.
[02:57:05.871 --> 02:57:07.191]  I mean, this is the takeover.
[02:57:07.191 --> 02:57:10.032]  This is the end of America right now.
[02:57:10.032 --> 02:57:11.633]  I see that going on.
[02:57:11.633 --> 02:57:18.375]  And then also on Stephen Bannoon, he was talking about the Pope in 83 or 87 signed a contract
[02:57:21.502 --> 02:57:28.210]  Where he has the ultimate authority over all the world.
[02:57:28.210 --> 02:57:34.919]  Is that something that he did that we're not aware of and that's why they're doing all the one order and he's the spokesman?
[02:57:38.243 --> 02:57:41.446]  Well, I know there's a lot of international treaties and a lot of secretive deals.
[02:57:41.446 --> 02:57:43.288]  We've gone under global government, TPP.
[02:57:43.288 --> 02:57:45.049]  I know the Vatican's heavily involved.
[02:57:45.049 --> 02:57:45.650]  God bless you.
[02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:55.920]  We're going to go to more calls now from the chairman and everybody, but we did have some of our folks that speak Spanish decipher what the young Cuban gentleman, the young black Cuban gentleman was saying.
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:00.004]  He was saying, liberty down with Castro.
[02:58:01.325 --> 02:58:06.107]  How dare him not want to live in a collapsing hellhole with two weirdo brothers running everything.
[02:58:06.107 --> 02:58:09.248]  Talking about their, you know, kids running things now.
[02:58:09.248 --> 02:58:11.569]  And so everyone celebrated on ESPN.
[02:58:11.569 --> 02:58:12.910]  Oh, it's so fun to drag people away.
[02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:15.951]  And they were saying, Liberta, Liberty, down with Castro.
[02:58:15.951 --> 02:58:18.012]  Let's hear this guy right now.
[02:58:18.012 --> 02:58:19.633]  ...on our sets.
[02:58:19.633 --> 02:58:21.554]  Let me throw it back now to the studio.
[02:58:24.113 --> 02:58:25.554]  And the police grab him, rough him up.
[02:58:25.554 --> 02:58:26.595]  There's more footage coming up.
[02:58:26.595 --> 02:58:27.456]  And ram him in a car.
[02:58:27.456 --> 02:58:29.517]  And he'll be seen in about 10 years if he's lucky.
[02:58:29.517 --> 02:58:32.580]  And ESPN loves it.
[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:33.440]  Take him away.
[02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:34.541]  It's so cool.
[02:58:34.541 --> 02:58:36.363]  Get rid of all due process.
[02:58:36.363 --> 02:58:38.565]  And the banks can take all your pension funds next.
[02:58:38.565 --> 02:58:39.786]  They're coming for you.
[02:58:39.786 --> 02:58:40.886]  Like George Carlin said.
[02:58:40.886 --> 02:58:42.107]  And you want it.
[02:58:42.107 --> 02:58:43.228]  Am I talking to our audience?
[02:58:43.228 --> 02:58:44.209]  With the trendies?
[02:58:44.209 --> 02:58:47.111]  You want to have your jaw and teeth knocked out by the government.
[02:58:47.111 --> 02:58:47.472]  I know it.
[02:58:48.507 --> 02:58:51.710]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:54.072]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:54.072 --> 02:59:01.078]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:59:01.078 --> 02:59:06.403]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanse is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:59:06.403 --> 02:59:15.371]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[02:59:15.811 --> 02:59:24.693]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:59:24.693 --> 02:59:31.775]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpiteGerex herbal processing technique.
[02:59:31.775 --> 02:59:37.116]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best
[02:59:37.276 --> 02:59:38.276]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:06.643 --> 03:00:15.113]  So imagine a young man with a couple friends jumps up with him on ESPN and says, down with the Castros family, leave our top.
[03:00:15.113 --> 03:00:21.680]  They grab him, drag him off, rough him up, throw him in a police car, and our media thinks it's a wonderful thing.
[03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:22.661]  Could we do that here?
[03:00:22.661 --> 03:00:23.943]  Ban free speech?
[03:00:23.943 --> 03:00:26.346]  Man, we're banning the name mother and father.
[03:00:27.662 --> 03:00:28.743]  I mean, this is awesome.
[03:00:28.743 --> 03:00:30.084]  This is so liberal.
[03:00:30.084 --> 03:00:31.545]  This is so trendy.
[03:00:31.545 --> 03:00:36.828]  Those professors that, you know, want to beat up students that have free speech and say, get me some muscle over here.
[03:00:36.828 --> 03:00:46.155]  They ought to want to run to Cuba right now and live in a caved-in deal with mosquitoes, a hundred-year-old house right now, and eat squid five times a day.
[03:00:46.155 --> 03:00:47.896]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:00:47.896 --> 03:00:54.800]  More than just, more than just, we have a moment here with a political demonstration on our set.
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:56.762]  So let me throw it back now to the studio.
[03:00:58.069 --> 03:00:59.850]  They're plainclothes policemen.
[03:00:59.850 --> 03:01:01.751]  Those all thrown up in the air here.
[03:01:01.751 --> 03:01:02.932]  Not choking people?
[03:01:02.932 --> 03:01:06.494]  Astonishingly, as soon as they hit the ground, they made several arrests.
[03:01:06.494 --> 03:01:08.075]  They were taken off here, dragged off.
[03:01:08.075 --> 03:01:10.957]  One dissident was taken off.
[03:01:10.957 --> 03:01:13.698]  Police restraining him by the neck, putting him in a car.
[03:01:13.698 --> 03:01:15.119]  So they've been taken away.
[03:01:15.119 --> 03:01:16.500]  And then the police descended on our...
[03:01:17.572 --> 03:01:20.275]  Oh, thank God for saying liberty and down with the Castro's.
[03:01:20.275 --> 03:01:24.821]  We ought to have a national day of banning free speech and celebrating it.
[03:01:24.821 --> 03:01:26.983]  Oh, and funding Al-Qaeda like Hillary.
[03:01:26.983 --> 03:01:30.387]  And funding guns and the Mexican drug cartels to win the Second Amendment.
[03:01:30.387 --> 03:01:32.630]  Oh, thank you, you're so liberal.
[03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:33.531]  Oh, so liberal.
[03:01:33.531 --> 03:01:34.752]  Oh, so liberal.
[03:01:34.752 --> 03:01:36.514]  Uh, Terry in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[03:01:36.514 --> 03:01:36.854]  Go ahead.
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:41.121]  Hey Alex, my brother in Christ, I got something for you.
[03:01:41.121 --> 03:01:45.443]  You know how you always bash the left, you know, with your verbiage or your rants and all that kind of good stuff?
[03:01:45.443 --> 03:01:47.924]  Yeah, that's because they rule everything, they're dominating everything.
[03:01:47.924 --> 03:01:52.005]  I mean, when the Globals were trying to use the right to take over, I was talking about that problem.
[03:01:52.005 --> 03:01:53.466]  Go ahead.
[03:01:53.466 --> 03:01:54.927]  I know.
[03:01:54.927 --> 03:01:57.227]  The power of God, I got one verse for you.
[03:01:57.227 --> 03:02:00.489]  This is God speaking, so you can use and say this is what God says.
[03:02:00.489 --> 03:02:02.009]  He says in Jeremiah 4.22, He says,
[03:02:04.116 --> 03:02:04.937]  It's foolish.
[03:02:04.937 --> 03:02:06.097]  They have not known me.
[03:02:06.097 --> 03:02:07.018]  They are soddish.
[03:02:07.018 --> 03:02:08.678]  That word translates to stupid.
[03:02:08.678 --> 03:02:10.139]  So if you read it, they have not known me.
[03:02:10.139 --> 03:02:12.100]  They are stupid children.
[03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:13.481]  And they have none understanding.
[03:02:13.481 --> 03:02:16.743]  They are wise to do evil, but to do good, they have no knowledge.
[03:02:16.743 --> 03:02:17.203]  See what that does.
[03:02:17.203 --> 03:02:17.463]  That's right.
[03:02:17.463 --> 03:02:21.505]  They have a knowledge of evil and how to act like morons, but not how to be honorable.
[03:02:21.505 --> 03:02:24.607]  What's the word that translates to stupid again?
[03:02:24.607 --> 03:02:25.227]  It's soddish.
[03:02:25.227 --> 03:02:28.549]  It's an old Celtic or a Breton word, sod or sod.
[03:02:28.549 --> 03:02:29.569]  It translates stupid.
[03:02:29.569 --> 03:02:33.051]  But the thing of it is, if you even cause one, because you reach millions.
[03:02:33.692 --> 03:02:40.070]  If you even cause one of the lefties or anybody else to actually crack the book and say, well, God said I was stupid just to look for themselves, I'll tell you what.
[03:02:40.823 --> 03:02:45.667]  Um, Alex, even the angels rejoice for somebody that, you know, maybe never cracked the Bible, you know what I'm saying?
[03:02:45.667 --> 03:02:55.414]  No, I hear you, and I'm not saying I'm super smart either, but when you talk to a bug-eyed leftist, they want to ban free speech, they want to arrest everybody, they're not even liberal.
[03:02:55.414 --> 03:02:58.297]  But notice, the left-right paradigm is only a hundred years old.
[03:02:58.297 --> 03:03:05.222]  Before the left meant the occult, devil worship, Luciferianism, the left-hand path, left-hand rise above.
[03:03:05.222 --> 03:03:08.425]  So, all of this is hiding in plain view, and that's why so many times
[03:03:09.065 --> 03:03:10.266]  These are lovers of death.
[03:03:10.266 --> 03:03:11.648]  This is a cult group.
[03:03:11.648 --> 03:03:16.913]  The problem is the right wing is the very same group at the top.
[03:03:16.913 --> 03:03:17.474]  Great points.
[03:03:17.474 --> 03:03:18.555]  God bless you, Terry.
[03:03:18.555 --> 03:03:20.637]  Leeann Mackin is coming up in like five minutes.
[03:03:20.637 --> 03:03:26.744]  Let's go to Andrew in Ohio talking about PC culture, which boils down to being drug off for free speech.
[03:03:26.744 --> 03:03:28.386]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[03:03:28.386 --> 03:03:28.806]  Hey, Alex.
[03:03:28.806 --> 03:03:29.527]  How are you doing today?
[03:03:29.527 --> 03:03:30.368]  I'm doing all right, my friend.
[03:03:31.089 --> 03:03:31.649]  I'm doing good.
[03:03:31.649 --> 03:03:38.473]  Alright, so I just wanted to talk quickly about PC culture and how it relates to, I tried to give someone some of the Wake Up America coffee.
[03:03:38.473 --> 03:03:50.378]  So first off, political correctness has become so 1984 in Europe and the media that police in Europe are ordered to give personal home visits to people who speak their common sense opinions to try to scare them into silence.
[03:03:50.378 --> 03:03:51.779]  Sure, no, that was in the news today.
[03:03:51.779 --> 03:03:55.861]  If Muslims celebrated in the school and you talked about it, the police came to visit you.
[03:03:57.253 --> 03:03:58.955]  Yeah, it's just so bizarre.
[03:03:58.955 --> 03:04:00.096]  I cannot believe it's going on.
[03:04:00.096 --> 03:04:04.259]  If you're raped in Sweden, they tell you, well, it's their culture, don't complain.
[03:04:04.259 --> 03:04:08.223]  They're even allowed to have sex with children because it's their, quote, culture.
[03:04:08.223 --> 03:04:09.284]  They are God.
[03:04:10.815 --> 03:04:11.956]  It's insanity.
[03:04:11.956 --> 03:04:23.379]  So I actually gave a family member a bag of a Wake Up America coffee, and I didn't know their political views or anything like that, but I guess they weren't a big fan of the InfoWars outlet.
[03:04:23.379 --> 03:04:23.779]  I don't know.
[03:04:23.779 --> 03:04:24.860]  I didn't really know.
[03:04:24.860 --> 03:04:26.700]  So I gave them this present for Christmas.
[03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:31.862]  It was a Wake Up America coffee, and they opened it, and they just gasped.
[03:04:31.862 --> 03:04:32.863]  They were like, no!
[03:04:32.863 --> 03:04:36.684]  They were so scared they were getting this Wake Up America coffee because it said, wake up.
[03:04:37.584 --> 03:04:39.066]  Oh my gosh, wake up!
[03:04:39.066 --> 03:04:41.808]  No, we're doing so good in this globalist system.
[03:04:41.808 --> 03:04:42.529]  Wow.
[03:04:42.529 --> 03:04:43.490]  Leanne's coming up.
[03:04:43.490 --> 03:04:44.871]  I bet she wants to take your call.
[03:04:44.871 --> 03:04:45.572]  Finish your story.
[03:04:45.572 --> 03:04:46.012]  I gotta go.
[03:04:46.012 --> 03:04:47.674]  I don't want to honk her time.
[03:04:47.674 --> 03:04:48.034]  Wow.
[03:04:48.034 --> 03:04:49.075]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:04:49.075 --> 03:04:50.136]  Andrew Stahler, if you want to.
[03:04:50.136 --> 03:04:52.538]  Ozzie, Matthew, Ray, Tyler.
[03:04:52.538 --> 03:04:53.539]  Leanne's coming up.
[03:04:53.539 --> 03:04:56.382]  And in the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:58.596 --> 03:05:19.226]  I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times, because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer, and that all the very many adverse effects, which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[03:05:19.566 --> 03:05:24.328]  That was a statement made in April 2014 by a French medical doctor, Bernard Delberg.
[03:05:24.328 --> 03:05:29.690]  He's a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Merck, the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine Gardasil.
[03:05:29.690 --> 03:05:37.512]  And now, almost two years later, Dr. Sing-Hang Lee, director of the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in Connecticut, has proved these predictions correct.
[03:05:37.512 --> 03:05:38.913]  He published a letter sent to the U.S.
[03:05:38.913 --> 03:05:41.954]  CDC, the World Health Organization, and the Ministry of Health in Japan,
[03:05:42.154 --> 03:05:42.474]  We're good.
[03:05:58.243 --> 03:06:01.725]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:01.725 --> 03:06:09.971]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:09.971 --> 03:06:15.395]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:08:12.421 --> 03:08:18.713]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:23.709 --> 03:08:26.231]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[03:08:26.231 --> 03:08:33.275]  I am Leanne McAdoo taking over for Alex Jones here as we enter the fourth hour, the overdrive hour.
[03:08:33.275 --> 03:08:47.043]  Now before the break, we were speaking with Andrew in Ohio and he was talking about the PC culture and how extreme it is that his family member, rather than saying thank you for some awesome coffee, was shocked, utterly shocked.
[03:08:47.043 --> 03:08:48.784]  So Andrew, go ahead and finish your story.
[03:08:50.331 --> 03:08:53.072]  Yeah, it was just a really interesting experience.
[03:08:53.072 --> 03:08:59.894]  I mean, I kind of got upset when they kind of looked at the bag of coffee like I had just given them a piece of poop or something.
[03:08:59.894 --> 03:09:03.115]  I don't know, they just looked scared at it, and it just kind of upset me.
[03:09:03.115 --> 03:09:12.358]  But I later learned that they were Obama supporters, and I think that that may have been part of the reason why they were kind of scared of the whole InfoWars name.
[03:09:12.358 --> 03:09:15.319]  But yeah, I was just, yeah, I was appalled.
[03:09:15.879 --> 03:09:24.446]  Well see, and that's, you know, obviously their ideology isn't that strong to begin with, if they can be challenged by a bag of coffee.
[03:09:24.446 --> 03:09:26.228]  Delicious coffee, might I add.
[03:09:26.228 --> 03:09:28.030]  We drink it every day here in the office.
[03:09:28.030 --> 03:09:38.679]  And so this whole PC culture, before the break Alex was playing the video of the dissidents interrupting a live broadcast there in Cuba, and they're being dragged off by the neck.
[03:09:39.759 --> 03:09:46.963]  Because, obviously, the Castro regime doesn't want anything to spoil their visit with President Obama.
[03:09:46.963 --> 03:09:51.886]  And a lot of these protesters who are going and disrupting the Trump rally and stuff, I mean, they need to take a look.
[03:09:51.886 --> 03:09:55.748]  They think this socialism and communism is so great.
[03:09:55.748 --> 03:10:02.071]  Look at what's going to happen if you manage to shut down people's free speech because it offends you.
[03:10:02.071 --> 03:10:05.273]  You're going to get dragged away, just like those dissidents were.
[03:10:05.973 --> 03:10:06.314]  Thank you!
[03:10:23.891 --> 03:10:36.436]  Kind of want to talk about the updates with this bombing that took place yesterday in Brussels and of course it's the day after now and sort of the same things happening after every single attack.
[03:10:36.436 --> 03:10:40.057]  Here again the bomber brothers were known by Interpol
[03:10:40.257 --> 03:10:45.539]  They were put on Interpol, but they were still able to provide ammunition for the Paris attacks.
[03:10:45.539 --> 03:10:50.341]  They were able to rent apartments for the Brussels mastermind.
[03:10:50.341 --> 03:11:02.226]  And so these people, they were able to evade security services despite being notorious gangland criminals, and they had already been placed on a worldwide terror watch list.
[03:11:02.226 --> 03:11:03.927]  So, and of course now this
[03:11:04.787 --> 03:11:09.569]  The fact that they're now being tied in directly linked to the Paris massacre.
[03:11:09.569 --> 03:11:11.190]  This is the first time we're learning that.
[03:11:11.190 --> 03:11:12.111]  Yes, indeed.
[03:11:12.111 --> 03:11:13.892]  They're all linked there.
[03:11:13.892 --> 03:11:18.774]  But it's since emerged that they have extensive criminal records.
[03:11:18.774 --> 03:11:21.475]  Both of them had been jailed for crimes.
[03:11:21.475 --> 03:11:24.117]  One of them was listed on an Interpol red notice.
[03:11:24.657 --> 03:11:41.130]  Which is an alert that's given to police forces around the world saying that he was wanted in Belgium on terrorism charges, yet they were still allowed to play a major role providing ammunition and renting out safe houses where the Brussels and Paris attacks were plotted.
[03:11:41.130 --> 03:11:52.099]  Additionally, Turkey reveals that they arrested one of the Brussels bombers in June and they deported him back to Belgium and they even warned that he was a militant.
[03:11:52.719 --> 03:11:54.562]  So again, we have warnings of these people.
[03:11:54.562 --> 03:11:55.945]  How are they allowed to slip through?
[03:11:55.945 --> 03:12:01.174]  As we've reported, they were protected there in the Molenbeek neighborhood for months.
[03:12:02.498 --> 03:12:13.088]  Now, this revelation comes after it's been revealed that one of the suicide bombers left a note telling how he was desperate to blow himself up because he didn't want to go to prison like his friend.
[03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:15.751]  Aww, what a big baby!
[03:12:15.751 --> 03:12:22.457]  So he just decided that this was the best option to go ahead and commit this atrocity.
[03:12:23.258 --> 03:12:34.669]  And in addition to being warned about these people on the Interpol list, Belgian intelligence had precise warning that the airport was targeted for a bombing.
[03:12:34.669 --> 03:12:42.056]  But they, I don't know if they were understaffed or they just weren't focusing on the airport, but again, there was a precise warning that it was targeted.
[03:12:42.056 --> 03:12:43.997]  So they know this is going to happen.
[03:12:43.997 --> 03:12:45.439]  Again, the warnings were ignored.
[03:12:46.039 --> 03:12:48.921]  And then let's talk about the reaction afterward.
[03:12:48.921 --> 03:12:52.483]  So here again, we're going back to free speech and how important it is.
[03:12:52.483 --> 03:13:01.670]  Well, a yoga instructor tweeted something out about being shocked about how there were Muslim children in class celebrating this Brussels attack.
[03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:05.872]  And then he says, you know, how do you remember the lesson if there is in your class?
[03:13:05.872 --> 03:13:08.054]  It's being applauded by Muslim children.
[03:13:08.054 --> 03:13:15.579]  So then a few hours later, he tweeted out again that three police officers had visited his house and that he would no longer
[03:13:16.659 --> 03:13:24.602]  So just the simple fact that we have children in a class celebrating this shows that this is not isolated ideology.
[03:13:24.602 --> 03:13:36.066]  And again, being protected in those neighborhoods for months, walking around, going to the grocery store, even after the person's face has been put up on a most wanted list and still being allowed to go shopping.
[03:13:36.066 --> 03:13:42.909]  Obviously we have some major intimidation going on in these neighborhoods, but as well, it's not an isolated ideology.
[03:13:43.789 --> 03:13:46.310]  And of course, online, ISIS is running a poll.
[03:13:46.310 --> 03:13:49.271]  What will be the color of the Eiffel Tower next?
[03:13:49.271 --> 03:13:50.752]  And this is in an online forum.
[03:13:50.752 --> 03:13:56.955]  They're quizzing their gleeful supporters about the location of the terror group's next attack.
[03:13:56.955 --> 03:14:04.118]  And according to this poll, the United Kingdom seems to be the next major hit.
[03:14:04.118 --> 03:14:11.281]  One of the users affiliated with this group tweeted, the Islamic State will attack London, Washington, Rome, and all the infidel's capitals.
[03:14:12.641 --> 03:14:27.237]  And of course they celebrated by passing out candy to children in Syria and I saw those pictures and the people there are extremely unhappy and you can tell that they're just in fear of these ISIS criminals that have taken over
[03:14:27.677 --> 03:14:33.002]  But you know what, it's not just ISIS supporters out there laughing, smiling, celebrating in the face of this attack.
[03:14:33.002 --> 03:14:42.110]  It's also the leader of the free world, President Obama, is out there smiling and laughing and doing the wave with Castro.
[03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:46.814]  You know, you don't send a picture of yourself laughing when people have just been blown up.
[03:14:46.814 --> 03:14:50.397]  And of course, now I want to go to this report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:51.378 --> 03:14:57.604]  He is explaining that enough is enough and it's time to stop defending Islam.
[03:14:57.604 --> 03:14:58.705]  So let's go to that report.
[03:14:58.705 --> 03:15:06.612]  How many Europeans need to be slaughtered before we acknowledge that Islam is not a religion of peace?
[03:15:06.612 --> 03:15:16.180]  How many blood-stained bodies and limbs need to be strewn across airports and metro stations before we admit that Islam has a problem with violence?
[03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:22.327]  Putting a filter on your Facebook photo is not going to reduce terror.
[03:15:22.327 --> 03:15:27.873]  Starting a sympathetic hashtag on Twitter is not going to reduce terror.
[03:15:27.873 --> 03:15:31.817]  Creating a sappy cartoon is not going to reduce terror.
[03:15:31.817 --> 03:15:32.157]  Islam.
[03:15:32.157 --> 03:15:34.759]  And just to remind you, Islam is a belief system, not a race.
[03:15:55.151 --> 03:15:59.033]  It's not racist to criticise a religion.
[03:15:59.033 --> 03:16:01.213]  This has nothing to do with Islam.
[03:16:01.213 --> 03:16:03.454]  They were lecturers once again.
[03:16:03.454 --> 03:16:08.336]  Yet in the past 30 days alone, there have been 23 Islamic attacks in 22 countries, 1,018 people killed, 2,008 people injured, just in the last
[03:16:16.520 --> 03:16:17.520]  30 days!
[03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:25.527]  But the usual suspects, like George Galloway, immediately tried to absolve Islam of blame by pointing to foreign policy.
[03:16:25.527 --> 03:16:30.592]  And yes, the West's policy in arming jihadists in Libya and Syria was a disaster.
[03:16:30.592 --> 03:16:36.837]  But Brussels suspended its bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria 8 months ago.
[03:16:36.837 --> 03:16:42.062]  Belgium hardly has a reputation for being a murderous, invading empire.
[03:16:42.162 --> 03:16:48.984]  You're only blaming foreign policy so you don't have to acknowledge that Islam has a violence problem.
[03:16:48.984 --> 03:16:56.165]  It's far more likely that this was a revenge attack for the capture of Paris massacre culprit Salah Abdeslam.
[03:16:56.165 --> 03:17:05.468]  Who, by the way, was able to hide in Brussels for four months because he was helped by the residents of Molenbeek.
[03:17:05.468 --> 03:17:06.748]  Proving, once again,
[03:17:07.068 --> 03:17:14.775]  That terrorism has far more support amongst Muslims than the politically correct media will ever recognise.
[03:17:14.775 --> 03:17:23.802]  Residents of Molenbeek even rioted and attacked the police during Salah's arrest, calling the terrorists their hero.
[03:17:23.802 --> 03:17:30.728]  These terrorists emerge out of the same ghettos that leftists celebrate in the name of diversity.
[03:17:30.848 --> 03:17:41.397]  The same Muslim no-go areas that the media and politicians claim are a conspiracy theory, even as film crews are attacked every time they go near them.
[03:17:41.397 --> 03:17:42.478]  Hello, how are you?
[03:17:42.478 --> 03:17:44.519]  Liz Hayes and the 60 Minutes crew attacked.
[03:17:48.741 --> 03:17:52.585]  But who did some on the left blame for the Brussels attack?
[03:17:52.585 --> 03:17:55.348]  You guessed it, it's Donald Trump.
[03:17:55.348 --> 03:18:00.033]  Because he might have said mean things that offended the poor terrorists.
[03:18:00.033 --> 03:18:08.722]  Even though Trump warned about Brussels and was criticised for it just two months ago, calling the Belgian capital a jihadist hellhole.
[03:18:08.962 --> 03:18:11.724]  There's something going on, and it's not good.
[03:18:11.724 --> 03:18:17.668]  Where they want Sharia law, where they want this, where they want things that... You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[03:18:17.668 --> 03:18:19.169]  There is no assimilation.
[03:18:19.169 --> 03:18:24.993]  There's something bad going on, and until we find out what it is so we can correct it... You go to Brussels.
[03:18:24.993 --> 03:18:27.695]  I was in Brussels a long time ago, 20 years ago.
[03:18:27.695 --> 03:18:29.516]  So beautiful, everything's so beautiful.
[03:18:30.305 --> 03:18:32.807]  It's like living in a hellhole right now.
[03:18:32.807 --> 03:18:35.488]  You go to these different places, there's something going on.
[03:18:35.488 --> 03:18:39.630]  Foreign policy, Donald Trump, even climate change.
[03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:45.534]  The left will search for any excuse to avoid having to face the truth.
[03:18:45.534 --> 03:18:47.615]  Islam is not a religion of peace.
[03:18:47.975 --> 03:18:54.316]  How many times will violent Islamists have to prove this before anything changes?
[03:18:54.316 --> 03:18:56.297]  Islam needs a reformation.
[03:18:56.297 --> 03:19:04.099]  By immediately labelling anyone who makes this argument a racist or an Islamophobe, you're preventing that reformation.
[03:19:04.099 --> 03:19:07.379]  You're allowing extremists to dominate the conversation.
[03:19:07.379 --> 03:19:14.461]  Because smart and sensible people, including Muslim reformists, are being intimidated into silence.
[03:19:14.761 --> 03:19:22.229]  You're contributing to the deadly naivety that paved the way for Europe's open border madness.
[03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:28.415]  You're contributing to the absurd notion that mass unrestrained multiculturalism works.
[03:19:28.415 --> 03:19:29.756]  It doesn't work.
[03:19:29.756 --> 03:19:32.239]  Molenbeek proves it doesn't work.
[03:19:32.799 --> 03:19:35.960]  Today's attacks prove it doesn't work.
[03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:46.645]  How many more attacks in major European cities will we have to witness before we acknowledge that it doesn't work?
[03:19:46.645 --> 03:19:51.867]  All right, and that was Paul Joseph Watson once again with a really incredible point of view.
[03:19:51.867 --> 03:19:57.990]  Now coming up, we're going to be taking your phone calls and also talking about why you just can't trust anything you see on TV anymore.
[03:19:57.990 --> 03:20:02.032]  Hey everyone, with 20 plus years as a radio host, I've seen about everything.
[03:20:02.572 --> 03:20:06.977]  One thing that keeps recurring, though, are these timeshare charlatans.
[03:20:06.977 --> 03:20:18.850]  These high-pressure salespeople who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer, then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a timeshare they don't need, they don't want, and they can't afford.
[03:20:18.850 --> 03:20:20.832]  And then they're stuck with that thing forever.
[03:20:20.832 --> 03:20:24.376]  Monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual fees that keep going up and up.
[03:20:24.876 --> 03:20:27.937]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things.
[03:20:27.937 --> 03:20:29.737]  You know, you can't get out of the contract.
[03:20:29.737 --> 03:20:31.278]  You can't get out of the deed or the membership.
[03:20:31.278 --> 03:20:32.638]  Well, that's not true.
[03:20:32.638 --> 03:20:38.239]  My friends at American Consumer Credit, a timeshare release company, can get you free.
[03:20:38.239 --> 03:20:40.340]  That's their personal guarantee.
[03:20:40.340 --> 03:20:44.521]  12 years in business, free consultation, A-plus rating with the BBB.
[03:20:44.521 --> 03:20:45.521]  They're the real deal.
[03:20:45.521 --> 03:20:47.461]  You want to get out of your timeshare contract?

[03:20:50.844 --> 03:20:51.044]  Call now.
[03:20:51.044 --> 03:20:51.084]  800-587-3948.
[03:20:58.689 --> 03:21:00.069]  You know about RVs.
[03:21:00.069 --> 03:21:01.529]  You've heard about bunkers.
[03:21:01.529 --> 03:21:04.270]  But surviving is not recreation.
[03:21:04.270 --> 03:21:07.030]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:09.191]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.

[03:21:29.795 --> 03:21:30.695]  Frequently in pain?
[03:21:30.695 --> 03:21:31.436]  Over-stressed?
[03:21:31.436 --> 03:21:32.076]  Always tired?
[03:21:32.076 --> 03:21:37.839]  The solution is to oxygenate your cells because disease cannot survive in an oxygen-rich environment.

[03:22:01.383 --> 03:22:08.810]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:22:08.810 --> 03:22:12.414]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:22:12.414 --> 03:22:16.098]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:22:16.758 --> 03:22:18.579]  I said, let me see.
[03:22:18.579 --> 03:22:29.662]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:22:29.662 --> 03:22:40.785]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:22:41.724 --> 03:22:42.745]  How about you?

[03:23:05.660 --> 03:23:10.283]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[03:23:10.283 --> 03:23:21.112]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[03:23:21.112 --> 03:23:26.356]  Supernatural Silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers.

[03:24:06.579 --> 03:24:08.781]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:08.781 --> 03:24:12.504]  I am your host for this fourth Overdrive Hour, Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[03:24:12.504 --> 03:24:18.308]  Now, we want to talk a little bit about the results of the primaries that took place in Arizona and Utah yesterday.
[03:24:18.308 --> 03:24:21.691]  So, Donald Trump won the primary in Arizona.
[03:24:21.691 --> 03:24:24.893]  He'll get 58 of the delegates there.
[03:24:24.893 --> 03:24:25.814]  It's a winner-take-all.
[03:24:25.814 --> 03:24:32.439]  And then Cruz, with 71% of the vote in Utah, meaning he'll get 40 of the state's delegates.
[03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:39.327]  You know, maybe if I hadn't really been paying any attention, I'd just say, oh, OK, Cruz, fine, he gets 70% of the vote.
[03:24:39.327 --> 03:24:42.130]  Those people in Utah must really like him.
[03:24:42.130 --> 03:24:44.553]  Well, of course, we were instantly getting...
[03:24:46.144 --> 03:24:51.749]  Some reports of voters feeling that there was some scandal going on, some voting fraud.
[03:24:51.749 --> 03:25:03.340]  A person actually wrote into one of the forums on Godlike Productions that they literally had over 50 ballots in their hand at one time because they were just passing out ballots.
[03:25:03.340 --> 03:25:09.666]  There was only about 120 people there, so they just passed a stack of 250 and said, you know, take one and pass it down.
[03:25:10.146 --> 03:25:11.947]  This person ended up with a huge stack.
[03:25:11.947 --> 03:25:15.408]  You can see the picture of that stack they took a picture of.
[03:25:15.408 --> 03:25:19.129]  And then, of course, so luckily this person's honest.
[03:25:19.129 --> 03:25:22.630]  He didn't fill out as many ballots as he wanted to.
[03:25:22.630 --> 03:25:31.113]  Points out that they weren't taking, there was no controls, no credential checks, no ID checks, and ballots just being handed around like napkins.
[03:25:31.593 --> 03:25:36.277]  Then he said he visited another precinct caucus to see if the same thing was going on.
[03:25:36.277 --> 03:25:39.660]  They didn't even ask him for ID when he entered the building.
[03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:45.784]  And the same thing was happening there with just these ballots being passed around willy-nilly.
[03:25:45.784 --> 03:25:59.575]  And also, he says about 15 minutes later, with only 10 or so people milling around, because a lot of people left once they cast their vote, someone walked into the room with an envelope stuffed full of absentee ballots.
[03:26:00.456 --> 03:26:08.639]  So some of the envelopes had two to five or more ballots and he said, you know, isn't there an absentee process already in place?
[03:26:08.639 --> 03:26:11.200]  Didn't people have to register for that last week?
[03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:17.263]  And they said, oh no, no, no, this is completely normal, totally normal that we would just all of a sudden bring in a big...
[03:26:18.183 --> 03:26:18.624]  I don't know.
[03:26:35.205 --> 03:26:54.898]  Now Wired Magazine reported about how Utah's online caucus is giving security experts heart attacks because they pretty much agree that letting people vote online is a very bad idea and talking about this Smartmatic company which is going to be managing the electronic voting systems and internet voting, yeah they can take all the precautions they want but
[03:26:55.678 --> 03:27:03.383]  They can't do anything to secure the laptops, smartphones, and other personal devices that voters are going to be using to vote online.
[03:27:03.383 --> 03:27:13.669]  And as we've reported, there's a George Soros board member who's chairing the firm that's running the online voting for the caucus there in Utah.
[03:27:13.669 --> 03:27:15.169]  Now I want to go to this clip.
[03:27:15.169 --> 03:27:15.590]  This is from 2011.
[03:27:15.590 --> 03:27:22.133]  There's a programmer testifying that he was asked to rig voting machine software.
[03:27:22.133 --> 03:27:22.914]  So let's go to that clip.
[03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:36.963]  Mr. Curtis, would you please state your full name for the record?
[03:27:36.963 --> 03:27:39.366]  My name is Clinton Eugene Curtis.
[03:27:39.366 --> 03:27:41.228]  And where do you reside?
[03:27:41.228 --> 03:27:42.189]  LIC, Florida.
[03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:43.730]  And what is your profession?
[03:27:43.730 --> 03:27:45.012]  I'm a computer programmer.
[03:27:45.012 --> 03:27:48.395]  Would you please speak into the microphone so the audience can hear your testimony?
[03:27:48.395 --> 03:27:49.456]  I'm a computer programmer.
[03:27:50.336 --> 03:27:54.918]  Mr. Curtis, are there programs that can be used to secretly fix elections?
[03:27:54.918 --> 03:27:55.579]  Yes.
[03:27:55.579 --> 03:27:57.360]  How do you know that could be the case?
[03:27:57.360 --> 03:28:07.645]  Because in October of 2000, I wrote a prototype for President Congressman Tom Feeney at the company I work for in Albedo, Florida that did just that.
[03:28:08.725 --> 03:28:10.407]  And we say did just that.
[03:28:10.407 --> 03:28:11.829]  It would rig an election?
[03:28:11.829 --> 03:28:18.436]  It would flip the vote 51-49 with whoever you wanted it to go to and whichever race you wanted to win.
[03:28:18.436 --> 03:28:26.264]  And would that program that you designed be something that elections officials that might be on county boards of elections could detect?
[03:28:26.264 --> 03:28:26.985]  They'd never see it.
[03:28:31.824 --> 03:28:35.746]  Okay, and so that's, you know, that's a very poignant statement that he makes.
[03:28:35.746 --> 03:28:47.812]  He says they would never see it, they'd never know, you'd have to have access there to be able to see the source code, but here he's admitting that yes, programmers can create this, it's very easy, and he was asked to do it, and
[03:28:48.372 --> 03:28:48.993]  And he did.
[03:28:48.993 --> 03:28:53.555]  He was asked by a powerful Republican legislator to create this vote-rigging software.
[03:28:53.555 --> 03:29:09.245]  And then when you go back to this Wired article, where it says that this new online process was spearheaded by a Utah GOP chairman, James Evans, who was looking for ways to make the caucus process more convenient and accessible for voters, right?
[03:29:09.245 --> 03:29:13.147]  Because it's been wrong all of these decades.
[03:29:13.147 --> 03:29:16.249]  He says, Evans says, he was aware of the potential security risks
[03:29:16.849 --> 03:29:21.631]  But he dismissed these off-sided vulnerabilities as far-fetched.
[03:29:21.631 --> 03:29:29.655]  So we already know that there is a whole system being rigged to game the system, and that's why everything is very odd there in Utah.
[03:29:29.655 --> 03:29:38.320]  And as we know, George Soros' board member is backing the Smartmatic firm, which is in charge of these online machines.
[03:29:38.320 --> 03:29:45.483]  So I think if we go online with our voting, it's just bye-bye to our supposed democracy.
[03:29:45.483 --> 03:29:46.144]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:47.853 --> 03:29:51.776]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.776 --> 03:29:58.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.662 --> 03:30:08.310]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam, and that is the special relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
[03:30:08.310 --> 03:30:15.256]  Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an interview with CNN.
[03:30:15.856 --> 03:30:25.945]  If you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang activity, the way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there, and you target the gang members to get them off the street.
[03:30:25.945 --> 03:30:30.830]  I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of radical Islamic terrorism.
[03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:33.692]  Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue.
[03:30:33.692 --> 03:30:40.519]  That is the creation, promotion, and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia and the United States.
[03:30:40.899 --> 03:30:54.568]  As a political opportunist, supported by Goldman Sachs, the CFR, and the establishment, Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and its lies, delusions, omissions, and misrepresentations of the truth.
[03:30:54.568 --> 03:30:57.130]  And you can read more right now at Infowars.com

[03:32:08.336 --> 03:32:08.816]  Thank you, brother.

[03:32:10.736 --> 03:32:16.958]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[03:32:16.958 --> 03:32:18.938]  Welcome to the InfoWar.

[03:32:31.224 --> 03:32:34.106]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:32:34.106 --> 03:32:35.187]  What products are you taking?

[03:32:43.754 --> 03:32:46.956]  And I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofilm.

[03:33:12.385 --> 03:33:17.291]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:22.732 --> 03:33:24.673]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.673 --> 03:33:27.896]  Alex Jones is not here to go, yeah!
[03:33:27.896 --> 03:33:29.797]  I'm hosting the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:33:29.797 --> 03:33:30.598]  I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[03:33:30.598 --> 03:33:33.260]  Joining me in studio is Rob Due.
[03:33:33.260 --> 03:33:40.546]  But before we get to this next segment, which is, I mean, it's going to blow your mind why you cannot trust anything anymore.
[03:33:40.546 --> 03:33:42.828]  You will not believe the software that's out there.
[03:33:42.828 --> 03:33:47.592]  And of course, you know, this is just the tip of the iceberg because this is what they're revealing to the public.
[03:33:48.072 --> 03:33:55.858]  But before we do that, I want to let you guys know that we're having a limited time special, 20% off of the new Ultimate Liver Cleanse Pack.
[03:33:55.858 --> 03:33:58.480]  Alex Jones is doing another liver cleanse this week.
[03:33:58.480 --> 03:34:04.064]  He experienced some tremendous, dramatic results last year, so he's doing it again.
[03:34:04.064 --> 03:34:11.170]  And he says he didn't want to do it alone, so he's asking all the info warriors out there to join with him in doing this liver cleanse.
[03:34:11.810 --> 03:34:20.275]  And in order to make that easier for you, he wanted to give a 20% off discount on the cleansing packs at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:34:53.188 --> 03:35:03.350]  It absolutely helped me completely shift my habits and cleared my mind so that I could get back in the game because I was starting to feel ultra sluggish.

[03:35:11.173 --> 03:35:16.860]  Dew, I know you said you had some pretty tremendous success there with the... Oxy-Powder.
[03:35:16.860 --> 03:35:17.400]  Oxy-Powder.
[03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:18.281]  Definitely.
[03:35:18.281 --> 03:35:19.683]  Twelve pounds in just a few days.
[03:35:19.683 --> 03:35:21.325]  Twelve pounds in six days and then...
[03:35:23.174 --> 03:35:31.997]  The second time I did it, I didn't have, I think I lost like three or four pounds, but I noticed the... Well, you had already kind of flushed a lot out of your gut.
[03:35:31.997 --> 03:35:44.340]  Yeah, that was, you know, it was a few months later, but I noticed that my body became, you could feel it detoxify, because for two days I felt like garbage, and then the third day I felt amazing.
[03:35:44.340 --> 03:35:48.281]  I woke up, I had energy, stayed up for about 18 hours, just felt great.
[03:35:48.701 --> 03:35:51.663]  Yeah, and that's something that a lot of people might experience.
[03:35:51.663 --> 03:36:03.451]  They might have some skin issues and things for those first couple of days while their body is detoxing, but then once those toxins are out, and you might have to do it a couple of times, but once those toxins are out, you have glowing skin.
[03:36:03.451 --> 03:36:09.875]  I know I did, and I felt tremendous, and I have a pair of jeans that I can actually button again.
[03:36:09.875 --> 03:36:12.417]  And that's like a full-body paradigm shift.
[03:36:12.417 --> 03:36:14.018]  I've got a mental paradigm shift here.
[03:36:14.018 --> 03:36:14.939]  Somebody sent me this email.
[03:36:14.939 --> 03:36:15.599]  Just let me read this.
[03:36:15.599 --> 03:36:17.100]  This is from Charles.
[03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:18.081]  Sent this to me this morning.
[03:36:18.841 --> 03:36:23.625]  Because I took down my rebel flag, which you can't buy on eBay anymore, and peeled the NRA sticker off the front door.
[03:36:23.625 --> 03:36:27.428]  I disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy-ass neighborhood watch.
[03:36:27.428 --> 03:36:32.631]  I bought two Pakistani flags and put one at the corner of my front yard, each corner of my front yard.
[03:36:32.631 --> 03:36:35.974]  Then I purchased a black flag of ISIS, which I could buy on eBay and ran it up the flagpole.
[03:36:36.494 --> 03:36:42.759]  Now the local police, sheriff, FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security and Secret Service and other agencies are watching my house 24-7.
[03:36:42.759 --> 03:36:45.461]  I've never felt safer and I'm saving $29.95 a month.
[03:36:45.461 --> 03:36:47.762]  That ADT used to charge me.
[03:36:47.762 --> 03:36:51.225]  I also bought burkas for my family when we shop or travel.
[03:36:51.225 --> 03:36:53.786]  Everyone moves out of the way and security can't pat us down.
[03:36:53.786 --> 03:36:56.929]  Hot dams, safe at last, ain't the old republic great or what?
[03:36:57.689 --> 03:37:01.511]  I thought that was really, you kind of summed it all up in there.
[03:37:01.511 --> 03:37:03.552]  It's the way our security system works.
[03:37:03.552 --> 03:37:14.118]  In fact, I think Alex is about to do a Facebook mentions about these planes that are landing in airports around the country and people are just being let through customs and they say, well it's a snafu.
[03:37:16.099 --> 03:37:17.319]  There's no snafu.
[03:37:17.319 --> 03:37:18.520]  I've traveled internationally.
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:20.201]  You funnel into one area.
[03:37:20.201 --> 03:37:22.482]  You're not getting out without going through customs.
[03:37:22.482 --> 03:37:22.762]  Right.
[03:37:22.762 --> 03:37:27.504]  And you know, then you have the illegal immigrants that they're flying around the country, letting them fly pieces of paper.
[03:37:27.504 --> 03:37:29.465]  Meanwhile, what do we have?
[03:37:29.465 --> 03:37:35.828]  Just yesterday, it was announced that the vaunted Viper teams are starting back up as a result of this Paris attack.
[03:37:35.828 --> 03:37:38.149]  I've got a short clip from CNN.
[03:37:38.149 --> 03:37:42.451]  This is the Viper teams now clip, guys, and it starts off with a CNN reporter.
[03:37:42.911 --> 03:37:48.155]  So these teams are basically set up to go to every form of transportation.
[03:37:48.155 --> 03:37:51.658]  Bus stations, train stations, highways.
[03:37:51.658 --> 03:37:54.300]  And I've even got video of them practicing on highways a few years ago.
[03:37:54.300 --> 03:37:57.042]  We put that in Police State for the rise of FEMA.
[03:37:57.042 --> 03:37:59.304]  Because people don't believe this stuff when you show it to them back then.
[03:37:59.304 --> 03:38:00.585]  They're like, oh it doesn't happen.
[03:38:00.585 --> 03:38:02.366]  Well now they've activated the Viper team.
[03:38:02.366 --> 03:38:03.267]  So let's go to that clip now.
[03:38:05.691 --> 03:38:13.136]  The TSA is preparing to launch a specialized group, a specialized unit, at airports in major cities.
[03:38:13.136 --> 03:38:20.381]  The so-called Viper teams, they use everything from bomb-sniffing dogs to advanced specialized screening.
[03:38:20.381 --> 03:38:21.262]  Tonight, U.S.
[03:38:21.262 --> 03:38:23.704]  cities nationwide are on heightened alert.
[03:38:24.404 --> 03:38:28.549]  New York City is stepping up its police and National Guard presence.
[03:38:28.549 --> 03:38:36.218]  High visibility anti-terrorist patrols can be seen in the subway system where officers are checking bags for explosives.
[03:38:36.218 --> 03:38:40.744]  Signs at New York's Penn Station alert passengers about random checks.
[03:38:40.744 --> 03:38:44.328]  And the city's three major airports have heightened security as well.
[03:38:44.548 --> 03:38:48.449]  Yeah, we don't want to be racist and actually go look at people.
[03:38:48.449 --> 03:38:51.189]  Yeah, we don't want to be racist, we just want to pat everyone down.
[03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:53.310]  You see how they're bringing the old lady up?
[03:38:53.310 --> 03:38:55.250]  Come here, old lady, let me get a check of your bag.
[03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:55.950]  Kids in wheelchairs.
[03:38:55.950 --> 03:38:56.790]  You look like a terrorist.
[03:39:10.453 --> 03:39:14.896]  Because, you know, if they do any type of profiling, oh, that would be bad.
[03:39:14.896 --> 03:39:23.361]  Before we go to the video from the past, which was part of a video I did of Alex, he was trying to educate the TSA, and I put some clips in there.
[03:39:23.361 --> 03:39:27.224]  But this is a video from Texas Shrugged Book.
[03:39:28.084 --> 03:39:29.826]  Uh, somebody sent me this yesterday.
[03:39:29.826 --> 03:39:31.828]  It went out on the 23rd.
[03:39:31.828 --> 03:39:34.510]  Brussels attack is strange as Paris attack.
[03:39:34.510 --> 03:39:40.576]  And there's a clip in there which the guy shows of when they arrested the mastermind of the Paris attacks.
[03:39:40.576 --> 03:39:43.499]  They show him running past like five or six cops.
[03:39:43.499 --> 03:39:45.181]  He just let him run by him.
[03:39:45.181 --> 03:39:46.682]  He turns the corner, runs down the street.
[03:39:46.682 --> 03:39:47.903]  They fire one shot at him.
[03:39:48.664 --> 03:39:53.827]  And then he's arrested down the street, and it's just weird, and nobody even talks about how weird that is.
[03:39:53.827 --> 03:39:55.828]  It was a dramatic firefight.
[03:39:55.828 --> 03:39:57.028]  Oh, they call it a dramatic firefight.
[03:39:57.028 --> 03:39:57.769]  There's one shot.
[03:39:57.769 --> 03:40:01.951]  Here you can see the one shot as he comes down, and then there they drag him off.
[03:40:01.951 --> 03:40:05.152]  And it goes, it gets slower and slower as we go by.
[03:40:05.152 --> 03:40:07.253]  You can see a slower version right here.
[03:40:07.253 --> 03:40:08.414]  Here he comes.
[03:40:08.414 --> 03:40:11.955]  You can see, look, they're like stepping out of his way, like, hey, come on, come on.
[03:40:11.955 --> 03:40:13.856]  Oh, no, he didn't grab him.
[03:40:13.856 --> 03:40:15.137]  He's all, I'm going to run.
[03:40:15.137 --> 03:40:16.758]  One shot, you'll see it on the corner of the building.
[03:40:17.518 --> 03:40:18.660]  Poof of smoke right there.
[03:40:18.660 --> 03:40:19.221]  One shot.
[03:40:19.221 --> 03:40:20.482]  He ducks.
[03:40:20.482 --> 03:40:22.945]  Dramatic firefight.
[03:40:22.945 --> 03:40:24.307]  Well, maybe it is dramatic.
[03:40:24.307 --> 03:40:27.572]  It might be dramatic for them because they're not used to seeing the...
[03:40:28.904 --> 03:40:35.649]  The guy also makes a note that every one of these cops in Brussels is now in a full face mask.
[03:40:35.649 --> 03:40:35.890]  Yeah.
[03:40:35.890 --> 03:40:39.312]  Which you see, you know, only when they're conducting SWAT raids, not when they're out guarding people.
[03:40:39.312 --> 03:40:43.876]  And now we have shots of police officers in the United States covering their faces.
[03:40:43.876 --> 03:40:46.618]  The incompetent TSA is now the Viper team.
[03:40:46.618 --> 03:40:52.563]  Yeah, and it's just amazing that, so I thought that was pretty interesting and that I think coincides with this
[03:40:53.263 --> 03:40:55.164]  This individual, the luckiest guy in the world.
[03:40:55.164 --> 03:40:56.945]  The luckiest, unluckiest guy in the world.
[03:40:56.945 --> 03:41:03.188]  Yeah, I mean, he's in three different terror attacks in three different countries and survives all three.
[03:41:03.188 --> 03:41:03.768]  Yes.
[03:41:03.768 --> 03:41:04.469]  Amazing.
[03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:07.010]  Yeah, well it was his third brush with terror.
[03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:11.792]  American Mormon, 19, left with burns and shrapnel injuries in Brussels attack.
[03:41:11.792 --> 03:41:15.414]  He also survived Boston and Paris bombings.
[03:41:15.414 --> 03:41:18.676]  Now, to be clear, he was in Paris at the same time.
[03:41:18.676 --> 03:41:19.316]  I don't think he was
[03:41:19.936 --> 03:41:24.819]  At the Bataclan or anywhere where those, you know, he wasn't at the stadium or anything like that.
[03:41:24.819 --> 03:41:31.903]  However, he was a block away from the Boston Marathon bombings and then here he's got burns and shrapnel injuries.
[03:41:31.903 --> 03:41:32.904]  Who is this guy?
[03:41:32.904 --> 03:41:35.245]  He's the superhuman terrorist survivor.
[03:41:35.245 --> 03:41:40.088]  I mean, I don't know what the odds are to be in the area of three different terror attacks.
[03:41:40.088 --> 03:41:40.448]  No, I mean.
[03:41:40.448 --> 03:41:41.148]  Several years apart.
[03:41:41.148 --> 03:41:46.492]  Yeah, he's either the luckiest guy or I would never want to actually ever go on a vacation with this person ever.
[03:41:46.492 --> 03:41:46.992]  Exactly.
[03:41:46.992 --> 03:41:48.613]  Hey, now let's show, let's show people.
[03:41:49.153 --> 03:41:49.893]  How many people on board?
[03:41:49.893 --> 03:41:50.034]  Me?
[03:41:50.034 --> 03:41:50.674]  You're a citizen.
[03:41:50.674 --> 03:41:52.295]  Yeah, but does it really matter?
[03:42:20.820 --> 03:42:29.168]  Tennessee is now the first state ever to work with the TSA to deploy a simultaneous counter-terrorism operation statewide.
[03:42:29.168 --> 03:42:39.597]  You know, this was a massive operation, really bringing all federal, state, and local agencies together to not only do random searches, but also create an army of agents on wheels.
[03:42:39.597 --> 03:42:44.041]  You're probably used to seeing these signature blue uniforms at the airport.
[03:42:46.402 --> 03:42:55.525]  But now, TSA agents are on the interstates fighting terrorism with visible intermodal intervention and response, or VIPER operations.
[03:42:55.525 --> 03:42:58.026]  Look at that.
[03:42:58.026 --> 03:43:00.607]  All across the state.
[03:43:00.607 --> 03:43:02.468]  That's a dry run.
[03:43:02.468 --> 03:43:03.368]  That is what they're doing.
[03:43:03.368 --> 03:43:08.510]  They're preparing for when an attack happens, which didn't even happen in our country yet.
[03:43:09.110 --> 03:43:10.751]  They're going to pull out all the security.
[03:43:10.751 --> 03:43:16.917]  But what's the most unsecure place in the airport is the entrances where they have everybody crammed in going through this TSA security.
[03:43:16.917 --> 03:43:17.137]  Right.
[03:43:17.137 --> 03:43:18.999]  And we've been saying that for years.
[03:43:18.999 --> 03:43:28.147]  And so now, of course, since this happened in Brussels, just the way that we described, that's what's that now they're saying Wolf Blitzer is asking, well, how far would you go?
[03:43:28.147 --> 03:43:32.070]  And do we need to put the TSA now out into the
[03:43:33.109 --> 03:43:33.789]  Driveway there.
[03:43:33.789 --> 03:43:34.750]  Should we have them in our houses?
[03:43:34.750 --> 03:43:37.471]  Should we have them in our toilet areas?
[03:43:37.471 --> 03:43:39.192]  The Toilet Inspection Agency.
[03:43:39.192 --> 03:43:50.018]  Yeah, we need to give them 24-hour access to our cameras and they'll have just a TSA base where they can just check in whenever they want to make sure that we're safe.
[03:43:50.018 --> 03:43:52.439]  And that's, you know, it is for our safety and security.
[03:43:52.679 --> 03:43:54.321]  Totally, totally uncalled for.
[03:43:54.321 --> 03:44:02.829]  Hey, before we get to that video that you were showing, I did get a tweet from a guy, DB, who was asking about this one-minute piece that I put on the air this morning.
[03:44:02.829 --> 03:44:04.731]  This is from Hope Girl blog.
[03:44:04.731 --> 03:44:07.674]  Gardasil vaccine becomes international scandal.
[03:44:07.674 --> 03:44:09.356]  And it's talking about two quotes.
[03:44:09.356 --> 03:44:10.777]  I'll read the first one.
[03:44:10.777 --> 03:44:13.300]  I predict Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all time.
[03:44:14.020 --> 03:44:30.884]  Of all times, because at some point in time the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[03:44:30.884 --> 03:44:31.304]  Right.
[03:44:31.304 --> 03:44:35.445]  And that was a former industry physician who worked for Merck.
[03:44:36.105 --> 03:44:38.846]  And who made the HPV vaccine Gardasil.
[03:44:38.846 --> 03:44:39.966]  He said that back in 2014.
[03:44:39.966 --> 03:44:50.208]  And then we had a Dr. Sinhang Lee, who also back in 2014 examined a little girl who died six months after receiving the Gardasil vaccine.
[03:44:50.208 --> 03:44:59.610]  And he found DNA fragments from the viral gene that had coalesced with the aluminum that's in the vaccine and kind of were just sitting in there.
[03:44:59.610 --> 03:45:02.091]  And he believes they caused a lethal shock.
[03:45:04.111 --> 03:45:08.732]  These being inside her brain caused a lethal shock and then caused her to die.
[03:45:08.732 --> 03:45:14.053]  So that's from Hope Girl blog, Gardasil vaccine becomes international scandal.
[03:45:14.053 --> 03:45:15.614]  Stories like this really need to get out.
[03:45:15.614 --> 03:45:16.454]  They really do.
[03:45:16.454 --> 03:45:26.616]  And the fact that the way that they educate people on this, it actually ups your odds of getting all the other different kinds of cervical cancer that are out there because it's only one or two strains that it affects.
[03:45:27.396 --> 03:45:33.662]  And if your body is healthy, for the most part, your immune system is able to clear that out, especially with regular checkups.
[03:45:33.662 --> 03:45:36.785]  This is just a dangerous vaccine and it's not necessary.
[03:45:36.785 --> 03:45:40.109]  That Rick Perry tried to ram down everybody's throat and say it was mandatory.
[03:45:40.109 --> 03:45:41.410]  We can't forget that.
[03:45:41.410 --> 03:45:43.412]  So, this is the United States.
[03:45:43.412 --> 03:45:49.097]  We've shown video of little villages in Mexico where schoolgirls are writhing on the floor having convulsions.
[03:45:50.330 --> 03:45:55.972]  Twenty girls at a time are having convulsions after getting this, and the people on camera are going, we don't know what's going on.
[03:45:55.972 --> 03:45:57.733]  Nobody will help us.
[03:45:57.733 --> 03:46:00.834]  And they just keep saying, take the vaccine, it's safe and effective, safe and effective.
[03:46:00.834 --> 03:46:06.496]  And then I had to debate that clown from The Young Turks, who's just like, well, some vaccines should be mandatory.
[03:46:07.156 --> 03:46:08.117]  Yeah.
[03:46:08.117 --> 03:46:08.697]  Okay.
[03:46:08.697 --> 03:46:10.479]  Well, you sound like a conspiracy theorist.
[03:46:10.479 --> 03:46:11.720]  Yeah, I know.
[03:46:11.720 --> 03:46:14.663]  So, talking about another conspiracy theory.
[03:46:14.663 --> 03:46:24.892]  So, there's this new program out, and we've seen all these face-swapping apps, like if you're on Snapchat, they have where you can face-swap with people.
[03:46:24.892 --> 03:46:29.576]  And now there's a face-swapping technology called Face-to-Face.
[03:46:29.576 --> 03:46:33.920]  And if you guys can go ahead and roll the B-roll for those of us who are, if you're listening
[03:46:34.600 --> 03:46:39.843]  Watching us on the live stream, you can see this video that's up there, but it's face-to-face.
[03:46:39.843 --> 03:47:01.096]  It requires only target footage, which in this case, they're using footage of George W. Bush or Vladimir Putin, so they can take an actor or video from a news broadcast, and then there's an actor who, on the side, it records their face, and so that actor is able to say whatever they want
[03:47:01.656 --> 03:47:01.816]  I don't
[03:47:19.289 --> 03:47:27.432]  And then somebody releases it out there, and then it becomes news through Twitter, and before people have any time to realize it's a hoax, it's done.
[03:47:27.432 --> 03:47:32.614]  People would have to go back and actually find the original clip and go, no, here's what he actually said, this is something else.
[03:47:32.614 --> 03:47:37.055]  Now they're saying, oh, it's just a university research project at this point.
[03:47:37.055 --> 03:47:40.596]  A university, why are they, why?
[03:47:40.596 --> 03:47:48.079]  There's nothing about this that you would want to use it for other than some sort of nefarious project blue beam type thing.
[03:47:49.008 --> 03:47:52.210]  Yeah, or just create fake news, which we've seen the CIA do.
[03:47:52.210 --> 03:47:53.712]  Now they can do it on American soil.
[03:47:53.712 --> 03:47:57.915]  Those laws have been lifted where they can just go and do whatever they want.
[03:47:57.915 --> 03:48:02.338]  And you think this university has this technology and nobody else has it.
[03:48:02.338 --> 03:48:02.678]  Right.
[03:48:02.678 --> 03:48:05.100]  Sadly, sadly, sadly mistaken.
[03:48:05.100 --> 03:48:08.062]  I mean, this is just what they are showing us.
[03:48:08.062 --> 03:48:08.323]  Right.
[03:48:08.323 --> 03:48:11.965]  And so obviously this kind of technology already exists.
[03:48:11.965 --> 03:48:13.366]  The things are already out there.
[03:48:13.366 --> 03:48:16.148]  So just be aware that you really do have to
[03:48:17.069 --> 03:48:18.990]  Be conscious of what they're showing you.
[03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:27.554]  I mean, we've seen the videos with the crisis actors or where they're running the drills and it looks just like the real thing.
[03:48:27.554 --> 03:48:33.737]  So if all you saw on the news broadcast was images of the drill, you would think it was really happening.
[03:48:33.837 --> 03:48:35.357]  And you'd never know.
[03:48:35.357 --> 03:48:38.078]  And so this is a real thing that's out there.
[03:48:38.078 --> 03:48:45.160]  There he is speaking on behalf of Vladimir Putin, who could be declaring war against the United States.
[03:48:45.160 --> 03:48:47.981]  So then the United States has to retaliate and nuke Russia.
[03:48:47.981 --> 03:48:50.742]  And they can say, well look, we saw it there on the video.
[03:48:50.742 --> 03:48:51.622]  We saw it on YouTube.
[03:48:51.622 --> 03:48:52.802]  Yeah, we saw it on the YouTube.
[03:48:52.802 --> 03:48:56.263]  I mean, that's where Obama says he doesn't even know with his administration.
[03:48:56.263 --> 03:49:01.065]  He just gets all of his understanding from the news and internet.
[03:49:02.935 --> 03:49:08.617]  Totally, totally bizarre, but if you think that is the height of the technology, sadly mistaken.
[03:49:08.617 --> 03:49:22.941]  Somebody probably got a piece of code, brought it to a university, and said, hey, you guys play with it, see what else you can come up with, and then they're using it as a testing ground to have it be augmented more, because a lot of government people, they get in these areas and they're not able to
[03:49:23.740 --> 03:49:27.542]  Really take projects to the very end, either by lack of funding or something else.
[03:49:27.542 --> 03:49:28.883]  So they do it through the university system.
[03:49:28.883 --> 03:49:29.163]  Right.
[03:49:29.163 --> 03:49:40.870]  Well, imagine what they're... I mean, if this is just some university research, imagine what's going on with DARPA and all these others, where they go to invite all the technology entrepreneurs to come join us.
[03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:42.411]  We need your help.
[03:49:42.411 --> 03:49:45.533]  What did you think of what was going on in Utah?
[03:49:45.533 --> 03:49:48.295]  Like, Ted Cruz had a huge victory in Utah.
[03:49:48.295 --> 03:49:50.956]  That was where the Soros counting machines were.
[03:49:50.956 --> 03:49:51.536]  Right.
[03:49:53.021 --> 03:49:56.662]  Although, in all fairness, Donald Trump did have a very small rally in Salt Lake City.
[03:49:56.662 --> 03:50:10.565]  It wasn't like one of his bigger rallies, but do you think there was any... Well, I mean, it's just kind of odd that we have all of the elite... No, it doesn't make any sense if you look at the rest of what's going on in the nation, but let's not forget we've got Mitt Romney, right?
[03:50:10.565 --> 03:50:17.207]  The Mormon coming out of there, but then that was where the establishment had their big meeting in Utah of how we've all got to take down Trump.
[03:50:17.927 --> 03:50:18.287]  Right?
[03:50:18.287 --> 03:50:19.407]  I mean, that was a little odd.
[03:50:19.407 --> 03:50:27.789]  Why is Utah all of a sudden in the news and all these different places with all these establishment leaders meeting there talking about how we have to take down Trump?
[03:50:27.789 --> 03:50:41.692]  And then all of a sudden the guy, the GOP head there in Utah comes up with this new technology, this brand new website affiliated with George Soros to give voters ease their access to voting by going online with their votes.
[03:50:41.932 --> 03:50:46.236]  Meanwhile, there were super long lines in parts of Arizona where they just cut out a lot of polling places.
[03:50:46.236 --> 03:50:48.498]  So, definitely chicanery going on.
[03:50:48.498 --> 03:50:49.519]  It's nothing new.
[03:50:49.519 --> 03:50:49.819]  All right.
[03:50:49.819 --> 03:50:50.519]  Well, stick around.
[03:50:50.519 --> 03:50:51.520]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:51.520 --> 03:50:53.142]  We'll be taking some calls.
[03:50:59.471 --> 03:51:01.452]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:01.452 --> 03:51:06.435]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:06.435 --> 03:51:10.437]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:10.437 --> 03:51:11.998]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:11.998 --> 03:51:15.900]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:15.900 --> 03:51:20.662]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:20.662 --> 03:51:21.503]  He waited too long.
[03:51:21.923 --> 03:51:25.284]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:25.284 --> 03:51:26.184]  What did I do?
[03:51:26.184 --> 03:51:33.627]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite, made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.

[03:53:56.836 --> 03:53:57.576]  Effective.
[03:54:06.733 --> 03:54:08.614]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:54:08.614 --> 03:54:11.435]  We are here wrapping up the fourth Overdrive Hour.
[03:54:11.435 --> 03:54:14.716]  I'm your host, Leigh Ann McAdoo, joined by Rob Dew.
[03:54:14.716 --> 03:54:18.718]  Now, before I go to one of your calls, I'm going to take a phone call from Ozzy here in Texas.
[03:54:18.718 --> 03:54:23.140]  I wanted to first say thank you to one of our Info Warriors out there, Nora Claypool.
[03:54:23.140 --> 03:54:26.461]  She sent me a huge box of handmade jewelry, and it's awesome.
[03:54:26.461 --> 03:54:30.863]  I'm going to be wearing it forever, so I just wanted to give you a shout out to say thank you so much.
[03:54:30.863 --> 03:54:34.745]  And then Kit Daniels brought this in during the break.
[03:54:35.305 --> 03:54:39.666]  Insider Cruz campaign encouraged Utah voters to break the law.
[03:54:39.666 --> 03:54:45.028]  So the day before these elections, the caucus was being held in Utah.
[03:54:45.028 --> 03:54:50.530]  They encouraged absentee voters to slip in their ballots without proper documentation.
[03:54:52.330 --> 03:54:56.273]  Utah, their voters can't decide to vote absentee the day before.
[03:54:56.273 --> 03:54:58.734]  They have to print off a ballot.
[03:54:58.734 --> 03:55:03.717]  They have to get it all kind of shored up the Thursday before the primaries.
[03:55:03.717 --> 03:55:08.840]  They can't just go and say, oh, well, I printed it off from the new website, utah.gop.
[03:55:08.840 --> 03:55:11.001]  Now I'm going to vote absentee.
[03:55:11.001 --> 03:55:13.823]  So again, lying Ted Cruz.
[03:55:13.823 --> 03:55:15.404]  Mr. Gambini, what is a ute?
[03:55:17.705 --> 03:55:22.707]  Well, let's go ahead and very quickly take this phone call from Ozzie in Texas.
[03:55:22.707 --> 03:55:26.749]  You wanted to talk about terrorist attacks in the USA.
[03:55:26.749 --> 03:55:27.429]  Yes, Leanne.
[03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:28.349]  Am I on air now?
[03:55:28.349 --> 03:55:31.051]  Yes, go ahead and real quick.
[03:55:31.051 --> 03:55:32.231]  Yeah, awesome.
[03:55:32.231 --> 03:55:35.692]  I emailed you on a private message.
[03:55:35.692 --> 03:55:46.697]  I don't know if you have read it, but I just wanted to make a comment that you can make a connection between Islam and Freemasonry.
[03:55:49.182 --> 03:56:05.333]  Basically, if you remember the Shriners, this group of fundraisers and... I think there's an ISIS commander that was made a Mason, who was telling me that it was the guy we talked to in Italy.
[03:56:05.333 --> 03:56:06.934]  I can't think of his name right now.
[03:56:06.934 --> 03:56:08.555]  This is it.
[03:56:08.555 --> 03:56:13.759]  In order for you to become a Shriner, you have to be a 33rd degree Freemason.
[03:56:14.602 --> 03:56:18.966]  And when you search, nobody has looked into it.
[03:56:18.966 --> 03:56:25.631]  But when you look at the Shriners, they call themselves the Ancient Arabic Order of Something.
[03:56:25.631 --> 03:56:30.855]  And it's a very extreme version of Islam, anti-Christian.
[03:56:30.855 --> 03:56:42.305]  So it makes a lot of sense that our leaders, that are Freemasons, are basically turning us over into Islam, which is, you know, what the Shriners stand for.
[03:56:43.220 --> 03:56:43.841]  Hmm.
[03:56:43.841 --> 03:56:49.447]  Well, Ozzy, that is very interesting because, I mean, we're all kind of sitting back going, what in the heck is happening?
[03:56:49.447 --> 03:56:52.910]  How come they're destroying Christianity, but then you can't... Look at the symbol.
[03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:56.454]  You can't in any way criticize Islam or something.
[03:56:56.454 --> 03:56:58.396]  So, Ozzy, thank you for your point.
[03:56:58.396 --> 03:57:03.462]  I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that are going to take that and do some further digging and investigating.
[03:57:04.162 --> 03:57:07.763]  And yeah, I do think there's going to have some sort of attack here.
[03:57:07.763 --> 03:57:11.865]  I knew there was going to be some sort of attack here with this election.
[03:57:11.865 --> 03:57:20.067]  Of course, they would have to ramp up the terror in order to control people and enhance that surveillance state as well.
[03:57:20.067 --> 03:57:21.528]  What do you think?
[03:57:21.528 --> 03:57:23.269]  I think let's go to Ray and see what he has to say.
[03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:25.529]  He's talking about a false flag in 2016.
[03:57:25.529 --> 03:57:26.810]  Okay, very quickly, Ray.
[03:57:26.810 --> 03:57:27.470]  Go ahead, Ray.
[03:57:27.470 --> 03:57:28.830]  Make it quick.
[03:57:28.830 --> 03:57:29.611]  How are you guys doing?
[03:57:31.112 --> 03:57:37.594]  I was watching an episode of Alex Jones talking about how somebody was going to blow up the Fierce Tower here in Chicago in 2015.
[03:57:37.594 --> 03:57:40.495]  Now it's 2016, so I'm still wondering.
[03:57:40.495 --> 03:57:43.776]  I'm kind of scared, you know, the things that happen in France, you know, it might happen here too.
[03:57:43.776 --> 03:57:46.757]  So what's the deal with the Fierce Tower getting blown up?
[03:57:46.757 --> 03:57:47.978]  Well, I'll tell you a story.
[03:57:47.978 --> 03:57:59.642]  When I was in Chicago back in 2010, I believe it was, we were covering a terror drill that was going on there with the National Guard, Operation Vigilant Guard, where we showed them working with the Boy Scouts as terror victims.
[03:58:00.502 --> 03:58:07.229]  I went to try to film this area underneath the Sears Tower where there's some roads, and a security guy came down and said, what are you doing down here?
[03:58:07.229 --> 03:58:08.330]  You can't be down here with a camera.
[03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:15.498]  I thought that was pretty odd, considering everywhere else in Chicago I was allowed to walk around with a camera, but just that one little spot, I wasn't.
[03:58:16.479 --> 03:58:17.360]  I thought that was pretty good.
[03:58:17.360 --> 03:58:20.103]  I mean obviously monuments and crowds, stadiums.
[03:58:20.103 --> 03:58:24.267]  They've been warning about this for quite some time that these are going to be the soft targets.
[03:58:24.267 --> 03:58:26.629]  If you see something, shoot video of it and put it on YouTube.
[03:58:26.629 --> 03:58:30.873]  Don't necessarily say something to Homeland Security because they may or may not be involved.
[03:58:30.873 --> 03:58:34.237]  All right, well tune in to the InfoWars Nightly News tonight at 7 p.m.
[03:58:34.237 --> 03:58:36.119]  Central with your host Sha'Carri Jackson.
