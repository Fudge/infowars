[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:34.040]  it's Wednesday the 23rd day of March 2016 I'm Alex Jones your host will be
[00:34.040 --> 00:38.240]  here for the next four hours have another big broadcast wind up for you
[00:38.240 --> 00:44.320]  obviously Larry Nichols has big intel on the race war Obama's trying to
[00:44.320 --> 00:51.800]  basically stage slash class war and he's been predicting if the last year he's
[00:51.800 --> 00:55.440]  out of the hospital he's gonna be joining us for 30 minutes the first half
[00:55.440 --> 01:01.720]  of the next hour dr. Kelly Ward who is beating John McCain three five eight and
[01:01.720 --> 01:09.280]  even ten points and scientific polls there in Arizona she will be joining us
[01:09.280 --> 01:18.080]  to talk about Obamacare the selection and more Leanne McAdub he is going to be
[01:18.080 --> 01:26.080]  popping in on the broadcast as well twice today wants to talk about some of
[01:26.080 --> 01:29.800]  their experiences here at the info war but also I want to get her in because I
[01:29.800 --> 01:34.600]  saw her about an hour ago 45 minutes ago or so back in the office and she was
[01:34.600 --> 01:42.080]  saying as you see what Donald Trump was talking about last night on CNN and I
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.600]  went and actually we're getting the transcript and I specifically went and
[01:46.600 --> 01:49.600]  looked it up we've got the video clip talking about all the surveillance all
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.080]  the police state to keep us safe and how great that's all gonna be here's my
[01:55.080 --> 02:01.960]  problem if we're going to make America great again America has to be free
[02:01.960 --> 02:05.920]  again and I think Donald Trump means well he's right about the trade deals the
[02:05.920 --> 02:11.080]  globalist hating for real reasons but we need to influence Trump to understand
[02:11.080 --> 02:15.720]  they have plenty of surveillance the FBI knew two years before who the San
[02:15.720 --> 02:20.920]  Bernardino shooters were and were ordered to stand down now I've called the
[02:20.920 --> 02:26.800]  situation over in Brussels a false flag it's a real terrorist attack probably
[02:26.800 --> 02:30.000]  there's real Islamic terror but who brought them in who protected them if you
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.760]  open the door and you're part of it then it's a stage government event even if
[02:34.760 --> 02:41.400]  there's real actors but probably a better word is a stand down is probably
[02:41.400 --> 02:45.720]  better than a false flag I saw a big debate in a video I shot for Facebook
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.040]  mentions about whether it was a false flag or not most people agreed you could
[02:49.040 --> 02:53.280]  call it that but really it'd be better to call it a stand down let it happen
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.560]  which is just as bad the point is they're bringing these people in unvetted
[02:58.560 --> 03:03.760]  and then acting like Donald Trump has 14 heads and then he's from Mars when he
[03:03.760 --> 03:08.920]  says we should just have basic border security so I like Donald Trump and I
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.160]  want to support him but man you know this whole thing I told you months ago
[03:14.160 --> 03:19.640]  the FBI can get into iPhones and it was in the news Sunday and Monday oh Fox
[03:19.640 --> 03:23.360]  News broke it guess what they were already in the iPhone they have ways to
[03:23.360 --> 03:27.960]  get around it I've talked to tech people it's not even that hard especially with
[03:27.960 --> 03:33.040]  an older version iPhones are harder than droids but it can be done and it's
[03:33.040 --> 03:38.680]  it's it's it's not even close to super hard and that's now confirmed again you
[03:38.680 --> 03:44.040]  heard it here first now separate that though I've got my concerns about Trump
[03:44.040 --> 03:52.800]  but man Ted Cruz Goldman Sachs CFR work for Bush senior his wife helped
[03:52.800 --> 03:59.040]  poncho TPP in a U and he said it here last Wednesday and it now came through
[03:59.040 --> 04:05.840]  last night and this morning Jeb Bush as bad as it gets mr. New World order
[04:05.840 --> 04:16.040]  himself has now endorsed Ted Cruz Ted Cruz is supported in essay spying speaks
[04:16.040 --> 04:20.680]  out against it but supports it see it's kind of refreshing to have Trump running
[04:20.680 --> 04:24.640]  around saying it's a great idea even though I disagree with him at least in
[04:24.640 --> 04:30.760]  his mind he thinks you know stop the terrorist but this is really really
[04:30.760 --> 04:35.640]  another nail in the political coffin in my view of Ted Cruz I mean I can just see
[04:35.640 --> 04:40.240]  him getting into the presidency and then George W. Bush was like against
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.040]  interventionism and pro gun and all the stuff till he got into the White House
[04:44.040 --> 04:47.120]  and then all that went by the wayside we're gonna open the phones up get your
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.680]  take on this as well the latest on the terror attacks over in Brussels Belgium
[04:51.680 --> 04:57.920]  and more hey did you know that one American was at all three bombings I
[04:57.920 --> 05:02.400]  predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times
[05:02.400 --> 05:05.760]  because at some point in time the evidence will add up to prove that this
[05:05.760 --> 05:10.240]  vaccine technical and scientific feat that it may be has absolutely no effect
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.520]  on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which destroyed
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.320]  lives and even kill serve no other purpose other than to generate profit
[05:18.320 --> 05:22.320]  for the manufacturers that was a statement made in April 2014 by a
[05:22.320 --> 05:26.120]  French medical doctor Bernard Delberg he's a former pharmaceutical industry
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.440]  physician with Merck the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine Gardasil and now almost
[05:30.440 --> 05:34.200]  two years later Dr. Singh Hang Lee director of the Milford Molecular
[05:34.200 --> 05:37.720]  Diagnostics Laboratory in Connecticut has proved these predictions correct he
[05:37.720 --> 05:41.040]  published a letter sent to the US CDC the World Health Organization and the
[05:41.040 --> 05:44.720]  Ministry of Health in Japan and others documenting scientific misconduct
[05:44.720 --> 05:47.640]  among the world's leading health organizations tasked with providing
[05:47.640 --> 05:51.200]  vaccine safety by deliberately misleading Japanese health authorities on

[08:09.620 --> 08:15.880]  America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to the
[08:15.880 --> 08:23.920]  Alex Jones show that's right ladies and gentlemen freedom is what generates
[08:23.920 --> 08:30.880]  wealth and is what generates rates from the Montana and Scarface says first you
[08:30.880 --> 08:37.480]  get the money then you get the power then you get the woman well that's not
[08:37.480 --> 08:44.640]  really my experience first you get the freedom then you get the greatness then
[08:44.640 --> 08:50.360]  you get the civilization the problem is then you get the corruption and the
[08:50.360 --> 08:56.680]  decadence that sets in from a great nation a great society a wealthy power
[08:56.680 --> 09:04.080]  but even before freedom comes honor even before we can make America free again
[09:04.080 --> 09:09.440]  we must make America honorable again I know so many people that think lying and
[09:09.440 --> 09:15.560]  twisting and engaging in disinformation is what gives them power to rule over
[09:15.560 --> 09:22.080]  and con ignorant people that is the blood that is the ether that is the
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.080]  atmosphere of oppression and enslavement and it will ultimately bring down the
[09:28.080 --> 09:34.160]  very parasites that use it to come to power it is the plague it is anathema
[09:34.160 --> 09:43.520]  it is a total and complete fraud I have a hat that I wear out in public only to
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.800]  condition the brainwashed politically correct folks in liberal areas of
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.720]  Austin Texas it's a camouflage hat make America great again that I got from the
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.240]  Donald Trump website my son likes to wear the red one that says that has an
[09:57.240 --> 10:02.680]  American flag on the side no Trump's not a sponsor I'm just making a point here
[10:02.680 --> 10:09.240]  my older daughter also likes Trump and wears Trump t-shirts that's their choice
[10:09.240 --> 10:13.000]  and I say don't completely trust Trump you know he could have some problems he
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.040]  could turn around and bite us in the rear end but I still wear it so that
[10:18.040 --> 10:23.600]  people can ridicule me I don't wear it in conservative areas I wear it so my
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.480]  children can watch me not care when trendies get upset by something so they
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.360]  can learn that what matters is what's going on inside of you that you know is
[10:32.360 --> 10:38.120]  right from your own research and your own history not what jellyfish thing but I
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.840]  will say this I'm backing Trump because the establishments care to death of him
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.280]  and he's right on maybe seven out of ten major issues he's wrong on surveillance
[10:49.280 --> 10:55.400]  he's wrong on police state he is wrong on things like torture and he's
[10:55.400 --> 11:01.240]  reversing self-on-torture partially on the surveillance I told everybody months
[11:01.240 --> 11:05.160]  ago because it's known that they have a backdoor not through the front-end
[11:05.160 --> 11:10.840]  encryption but to break in to the hardware and the hard drive of the
[11:10.840 --> 11:17.040]  iPhone especially if it's an older version it's easy if it's an older
[11:17.040 --> 11:20.280]  version it's harder if it's brand-new that's why they're always updating it
[11:20.280 --> 11:25.760]  they've gone to a six-digit code if you're not using the thumbprint
[11:25.760 --> 11:32.240]  apples are some of the best it's a closed system obviously a very evil
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.080]  company but I'm stating the securities better I'm not an IT person I just read
[11:36.080 --> 11:41.000]  the top reviews I've experienced it myself and they came out the last two
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.360]  days and admitted the news okay the FBI actually did get in the phone okay they
[11:45.360 --> 11:49.920]  do have a backdoor into it and not just through the hardware or software the
[11:49.920 --> 11:55.400]  apps most the big ubiquitous top apps it's come out have backroom deals with
[11:55.400 --> 12:05.200]  major governments and Interpol to have backdoors through the app just like
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.040]  hackers get into iPhones all the time and get into the cloud and you name it
[12:10.040 --> 12:13.440]  they can get into your phone through the cloud they can get into it through
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.640]  Spotify they can get in through it through websites it's ridiculous to have
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.360]  the FBI claim that they couldn't get into it and within a week Apple came out
[12:23.360 --> 12:27.280]  and said okay we remotely access the phone the FBI is already in it it's
[12:27.280 --> 12:36.760]  total bull okay and I just want to point out we told you again first because we
[12:36.760 --> 12:41.840]  know what we're talking about I'm not bragging we've reverse engineered it we
[12:41.840 --> 12:49.440]  understand it now that said it's legal and lawful to have the NSA spying on
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.120]  targets overseas it's its job I've had William Benny the top living code
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.400]  breaker top mathematician fourth and fifth dimensional thinker and I've had
[12:59.400 --> 13:02.280]  two three-hour dinners with him talk about amazing didn't tell me anything
[13:02.280 --> 13:09.600]  secret he just talked about quantum mechanics and mathematical overlays and
[13:09.600 --> 13:17.960]  things like fourth dimensional holograms I'm not bragging he couldn't believe
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.400]  because I hadn't even read this in science books I was sitting there talking
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.280]  to him right there in front of some of the crew that went at a steakhouse and I
[13:28.280 --> 13:33.320]  was talking about in mathematics how scientists a hundred years ago predicted
[13:33.320 --> 13:38.840]  that when a probe finally flew over Saturn interdimensional forces of a gas
[13:38.840 --> 13:45.920]  giant that size would manifest structural codes on the surface of the gas
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.480]  giant at the poles and would manifest a hexagon now I didn't envision that they
[13:51.480 --> 13:56.280]  envisioned it a hundred years ago and sure enough when the first probes was it
[13:56.280 --> 14:02.880]  Voyager flew over it there was the interdimensional manifestation and I
[14:02.880 --> 14:06.240]  said let me guess is that how you break some of these really supposedly
[14:06.240 --> 14:10.640]  impossible to break codes is an interdimensional shadow and he said that's
[14:10.640 --> 14:14.800]  he goes how do you know that that's that's incredibly classified and I said
[14:14.800 --> 14:19.160]  but it's actually out there in mainline literature and my dad five or six years
[14:19.160 --> 14:23.560]  ago said you watch it's gonna be holograms and interdimensional shadows I
[14:23.560 --> 14:26.840]  said how do you know that he said oh I just read scientific publications so the
[14:26.840 --> 14:32.400]  truth is it's just there's nothing really hidden and even someone like William
[14:32.400 --> 14:35.520]  Benny doesn't know that that knowledge is actually already out there in the
[14:35.520 --> 14:39.920]  general public there's not much that isn't out there okay there isn't much
[14:39.920 --> 14:44.280]  that's out there and they can have White House run publications make fun of me
[14:44.280 --> 14:47.600]  when I make statements like that and things that's fine because that's for
[14:47.600 --> 14:50.840]  their idiot audience that are pseudo-intellectuals and think they know
[14:50.840 --> 14:55.760]  everything the reason I talk about our bona fides and the fact that we know so
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.560]  much is because people need to understand we're not playing games here we
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.480]  mean to defeat the globalist we mean to study the enemy and expose their
[15:04.480 --> 15:09.680]  operations and save human sovereignty I want it for myself and my family if I'm
[15:09.680 --> 15:15.320]  gonna get it means you need to get it too we're in this together I absolutely
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.160]  care about everybody and not because I'm some sap but because I'm a man and
[15:19.160 --> 15:23.720]  because I am a warrior when it comes down to being a warrior that means
[15:23.720 --> 15:27.840]  raising strong kids standing up for the culture and being the best most honest
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.720]  person I can be not because I'm Mr. Goodie two shoes but because I understand
[15:32.720 --> 15:37.760]  that's what builds a safe and good society all you cheaters and crooks and
[15:37.760 --> 15:42.120]  the rest of you that think being dirty so cool you're nothing but chumps lying
[15:42.120 --> 15:52.040]  to yourselves and I'm sick of you now that said I've got some issues with
[15:52.040 --> 15:54.080]  Donald Trump this police state statements we're gonna talk about at the
[15:54.080 --> 16:00.400]  bottom of the hammer play some clips we have another clip from Roger Stone the
[16:00.400 --> 16:06.640]  consummate Trump insider last week with us what last Wednesday was it all look
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.600]  the date we play the video and he said you watch Jeb Bush will endorse him the
[16:11.600 --> 16:18.880]  next few weeks Jeb Bush has now endorsed not Donald Trump of course but as he
[16:18.880 --> 16:24.920]  predicted Ted Cruz and that is a big blow confirming he was a bush sleeper
[16:24.920 --> 16:35.880]  sell we thought it was really bad news when we saw Marvin Bush take over his
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.280]  financing of his campaign we thought it was bad news his wife was CFR and ran
[16:40.280 --> 16:44.520]  and commanded the TPP ram through when it was first being written four years
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.400]  ago we thought all of that was bad the Goldman Sachs connection but let me tell
[16:48.400 --> 16:54.680]  you I would go off his past votes Neil Bush Marvin Bush you name it get
[16:54.680 --> 16:59.160]  involved in his campaign I would take his past votes and say he's pro-second
[16:59.160 --> 17:02.840]  amendment you name it I'm gonna trust him off his four-year record and ignore
[17:02.840 --> 17:08.440]  the previous stuff but having them come in and support them now means I don't
[17:08.440 --> 17:15.160]  trust them at all let's go ahead and go to this Roger Stone clip
[17:15.800 --> 17:20.960]  sure the fact that Donald Trump may have 237 votes the majority and the first
[17:20.960 --> 17:25.480]  ballot is almost irrelevant to the king makers to the party elites look
[17:25.480 --> 17:31.800]  they're petrified and here's why Trump is uncontrollable to them so let's not
[17:31.800 --> 17:36.200]  let's not assume that just because the bosses and the king makers want to
[17:36.200 --> 17:40.920]  steal this that they are going to be successful Trump has the most important
[17:40.920 --> 17:45.960]  power on his side public opinion and as Abraham Lincoln said public opinion in
[17:45.960 --> 17:51.800]  this country is everything the big steal is going to be very difficult for the
[17:51.800 --> 17:57.600]  bosses to carry out it's interesting to me and I predict again George W Bush's
[17:57.600 --> 18:02.320]  clan particularly Jeb Bush will be endorsing Ted Cruz shortly because Ted
[18:02.320 --> 18:07.480]  Cruz is a Bush family retainer Ted Cruz isn't the constitutional conservative
[18:07.480 --> 18:13.320]  you think he is he's a globalist he's backed by Goldman Sachs his wife and he
[18:13.320 --> 18:19.640]  are our minor servants for the Bush family she worked for Condoleezza Rice
[18:19.640 --> 18:23.360]  getting us into the phony Iraq war then she went over and worked for Robert
[18:23.360 --> 18:28.040]  Zellick the US trade representative former president of the World Bank former
[18:28.040 --> 18:30.920]  president of Council on Foreign Relations and now the fellow reserves giving
[18:30.920 --> 18:37.680]  money to him and Hillary but none zero to Donald Trump another incredible
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.280]  endorsement yeah he's Dr. Evil look if you ask me
[18:41.280 --> 18:45.320]  Donald Trump has a long list of thank-you notes that he has to write
[18:45.320 --> 18:49.400]  he's got to send one to the Pope he's got to send one to the Chinese
[18:49.400 --> 18:53.680]  government he's got to send one to Vincente Fox he's got to send one to Mitt
[18:53.680 --> 18:58.480]  Romney and now he's got to send one to the Washington Post all of these attacks
[18:58.480 --> 19:03.680]  are backfiring all they're doing is winning votes for Donald Trump all
[19:03.680 --> 19:07.600]  right we're gonna put the full three and a half minute clip up the next 20
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.200]  minutes to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com because it's one thing
[19:12.200 --> 19:15.760]  to have the Bushes endorse them but it's another thing to have the back story of
[19:15.760 --> 19:22.520]  what this signifies and what this means their Ted Cruz is is a surrogate for the
[19:22.520 --> 19:30.400]  Bushes their name is used up their name is blown they are back and it's even in
[19:30.400 --> 19:37.760]  the national review Ted Cruz the Bush years so I'm sorry Ted Cruz is got his
[19:37.760 --> 19:42.200]  old handlers running him and I don't trust him now I'm done with Ted Cruz
[19:42.200 --> 19:48.920]  that's it and of course Benedict Arnold himself the man that says you're going to
[19:48.920 --> 19:54.160]  hell if you don't vote for Ted Cruz Glenn Beck is for him as well I mean we
[19:54.160 --> 20:00.360]  would be insane to be for Ted Cruz he's super bad news. Something shocking just
[20:00.360 --> 20:04.600]  happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego the old guys in the unit have
[20:04.600 --> 20:08.800]  turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness
[20:08.800 --> 20:13.080]  tests how is this even possible turns out the old guys in this unit have been

[24:55.080 --> 25:00.760]  prisonplanet.com that is amazing Tim Kennedy as high-level special forces as
[25:00.760 --> 25:06.080]  it gets you know the top secret units you name it just stuff that's beyond
[25:06.080 --> 25:12.480]  anything in movies I'm just gonna leave it at that not that I've learned about it
[25:12.480 --> 25:19.200]  from him I've learned about it here and there and other places amazing and he
[25:19.200 --> 25:22.280]  comes out and says the government is letting terror attacks happen to take
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.120]  our freedoms that interview that ten-minute segment of the hour and a
[25:26.120 --> 25:31.040]  half interview is on info wars.com how important is that he comes out and says
[25:31.040 --> 25:40.320]  the video showing him shoot up the car in the truck in Oregon is wrong and that
[25:40.320 --> 25:47.040]  that's not what you do and that he knows the guys that did it and then I'm not
[25:47.040 --> 25:52.320]  at liberty to tell the rest of the story he didn't say what he wouldn't say or
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.880]  would say once he got on air and then he just talked about it on air and
[25:56.880 --> 26:04.080]  understand folks just him coming on air is a big deal because obviously he's been
[26:04.080 --> 26:08.680]  threatened repeatedly last time and this time and of course it's having the
[26:08.680 --> 26:14.080]  opposite effect and he represents basically the general feeling of army
[26:14.080 --> 26:18.520]  special forces I can tell you that and he said that on air wow the most elite
[26:18.520 --> 26:28.680]  of the army on average are as awake as I am or more and are concerned to the point
[26:28.680 --> 26:33.160]  that basically one of their leaders he's pretty much their mascot their leader
[26:33.160 --> 26:37.480]  the guy they look up to comes on this show and tells you that that's not me
[26:37.480 --> 26:41.160]  bragging that's dangerous I was actually sick at my stomach yesterday about that
[26:41.160 --> 26:47.360]  interview for what it signifies the level we've gotten to I feel good about it
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.160]  and I've told you about this kind of stuff for years behind the scenes but
[26:52.160 --> 26:56.840]  this is a real battle for the country people under world government they're
[26:56.840 --> 27:03.160]  bringing in radical Muslims to let them attack us to take our freedoms
[27:03.160 --> 27:08.200]  Tucker Carlson's a smart guy came on and said the left hates the West and just
[27:08.200 --> 27:11.840]  feels sorry for radical Muslims that's why they bring them in yeah grassroots
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.080]  liberals but not the leadership they know full well what they're doing Tim
[27:16.080 --> 27:22.560]  Kennedy's right and there's just tons of powerful info like that on info wars
[27:22.560 --> 27:28.440]  calm right now the Tucker Carlson interview is called why the left loves
[27:28.440 --> 27:32.200]  jihadist and let me tell you something there's all these mainline leftists that
[27:32.200 --> 27:35.080]  mean well out there and I've got some problems with some of the right wing
[27:35.080 --> 27:43.400]  positions as well I'm a libertarian but radical Islam is taking over Islam and
[27:43.400 --> 27:51.120]  it is the most oppressive twisted bizarre hateful bullying bossy arrogant in
[27:51.120 --> 27:59.680]  your face garbage and the elites that we have Google Facebook Microsoft Apple
[27:59.680 --> 28:11.560]  the Democratic Party with the neocons have run turning the most evil cowardly
[28:11.560 --> 28:17.280]  trash you can imagine loose on more than 10 countries our military finally had a
[28:17.280 --> 28:20.960]  breaking point as I told you five years ago when this went operational and they
[28:20.960 --> 28:24.960]  were told to deliver weapons to actual al-qaeda operatives who would shoot their
[28:24.960 --> 28:30.560]  mouths off at them and then I had the whistleblowers on from the Justice
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.080]  Department and the CIA and you name it people always shed whistleblowers
[28:34.080 --> 28:38.040]  whenever speak out oh yes they will they know they get persecuted they know
[28:38.040 --> 28:41.680]  people come after them there's a certain point where people go listen we're not
[28:41.680 --> 28:48.000]  working with al-qaeda you got that and I told you we reached that point four or
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.760]  five years ago and that's a good thing but it's also extremely dangerous to
[28:53.760 --> 28:58.560]  realize that we were right it was worse than we thought and we're really
[28:58.560 --> 29:04.200]  controlled by people this evil and it comes out in the open and none of them
[29:04.200 --> 29:09.880]  are getting in trouble that's the problem yes our military has said no that's
[29:09.880 --> 29:13.000]  why they want to have a civil war because they know local governments are
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.920]  awake a lot of state governments are awake the military's awake a lot of the
[29:16.920 --> 29:22.040]  police are awake so they want a civil war to overthrow the system so bad that
[29:22.040 --> 29:25.800]  government has to become tyrannical just to support civilization and then they
[29:25.800 --> 29:30.920]  think they can control the system at the top that's why they're pushing us into
[29:30.920 --> 29:36.840]  chaos because out of the chaos they want to bring tyranny in just like
[29:36.880 --> 29:44.840]  Tim Kennedy said here yesterday I mean you know that's what it comes down to
[29:44.840 --> 29:50.400]  will you listen to top Delta Force people we're on the march the Empire's on
[29:50.400 --> 29:56.600]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.160 --> 30:02.520]  I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all times
[30:02.520 --> 30:05.720]  because at some point in time the evidence will add up to prove that
[30:05.720 --> 30:10.000]  this vaccine technical and scientific feat that it may be has absolutely no
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.160]  effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which
[30:14.160 --> 30:18.040]  destroyed lives and even kill serve no other purpose other than to generate
[30:18.040 --> 30:22.440]  profit for the manufacturers that was a statement made in April 2014 by a
[30:22.440 --> 30:26.200]  French medical doctor Bernard Delberg he's a former pharmaceutical industry
[30:26.200 --> 30:30.560]  physician with Merck the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine Gardasil and now almost
[30:30.560 --> 30:34.280]  two years later dr. Singh hang Lee director of the Milford molecular
[30:34.280 --> 30:37.840]  diagnostics laboratory in Connecticut has proved these predictions correct he
[30:37.840 --> 30:41.160]  published a letter sent to the US CDC the World Health Organization and the
[30:41.160 --> 30:45.120]  Ministry of Health in Japan and others documenting scientific misconduct among
[30:45.120 --> 30:48.840]  the world's leading health organizations tasked with providing vaccine safety by
[30:48.840 --> 30:52.520]  deliberately misleading Japanese health authorities on the safety of the HPV

[33:52.720 --> 33:56.480]  don't trust the other candidates I'll say that right now but I've got some
[33:56.480 --> 33:59.640]  concerns we're gonna talk to Leigh Ann about some of her concerns she was
[33:59.640 --> 34:02.080]  raising him to me this morning and I was already having him as well so I
[34:02.080 --> 34:08.080]  thought we'd we discuss it briefly though we are listed supported if if people
[34:08.080 --> 34:12.640]  don't buy the products we don't continue on an operate and man sometimes we had a
[34:12.640 --> 34:15.920]  whole bunch of orders of t-shirts books videos water filters and we're doing
[34:15.920 --> 34:19.840]  great and I'm hardly even plug it and then sometimes I'm plugging in people
[34:19.840 --> 34:23.480]  aren't buying anything we won't exist if that you know happens obviously we're
[34:23.480 --> 34:26.920]  doing okay I want to get a few more reporters a couple more camera people
[34:26.920 --> 34:30.200]  so I can have more people out in the field we need to get five or six more
[34:30.200 --> 34:33.960]  people I think we're basically done at that point because you know I've put on

[37:26.920 --> 37:31.160]  video on the liver cleanse page on info warslife.com where you break it down you
[37:31.160 --> 37:33.440]  did the liver and gallbladder cleanse without getting into details here
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.640]  spending too much time what did it do for you guys well it pretty much changed my
[37:37.640 --> 37:40.480]  life I mean we're gonna turn her mic on hold on go ahead and turn her mic on go
[37:40.480 --> 37:46.000]  ahead it pretty much changed my life like it was what I needed to help give me
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.600]  that boost to be able to change my habits because there you have six days
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.240]  where you're kind of my level start over apologize you don't like audio in your
[37:55.240 --> 37:58.320]  ear so they weren't sending me your audio and I apologize to you and the crew
[37:58.320 --> 38:02.680]  that that I've forgotten that that I had no audio sorry start over Leanne well
[38:02.680 --> 38:07.200]  thank you a proper free this is not scripted go ahead well I'm saying the
[38:07.200 --> 38:10.840]  liver cleanse changed my life like it was six days where I had to dedicate
[38:10.840 --> 38:17.200]  myself to resetting my habits and I had to prove to myself that I could avoid the
[38:17.200 --> 38:20.960]  propaganda with the commercials and like I don't even like fast food at all I
[38:20.960 --> 38:23.800]  never eat it but I got to the point where I was like driving and I'm like
[38:23.800 --> 38:28.280]  mmm maybe I should just pull into this fast food place and because it you
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.640]  really truly do have to bypass all of those things in your body that are
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.280]  trying to convince you to just fail fail fail and this was awesome it slimmed
[38:37.280 --> 38:41.160]  me down I have by the way how much weight you lost because you looked really
[38:41.160 --> 38:44.880]  good and you looked young but I'm not kidding you were glowing during it and
[38:44.880 --> 38:49.520]  after and you guys literally look five years younger yeah no it was awesome it
[38:49.520 --> 38:55.280]  like brightened up my skin the thing for me was this little fat pocket in my
[38:55.280 --> 38:58.560]  upper belly that I could just not get rid of I didn't know where it was coming
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.520]  from and that was where it flushed out was right here around my ribs and that
[39:03.520 --> 39:07.480]  you're already right say it hasn't come back and that for me was key what is
[39:07.480 --> 39:10.680]  your friend what did she experience because there's a video about it on the
[39:10.680 --> 39:14.160]  site but just break it down for folks Liam well the same thing with Emmy I
[39:14.160 --> 39:20.040]  mean she was just glowing tons of energy and we you can see she really slimmed
[39:20.040 --> 39:23.480]  down there her her belly was just like whoo you could see all her little how
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.520]  fast that happened that was in six days wow six days do you know as an athlete
[39:28.520 --> 39:32.240]  coaches basketball had a college scholarship in basketball he's not a fat
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.360]  guy at all but he lost 12 pounds in one week just from what was stuck in his
[39:36.360 --> 39:41.800]  guts right right and that's the that's the thing it's like you know everyone
[39:41.800 --> 39:45.080]  has to take care of themselves and take care of their digestive tract and I
[39:45.080 --> 39:47.880]  would just like to point out my after picture
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.440]  Leanne I'm impressed I mean you look right before but you really did lose some
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.880]  tummy fat you can see also under my chin in my face let's put that back up I
[39:55.880 --> 39:59.840]  lost some wow you did lose weight under your chin under my chin and you can see
[39:59.840 --> 40:03.280]  the little like on the before picture you can see there was kind of like that
[40:03.280 --> 40:08.920]  little pudgy thing in the back and it's slimmed down and that was six days that
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.000]  was in six days I'm doing it right now but but I'll be honest it's not hard to
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.520]  do but it is it's not hard you can eat but it is kind of a hassle I mean I
[40:17.520 --> 40:20.360]  kind of got off a little bit yesterday I'm back on it today I just have a
[40:20.360 --> 40:23.960]  problem doing it right well that's the thing that I talked about in this video
[40:23.960 --> 40:27.960]  is that how are you supposed to resist tyranny if you can't even resist the
[40:27.960 --> 40:32.960]  taco sand if you can't let commercials program you and say ooh get this burger
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.000]  do this do that how are you supposed to not allow other propaganda to take hold
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.080]  of your life and that's what this was for me it was like me being in charge
[40:41.080 --> 40:45.920]  taking hold of my life clearing out my system getting myself awakened and my
[40:45.920 --> 40:50.800]  my thoughts pure because you know you we have all these jumbled thoughts from all
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.040]  the toxins that we're putting in our body by the way I'm impressed I mean you
[40:54.040 --> 40:56.920]  guys aren't camera people like I'm not camera people you guys went and shot this
[40:56.920 --> 41:00.960]  all yourselves so it's amateur but it looks professional and you did a great
[41:00.960 --> 41:05.920]  job and people can go to info wars life calm to the deep cleanse liver shield
[41:05.920 --> 41:11.240]  page and see their informational video Dr. Groups video my breakdown without
[41:11.240 --> 41:17.920]  getting into any details 98% of people I talked to within a day have the big
[41:17.920 --> 41:23.320]  event happen and did you guys have the big event happen what do you mean you
[41:23.320 --> 41:27.000]  know the big cleanse the big final day what you doing the 6th day the 7th day
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.040]  what happened God rested on the 7th day but with this cleanse well see that's a
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.080]  thing is like you've got to follow the directions that Dr. Group puts out like
[41:35.080 --> 41:40.520]  I said I did the wrong the wrong salt and so it ended up that I didn't flush out
[41:40.520 --> 41:44.720]  all of that salt so I had to do an additional day with the proper direction
[41:44.720 --> 41:48.840]  so that's right you did it with like sea salt instead of the epsom salt and I
[41:48.840 --> 41:54.720]  like when I did the oil the olive oil I laid down on my side and I immediately
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.800]  started hearing in my body and feeling it going like all these little globules
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.840]  like just coming out like I could hear them popping out of my gallbladder it
[42:05.840 --> 42:09.680]  was there isn't people's gallbladders burst and so you did it right on the
[42:09.680 --> 42:14.120]  final day it was yes yeah and it I mean granted I'm mostly a vegetarian I eat a
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.320]  lot of vegetables and stuff so I'm pretty healthy so it wasn't super extreme
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.400]  now Emmy had some that were like this big and they were black so yeah I'm not
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.280]  gonna say what happened to me but let's just say like the movie alien and it
[42:27.280 --> 42:30.040]  really freaked me out because I was rolling my eyes four years ago when
[42:30.040 --> 42:32.840]  Anthony and group were doing these and people were saying that it was the best
[42:32.840 --> 42:36.120]  cleanse ever and I finally did it about a year and a half ago and then now I'm
[42:36.120 --> 42:43.000]  doing it again and it is simply amazing how your body is battling and taking all
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.360]  these toxins in and then doesn't know what to do with them so creates these
[42:46.360 --> 42:50.600]  crystals right yeah and that's the thing is how are we supposed to have clear
[42:50.600 --> 42:55.200]  thoughts empowered bodies empowered minds if our bodies are so weighed down
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.800]  with toxins folks you should do the liver cleanse today there's a big
[42:58.800 --> 43:02.800]  advanced one with what to eat what to do for six days I just do the basic one
[43:02.800 --> 43:06.360]  it's pretty easy to do and I had spectacular results now I didn't do
[43:06.360 --> 43:09.960]  everything I was supposed to so it took a day and a half for it to happen
[43:09.960 --> 43:14.280]  because the same thing with me I called group up and I said nothing happened in
[43:14.280 --> 43:17.480]  the morning he goes well what kind of salt did you use and I go I didn't do
[43:17.480 --> 43:20.520]  the salt and he goes well there you got to do the two or three caplets of
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.760]  epsom salt right so I did that the next night in olive oil again and then then
[43:24.760 --> 43:27.960]  yeah and that's exactly what happened with me I didn't use the epsom salt I
[43:27.960 --> 43:31.600]  used a different kind of I just didn't do it period and you can't do that well
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.280]  it's amazing info wars life calm info wars store.com that's how we find the
[43:36.280 --> 43:41.000]  operation as well so you can't lose I mean look we're fighting for your second

[44:03.160 --> 44:07.160]  now out of that Leanne into your concerns and my concerns about Trump but
[44:07.160 --> 44:11.280]  first let's just go over some of the news that's happened in the last 24 hours
[44:11.280 --> 44:17.320]  that ties into this to give folks kind of a background here shocking Obama laughs
[44:17.320 --> 44:22.960]  and meets with of course Royal Castro that was his second day in Cuba at a
[44:22.960 --> 44:27.400]  baseball game and other events with the communist dictator after Brussels terror
[44:27.400 --> 44:33.040]  attack mm-hmm just a few hours moments after giving his little heartfelt 40
[44:33.040 --> 44:37.680]  second speech and he's on ESPN show TV viewers this article in the photo the
[44:37.680 --> 44:41.120]  video is amazing just laughing and giggling talking for an hour about
[44:41.120 --> 44:47.320]  baseball but 56 seconds about the terror attack yeah they take our freedoms in
[44:47.320 --> 44:50.800]  the name of fighting terror he leaves the border open he brings the jihad he's
[44:50.800 --> 44:56.880]  in but there's no discussion well this is his dream job he cannot wait to shake
[44:56.880 --> 45:00.680]  off the whole leader of the free world thing because really he wants to be an
[45:00.680 --> 45:04.600]  ESPN well you're right in fact he said that yeah he wants to be an ESPN Sports
[45:04.600 --> 45:07.960]  Center but he's in his element right here look at that smile on his face he
[45:07.960 --> 45:11.720]  doesn't want to be the president so why can't he just get out now like he
[45:11.720 --> 45:15.840]  vacations I mean I thought Bush was bad watching Sports Center dollars hard it
[45:15.840 --> 45:19.600]  was a total puppet and I mean even worse than Bush if that's possible so but
[45:19.600 --> 45:24.040]  but for me the media is not mentioning with a dictator right with with a
[45:24.040 --> 45:28.480]  dictator at a dictatorship telling us how great it is but a lot of Cubans are
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.720]  very upset about it those that have actually been exiled here to this
[45:32.720 --> 45:38.080]  country or who came on rafts exactly plus the country is collapsing right and
[45:38.080 --> 45:43.120]  then he takes a picture in front of Shay the day before Shaglava as if that was
[45:43.120 --> 45:48.600]  said that Indians said that native groups were basically subhuman idiots and
[45:48.600 --> 45:53.760]  black people he's very racist oh yeah folks have no idea how racist the
[45:53.760 --> 45:57.960]  upper class in Latin America is but he's a hipster here I've been down there at
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.000]  it yet you know the quote upper class people's houses and they make these
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.720]  racist statements and it's happening in Mexico too and I'm like hey I'm not
[46:04.720 --> 46:07.740]  racist I was raised in the US I'm not into this
[46:07.740 --> 46:12.400]  Shaglava wrote a book where he called native Indians and blacks I'm not gonna
[46:12.400 --> 46:16.200]  even quote what he said he called him he called the natives roaches and he called
[46:16.200 --> 46:21.560]  blacks well you know what the name is he called them basic well go go look it up
[46:21.560 --> 46:24.840]  yourself it's unbelievable yeah oh he's very insulting but this is what
[46:24.840 --> 46:28.720]  communists think of people they hate the little people you know they call
[46:28.720 --> 46:34.240]  Appalachian people white trash you know white gorillas and they call them
[46:34.240 --> 46:40.160]  bitter clingers it's all the same crud folks they call us all scum well see and
[46:40.160 --> 46:44.200]  that picture for me because you know he's sort of the hipster hero he's the
[46:44.200 --> 46:47.280]  revolutionary and everything and then you've got a lot of these black lives
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.480]  matter people out there protesting not understanding that they're being
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.120]  orchestrated by George Soros and another billionaires to do their Obama agreed
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.300]  on this whole trip this is all iconic communist his campaign stuff was
[47:00.300 --> 47:04.080]  communist it's crazy and when he's not a communist he's a fascist coming in with
[47:04.080 --> 47:08.240]  select corporations like Google who will have a monopoly in Cuba now oh yeah
[47:08.240 --> 47:12.000]  notice they're keeping it tyrannical because they're gonna control just like
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.440]  China oh no I'm sure they're gonna give him a free and open internet come on well
[47:16.440 --> 47:19.880]  what's incredible they're just gonna let select companies in on top of it right
[47:19.880 --> 47:23.600]  it really is fascism using communism and the left loves it
[47:23.600 --> 47:30.080]  Jeb Bush backs Ted Cruz for president CNN this was predicted now seven days
[47:30.080 --> 47:33.320]  ago on Wednesday with Roger Stone we played it earlier what do you make of
[47:33.320 --> 47:38.280]  that I mean for me that is a political nail in the coffin Lee in yeah well and
[47:38.280 --> 47:41.880]  that's kind of ties into what I wanted to talk about with Trump today because now
[47:41.880 --> 47:45.120]  you know Heidi Cruz has come out responding to Trump saying that he's
[47:45.120 --> 47:50.160]  gonna spill the beans on her secrets as well so she responds to him and one of
[47:50.160 --> 47:54.540]  the things that she's really pushing is that Ted Cruz is the only candidate that
[47:54.540 --> 47:58.800]  is for the Constitution and so now they're really gonna be pointing out
[47:58.800 --> 48:02.840]  how he's there for the Constitution where Trump wants to act tough and blue
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.040]  collar and let's torture people and let's spy on the terrorist and that is
[48:07.040 --> 48:10.120]  gonna blow up in his face with libertarians and others he's got to stop
[48:10.120 --> 48:13.200]  it yeah he really does and so that's where they're gonna really start playing
[48:13.200 --> 48:16.640]  them off because you think they say Trump oh he's crazy he doesn't know what
[48:16.640 --> 48:20.200]  he's talking about he's racist this that but as soon as the terror attacks are
[48:20.200 --> 48:22.760]  going on they don't even know the body count yet they're like let's get Trump
[48:22.760 --> 48:26.360]  on the phone like let's let him talk and tell us what's going on sure and he
[48:26.360 --> 48:30.760]  was right he's gonna get hit he mentioned Brussels specifically that's
[48:30.760 --> 48:33.840]  where the terrorists are living and staying they've basically taken the
[48:33.840 --> 48:38.840]  city over of Brussels Belgium and so Trump's right about so many things and
[48:38.840 --> 48:43.360]  it's okay to use the NSA on non-citizen targets turns out the police knew
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.440]  these guys they were involved in organized crime connected terrorist again
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.200]  nothing was done Leigh Ann right well and the other guy was being pretend until
[48:51.200 --> 48:55.200]  they picked him up a few a week or so ago he was being protect protected by
[48:55.200 --> 49:00.160]  people in the Mullen beak neighborhood for months they knew he was walking
[49:00.160 --> 49:03.160]  around in the grocery store and they didn't turn him in and this was an
[49:03.160 --> 49:05.920]  attack on the United States they targeted the American Airlines line
[49:05.920 --> 49:10.920]  blow up a bunch of Americans and I mean I'm sick of it I'm tired of these
[49:10.920 --> 49:15.000]  people that want to kill Americans when most Americans have open arms and
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.240]  Belgium is so liberal and and Spain and all these countries have let these
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.720]  people in Germany France and then they they attack them they're just so
[49:23.720 --> 49:28.920]  arrogant they are so entitled they think they're on this jihad and now the West
[49:28.920 --> 49:32.400]  will just use this to bomb innocent Muslim countries right let's go to clip
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.040]  number one this is what you're concerned about with Trump should there be added
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.760]  security at the TSA let's go to that clip you're from New York City where
[49:40.760 --> 49:44.640]  there are three at least three major airports the most traffic train station
[49:44.640 --> 49:49.280]  in the country should there be added layers I know security is always high in
[49:49.280 --> 49:54.160]  New York especially after 9 11 but should there be added levels of security
[49:54.160 --> 49:59.840]  put in place right now for example an airport baggage claim centers train
[49:59.840 --> 50:04.160]  stations other places yes there should and you know we have a mayor who's
[50:04.160 --> 50:07.760]  doing a terrible job and everybody talks about it he's doing a terrible job in
[50:07.760 --> 50:12.720]  so many ways de Blasio he's a disaster as a mayor and probably will be
[50:12.720 --> 50:16.480]  challenged I can't imagine that he gets away with this but he knocked out
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.000]  surveillance and so many other things you know we had the finest surveillance of
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.040]  of the whole radical Islam situation that there is they say in the world the
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.960]  New York City Police Department which is an amazing department and so of course
[50:29.960 --> 50:33.800]  now he's talking about that skip the break at NYPD surveillance program that
[50:33.800 --> 50:38.200]  they had to dismantle that's right Leanne now again he's right when he says
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.360]  shut it all off to you check them don't let them in that's what you do at your
[50:42.360 --> 50:46.160]  border that's what you do with people from these countries you don't let them
[50:46.160 --> 50:51.560]  in you don't then surveil everyone and spend four billion dollars on surveillance
[50:51.560 --> 50:57.680]  equipment in New York two billion in Boston since 9-11 the East Coast has
[50:57.680 --> 51:04.040]  spent over ten billion dollars in in all sorts of spy gadgets and mobile
[51:04.040 --> 51:09.040]  exit ray vans and checkpoints and searches we're not against the police
[51:09.040 --> 51:13.600]  themselves we're against the policy of the TSA groping our genitals putting us
[51:13.600 --> 51:17.480]  in naked body scanners and then they allow the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudis
[51:17.480 --> 51:23.120]  that's in the news right to bypass it it's all a fraud it's all a hoax that's
[51:23.120 --> 51:26.960]  why Trump's wrong and they dismantle this NY this secret surveillance program
[51:26.960 --> 51:30.280]  because it was a violation of the Constitution constitutional rights that
[51:30.280 --> 51:34.400]  people there but yet they're surveilling the rest of the country absolutely yeah
[51:34.400 --> 51:37.760]  leave the radical Muslims alone go up to the FBI on the other job but they
[51:37.760 --> 51:40.680]  target the Tea Party and say we're the number one terror threat we got a bunch
[51:40.680 --> 51:45.160]  of clips let's go to this other clip he says change the law on torture so first
[51:45.160 --> 51:48.520]  he backs off torture because they say it's illegal now he says change the law
[51:48.520 --> 51:53.400]  don't like this here it is I think we have to change our law on on you know
[51:53.400 --> 51:57.560]  the waterboarding thing where they could chop off heads and they can drown
[51:57.560 --> 52:03.120]  people in cages and heavy steel cages and we can't waterboard so we have to
[52:03.120 --> 52:07.240]  change our laws and we have to be able to fight at least on an almost equal
[52:07.240 --> 52:12.840]  basis we have laws that we have to obey in terms of torture they have no laws
[52:12.840 --> 52:18.160]  whatsoever that they have that's enough and look look look we don't become
[52:18.160 --> 52:24.320]  because Jeffrey Dahmer kills teenagers or Ted Bundy kills women we don't go out
[52:24.320 --> 52:28.560]  and do it because somebody else because they're ISIS and Al Qaeda because they
[52:28.560 --> 52:34.120]  target innocents they torture people we don't start doing that George Washington
[52:34.120 --> 52:39.360]  didn't allow that because you lose the moral high ground now let's expand on
[52:39.360 --> 52:42.780]  that and I want Leigh Ann to comment he's meaning to say let's get tough on
[52:42.780 --> 52:47.760]  terrorists the problem is they're gonna do it to us folks they're not gonna do
[52:47.760 --> 52:51.440]  it to the terrorist who the establishment and who Hillary and who
[52:51.440 --> 52:55.480]  others have been arming and putting in charge they're bringing radical Islam
[52:55.480 --> 52:59.640]  into attack as Trump could not be more wrong on this but at least he's honest
[52:59.640 --> 53:03.760]  and says let's change the law go ahead well I honestly do not feel as though
[53:03.760 --> 53:07.920]  Trump is coming from a malicious place I I honestly think that he wants to keep
[53:07.920 --> 53:12.520]  America safe I think that he truly is wanting to talk tough and saying listen
[53:12.520 --> 53:15.720]  they're putting people in cages and electrocuting them and doing all this
[53:15.720 --> 53:18.720]  these guys are animals they don't deserve the same rights we've got right and
[53:18.720 --> 53:22.160]  so why can't we treat them the same way and so that's I get it where he's
[53:22.160 --> 53:25.600]  coming from where he truly feels like he wants sure at least he's being honest
[53:25.600 --> 53:28.520]  I mean the other people just do the torture to get false confessions and
[53:28.520 --> 53:33.920]  then basically say they're not doing it but that was the big warning don't trade
[53:33.920 --> 53:37.120]  your liberty for security because you get tearing absolutely let's go to this
[53:37.120 --> 53:40.960]  other clip and you've got some another list we'll get pulled up and go to we
[53:40.960 --> 53:45.160]  have a radical Islamic problem yeah he's one of the only people that'll
[53:45.160 --> 53:48.680]  actually say it so kudos to him what's beyond that is almost been taken over
[53:48.680 --> 53:52.960]  by the radicals in almost every area our government puts radical jihadists in to
[53:52.960 --> 53:55.960]  take over companies that aren't radical and then we'll never whisper the words
[53:55.960 --> 54:00.640]  yeah our government and other governments are behind it folks like
[54:00.640 --> 54:04.600]  Tim Kennedy said they're bringing them in to attack us to take our freedom
[54:04.600 --> 54:09.160]  that's what Trump doesn't get let's go to this clip what do you say to the
[54:09.160 --> 54:14.120]  millions of Muslim Americans who are very patriotic loyal Americans many of
[54:14.120 --> 54:18.280]  whom have sons and daughters who serve in the US military who feel they would
[54:18.280 --> 54:22.480]  be discriminated against if these policies went forward I say we have a
[54:22.480 --> 54:27.320]  problem we have a radical Islamic terrorism problem that's what I say I
[54:27.320 --> 54:32.120]  have to say that we have a problem like we've never had before this is a
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.680]  problem that has gone on general Pershing had the problem in 1919 in the
[54:36.680 --> 54:42.360]  Philippines with radical Islamic terrorism and he handled it a certain way I
[54:42.360 --> 54:45.680]  think you probably know that story it's a very gruesome story but you know what
[54:45.680 --> 54:50.800]  the problem didn't exist for 48 years after that happened so we have to be a
[54:50.800 --> 54:56.040]  lot tougher than we are right now they look at us as weak soft stupid people
[54:56.040 --> 55:00.480]  look at the scene on CNN right now all the bodies all over the floor and we're
[55:00.480 --> 55:03.600]  worried about waterboarding talk about a dialectic you know the
[55:03.600 --> 55:07.160]  establishment comes in and says torture everybody take all rides go after the
[55:07.160 --> 55:10.240]  tea party meanwhile they're funding al Qaeda and ISIS and turning them loose
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.600]  everywhere Trump comes in and says don't run al Qaeda don't run ISIS don't turn
[55:14.600 --> 55:18.880]  them over to Syria don't don't do this to Libya it's a disaster you screwed up
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.360]  no they did it by design Hillary admits Syria and Libya are what they want quote
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.560]  failed states okay that's the facts then he says let's get tough on these people
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.880]  don't bring them in stop them being brought in and when we catch them let's
[55:31.880 --> 55:35.600]  torture them to find out where the other ones are at right okay well if we
[55:35.600 --> 55:39.960]  hadn't financed them and turned them loose and funded Saudi Arabia and bought
[55:39.960 --> 55:43.960]  trillions in their oil this wouldn't be happening so Trump you cut off Saudi
[55:43.960 --> 55:49.880]  Arabia you cut off their oil you block bringing these people in you deport
[55:49.880 --> 55:54.280]  everybody that shoots their mouth off about jihad you throw their ass in jail
[55:54.280 --> 55:57.720]  they're not a citizens you put them on an airplane and send them back to their
[55:57.720 --> 56:02.080]  third world dirt dirt hole you send them back to their rat hole that's getting
[56:02.080 --> 56:06.960]  tough and you were turn the Republic and anybody you got free speech when you
[56:06.960 --> 56:11.280]  say you want to overthrow things and put a money-theistic cult in you're not
[56:11.280 --> 56:14.440]  an American you're a terrorist and you need to get your butt out of this
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.920]  country that's how you get tough that's what you do Trump got it that's it not
[56:19.920 --> 56:23.240]  but you're in the Bill of Rights and Constitution now I respect Trump for
[56:23.240 --> 56:26.280]  saying what he wants to say and what he wants to do this is gonna fall into the
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.400]  hands of the neocons and the fascist communist liberal filth sorry Leanne go
[56:31.400 --> 56:34.280]  ahead no I totally agree with you and that's why I wanted to bring this up is
[56:34.280 --> 56:38.480]  that they are going you can you can even see Wolf Blitzer he's like leading oh
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.840]  so how far would you go with the torture oh yeah just looking at in the
[56:43.840 --> 56:46.960]  establishment is just this will be the thing that they'll say you know what
[56:46.960 --> 56:50.600]  let's go ahead and put Trump in because he can convince all of these Americans
[56:50.600 --> 56:54.480]  to build their own prison Trump needs to start talking about prosecuting Hillary
[56:54.480 --> 56:58.720]  and prosecuting the neocons for running al Qaeda and ISIS and putting them in
[56:58.720 --> 57:03.480]  charge and Merkel needs to be arrested and Haland they brought them in they
[57:03.480 --> 57:08.160]  ate it in a bed they opened the door they stood down so they could take our
[57:08.160 --> 57:13.200]  rights and they're doing it and we see through it and we're done absolutely I'm
[57:13.200 --> 57:15.520]  sorry Leanne I'm gonna be screaming while you're in here let's go out to break
[57:15.520 --> 57:20.320]  with one more clip let's go to this clip be very vigilant very strong we're not
[57:20.320 --> 57:24.160]  going to have a country back that's right we need to be vigilant point out
[57:24.160 --> 57:28.920]  that criminals run our country that are in alliance with radical Sunni
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.880]  Wahhabist filth garbage here's the clip you look at what's going on in Germany
[57:33.880 --> 57:37.560]  you look at what's going on even they're part of Sweden where they're having
[57:37.560 --> 57:40.880]  problems like they never thought possible Sweden never had problems like
[57:40.880 --> 57:46.000]  this where a group came in and now all of a sudden they have a section so we can
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.600]  be nice about it and we should be politically correct about it but we're
[57:50.600 --> 57:55.680]  being fools okay we're being absolute alright Lee I want to hold you over the
[57:55.680 --> 58:00.040]  next five minutes so you can talk before we go to Larry Nichols and then take
[58:00.040 --> 58:02.720]  some phone calls and then we have the Senate candidate right now the
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.000]  Republican candidate a great lady a doctor that's beating beating John
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.840]  McCain but he's always getting beaten and they just still the election major
[58:08.840 --> 58:13.040]  election fraud news coming up as well but Leanne we should get mad though me you
[58:13.040 --> 58:15.520]  were mad this morning I really am fundamentally mad that our government's
[58:15.520 --> 58:19.520]  run by people bring jihadis in and their answer is take all our rights away
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.560]  yeah and then they see where they can use Trump to push that surveillance state
[58:23.560 --> 58:26.280]  yeah he made really great points I'm gonna try to shut up for four or five
[58:26.280 --> 58:28.840]  minutes when we come back to give you the floor to flush out more of your
[58:28.840 --> 58:32.440]  points and where you see this election going then we've got Larry Nichols
[58:32.440 --> 58:35.920]  popping in with inside baseball on how they plan to start a civil war which
[58:35.920 --> 58:39.840]  becomes clear clear every day second hour tell folks to call in tell your
[58:39.840 --> 58:43.600]  friends to listen right now not call in we're gonna take phones later but tell
[58:43.600 --> 58:47.560]  folks to tune in right now this is a war we have the truth we can smash the
[58:47.560 --> 58:52.280]  enemy brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it Rob do
[58:52.280 --> 58:57.520]  joins us you worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force get
[58:57.520 --> 59:01.400]  I'd been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I get in
[59:01.400 --> 59:05.760]  here at 830 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna
[59:05.760 --> 59:09.240]  make it and I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of
[59:09.240 --> 59:13.920]  brain force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like
[59:13.920 --> 59:17.480]  everything just kind of clears up it's got four and a half stars people really
[59:17.480 --> 59:20.240]  love it read about it find out why third-party
[59:20.240 --> 59:24.240]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the
[59:24.240 --> 59:28.520]  best organic based systems that will blow your socks off I haven't pulled it
[59:28.520 --> 59:31.280]  all night or like that in a while but I probably could not have done it without
[59:31.280 --> 59:36.040]  brain force I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up
[59:36.040 --> 59:40.040]  took two more brain force and came in you will find a brain force and other
[59:40.040 --> 59:48.840]  game-changing products at info wars life dot com or call 888-253-3139

[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:19.880]  information war it's Alex Jones I'm not name-dropping right now but I need to
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.280]  push people like Dave Mustaine and Billy Corrigan other really smart people that
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:29.000]  are libertarians free humans not conservative not liberal especially
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.360]  we're talking about Corrigan to come on the show because they're always making
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.000]  great points to be in text and and messages and stuff and then they're
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.640]  like yeah I'll come on never happens and then there's Dave Mustaine in a bomb
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.320]  show interview on Fox because he gets obviously attack when he comes out and
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.160]  speaks out but Billy's making some really good points here in text about a
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.120]  show you want to host Billy we know you're coming to town next month you

[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.320]  tolerant of everybody I don't even dislike anybody unless you're a radical
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.240]  jihadi that wants to cut my head off right and I don't mean to start screaming
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.920]  and yelling that's not an act folks I'm genuinely you see me today if I'm in
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.640]  pissed today yeah I mean and I would be too it just it gets so frustrating and
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.200]  you are able to take that anger and channel it and you know put that force
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.400]  field out there you do it better than I lean you've got the floor you got a lot
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.840]  of points for three and a half minutes go ahead well I just wanted to bring this
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.240]  up with Donald Trump because you know I do feel like he is someone who's on the
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.320]  outside and we've been watching how they've been attacking him we've got to
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.840]  take him down we've got to dismantle him and at every turn calling him a nazi
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.200]  so you know he's Hitler and then now when it comes to something like this
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.400]  where he wants to increase the surveillance change the laws on torture
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.400]  they're just kind of letting him speak and letting him put himself in that
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.880]  position because so many Americans support Donald Trump and I mean there's
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.960]  signs where people are like build that wall I'll help you build it and I know
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:09.480]  David Knight makes this point a lot that if if we have a wall we're we're stuck
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:14.560]  inside of it you know and no walls the total stunt there's a tunnel under it
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:19.280]  but it's like it's even the virtual wall the cyber wall this surveillance state
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.480]  this security I mean we're building we're begging them to build a prison to
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.880]  keep us safe and we know that that's a and we know to be used against us and
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.160]  not the foaming at the mouth criminals and jihadis who are leaving their own
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.560]  countries because they're constantly killing each other
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.280]  mm-hmm why would I'm not even against these people because there's some nice
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.360]  people in those countries but a good percentage of them a good minority of
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.880]  them are just psycho killers who absolutely believe it's okay to murder
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.160]  whoever they want and like keep women as slaves I mean as a woman what is it
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.800]  like for you because I have daughters and the jihadists really punched my
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.920]  buttons now that I have daughters I mean let me tell you know some jihadi like
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.720]  to do in Europe ever slaps my daughters around or bosses them around somewhere
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.000]  you know there's a reason all this dominating folks is going on in Europe
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.680]  America's had its way both chopped off to a certain extent but not completely
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.400]  mm-hmm yeah no for me that's one of the most frustrating things that I'm having
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:19.440]  to watch and to see a certain regressive left as Paul calls them just
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.920]  making excuses and saying well why would you attack their ideology and then some
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:29.400]  I think it was a Bill Maher who comes out and says well killing women who've
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.600]  been raped I think I have a problem with that kind of ideology like it's the
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.720]  woman's fault that she was raped but she disgraces her she's an acid thrown in
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.840]  her face and we're seeing that now being imported to Sweden and Germany and
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.680]  everybody that's upset about this needs to speak out against it and I know
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.760]  Billy has and I know Dave has and a lot of folks have courage so many other big
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:55.840]  movie stars TV people rock stars won't speak out because they're so scared they
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.720]  better be scared of losing all of our freedoms if we don't stand up now folks
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.360]  now is the time is what I'm getting it yeah it absolutely and that's the thing
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.040]  that's frightening is because I'm seeing we are on this precipice here with
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.080]  Trump I mean he's such a you know the real American hero you know but then
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.640]  he's like yeah and he in his heart I honestly think that he does want to
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.120]  protect us and keep us safe sure well he knows the military's been torturing
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.440]  since Vietnam right so he knows it's going on so he says yeah we're gonna do
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.480]  it and you know what's going on well and that's a realist about it he doesn't
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.200]  get the sophistication or maybe he does I just don't know well that's what he
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.920]  said to Wolf Blitzer he's like I don't agree that the military doesn't want to
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.360]  torture he says they're saying that to be politically correct well look you
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.880]  don't put it in long you don't do it occasionally you know a guy's got a bomb
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.000]  strapped to a five-year-old it's about to blow him up with them I've talked to
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.800]  special forces people that went ahead and tortured the guy to get him to you
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.560]  know to get the codes but you don't sit there and write it down and you don't
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.000]  just do it in a general system or take pictures lean on exactly great job are
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.160]  you turning to the monsters you're fighting I predict that Gardasil will
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.960]  become the greatest medical scandal of all times because at some point in time
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.800]  the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine technical and scientific
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.080]  feat that it may be has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.200]  the very many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill serve no
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.040]  other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers that was a
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.280]  statement made in April 2014 by a French medical doctor Bernard Delberg
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.960]  he's a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Merck the manufacturer of
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.480]  the HPV vaccine Gardasil and now almost two years later dr. Singh hang Lee

[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.320]  has proved these predictions correct he published a letter sent to the US CDC
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.760]  the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Japan and others
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.920]  documenting scientific misconduct among the world's leading health
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.440]  organizations tasked with providing vaccine safety by deliberately
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.280]  misleading Japanese health authorities on the safety of the HPV vaccine for more

[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.480]  with Roel Castro the dictator the hereditary dictator like North Korea
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:39.120]  they pass it to the family the new royalty just laughing and at 56 seconds
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:47.240]  to say about what happened in Brussels Belgium where our reporters were a day
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.680]  and a half two days after the Paris attacks is an hour and a half away and
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:57.280]  the terrorists had reportedly run there they caught the mastermind last week so
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.360]  as a diversion obviously they launched these attacks to be able to evacuate our
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.840]  experts believe not just Joe Biggs but counterterrorism specialists like Tim
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.880]  Kennedy but Biggs as an expert as well living through it that there will now
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.640]  be more attacks and when there are more attacks the answer will be it's Donald
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:23.600]  Trump for criticizing Islam and it's Donald Trump for blaming Islam truly sick
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.120]  there are Muslims that don't want to blow things up and that you would see as
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:35.520]  apostates or heretics according to mainline Sunni Shiite Muslims now from
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.280]  my research the Sunni Wahhabist are the most dangerous a virulent group they're
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.200]  the dominant group out of Saudi Arabia they're running around bullying everybody
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:50.560]  worldwide mainly Muslims Alawites Shiites and others and they're extremely
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.840]  oppressive Shiites around the world let Christians and Jews live and operate in
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.120]  peace if they don't get political the minute they do they're deader than a
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:07.440]  hammer they're the original Muslims the Wahhabist are sex trade slave trade
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:15.320]  scum desert bandits that took over in 1901 and created Saudi Arabia by 1930 set
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.800]  up the Royal House British intelligence backed them there's a double-cross deal
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.040]  now to bring them in worldwide they'll attack and then the West will be able to
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.640]  take its citizens liberty Tim Kennedy again anti-terrorism specialist the
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.480]  highest levels of army counterterrorism I won't even get into what units he won't
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.400]  even tell me but I've looked it up and I know came on the show and said our
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.240]  governments and the left are bringing amenity stabilize and bring in crises to
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:46.800]  take our freedoms that's what I'm telling you that's the fact now Larry
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.960]  Nichols in his own right was counterterrorism and a green beret and
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.480]  special operations in Latin America and Europe and you name it he could speak to
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.160]  all this and he ran campaigns for the Clintons he was their big insider in the
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.040]  hospital last week he's out by the grace of God we appreciate him joining us but
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.480]  we now have what we predicted last week with Trump insider Roger Stone saying
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.840]  look for the jab bush to endorse Bush excuse me Freudian slip their surrogate
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:18.320]  their minion because their name is fried Ted Cruz I like Ted Cruz's rhetoric but
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.280]  boy his pedigree is Bush all the way I'm not gonna get back into it but we'll play
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.520]  that short clips about a minute long coming up a little bit later we have
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:34.800]  Arizona primary with Trump wins Arizona Cruz wins Utah Brussels Tara three
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.120]  suspects identified suicide bombers were brothers they came in reportedly posing
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.800]  as migrant refugees there's evidence of election fraud up on
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:51.280]  redreport.com from godlike productions going through Utah caucuses mastermind

[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.360]  Belgian atrocities police swoop in on home district and these no-go zones that
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.360]  they said Trump was lying about they are also asking who would be a better
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:12.040]  fighter of terror Trump or Clinton Clinton's running ISIS in Al-Qaeda on record
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:18.320]  meanwhile a teacher who witnessed his Muslim students celebrating in the
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.840]  classroom after the attack Paul Joseph Watson reports on was given a police
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.000]  visit for his free speech yoga instructor shocked at support for
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.480]  terror bombings a Belgian yoga instructor who tweeted that Muslim
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.080]  children were celebrating the attacks in Brussels later received a home visit
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.200]  from the police oh on the same morning that the attacks unfolded Ivar Moll
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.840]  tweeted how do you remember a lesson if there is your class this is translated
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:53.200]  is applauded by Muslim children the tweet was accompanied by hashtags and it
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.560]  went into the attack hours later he tweeted that three police officers had
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:04.320]  visited his home and that there was no way he'd be tweeting in the future quote
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.200]  no longer will be tweeting the police said they visited him because we wanted
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.960]  to see what was going on and whether it was true that there was applause in the
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:18.680]  classroom yeah right sevens strange questions about the Brussels terror
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:24.600]  attacks we'll talk about that as well but joining us is Larry Nichols the
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.720]  consummate Clinton insider to talk about what's happening what's unfolding
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:34.600]  Larry what do you want to tackle first of the election the bombings the latest
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.760]  inside baseball on the investigation into the Scalia death what's front and
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:44.680]  center my friend front and center Alex I believe is the election just before
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.680]  coming on this program I received information about the strategy from the
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:59.760]  RNC the new strategy and pretty dastardly but you know Alex I gotta say this in
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.040]  front of your audience I've done worse things in elections I mean I've read
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.720]  more elections than most people have voted in what they're gonna do and this
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:13.120]  comes from what you saw with Jeb Bush endorsing Cruz what they're gonna do is
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:19.600]  they're gonna go to all extremes to make sure that Trump does not get 1237
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.960]  they're gonna do everything they can they're gonna back in they're gonna
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.880]  support Cruz they're gonna look like they're on fire for Cruz but it's
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:35.400]  simply to keep Trump from getting 1237 at that point they've got a broker
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:40.320]  convention and you know Alex I tried to tell people last time I was only you
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:46.400]  said this 10 months ago on our show I know you know these parties folks they're
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.640]  not government agencies they can change the rules as they choose when they
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:58.440]  choose they're rigging it against Trump now I would give anything if somebody in
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.920]  this audience had the ability to get Trump call me because I can tell him
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:07.440]  what they're gonna do and give a strategy against it for example they're
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.360]  fixing to start showing on the news that Trump's audiences are diminishing
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.720]  that's right they're gonna start showing that his big speeches and all these
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.560]  people coming by the tens of thousands they're diminishing you know how they're
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:29.080]  doing that they're doing that with George Soros you see these protesters that
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.760]  are showing up at Trump's speeches they're blocking the people from getting
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.080]  there well what they're trying to do they're trying to get people to come out
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:45.480]  with violence stark ruckuses because they know they know Alex that moral
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:51.680]  Christian conservatives they're not into that and so why would people come to a
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.720]  speech when they run the risk of getting hurt why would you bring your
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.560]  children to something that would be irresponsible sure it's a chilling
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:03.640]  effect it is and then so of course guess what happens you get to hear that his
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.960]  audiences are dwindling down the magic is gone so the answer is it's got to be
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:12.200]  bigger audiences for the first amendment to counter that baloney absolutely you
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.640]  know folks I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna tell you how to counter that go
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:24.240]  to Trump's rallies when you see these paid protesters don't pay any attention
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.880]  don't get in a shouting fest with them don't do anything just pretend they are
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:35.360]  not there now the other thing anybody that gets attacked this is a little
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.840]  inside trick that I guess I can be shot for telling anybody I'll tell you
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:45.440]  anybody that gets attacked they need to file criminal charges but what's neat
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.400]  about filing criminal charges Alex these people are being paid to be there
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.520]  they're being paid to be there and so they go back and demand lawyers and all
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.960]  the rest of it and that exposes the racketeering operation you got it and
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:05.480]  whoever paid them to go to that speech and to protest and throw a fit in calls
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:10.600]  violence that person is a co-conspirator sure what are people going to start
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.240]  pushing back to Soros I mean that old ugly you know Nazi collaborator I
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:23.520]  mean is I mean that why is that guy so above the law money power you know he's
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.240]  he's right at the epicenter you know I told you I told you until I'm sick of
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.320]  telling that they're not gonna end down Hillary I don't think it's anybody now
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.760]  that has any doubt they're not gonna ignite Hillary and the RNC is doing
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:45.320]  everything it can to make sure Hillary wins I know I know it sounds crazy but
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.680]  they are they're gonna pick their original candidate I feel like may still
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.880]  come back into the fold because once they go to that broker convention you
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.120]  understand they can pick anybody they want sure when you were on nine ten
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.160]  months ago saying that they're their own group they can do whatever they want
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:05.400]  they can stage it even the NFL's own tickets say it's all fake you know it's
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.760]  not all fake but when they want to make it fake it is fake it's even on the
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.720]  tickets like it's a WWF wrestling match well the parties are even worse they
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.720]  don't have the head of the RNC rules committee on CNBC I'm sure you saw that
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.360]  clip admitting look it's all stage your vote doesn't matter she says so there
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.040]  shouldn't be a primary he goes that's right and laughs at her that's right and
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:30.880]  you know they go with this ruse that the first time around in the convention the
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.800]  delegates have to vote with the vote of their state that is an out and out lie
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:42.120]  the delegates that are elected when they get to that convention get to vote
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:50.320]  their free will that is the actual rule and all this is about is to strip Trump
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:57.840]  of 1237 they beat him at a 1237 now and we're going to get an appointed
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:03.640]  presidential candidate for the RNC and they're now over there many Paul Ryan or
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.720]  Mitt Romney and having liberal media even mainline that that's okay to now have
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.280]  appointed candidates there'll be a backlash against the Republicans and
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:19.120]  Hillary will sail into victory that's exactly it that's it you know folks I'm
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:26.040]  gonna tell you we can stop this we can stop it Alex but Donald now I'm not
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:32.080]  trying to get a job I don't want to work for Donald Trump I want to do what I do
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:38.080]  while I still have breath in my lungs which may not be that long I want to do
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:45.120]  what I do he has to call me because as you know Alex maybe you can convince him
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.240]  I've got inside tips on what's coming well I'm able to get messages to him but
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.800]  that's about it and he's surrounded by pretty good folks or some of them are
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.680]  pretty young but but yes I definitely he does get the info that's on this show
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:00.280]  but but let's come back and talk about it hey everyone with 20 plus years as a
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:04.160]  radio host I've seen about everything one thing that keeps recurring though are
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:10.040]  these time-share charlatans these high-pressure sales people who get folks
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.880]  to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer then they get them in a
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:17.380]  corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a time-share they don't
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.160]  need they don't want and they can't afford and then they're stuck with that
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.080]  thing forever monthly payments mortgage payments annual fees that keep going up
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.560]  and up well up until recently people thought they couldn't get rid of these

[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:19.040]  break room getting a glass of iced tea during the break and direct TV we have
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.720]  cable and direct TV and I think dish we have a lot of different communications
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.600]  here bunch of different internet services wireless links you name it to try to
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.920]  be redundant when power goes out we have generators you name it I mean this is a
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:40.160]  defensive resistance operation set up basically around military doctrines of
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.880]  resistance during an occupation and I've read the national emergency documents
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:50.980]  we've been under martial law since 1933 with the War Powers Act and Franklin
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:55.120]  Roosevelt but they've been slowly expanding them and now under the
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.720]  different executive orders and several emergencies that Larry Nichols talks
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.320]  about we've written articles about they say we have quote reeducation camps
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:09.000]  prepared for the the Tea Party I mean that's in Army manuals why do you think
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.280]  military people are going public like Tim Kennedy about America's in trouble
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.920]  we're not gonna confiscate guns because they got the military training for it and
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.080]  just during the break they had an EAS alert and then I walked out and walked
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.240]  by and looked at cable TV and it was on one of the channels there as well that
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.040]  was cable I mean they're practicing taking over they've got the internet
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.680]  kill switch in place I'm gonna go ahead and have Larry Nichols with us till 50
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.400]  after this is a short segment but it just hit me we're under martial law when
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.880]  they have parties appointing candidates I mean they've had that on the books in
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:51.240]  76 Democrats in 72 but the boldness of it and the boldness of don't use the word
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.240]  mother or father and you use the wrong word we're gonna arrest you and Europe's
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.880]  doing it they've arrested the the frontrunner Marie Lapin who's a milk
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:06.120]  toast conservative people didn't recognize Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia in
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.880]  the middle of it till later we are entering sick stuff and rolling over to
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.240]  it folks is not the answer I want to talk about solutions and how to counter
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.280]  this in the next segment we got about three four minutes left Larry you know
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.760]  you were involved in all sorts of regime change in Latin America black ops and
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.800]  you can't get into it's classified but that's why they hired you for dirty
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.680]  tricks obviously you know with the Clintons and the Dixie mob is all the
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.400]  same group but you're a guy that's reformed woke up to it and said I'm not
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.840]  killing kids that's the backstory of folks just tuned in you know you've
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.640]  found your soul again as you said and hit your knees and that's great but a lot
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.000]  of folks in government are doing that too right now but the system's just
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.560]  moving forward you talk about the Strong Cities UN initiative that was in my
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.760]  local paper that the UN's gonna tell my government how to work I mean I'm living
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.320]  under world government now and the average yuppie has no idea what they're
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.720]  living under what's coming next Larry and everything you just heard me say is
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.960]  that wrong or is that right no that's all right excuse the dog somebody's
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:11.920]  walking by let me say this executive order 13 391 I know you've reported on
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:19.720]  it is the National Patriots Defense of Liberty Enabler Act that thing calls
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.200]  Alex that thing calls for federal territories to fall all federal
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:31.600]  tell territories to fall under agenda 21 number one but here's the kicker it
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:42.040]  also facilitates the president to bring in UN troops to this country now guys if
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:46.360]  you don't think we're close remember what I told you Alex about Cuba it says
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.960]  it officially it's been in the Washington Post you said six months ago
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.400]  they were gonna use Cuban troops as part of the invasion forces they can mix
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.720]  in and speak Spanish I mean it was you know Chinese troops are Russian folks
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:07.240]  would fight listen it is six hours they can have 250,000 black cat troops in
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:15.040]  this country I have fought them they're formidable they are now add to that that
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.240]  executive order where did it come from where did it come from Alex out of the
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:25.040]  blue why would he do that then Obama normalizes relationship with Cuba but
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.360]  here's the kicker why did he go to Cuba I mean go down there to watch a ball game
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.800]  uh-huh you see there are plans that have to be made I believe towards a
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.280]  facilitation to bring in those troops into this country that he can't make out
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:45.760]  of the White House I'll tell you the laws that they would love to see foreign
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.880]  troops kicking conservatives and veterans guts out in the street they
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.680]  did they just lust for our blood I'm telling you he's over there right now
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:59.480]  I believe I can't prove this in a court of law but soon I will be able to Castro

[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.560]  about these things we got to stop them stop them there is a way to stop that
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.160]  executive order the solution that is stay there let's talk about it long
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.720]  segment stay there and how to how to get Trump informed of what's happening and
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.360]  where this is all going Larry Nichols and of course you say Trump may be
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.080]  informed and stop them but you're also saying Obama may double-cross Hillary so
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.320]  let's talk about the different scenarios are there three or there four or there
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.600]  five with the consulman insider Larry Nichols I'm Alex Jones and make no
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:47.560]  mistake the Republic has never been in greater danger this is really
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:52.880]  happening we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:56.360]  GCN radio network
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:04.480]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam and that is the special
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:09.400]  relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia presidential candidate
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:14.120]  Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.880]  interview with CNN if you have a neighborhood where there is a high
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.400]  level of gang activity the way to prevent it is you increase the law
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:25.320]  enforcement presence there and you target the gang members to get them off
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:29.480]  the street I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.320]  radical Islamic terrorism Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue that is the
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.800]  creation promotion and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:43.560]  Arabia and the United States as a political opportunist supported by
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.440]  Goldman Sachs the CFR and the establishment Cruz must embrace the
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:53.640]  terror war narrative and its lies delusions emissions and misrepresentations
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:31:00.880]  of the truth you can read more right now at info wars com thousands of years
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:05.800]  ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of

[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:17.040]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.200]  had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:27.160]  silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the

[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:50.760]  authoritarian totalitarian behavior going on the preparations are staggering
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:56.440]  all over the US they're spending billions but table highway dividers out

[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.600]  highway America is having extra highway dividers placed at key positions to
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.040]  lock down in cordon cities and the only people that are awake are the
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.240]  military because they're being trained to do it and they are freaking out and
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.560]  they're turned into the show I don't really know how valuable that is I think
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.360]  it's valuable but they don't know what to do because the public only cares about
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:33.040]  Beyonce who's saying let's have race riots at the Super Bowl which is financed
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:40.520]  by the government again all run by the system to bring the country down I don't
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.840]  know how grave it is I don't know this is a beta test for five or ten years down

[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:59.520]  Nichols and their quick questions 800-259-9231-800-2599-231 the systems
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:05.560]  running around wild just just just just engaging in bizarre behavior there's
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.960]  there's three different options what Obama tries to stay Hillary gets in or
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.880]  Trump what are the other options where do you see it all going what do you
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:18.840]  expect to happen with the Soros folks trying to cause a quote racial slash
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:24.920]  class warfare 1917 Bolshevik deal what are the different ingredients what are
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.840]  the different areas of the perfect storm where do you see it going and how do
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:31.920]  we try to counter it all right Alex there's no doubt you've got two major
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:37.600]  events being facilitated right now number one is to create a centralized
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.920]  government power elite that's Hillary that's Hillary and Bill that's their
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:49.760]  agenda complicit with that are the Republicans the Republicans you see if
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.960]  Hillary takes over and she becomes King I say King versus Queen if she becomes
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.880]  King all members of Congress get to be Dukes and Earl's like in the 1600
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:05.920]  European models so they get to be power players now yeah they're big fish in
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.880]  smaller pond they'll leave after 20 years and their son or daughter just like
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:15.200]  Raul or just like young on will become the new vice right there's option one
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:25.320]  option to Obama is trying to turn us into an Islamic caliphate this country
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:31.720]  and if he can do that then he becomes and will become the global leader of
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.960]  Islam globally now everything you said has been total inside baseball has
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.400]  basically come true is that from your high-level sources or your own analysis
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:45.040]  you bet no it's not from analysis I don't not on something like this number
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.480]  one you just can't hell I couldn't even imagine this stuff so tell me how how
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.320]  level because I mean I know some famous national people that that you know say
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.760]  you were back at the beginning of the whole thing trying to take down Clinton
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.360]  I mean I know you've been there have a lot of big contacts you name it how high
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.280]  level and specifically what are they saying about his plan to create a
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:09.680]  caliphate well at some of the former top generals in the military who were ripped
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:15.320]  out because they were not going to go along with the sinister plan then I
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:21.280]  had two ambassadors that were involved believe it or not with the plan and then
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:25.240]  when they found out their the trueness of it they didn't think it was real they
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.440]  didn't think it was coming they called me and then as you know I got people
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:34.640]  or got a person must just say on the Supreme Court so I have pretty good
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:39.080]  deep inside information and about stuff like this you would never want to
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:43.840]  speculate and that's why I can tell you these things and you see them look at
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:51.680]  look at look at him now he's in Cuba for what for what the watch of all game
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:58.640]  now why would you out of the blue normalize relations with Cuba what did
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:03.280]  we get out of it that's what people got asked what did we get out of
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:08.080]  normalizing relationships with Cuba now they get a lot we don't get anything
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:16.080]  look these two options are on the table the third option is the one we got a
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.880]  fight for and that's Donald Trump I'm sorry I'm not trying to make Donald
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.080]  no I hear he's not perfect but listen there's a reason they're pulling their
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:29.520]  hair out that is not an act they are having a connection fit why well
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:34.720]  because Donald Trump they can't trust you see when you go to Washington you've
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:41.000]  got to be pliable pliable that now everybody in Washington that is
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.040]  probably per capita you know the salad per capita that's the filthiest group of
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:52.040]  people you can pedophiles drug addicts drunkards you could not put that many
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:55.880]  people in one place if you tried but that's where they are so they don't have
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:59.960]  dirt on him he's not ashamed to have and girlfriends when he's divorced he doesn't
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.520]  care he's never stepped in fetched he hasn't taken orders he hadn't taken
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:09.760]  orders and more importantly hadn't taken money he hadn't taken money from the big
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:15.360]  power players so that's Donald Trump that's why he may be the best when he is
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:20.000]  the best shot we got is he perfect is it absolute I don't know what no pillow
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.360]  gets there but then that brings us to what we got to do now folks if you want
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:32.080]  to shut down an executive order let me tell you a secret Congress has 30 days
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:38.640]  on any executive orders to rescind it if Congress does not rescind that
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:43.680]  executive order in 30 days Alex it becomes a law just like if it went
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.960]  through the legal process the House to Senate vote and president same thing with
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.000]  signing statements if I don't override that it becomes a law that's right now
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.480]  we got 30 days we're out of those 30 days what I'd like to provide Alex is give
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:02.120]  it to you probably tomorrow and get you put it up a script I'm gonna tell
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:07.480]  people exactly who to call what congressmen and senators with at the
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.040]  time we got the most power Alex they're scared to death they want their job they
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:15.720]  don't care about us they want to keep their job especially with the
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:21.400]  impending doom of the country as we know it they want their job so we have power
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:24.880]  and that's right they want their power to try to protect themselves during the
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:29.480]  takeover that's it so we're gonna have got a script that I want to provide to
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:35.520]  you and to all of you in the audience I suggest you take that script and it with
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:40.960]  it will be who to call and it tells you exactly what to say say those words
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.960]  exactly don't you know don't expand don't you can write the script but you
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:50.000]  know the basic called action but basically what is it would you just say
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.720]  look basically it's just right here you know hello and you know I'm calling to
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:02.160]  say this mr. Congressman or for the congressman there is an executive
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:10.080]  order 13391 which calls for all federal territories to fall under agenda 21 and
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:21.000]  for the bring in UN troops so tell the congressman that if he doesn't rescind
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:27.440]  that before the time expires I will do everything in my power everything my
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:33.920]  family can do all of my friends we will see to it that you never get elected to
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:40.760]  that office again now I'm telling you we did it as you recall remember Alex we
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.040]  did this same trick gets that do-by-points deal we called in had a
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.360]  read a script and guess what shut it down shut it down we can shut this
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:54.440]  sure I shot out in the 90s and again in the 2000s now they're bringing in by
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.800]  still right I want to bring this up a lot of experts thought that Clinton coming
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.240]  out and saying with disaster in the last eight years the disastrous legacy was a
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:06.640]  shot at Obama because he's getting where they're gonna try to double cross
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:10.880]  Hillary and their return to full power let's play that clip and get your take
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:39.520]  on it here it is a few days ago well first off Hillary was a big part of
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.960]  that legacy Obama was one of their creations though they've been fighting
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:48.560]  obviously what is that statement I mean what does that mean that is what Bill
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.600]  knows Bill is the consummate politicians I know because I help training
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:57.720]  what he is doing is he's cutting he knows the problem Hillary has she has to
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:03.920]  cut away Alex from Obama she's got to now to keep her from being put in a
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:07.520]  situation where if she actually said something like that there would be
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.360]  somebody jumper and say what are you talking about you were part of it
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:15.200]  Bill said it and that's exactly what they're doing they're building this
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:21.560]  divide between them and Obama and remember while you and I are talking
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:27.000]  right now Bill Clinton and Hillary and their minions are calling congressmen
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.240]  and senators left and right and saying if you don't if you go along with Obama
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:41.360]  and declaring a national crisis state of crisis we will destroy you that's what
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:44.840]  they're doing this question he's sort of playing both the Clintons and the
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.240]  Obamas we know he's funding both even a little bit the Sanders who is he from
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.800]  your intel fully behind because he's trying to start a civil emergency right
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:58.160]  now that would mean he's working for Obama he is source is out for source
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:02.000]  George or because I've asked that same question to people everywhere it doesn't
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.360]  make sense he's working with here he's working with all Jesus working with the
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:15.120]  Republicans he wants America to become a communist nation he ain't in he doesn't
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.040]  want to want it to be an Islamic caliphate I can tell you that but he
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:24.760]  believes in the consolidation of power he believes that he should own this
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:29.080]  country he's believed that for many years Alex you know that break down some
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:32.360]  of the other angles of the who are the major power broker elites the angle
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.720]  American old banks the big oil companies big pharma the big central banks are
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.800]  obviously chief they wanted kind of a curel quickly merger of socialism and
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.720]  fascism into a managed capitalist system with socialism and communism to
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.320]  control the public but clearly Obama has double crossed where our elite has and
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:55.080]  is trying to put Saudi Arabia and the worst jihadist in power our elite would
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:00.040]  actually do this what what is their problem those people saw their heads off
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:05.880]  in a minute now let me tell you the power players the oil the banks those
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:09.840]  people they're not with Obama they're not with him on turn this into Islamic
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:14.120]  caliphate they got enough sense against that and what's their problem afraid well
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.720]  they're afraid to come out overtly against Obama because he'll destroy so
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:23.440]  they got double cross they didn't they got yeah I mean he'll destroy him he
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.000]  can steal he's like it he's like a rattlesnake Alex he may be dead but don't
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:35.640]  get near those things look they want what Bill Clinton told me about years
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.000]  years years ago he said you know what the perfect government is nickel and so
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:45.120]  what he said we're all you have are the number of people you could count on one
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:51.160]  hand and they they got everything they're in power everybody else is dirt
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.960]  poor I said well I won't do that well because you don't have to answer the
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.560]  four or five people sure Carol quickly wrote 1,100 page book and admitted that
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.400]  is their master plan that's right everybody else is so dirt poor you
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:08.600]  don't have time to worry that is the US CIA globalist policy that was adopted
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:14.400]  1967 from Carol quickly they admitted certified planetary plan neo-futilism and
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:21.680]  guess who wants to be in that group that small handful George Soros Soros was
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:27.880]  the claim source won't source believes that it needs to be him and a couple of
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:33.080]  three of his buddies now you have some of the other bankers and all those people
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.000]  that think they need to be in it but they're never fighting global government
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  because they all think they're gonna control it they're gonna control it
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.480]  they're not gonna fight this they're gonna fight us Alex we're the target
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:50.120]  here's God we're the target I know three people independent on under their

[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.320]  bring in a world government because they all want the power and then finally
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:02.720]  one entity takes it all over and it's the devil and I talk about that in
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.680]  mainstream media makes fun of me and says he believes the devil's controlling

[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.040]  thanks you know I'm I'm really kind of concerned and I'd like to get some
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:11.360]  input on the relationship between Glenn Beck and Ted Cruz now I'm a Christian
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:22.000]  and I was a part of the same kind of Christianity that Ted Cruz follows years
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.120]  and years ago until I found out what was going on and it's all based around
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:34.000]  this whole Dominionism theology the theomity with Rush Downey and
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:40.320]  Dooney and all these people and so when I caught Glenn Beck ranting and raving
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:46.000]  about the way America was responding to Donald Trump as opposed to Ted Cruz
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.200]  says you're going to hell if you don't vote for Cruz so I mean what's your
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:54.240]  question about the Bush endorsement let me ask this who is Ted Cruz from your
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:57:01.840]  sources what do you think about him Alex Ted Cruz is an absolute fraud an
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:07.040]  absolute fraud Donald Trump wasn't kidding when he called him a liar you know
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.800]  Ted Cruz is what came up through the Bush organization the oil money his
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:19.280]  wife Goldman Sachs she's now on the committee for the Central American Union
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:24.600]  or the whatever he's a fraud now what gets me about back and back's gonna mess
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:28.240]  up to lose his audience I'm telling you especially that last trick they did when
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:31.960]  he's already lost his audience he's killing himself he's gonna lose he's
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.080]  gonna lose more especially when Ian Romney did that part which is a
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.160]  Mormonism thing saying that you know Cruz is coming to ride in on a white
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:47.600]  horse which means he's the Messiah guys these are sick people don't don't I know
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.800]  it's hard to believe because it looks like Ted Cruz fought Alex it looks like
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:56.680]  he fought on the floor for the tea party and such like that he did that to grow
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:02.160]  him a base that's all it was about he's no different than the others now I got

[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:14.120]  really that distance to the power players huh well the word I was always
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.280]  told in Texas is that he was Bush run so we wouldn't even interview him he
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.520]  wanted on the show we did a TV interview and then he did some good stuff in the
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:27.760]  Senate so I reserve judgment well don't reserve judgment anymore know who these

[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.560]  Clinton insider has been exposing them for 22 years Larry Nichols Larry let's
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:48.960]  talk to Debbie Debbie you bet hi there mr. Nichols hi Alex I just had a
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:54.360]  question I just got some information yesterday about Claire Lopez she was a
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:00.160]  former CIA trainer like a security analyst weapons of mass destruction
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:03.520]  specialist in the Middle East I was just wondering if you're familiar with her
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:07.920]  because they said she's coming to our small town in Minnesota to kind of
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:11.720]  warn about the Islamic attacks in the coming months the global Islamic
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:20.920]  I'm not aware of her let me see if he has a moving quick I apologize okay what about what about five million Islamists is coming in from radical areas over a
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:24.160]  million in the US they're keeping the number artificially low but it's much
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:27.520]  higher than they're saying I'd say a million clearly is this a sleeper cell
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:33.440]  plan use the crisis Alex they're coming in and if you look at what the Obama
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:37.160]  people are telling these people when they come in they're telling them not to
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:44.200]  assimilate Obama's people are telling these these Islam Islamic people don't
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.120]  assimilate into a society here and he's setting it up to where they will keep
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:52.720]  their society he's setting you know what's gonna happen with Dearborn
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:59.320]  Michigan the Claire's Caliphate it's coming Alex that's coming one day we're
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:03.520]  gonna wake up and Dearborn Michigan's gonna say hey we're no longer a part of
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:07.080]  the United States we are an Islamic Caliphate what do you think anybody can
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:12.200]  do about it it's the perfect Balkanization they're really doing it you
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.880]  can see it in Europe in the US you criticize it when your daughter gets
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:19.800]  raped and then the police come arrest you it's like hey they're God now they're
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:25.560]  your masters now Debbie I appreciate your call I mean I had Tim Kennedy in
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.000]  here who's you know high-level anti-terrorism units and stuff and he
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  said look they're bringing them in to attack to then take our liberties I
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:38.280]  think it's just that something Alex next week I will have confirmation on
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:46.320]  something that for the first time I'll be able to tell you with absolution and
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.320]  verification of what this Syrian invasion is all about what they're
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.640]  really doing I know and I think you know it's creating a corridor to the rest of
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:03.360]  Middle East to invade Europe it's it's the takeover of America yeah that's it
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.920]  it's the corridor in Europe that's that's what that's unbelievable
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:13.840]  Santo or Santino I'm saying it right in California Larry Nichols go ahead yes
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:20.240]  my question is for Larry Nichols and I live in California and my friend who is
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:29.840]  working at Disneyland recently told me that he was to get black from the
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:35.720]  company if he didn't train a Syrian refugee to take his job and they
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:40.080]  threatened that if he didn't train him they wouldn't allow him to ever work in
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:45.920]  a amusement park in California ever again and well and she told me basically
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:51.600]  they're just Syrian refugees coming in California they're getting enlisted in
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.520]  all these job positions without even having experience for the job and listen
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.560]  I have undercover reporters right now the huge show huge broadcast breaking next
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.720]  week where they give them real social security numbers fake names paychecks
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:13.040]  and are just kicking everybody out of section 8 at levels a hundred times what
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:17.060]  the news says it's a total invasion they fly the planes in every night to
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:20.800]  Berksham and other airports and it's actually in the news I mean this is a
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:25.720]  total invasion and they're all military aged men by the way is this part of the
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.880]  military invasion Larry yes it is and Alex they've got these major
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:37.360]  corporations committed to give all of these quote-unquote refugees minimum pay
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.640]  at 15 an hour when Americans that are doing the very same job that they're
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:46.480]  gonna lose get minimum wage economic warfare Larry Nichols God bless you
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:50.000]  we'll talk to you soon thank God you survived at that bout in the hospital
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.400]  everybody pray for him we're gonna be back with a major candidate going up
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:59.160]  against John McCain this is a big deal she's leading in the polls Ted Cruz
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:05.320]  ignores the real source of radical Islam and that is the special relationship
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:09.800]  between the United States and Saudi Arabia presidential candidate Ted Cruz
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:13.880]  sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:17.640]  interview with CNN if you have a neighborhood where there is a high
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:21.160]  level of gang activity the way to prevent it is you increase the law
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.040]  enforcement presence there and you target the gang members to get them off
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:29.240]  the street I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:34.080]  radical Islamic terrorism Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue that is the
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.120]  creation promotion and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi Arabia
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:44.160]  and the United States as a political opportunist supported by Goldman Sachs
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:49.680]  the CFR and the establishment Cruz must embrace the terror war narrative and
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:54.920]  its lies delusions emissions and misrepresentations of the truth you

[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:32.160]  to the Alex Jones show that's right we are here in North America under the
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:38.600]  NA you under FEMA region six under the Democrat Socialist Party the Republican
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:41.760]  Party says they're gonna try to steal the election from Donald Trump regardless
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:45.960]  what you think about Donald Trump folks they've never gone in and ignored the
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:51.640]  popular vote at a convention it is unprecedented what is it that is
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:55.880]  scaring him so bad well they're scared of populism taking on a tea party
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.320]  conservative libertarian bent like people like Dr. Kelly Ward who depending on
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:05.000]  the poll I've got a bunch of them just type in Kelly Ward beats John McCain in
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.640]  pole there's a whole bunch of polls Breitbart's got it you name it scientific
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:16.280]  polls where she has 45% and he has 36% we're talking nine points ahead other
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:23.640]  polls 8.7.6 points she is trouncing him but we need a total landslide against
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:30.160]  this Rhino warmongering guy that funded Al Qaeda ISIS in Syria this anti gunner
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:35.040]  this cheating five because I've seen them steal elections in Nevada folks I've
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:39.400]  seen it I mean well who doubts it now what they're doing to Trump so we need a
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:44.440]  massive landslide we need everyone to turn against John McCain and just send
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:48.640]  the establishment a message Dr. Kelly Ward was elected 2012 represent the
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:52.040]  people of Arizona's fifth legislative district as her senator and member of
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:55.040]  the Republican Party she earned her doctorate at West Virginia School of
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:59.280]  osteopathic medicine and now practicing emergency medicine in Arizona she has
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.000]  now resigned from the Arizona State Senate in order to focus on our efforts
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.680]  on the US Senate race Kelly Ward calm and my gosh I mean John McCain the
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:15.840]  ultimate Democrat in a Republican outfit I am so excited and I just hope she
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:19.480]  wins but I tell you you know it's like people beat Hillary about 20 points in
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:22.680]  New Hampshire and they give her all the points I mean I'm no doubt she's gonna
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:27.800]  get elected I don't mean to be negative here Dr. Ward but I tell you it looks
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:32.080]  like you'd already be the new senator there from there from Arizona but who
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.840]  knows I mean like North Korea looks like John McCain may be the hereditary
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.520]  dictator of Arizona what do you say doctor well hey Alex it is great to be
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:44.760]  here with you and you are exactly right he is the poster boy for the
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:50.760]  establishment for inside the Beltway politics for what everybody on both sides
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.160]  of the aisle is so upset about so frustrated so disappointed so
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:58.320]  disgusted with in Washington DC and things do look good here on the ground
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:03.040]  we've got so much momentum you know the poll you were talking about that was a
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.680]  poll of 1400 Arizona voters who mostly described themselves as moderate and
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:12.600]  independent and I'm you know I am a true conservative so you know it's kind of odd
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:15.840]  that moderate and independent would be flocking to me but I think that my
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:20.040]  message of liberty and freedom resonates across the board regardless of race
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:24.240]  regardless of age and regardless of political ideology people are ready to
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:31.000]  retire McCain and I'm here to help that happen well let's talk about I mean the
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.200]  polls pretty much all have you ahead and it looks like you're growing as time
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.800]  goes on what is his response been because I've noticed national media hasn't
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:43.360]  given us a lot of attention because if this consummate establishment dinosaur
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:48.000]  finally falls that'll send shock waves throughout the system I mean I would
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.480]  think your race it's got some attention but I think it should get even more
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.520]  attention oh yeah I you know I think the obvious is the race of national
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:01.640]  significance because if we are able to truly take down a DC dinosaur or be so
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:06.440]  it's the rhinoceros like John McCain it is going to send a message to Washington
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:11.480]  DC and those inside the belt way to say hey we the people are awake we the
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:16.320]  people are not going to be silent anymore we are reminding you that you
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:22.360]  work for us not the other way around and so you know I think that the national
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:28.080]  media especially the inside DC media you know they would love to ignore that I'm
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:31.120]  even in the race and John McCain would love to ignore that I'm in the race as
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:34.900]  well they want to make it a match up between John McCain and Ann Kirk
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:39.040]  Patrick the Democrat in the race who is one of our Congresswomen here from
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:45.280]  Arizona who votes with Barack Obama nearly 100% of the time she is extremely
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:50.160]  liberal she is extremely progressive and she has not done anything during her
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:54.840]  time in Washington she's 65 years old people are looking for a change they're
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:58.280]  looking for the next generation to come into Washington not the same
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:04.440]  generation to stay there and and lawed themselves over us and so you know I
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:09.680]  think that truly the true matchup is is Kelly Ward versus Ann Kirk Patrick and
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:15.120]  in that same poll I beat her by six or seven points so and and so the momentum
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:19.000]  is definitely with us I hope that the media is going to start paying more
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.840]  attention to the race and to me you know to me in particular because I am you
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:27.400]  know sure they know that it catch on even bigger so they've got to try to
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:31.240]  ignore a huge probably the most important to set a race in the country and I
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:33.720]  follow the news every day and it's really hard to see it unless you're
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:38.120]  looking at drudge or right bar their info wars I mean it's just crazy but
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:44.120]  look they're trying to appoint Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney now to the you know
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:49.920]  Republican primary you know they're at the RNC who knows maybe they'll just
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:56.240]  appoint McCain and retire him into the nomination maybe he should run against
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.760]  Hillary hey you know I'm sure he would love to be the president however he
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:04.600]  failed in both of his attempts to become the president and I don't think he
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.840]  fought nearly hard enough the last year he was obviously right I was being
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.680]  sarcastic but I'm saying we're gonna point well Ryan as the nominee why not
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:15.600]  just appoint John McCain again well exactly it's basically the same thing
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.440]  and if the party tries to pull those kind of shenanigans at the convention
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:23.560]  really there will be an uprising and I think that the GOP as we know it now
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:28.360]  will go the way of the way you know the people are speaking the people are
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:32.840]  speaking loudly that they want someone different that they want an outsider
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:37.560]  that they want a non-politician now of course the establishment is clawing
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:41.040]  their fingernails into the wall trying to maintain the empire that they have
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:45.040]  created for themselves and the others that they have deemed worthy to be part
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:49.000]  of that empire and so I used to say they would do almost anything to maintain
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.840]  it but I think they would do anything anything we saw it down in Mississippi
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:57.640]  with bad Cochrane and what happened with the Chris McDaniel race I you know I'm
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:01.000]  fighting fiercely here to make sure that there aren't any kind of you know
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.960]  there's there's no kind of funny business like what happened down in Mississippi
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:08.080]  here in Arizona well there's been funny business before but people are pretty
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.400]  aware of it but I've never I mean seen Leeds this big against whoever McCain's
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:18.720]  against he seems pretty entitled what is he doing to try to counter you what are
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:23.400]  you doing to counter him and what can my listeners across the country do to try
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.840]  to really get behind you right now to push you over the top well I love for
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:32.840]  people to come to my website which is kellyward.com kellyward.com
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:36.560]  Kelly with an eye because I care about the people also join me on social media
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:42.440]  Twitter and Facebook are on fire with with you know people who are are really
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:45.920]  looking for change in Washington DC and we all know we can't change Washington
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:50.160]  unless we change the people we send there and so come on to Facebook Kelly Ward
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:54.080]  for Arizona come on to Twitter Kelly Ward AZ gotta remember that Kelly with an
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:57.120]  eye because I care about the people so you can you can find the right Kelly Ward
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:00.720]  because there is a Kelly with a Y who works for the DNC and we definitely
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:04.640]  don't want to be on her team but that would be a great way to get involved
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:09.280]  because my biggest challenge is not you know showing that I'm a competent
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.720]  qualified capable person who's going to hit the ground running in Washington DC
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:17.640]  it's increasing my name recognition to the point where I'm able to go up against
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.520]  a guy who has nearly a hundred percent name recognition luckily for me he's got
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:26.520]  about a 26% job satisfaction so people are looking for an alternative and so I've
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:30.240]  got to show them that I'm out there and I am the alternative well America
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:35.840]  America needs a doctor I mean this country said yes we do we do we do I've
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:40.480]  got the cure I've got the cure to the John McCain item that's for sure the
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:46.440]  rhino virus we need to cure that rhino virus and and Dr. Ward has the cure now
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:52.200]  Senator McCain is actually doing a lot more things than he has in it for years
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:55.560]  and years and years he's showing up in places in Arizona that he hasn't been
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:59.880]  for decades and and the people that are there are kind of you know they're
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:03.240]  they're funny because they say wow he's actually coming they think he thinks that
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:08.720]  we're going to buy his story we'll see he's gonna be in Arizona this week
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:13.520]  coming to several events holding some coffees with Jeff Blake that other
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:17.880]  strong Republican that we have here in our state and I'm interested to see if
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.640]  they're actually going to answer questions from the people who are very
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.680]  frustrated with the representation that we've been getting here in Arizona yeah
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:28.120]  I know in the past he hardly campaigned he just expected to be given to him as a
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:32.520]  crown he's now had to fight you because of the incredible anti-establishment
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:37.360]  fervor that's going on but plus you've been running a good campaign I just want
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.960]  you to watch your back because that guy is just such a gangster yes you know
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:45.640]  I've had people who tell me you know to get an auto starter on my car that I
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:48.920]  should never be starting my own car I really hope that that things haven't
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:53.880]  gotten that far out of control that I should be fearful for my life but we
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:57.880]  are very cautious and and I always have you know people around me who are
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.360]  providing security which is is great and it makes me feel very confident and
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:06.160]  and comfortable whenever I go out to speak to the people because I'm more
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:09.840]  than willing to speak to all of the people answer their questions spend
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:15.280]  hours answering questions not just having planted planted questions you've
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:20.520]  been very successful countering him for our nationwide audience please seem to
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:26.560]  be senator from Arizona dr. Kelly Ward how have you been countering McCain how
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:31.320]  are you hitting him in 60 seconds right well you know he's never faced a well
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.200]  educated well-spoken down-to-earth constitution loving woman and so it's
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:38.600]  very difficult for him to overcome so we're pointing out his record I point
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:43.760]  out his record day after day after day he is a big government Republican voting
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.960]  for tax sites bailout massive new spending amnesty liberal judges calling
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:52.800]  the people who want to stop obama care of wacko birds you know all of those
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:55.880]  things but the thing that's going to be most important from people in your
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:00.400]  audience is to get on my website and to donate to this campaign whether it's
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:04.360]  five dollars fifteen dollars twenty dollars two thousand seven hundred
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:09.080]  dollars the maximum because that money is going to enable me to fight senator
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:12.600]  McCain who has a lot of money himself so I've got to have money to be able to
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:17.560]  win so that's Kelly Ward com quick but I will personally pop a drinker but I'll
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:21.640]  pop a bottle of champagne of McCain goes down he is one of the nastiest people

[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:12.560]  being a senator I mean she's only 9 10 12 points 8 points 9 points in the lower
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:17.640]  polls against McCain but this day and age I mean fraud so out in the open they
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:21.960]  make a mountain say he is awarded it for life and then his children and his
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:26.360]  daughter has it like North Korea that maybe her daughter or her son it's
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:32.040]  crazy but Kelly Ward dot com certainly shows the fact that she is surging Kelly
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:36.040]  Ward comms the site but think of the movie Idiocracy I was noticing one of
[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:41.120]  these big national scientific polls and then one of voters showed 45 percent for
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:47.040]  Kelly Ward it's now closer to 50 36% for McCain and unsure 20% that's from the
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:53.200]  movie Idiocracy how could 20% be unsure or not sure here's a clip of some of
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:56.720]  those voters from the movie Idiocracy please speak your name as it appears on

[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  my name is Joe is complete please wait while I tattoo your new identity on
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.960]  your arm that's basically where we're going so Dr. Ward let's talk about
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:38.480]  Obamacare in the four or five minutes left we have and how we reach out to the
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:44.240]  20% that's not sure oh my goodness that was that was so funny but so so sad that
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:48.060]  it almost is true you know Obamacare really is an
[02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:52.960]  abomination you have to you have to know I'm a practicing physician which I
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:56.800]  think we need more practicing people of all different kinds of people that have
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:00.640]  jobs to go to Washington and every time I work in the emergency department I
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:04.080]  used to say I see the good the bad and the ugly of Obamacare but really there
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:07.880]  is no good I see a lot of bad and a lot of ugly I see a lot of people who have
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:12.200]  no skin in the game who show up just the last time I worked I saw a girl who was
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:17.160]  27 or 28 years old who has been to the ER 30 times now not 30 times in her life
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:23.320]  30 times since June and there's no accountability whatsoever so we've got
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:27.560]  to fully repeal Obamacare I've got a plan out called the patient power plan
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:32.480]  it's my first policy proposal because we need new fresh bold ideas in
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.000]  Washington DC and we aren't getting those out of people who are there
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.960]  especially not out of Senator McCain the last idea I think he had was McCain
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:43.360]  find gold it was over a decade ago and it was a terrible idea so my patient
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.680]  power plan it is a full repeal of Obamacare including all of the taxes
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:51.080]  and regulations that go along with it that's going to save us billions if not
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:54.840]  trillions of dollars and more importantly it puts the power of
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:58.080]  healthcare back where it belongs it takes it away from insurance company
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:02.880]  executives and politicians and bureaucrats and puts it smack dab in the
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.520]  hands of patients because we all as patients deserve the healthcare that we
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:11.320]  want and the healthcare that we need rather than having to settle for what
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:16.360]  little tiny bit the government is willing to give us and so if we can get
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:20.840]  that inactive get the free market back into healthcare you know get some
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.880]  responsibility back into healthcare and clear out the murkiness that the
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:29.560]  hospitals and the insurance company has inserted into our healthcare process we
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:33.600]  are going to have a lot more healthy people in this country and our economy
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:38.440]  is going to store well I remember hearing about Obamacare eight years ago it
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:42.840]  was gonna be free when he was running for office and then I read the bill five
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:47.040]  years ago they got worse and worse and death panels and doubling and tripping
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:51.800]  prices and can't keep your doctors and then I go to a clinic or something and
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:55.080]  I see these people coming in saying well last time once this was being
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:58.480]  implemented a few years ago my bill was half this big now it's double and they
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:03.200]  say we're sorry ma'am we're sorry sir it's Obamacare and then my dad himself
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:07.640]  was in healthcare management not just a doctor and he got out of it not because
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:11.560]  the profits not being good but because it was so corrupt he said if you're part
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:15.440]  of the establishment and join with it you rip people off but it's designed to
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:20.360]  shut down smaller hospital groups smaller clinic groups it's just a giant
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:25.360]  screw job and since then I've talked to big hospital group owners and they say
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:30.040]  man we've never been making more money this is the greatest scam on earth but
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.040]  we can't see it going on forever we can't believe they made this legal I
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:39.320]  mean I don't think the public understands how criminal this was a dream of
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:44.560]  big mega hospitals and foreign bank owned insurance companies to screw job
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:48.160]  the American people even the Wall Street Journal had to admit in the first year
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:53.400]  of a supplementation globally insurance companies had a 47 plus percent increase
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:59.200]  in profit just on fleecing us this is the definition of industrial level
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:04.960]  looting right and and you can see that it's at its end of its rope because you've
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:09.040]  got big companies like United Health Care and etna who are saying that they're
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:13.120]  thinking about getting out because even with all of those subsidies even with
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:17.080]  all of that money flowing into their pockets and into their coffers they are
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:21.280]  losing money last year United Health Care lost 720 million dollars and they're
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:25.120]  coming out and saying we don't know if this Obamacare is sustainable right they
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:29.560]  want a 3-4 year screw job then act like they're against it get out of it and then
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.400]  the system's already wrecked then they got a single pair it's amazing when you
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:36.920]  know what you're talking about Kelly Ward calm Kelly Ward you're amazing I'm
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:39.960]  gonna pray you get into the Senate and I want everybody to donate immediately

[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:04.440]  Ted Cruz ignores the real source of radical Islam and that is the special
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:09.360]  relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia presidential candidate
[02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:14.080]  Ted Cruz sidestepped his proposal to patrol Muslim neighborhoods during an
[02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:17.840]  interview with CNN if you have a neighborhood where there is a high
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:21.360]  level of gang activity the way to prevent it is you increase the law
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:25.280]  enforcement presence there and you target the gang members to get them off
[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:29.480]  the street I am talking about any area where there is a higher incidence of
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:34.080]  radical Islamic terrorism Cruz completely sidestepped the real issue that is
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:38.800]  the creation promotion and support of radical Islamic terrorists by Saudi
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:43.560]  Arabia and the United States as a political opportunist supported by
[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:48.400]  Goldman Sachs the CFR and the establishment Cruz must embrace the
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:53.640]  terror war narrative and its lies delusions emissions and misrepresentations

[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:44.440]  flip something in my head but everywhere else folks you're told what to say and
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:48.640]  what to do and that dovetails the video coming up video dissidents disrupt

[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:15.240]  bombings killing at least 30 and wounding 230 world leaders raise their
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:20.080]  voices to once again demonstrate their true lack of understanding of the
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:25.000]  perspective of the people instead bleeding out like sheep the same old
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:31.040]  message of vigilance and security theater we have all grown to loathe
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:40.040]  per petre faisant de nombreux morts et plusieurs dizaine de blessé gendarmes

[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:13.560]  massacres should be a clear indication that the claims of ices that this is
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:18.680]  only the start of the storm aren't to be taken lightly and these attacks were
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:23.160]  undertaken by a wave of ices that was allowed to grow in the belly of europe
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:29.440]  like a cancer a caliphate disguised as the huddled masses but it was republican
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:34.160]  presidential candidate donald trump whose comments flew through the fog of new
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:39.000]  world order drivel to alert those with ears to listen with the chopping off of
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.720]  the heads and what's going on the brutality you've got to hit ices so
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:46.640]  hard and you've got to take them out and not play tiddly winks like we're
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:51.080]  playing right now there's something going on Maria go to brussels go to
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:56.040]  paris go to different places there's something going on and it's not good
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:59.880]  where they want your real law where they want this where they want things that
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:03.560]  you know there has to be some assimilation there is no assimilation
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:07.200]  where do you think of the new york times they took you to task about your
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:11.280]  assessment of brussels were you right of course i mean you take a look at it
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:15.800]  brussels is a disaster republican presidential candidate ted cruise
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:20.640]  played his hand early immediately demonizing trumps rhetoric while the
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:27.520]  body count in belgium continued to rise it is striking that the day after
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:33.520]  donald trump called for america weakening nato withdrawing from nato we
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:42.520]  see brussels where nato is headquartered the subject of a radical islamic
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:48.520]  terrorist attack president obama not to be ignored asked to be indulged on the
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:54.160]  matter and then proceeded to spew out more divisive and failed leadership
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:58.400]  rhetoric please indulge me i want to comment on the terrorist attacks that
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:03.920]  have taken place in brussels and this is yet another reminder that the world
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:13.040]  must unite we must be together regardless of nationality or race or
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:20.320]  faith in fighting against the scourge of terrorism clearly the elite speak a
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:25.040]  completely different language than the average citizen and their new world
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.960]  order motives are blatantly obvious at this point are we all truly prepared to
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:36.480]  endure exponential suicide bombings on the scale and scope witnessed for
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:42.000]  decades in the middle east now shifting to europe and the united states or will
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.880]  we finally hold the globalist puppets that have kidnapped the globe's
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:50.160]  governments accountable for the unyielding horror they are ultimately

[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:11.800]  street rent and he actually might lose his job he actually i guess he thinks he's
[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:16.800]  a good little globalist he shouldn't be told what to do he starts saying what
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:23.440]  what i can't talk quote those in power so this is what short little leashes

[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:45.840]  college tuition see they don't want him to be too strong they want that is the
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:50.360]  promise like the worm on the hook for the bass there's not really you know
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:57.160]  anything but a hook waiting for you just like cuba or china or anything all
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.280]  that's waiting for you is multinational corporations who are about the law
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:05.360]  coming in and your slave labor for them selective companies coming in not
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:09.320]  competition not companies battling over getting you to work for him and paying
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:15.440]  you more but screwing you over and so he wants to look like the good little
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:19.280]  populist commie and say he's all for it oh no no no you don't do that you don't
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:24.320]  promise free stuff and see they want to blame wall street in general most of
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:27.200]  wall street's just companies and businesses and you know there's a
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:30.800]  company of a thousand people that's publicly traded it's on wall street no
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:35.360]  it's Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and a few other mega banks that are consolidating
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:39.280]  and rigging the stock market the interest rates the currencies the flash
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:43.520]  trading it's all admitted to be rigged member ten years ago I was crazy I told
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:47.080]  you it was all rigged the gold market everything now they admit it remember I
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:53.560]  told you I was a crazy man I told you that well just basically all this was
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:57.280]  happening but now it's out in the open Chris Matthews told to stop talking
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:01.480]  here's the amazing video see the whole thing at info wars calm right now
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:04.920]  that's about competing in so we're too wealthy people on Wall Street as he

[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:15.160]  back to society and so I think that just am I supposed to stop talking no
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:21.760]  okay somebody just told me to no please don't okay and I think that I think so
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:24.800]  you have one man is very effective at talking about the individual and
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:30.960]  competing in some of competing claims of say we know what they are and that's
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:37.080]  what they do I've been there on CNN MSNBC you name it where they're going well
[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:40.240]  they're talking to you then they'll just shut the segment off end it and kick me

[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.720]  opened up but it's not opened up it's to select corporations and to select
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:07.120]  people to then go exploit the population of Cuba it's sick and then Raul

[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:48.320]  of good yeah this is a rule everything they're dominating everything i mean
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:50.960]  when the when the globals are trying to use the right to take over i was
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:54.800]  talking about that problem go ahead i know um
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:58.560]  the power of god i got a one verse for you uh this is god speaking so you can
[03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:02.880]  use and say this is what god says he says in in jeremiah 422 he says my
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:06.480]  people are is foolish they have not known me they are
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:10.000]  sorry that word translates to stupid so if you read it they have not known me
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.720]  they are stupid children and they have no
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:16.560]  understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:20.480]  see what they have a knowledge of evil and how to act like morons but not how
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:24.400]  to be honorable what's the word that translates to stupid again
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:27.360]  it's sad it's an old Celtic or a breton word
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:32.000]  sod or sod it translates stupid but the thing of it is if you even cause one
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.760]  because you reach million if you even cause one of the lefties or anybody
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:38.640]  else to actually crack the book and say well god said i was stupid just to
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:42.080]  look for themselves i'll tell you what um alice even the angels
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:44.880]  rejoice for somebody that you know maybe you never cracked the bible you know
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:47.280]  what i'm saying no i hear you and i'm not saying i'm
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:50.960]  super smart either but when you talk to a bug-eyed leftist
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:54.560]  they want to ban free speech they want to arrest everybody they're not even
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:57.680]  liberal but notice left right paradigms only 100 years
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:01.120]  old before the left meant the occult devil worship
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:05.120]  luciferianism the left hand path left hand rise above
[03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:08.960]  so all of this is hiding in plain view and that's why so many times
[03:03:08.960 --> 03:03:14.880]  these are lovers of death this is a cult group the problem is the right wing
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:18.400]  is the very same group at the top great points god bless you terry
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:22.480]  leon magnus coming up in like five minutes let's go to andrew in ohio
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:26.560]  talking about pc culture which boils down to being drug off for free speech
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:30.960]  go ahead andrew hey alex how are you doing today i'm doing all right my friend
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:34.000]  i'm doing good all right so i just wanted to talk quickly about pc culture
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:37.520]  and how it relates to i tried to give someone some of the wake up america
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:42.800]  coffee so first off political correctness has become so 1984 in europe
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:46.640]  in the media that police in europe are ordered to give personal home visits to
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:49.920]  people who speak their common sense opinions to try to scare them into
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:52.800]  silence sure now that was in the news today if you if muslim
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:57.120]  celebrated in the school and you talked about it the police came to visit you
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:00.960]  yeah it's just so bizarre i cannot believe it's going on if you're raped in
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:04.160]  sweden they tell you what's their culture don't complain
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:07.760]  they're even allowed to have sex with children because it's their quote
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:11.840]  culture they are god go ahead it's insanity
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:16.480]  so i i actually gave a family member a bag of a wake up america coffee
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:20.240]  and i didn't know their political views or anything like that but i guess they
[03:04:20.240 --> 03:04:24.720]  they weren't a big fan of the info wars outlet i don't know i didn't really know
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:28.160]  so i gave them this present for christmas it was a wake up america coffee and
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:31.760]  they opened it and they just gasped they're like no like
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:35.200]  they were literally they were so scared they were getting this wake up america

[03:08:23.600 --> 03:08:28.000]  welcome back to the alex jones radio show i am leon macadoo taking over for
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:31.280]  alex jones here as we enter the fourth hour
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:35.760]  the overdrive hour now before the break we were speaking with andrew in
[03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:39.040]  ohio and he was talking about the pc culture
[03:08:39.040 --> 03:08:42.560]  and how extreme it is that his family member rather than
[03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:47.520]  saying thank you for some awesome coffee was shocked utterly shocked so andrew
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:52.000]  go ahead and finish your story yeah it was just it was a really
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:55.360]  interesting experience i mean i kind of got upset when they they kind of looked
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:58.160]  at the bag of coffee like i had just given them
[03:08:58.160 --> 03:09:01.920]  a piece of poop or something i don't know they just look scared at it and
[03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:05.520]  it just kind of upset me but i later learned that they were obama supporters
[03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:08.880]  and i think that that may have been part of the reason why they were kind of
[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:14.320]  scared of the whole info wars name but um yeah i was just uh
[03:09:14.320 --> 03:09:18.640]  yeah i was appalled well see and that's you know obviously their ideology isn't
[03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:21.440]  that strong to begin with if they can be
[03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:26.880]  challenged by a bag of coffee delicious coffee might i add we drink it every day
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:30.720]  here in the office and so this whole pc culture before the
[03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:34.160]  break alex was playing the video of the dissidents
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:38.080]  interrupting a live broadcast there in cuba and they're being dragged off by
[03:09:38.080 --> 03:09:41.920]  the neck uh because obviously the castor regime
[03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:46.800]  doesn't want any anything to spoil their visit with president obama
[03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:50.400]  and a lot of these protesters who are going and disrupting the trump rally and
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:52.800]  stuff i mean they need to take a look they think this
[03:09:52.800 --> 03:09:57.280]  socialism and communism is so is so great look at what's going to happen
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:01.200]  if you manage to shut down people's free speech because it
[03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:05.840]  offends you you're going to get dragged away just like those dissidents were
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:09.440]  there in cuba um well andrew thank you so much
[03:10:09.440 --> 03:10:14.160]  for you know fighting against your family's
[03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:18.320]  kind of ideology in this in this case and supporting the info war we really
[03:10:18.320 --> 03:10:23.760]  definitely appreciate that um so switching gears here
[03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:26.800]  kind of want to talk about the updates with this
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:30.320]  bombing that took place yesterday in brussels and of course
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:33.840]  it's the day after now and sort of the same things
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:37.280]  happening after every single attack here again
[03:10:37.280 --> 03:10:41.520]  the bomber brothers were known by interpol they were put on interpol
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:45.600]  but they were still able to provide ammunition for the paris attacks they
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:48.720]  were able to rent apartments for the brussels
[03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:52.560]  mastermind and so these people they were able to evade
[03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:57.680]  security services despite being notorious gangland criminals and they
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:00.880]  had already been placed on a worldwide terror
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:04.640]  watch list so and of course now this
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:08.160]  the fact that they're now being tied in uh directly linked
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:11.600]  to the paris massacre this is the first time we're learning that yes
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:15.520]  indeed they're all linked there but it's since emerged
[03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:20.000]  that they have extensive criminal records both of them had been jailed
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:23.440]  for crimes uh one of them was listed on an interpol
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:27.440]  red notice which is an alert that's given to police forces around the world
[03:11:27.440 --> 03:11:30.880]  saying that he was wanted in belgium on terrorism charges
[03:11:30.880 --> 03:11:34.640]  yet they were still allowed to play a major role
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:37.680]  providing ammunition and renting out safe houses
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:41.040]  where the brussels and paris attacks were plotted
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:44.640]  additionally turkey reveals that they arrested
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:48.240]  one of the brussels bombers in june and they deported him
[03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:52.560]  back to belgium and they even warned that he was a militant
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:55.600]  so again we have warnings of these people how are they allowed to slip
[03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:59.360]  through as we've reported they were protected there in the
[03:11:59.360 --> 03:12:04.560]  mullen beak neighborhood for months now this revelation comes after it's
[03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:08.160]  been revealed that one of the suicide bombers left a note
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:11.600]  telling how he was desperate to blow himself up because he didn't want to go
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:17.120]  to prison like his friend oh what a big baby so he would just
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:21.120]  decided that this was the the best option to to go ahead and
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:26.320]  commit this atrocity and in addition to being warned about these
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:31.200]  people on the interval interpol list belgium intelligence had precise
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:34.560]  warning that the airport was targeted for a bombing
[03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:37.200]  but they i don't know if they were understaffed or they just weren't
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:41.120]  focusing on the airport but again there was a precise warning that it was
[03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:43.840]  targeted so they know this is going to happen
[03:12:43.840 --> 03:12:47.920]  again the warnings were ignored and then let's talk about the reaction
[03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:52.320]  afterward so here again we're going back to free speech and how important it is
[03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:55.600]  well a yoga instructor tweeted something out
[03:12:55.600 --> 03:12:59.120]  about being shocked about how there were muslim children in class
[03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:03.280]  celebrating this brussels attack and then he says you know how do you remember
[03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:07.840]  the lesson if there is in your class it's being applauded by muslim children
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:12.240]  so then a few hours later he tweeted out again that three police officers had
[03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:16.480]  visited his house and that he would no longer be tweeting
[03:13:16.480 --> 03:13:20.560]  so just the simple fact that we have children in a class
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:24.800]  celebrating this shows that this is not isolated ideology
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:28.160]  and again being protect protected in those neighborhoods for months
[03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:32.000]  walking around going to the grocery store even after the person's
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:35.120]  face has been put up on a most wanted list and still being allowed to go
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:38.640]  shopping obviously we have some major intimidation going on in these
[03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:43.600]  neighborhoods but as well it's not an isolated ideology
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:47.840]  and of course online isis is running a poll what will be the color of the eiffel
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:50.880]  tower next and this is an online forum they're
[03:13:50.880 --> 03:13:55.440]  quizzing their gleeful supporters about the location of the terror groups
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:14:02.080]  next attack and according to this poll the united kingdom seems to be the next
[03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:05.600]  major hit one of the users affiliated with this
[03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:08.560]  group tweeted the islamic state will attack London
[03:14:08.560 --> 03:14:13.840]  Washington Rome and all the infidels capitals and of course they celebrated
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:18.160]  by passing out candy to children in syria
[03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:21.760]  and i saw those pictures and the people there are extremely unhappy and you can
[03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:26.160]  tell that they're just in fear of these isis criminals
[03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:29.680]  that have taken over but you know it's not just isis supporters
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:32.880]  out there laughing smiling celebrating in the face of this attack
[03:14:32.880 --> 03:14:36.880]  it's also the leader of the free world president obama
[03:14:36.880 --> 03:14:40.640]  is out there smiling and laughing and doing the wave
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:43.920]  with Castro you know you don't send a picture of yourself
[03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:47.920]  laughing when people have just been blown up and of course
[03:14:47.920 --> 03:14:51.280]  now i want to go to this report by paul joseph watson
[03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:55.600]  he is explaining that enough is enough and it's time
[03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:59.680]  to stop defending islam so let's go to that report how many
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:03.120]  europeans need to be slaughtered before we acknowledge
[03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:08.720]  that islam is not a religion of peace how many bloodstained bodies and limbs
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:12.160]  need to be strewn across airports and metro stations
[03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:16.320]  before we admit that islam has a problem with violence
[03:15:16.320 --> 03:15:19.840]  putting a filter on your facebook photo
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:25.520]  is not going to reduce terror starting a sympathetic hashtag on twitter
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:30.000]  is not going to reduce terror creating a sappy cartoon
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:33.840]  is not going to reduce terror hugging a muslim
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:38.480]  is not going to reduce terror calling someone an islamophobe
[03:15:38.480 --> 03:15:43.760]  is not going to reduce terror the only thing that will reduce terror is
[03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:49.280]  acknowledging and countering its root ideology islam and just to
[03:15:49.280 --> 03:15:54.960]  remind you islam is a belief system not a race
[03:15:54.960 --> 03:16:01.120]  it's not racist to criticize a religion this has nothing to do with islam
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:05.360]  they were lecturers once again yet in the past 30 days alone
[03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:09.440]  there have been 23 islamic attacks in 22 countries
[03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:16.720]  1,018 people killed 2008 people injured just in the last 30
[03:16:16.720 --> 03:16:20.480]  days but the usual suspects like george galloway
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:25.440]  immediately tried to absolve islam of blame by pointing to foreign policy
[03:16:25.440 --> 03:16:29.360]  and yes the west's policy in arming jihadists in libya and syria
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:35.120]  was a disaster but brussels suspended its bombing campaign against isis in syria
[03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:39.280]  eight months ago belgium hardly has a reputation
[03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:44.320]  for being a murderous invading empire you're only blaming foreign policy so
[03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:48.880]  you don't have to acknowledge that islam has a violence problem
[03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:52.880]  it's far more likely that this was a revenge attack for the capture of
[03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:57.600]  paris massacre culprit salar abdeslam who by the way
[03:16:57.600 --> 03:17:01.600]  was able to hide in brussels for four months
[03:17:01.600 --> 03:17:05.360]  because he was helped by the residents of mollenbeek
[03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:09.440]  proving once again that terrorism has far more support
[03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:12.800]  amongst muslims than the politically correct media
[03:17:12.800 --> 03:17:17.200]  will ever recognize residents of mollenbeek even rioted
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:23.680]  and attacked the police during salar's arrest calling the terrorist their hero
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:28.720]  these terrorists emerge out of the same ghettos that leftists celebrate
[03:17:28.720 --> 03:17:33.600]  in the name of diversity the same muslim no go areas that the media
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:37.040]  and politicians claim are a conspiracy theory
[03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:41.200]  even as film crews are attacked every time they go near them
[03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:52.480]  hello how are you but who did some on the left blame for the brussels attack
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:57.440]  you guessed it it's donald trump because he might have said mean things that
[03:17:57.440 --> 03:18:01.600]  offended the poor terrorists even though trump warned about
[03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:05.280]  brussels and was criticized for it just two months ago
[03:18:05.280 --> 03:18:08.880]  calling the belgium capital a jihadist hellhole
[03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:13.040]  there's something going on and it's not good where they want your real law
[03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:16.400]  where they want this where they want things that you know there has to be
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:19.840]  some assimilation there is no assimilation there's something
[03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:23.920]  bad going on and until we find out what it is so we can correct it
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:27.600]  you go to brussels i was in brussels a long time ago 20 years ago
[03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:32.640]  so beautiful everything's so beautiful it's like living in a hellhole right now
[03:18:32.640 --> 03:18:36.640]  you go to these different places there's something going on foreign policy
[03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:42.400]  donald trump even climate change the left will search for any excuse
[03:18:42.400 --> 03:18:47.840]  to avoid having to face the truth islam is not a religion of peace
[03:18:47.840 --> 03:18:51.920]  how many times will violent islamists have to prove this
[03:18:51.920 --> 03:18:56.160]  before anything changes islam needs a reformation
[03:18:56.160 --> 03:18:59.120]  by immediately labeling anyone who makes this argument
[03:18:59.120 --> 03:19:03.120]  a racist or an islamophobe you're preventing that
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:07.280]  reformation you're allowing extremists to dominate the conversation
[03:19:07.280 --> 03:19:11.600]  because smart and sensible people including muslim reformists
[03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:16.560]  are being intimidated into silence you're contributing to the deadly
[03:19:16.560 --> 03:19:21.280]  naivety that paved the way for europe's open border
[03:19:21.280 --> 03:19:24.560]  madness you're contributing to the absurd notion
[03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:29.600]  that mass unrestrained multiculturalism works it doesn't work
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:35.840]  mollenbeek proves it doesn't work today's attacks prove it doesn't work
[03:19:35.840 --> 03:19:39.440]  how many more attacks in major european cities
[03:19:39.440 --> 03:19:42.720]  will we have to witness before we acknowledge
[03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:49.280]  that it doesn't work all right and that was paul joseph watson once again with

[03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:15.680]  then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into
[03:20:15.680 --> 03:20:19.120]  buying a timeshare they don't need they don't want and they can't afford
[03:20:19.120 --> 03:20:21.840]  and then they're stuck with that thing forever monthly payments mortgage

[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:14.160]  overdrive hour leon macadoo now we want to talk a little bit about the results
[03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:16.560]  of the primaries that took place in arizona and
[03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:20.160]  utah yesterday so donald trump won the primary
[03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:24.720]  in arizona he'll get 58 of the delegates there
[03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:30.160]  it's winner take all and then cruz with 71 of the vote in utah
[03:24:30.160 --> 03:24:33.600]  meaning he'll get 40 of the state's delegates now
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:36.880]  you know maybe if i hadn't really been paying any attention i'd just say oh
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:41.040]  okay cruz fine he gets 70 of the vote those people in utah must really like
[03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:46.000]  him well of course we were instantly getting
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:50.640]  some reports of voters feeling that there was some scandal going on some
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:54.880]  voting fraud a person actually wrote into one of the forums on godlike
[03:24:54.880 --> 03:24:58.240]  productions that uh they literally had over 50
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:03.200]  ballots in their hand at one time because they were just passing out ballots
[03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:05.760]  there was only about 120 people there so they just
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:10.000]  passed a stack of 250 and said you know take one and pass it down and
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:13.120]  this person ended up with a huge stack you can see the picture
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:17.120]  of that stack they took a picture of and then of course so
[03:25:17.120 --> 03:25:22.480]  luckily this person's honest he didn't fill out as many ballots as he wanted to
[03:25:22.480 --> 03:25:27.200]  points out that they weren't taking there was no controls no credential checks
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:31.520]  no id checks and ballots just being handed around like napkins
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:35.360]  then he said he visited another precinct caucus to see if the same thing was
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:39.440]  going on they didn't even ask him for id when he entered the building
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:43.600]  and the same thing was happening there with just these ballots being passed
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:48.800]  around willy nilly and also uh he says about 15
[03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:52.320]  minutes later with only 10 or so people milling around because a lot of people
[03:25:52.320 --> 03:25:56.880]  left once they cast their vote someone walked into the room with an envelope
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:26:02.000]  stuffed full of absentee ballots so some of the envelopes had
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:05.920]  two to five or more ballots and he said you know is this
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:09.760]  isn't there an absentee process already in place didn't people have to register
[03:26:09.760 --> 03:26:14.320]  for that last week and they said oh no no no this is completely normal
[03:26:14.320 --> 03:26:18.160]  totally normal that we would just all of a sudden bring in a big
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:21.440]  envelope stuff with ballots and saying that these are absentee
[03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:25.600]  ballots and then so in one precinct crews got around 100
[03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:30.880]  trump had two in case it had zero and maybe that wouldn't be so odd if the
[03:26:30.880 --> 03:26:35.040]  it was just completely off from what we've been seeing around the country
[03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:39.440]  now wired magazine reported about how utah's online caucus is giving security
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:43.280]  experts heart attacks because they pretty much agree that letting people
[03:26:43.280 --> 03:26:48.320]  vote online is a very bad idea and talking about this smartmatic
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:51.280]  company which is going to be managing the electronic voting systems
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:54.560]  and internet voting yeah they can take all the precautions they want
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:26:59.200]  but they can't do anything to secure the laptops smartphones and
[03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:03.120]  other personal devices that voters are going to be using to vote online
[03:27:03.120 --> 03:27:07.520]  and as we've reported uh there's a george soros board member who's
[03:27:07.520 --> 03:27:12.400]  chairing the firm that's running the online voting for the caucus there
[03:27:12.400 --> 03:27:17.520]  in utah now i want to go to this clip this is from 2011 there's a programmer
[03:27:17.520 --> 03:27:22.480]  testifying that he was asked to rig voting machine software so let's go to
[03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:33.760]  that clip
[03:27:33.760 --> 03:27:36.880]  mr curtis would you please state your full name for the record
[03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:40.880]  uh name is clinton eugene curtis and where do you reside
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:44.880]  howl i see florid and what is your profession i'm a computer programmer
[03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:47.520]  would you please speak into the microphone so the audience can hear your
[03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:52.240]  testimony i'm a computer programmer mr curtis are there programs that can
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:57.200]  be used to secretly fix elections yes how do you know that'd be the case
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:28:03.360]  because in october of 2000 i wrote a prototype for president congressman
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:06.480]  tom feney at the company i worked for in obito
[03:28:06.480 --> 03:28:10.960]  florida that did just that and when you say did just that it would rig an
[03:28:10.960 --> 03:28:14.240]  election it would flip the vote 51 49
[03:28:14.240 --> 03:28:18.240]  but whoever you wanted to go to and whichever race you wanted to win
[03:28:18.240 --> 03:28:21.920]  and would that program that you designed be something that elections
[03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:26.080]  officials that might be on county boards of elections could detect
[03:28:26.080 --> 03:28:33.200]  they'd never see it mr okay and so that's you know
[03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:36.880]  that's a very poignant statement that he makes he says they would never see it
[03:28:36.880 --> 03:28:39.600]  they'd never know you'd have to have access there
[03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:43.600]  to be able to see the source code but here he's admitting that yes programmers
[03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:47.440]  can create this it's very easy and he was asked to do it
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:52.000]  and and he did he was asked by a powerful republican legislator to create this
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:56.160]  vote rigging software and then when you go back to this wired article
[03:28:56.160 --> 03:28:59.440]  where it says that this new online process
[03:28:59.440 --> 03:29:04.080]  was spearheaded by a utah gop chairman james evans
[03:29:04.080 --> 03:29:07.600]  who was looking for ways to make the caucus process more convenient and
[03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:10.880]  accessible for voters right because it's been wrong
[03:29:10.880 --> 03:29:15.840]  all of these decades he says evan says he was aware of the potential security
[03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:18.960]  risks but he dismissed these off-sided
[03:29:18.960 --> 03:29:23.280]  vulnerabilities as far-fetched so we already know that there is a
[03:29:23.280 --> 03:29:26.560]  whole system being rigged to game the system
[03:29:26.560 --> 03:29:30.880]  and that's why everything is very odd there in utah and as we know
[03:29:30.880 --> 03:29:35.200]  george soros's board member is backing the smartmatic firm
[03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:38.880]  which is in charge of these online machines so
[03:29:38.880 --> 03:29:42.800]  i think if we go online with our voting it's just
[03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:47.760]  bye-bye to our supposed democracy we'll be right back
[03:29:47.760 --> 03:29:51.600]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:51.600 --> 03:29:56.480]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.560 --> 03:30:02.800]  ted cruz ignores the real source of radical islam
[03:30:02.800 --> 03:30:07.040]  and that is the special relationship between the united states
[03:30:07.040 --> 03:30:10.080]  and saudi arabia presidential candidate ted cruz
[03:30:10.080 --> 03:30:14.720]  sidestepped his proposal to patrol muslim neighborhoods during an interview
[03:30:14.720 --> 03:30:18.480]  with cnn if you have a neighborhood where there is a high level of gang
[03:30:18.480 --> 03:30:21.840]  activity the way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement
[03:30:21.840 --> 03:30:26.160]  presence there and you target the gang members to get them off the street i am

[03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:42.640]  by saudi arabia and the united states as a political opportunist

[03:35:18.160 --> 03:35:22.480]  12 pounds and just 12 pounds and six days and then
[03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:27.040]  the the second time i did it i didn't have as i think i lost like three or
[03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:29.840]  four pounds but i noticed the um well you had
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:34.080]  already kind of flushed a lot out of your blood yeah that was uh
[03:35:34.080 --> 03:35:39.680]  you know it was a few months later but i noticed that um my body became
[03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:43.040]  you could feel it detoxify because for two days i felt like garbage and then
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:45.840]  the third day i felt amazing i woke up i had energy
[03:35:45.840 --> 03:35:49.840]  stayed up for about 18 hours just felt great yeah and that's something that a
[03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:52.480]  lot of people might experience they might have
[03:35:52.480 --> 03:35:56.000]  some skin issues and things for those first couple of days while their body
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:36:00.240]  is detoxing but then once those toxins are out and you might have to do it a
[03:36:00.240 --> 03:36:03.840]  couple of times but once those toxins are out you have glowing skin i know i
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:07.600]  did and i felt tremendous and i have a pair of
[03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:10.960]  genes that i can actually button again and that's like a whole
[03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:14.160]  a full body paradigm shift i've got a mental paradigm shift here somebody
[03:36:14.160 --> 03:36:17.600]  sent me this email just let me read this this is from charles sent this to me
[03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:20.240]  this morning because i took down my rebel flag which
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:23.440]  you can't buy in ebay anymore and peeled the nra sticker off the front door
[03:36:23.440 --> 03:36:27.280]  i disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy-ass neighborhood watch
[03:36:27.280 --> 03:36:31.520]  i bought two pakistani flags and put one at the corner of of my front yard each
[03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:34.240]  corner of my front yard then i purchased a black flag of isis which i
[03:36:34.240 --> 03:36:38.160]  could buy in ebay and ran up the flagpole now the local police sheriff fbi
[03:36:38.160 --> 03:36:41.200]  cia nsa homeland security and secret service and other agencies are watching
[03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:45.280]  my house 24 7 i've never felt safer and i'm saving 29 95 a month
[03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:50.160]  that 80 80 t used to charge me i also bought burkas for my family when we
[03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:53.680]  shop or travel everyone moves out of the way and security can't pat us down
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:57.520]  hot damn safe at last ain't the older public great or what
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:01.040]  i thought that was really yeah it kind of sums it all up
[03:37:01.040 --> 03:37:04.400]  in there it's the way our security system works in fact i think alex is
[03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:08.880]  about to do a facebook mentions about these planes that are landing
[03:37:08.880 --> 03:37:13.040]  in airports around the country and people are just being let through customs
[03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:18.800]  and they say well it's a snafu there's no snafu i've traveled internationally
[03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:21.680]  you funnel into one area you're not getting out without going through
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:23.920]  customs right and you know then you have the
[03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:26.320]  illegal immigrants that they're flying around the country letting them fly
[03:37:26.320 --> 03:37:30.240]  pieces of paper meanwhile what do we have just yesterday it was
[03:37:30.240 --> 03:37:34.960]  announced that the vaunted viper teams are starting back up as a result of this
[03:37:34.960 --> 03:37:38.000]  paris attack i've got a short clip from cnn
[03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:42.800]  this is the viper teams now clip guys and starts off off of the cnn reporter
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:47.040]  so these teams are basically set up to go to every
[03:37:47.040 --> 03:37:50.480]  form of transportation bus stations train stations
[03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:54.160]  highways and i've even got video of them practicing on highways a few years ago
[03:37:54.160 --> 03:37:57.840]  we put that in police state for the rise of fema because people don't believe
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:00.880]  this stuff when you show it to them back then like oh it doesn't yeah well now
[03:38:00.880 --> 03:38:05.280]  they've activated the viper team so let's go to that clip now
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:09.360]  the tsa is preparing to launch a specialized group
[03:38:09.360 --> 03:38:14.880]  a specialized unit at airports in major cities in so-called viper teams they
[03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:20.240]  use everything from bomb sniffing dogs to advanced specialized screening
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:24.240]  tonight us cities nationwide are on heightened alert
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:28.400]  new york city is stepping up its police and national guard presence
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:32.800]  high visibility anti-terrorist patrols can be seen in the subway system
[03:38:32.800 --> 03:38:37.440]  where officers are checking bags for explosives signs at new york's pen
[03:38:37.440 --> 03:38:40.560]  station alert passengers about random checks
[03:38:40.560 --> 03:38:44.560]  and the city's three major airports have heightened security as well
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:47.760]  expect to see uh extraordinary nyp
[03:38:47.760 --> 03:38:51.840]  full body cavity service coming days going on as a sign of our readiness to
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:54.480]  protect people at all times but we're not going to be violating the
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:57.840]  constitutional rights of people and and surveilling those neighborhoods that
[03:38:57.840 --> 03:39:01.920]  are miami and lots of beds for jihadism yeah we don't want to be racist and
[03:39:01.920 --> 03:39:04.560]  actually go look at people we just want to pat everyone down
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:07.200]  everyone you see how they're bringing the old lady up and come here old lady
[03:39:07.200 --> 03:39:10.320]  i'm gonna check your bag kids in wheelchairs like a terrorist
[03:39:10.320 --> 03:39:14.640]  because you know if they if they do any type of profiling oh that'd be bad
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:18.640]  and before we go to the the video from the past which was part of a video i
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:21.920]  did of alex he was trying to educate the tsa and
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:25.520]  i put some clips in there but this is a video from
[03:39:25.520 --> 03:39:29.280]  texas shrugged book uh somebody sent me this
[03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:33.040]  yesterday it came it went out on the 23rd brussel's attack is strange as
[03:39:33.040 --> 03:39:35.920]  paras attack and there's a clip in there which the
[03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:39.600]  guy shows of of when they arrested the mastermind of the
[03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:42.560]  paras attacks they show him running past like
[03:39:42.560 --> 03:39:46.320]  five or six cops he just let him run by him he turns the corner runs down the
[03:39:46.320 --> 03:39:50.080]  street they fire one shot at him and then he's arrested down the street
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:53.680]  and it's just weird and nobody even talks about how weird that is
[03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:56.640]  like it was a dramatic firefight oh they call it a dramatic
[03:39:56.640 --> 03:40:00.160]  firefight there's one shot here you can see the one shot as he comes down and
[03:40:00.160 --> 03:40:04.240]  then there they drag him off and and it goes it gets slower and
[03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:07.120]  slower as we go by you can we'll see a slower version right here
[03:40:07.120 --> 03:40:10.720]  here he comes you can see look they're like stepping out of his way like hey
[03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:13.760]  come on come on up no we didn't grab him
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:17.200]  he's oh i'm gonna fire one shot you'll see it on the corner of the building
[03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:21.200]  the poof of smoke right there one shot he ducks dramatic
[03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:24.240]  firefight well maybe it is dramatic that's the news
[03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:27.040]  it might be dramatic for them because they're dramatic firefighters used to
[03:40:27.040 --> 03:40:30.960]  seeing the the guy also makes a note that every one of
[03:40:30.960 --> 03:40:35.600]  these cops in brussels is now in a in a full face mask
[03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:38.320]  yeah which you see you know only when they're conducting swat rays not when
[03:40:38.320 --> 03:40:42.000]  they're out guarding people and now we have shots of police officers in the
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:46.560]  united states covering their faces the incompetent tsa is now the viper team
[03:40:46.560 --> 03:40:49.840]  yeah and it it's just amazing that so i
[03:40:49.840 --> 03:40:53.120]  i thought that was pretty interesting and that i think coincides with this
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:57.040]  this individual the luckiest guy the luckiest unluckiest guy in the world i
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:01.280]  mean he's he's in three different terror attacks in three different countries
[03:41:01.280 --> 03:41:06.880]  and survives all three yes amazing yeah well it was his third brush with terror
[03:41:06.880 --> 03:41:10.480]  american Mormon 19 left with burns and shrapnel
[03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:15.280]  injuries in brussels attack he also survived boston and paris bombings
[03:41:15.280 --> 03:41:19.760]  now to be clear he he was in paris at the same time i don't think he was
[03:41:19.760 --> 03:41:23.840]  at the bataclan or anywhere where those you know he wasn't at the stadium or
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:27.120]  anything like that however he was a block away from the
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:30.560]  boston marathon bombings and then here he's got burns and
[03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:35.440]  shrapnel injuries who is this guy he's the superhuman terrorist survivor
[03:41:35.440 --> 03:41:39.040]  i mean i don't know what the odds are to be in the area of three different terror
[03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:42.000]  attacks no i mean years apart yeah he's either the
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:45.600]  luckiest guy or i would never want to actually ever go on a vacation with this
[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:48.320]  person ever exactly hey now let's show let's show
[03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:52.240]  people this is part of a clip that we put in police state for the rise of fema
[03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:55.440]  this isn't the exact clip i just went back to the original news report but it
[03:41:55.440 --> 03:41:59.520]  starts off with a guy going through a one of our internal checkpoints that are
[03:41:59.520 --> 03:42:02.480]  a hundred miles away from the border he's being asked
[03:42:02.480 --> 03:42:05.840]  you know who are you are you an american citizen he gives a pretty funny answer
[03:42:05.840 --> 03:42:09.920]  and then it goes into the viper team news report from tennessee
[03:42:09.920 --> 03:42:13.920]  is where it was and so let's go ahead and roll that
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:18.240]  me you're a citizen yeah but does it really matter
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:22.400]  not anymore unfortunately thank you this is honest tennessee is now the first
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:26.960]  state ever to work with the tsa to deploy a simultaneous counter-terrorism
[03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:30.320]  operation statewide yay you know this was a massive
[03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:34.160]  operation really bringing all federal state and local agencies together
[03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:39.520]  so not only do random searches but also create an army of agents on wheels
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:46.320]  you're probably used to seeing these signature blue uniforms at the airport
[03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:50.560]  but now tsa agents are on the interstates fighting terrorism
[03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:55.040]  with visible intervention and response or viper operation
[03:42:55.040 --> 03:42:59.200]  haven't stopped a single terrorist attack look at that all across the state
[03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:02.800]  at five weight stations that's a driver's station state one that is what
[03:43:02.800 --> 03:43:05.440]  they're doing they're preparing for when
[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:08.240]  an attack happens which didn't even happen in our country
[03:43:08.240 --> 03:43:11.360]  yet they're gonna pull out all the security but what's the most
[03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:15.040]  unsecure place in the airport is the entrances where they have everybody
[03:43:15.040 --> 03:43:18.000]  crammed in going through this tsa security right and we've been saying that
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:20.640]  for years and so now of course since this happened in
[03:43:20.640 --> 03:43:25.040]  brussels just the way that we described that's what's that now
[03:43:25.040 --> 03:43:29.520]  they're saying wolf blitzer is asking don't well how far would you go and
[03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:32.960]  do we need to put the tsa now out into the
[03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:36.240]  driveway do we have them in our houses should we have them yes in
[03:43:36.240 --> 03:43:40.880]  our toilet areas the toilet inspection agency yeah we need to give them
[03:43:40.880 --> 03:43:47.280]  24-hour access to our cameras and they'll have just a tsa base where they can
[03:43:47.280 --> 03:43:49.840]  just check in whenever they want to make sure that we're safe
[03:43:49.840 --> 03:43:54.000]  and that's you know it is for our safety and security totally totally uncalled
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:55.920]  for hey before we get to that video that you
[03:43:55.920 --> 03:44:00.080]  want to show i did get a tweet from a guy db who was asking about this one
[03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:03.760]  minute piece that i put on the the air this morning talking this is from hope
[03:44:03.760 --> 03:44:07.440]  girl blog Gardasil vaccine becomes international scandal
[03:44:07.440 --> 03:44:10.560]  and it's talking about two quotes i'll read the first one
[03:44:10.560 --> 03:44:13.840]  i predict Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all time
[03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:16.800]  of all times because at some point in time the evidence will add up to prove
[03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:20.400]  that this vaccine technical and scientific feed it may be has
[03:44:20.400 --> 03:44:24.480]  absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very
[03:44:24.480 --> 03:44:27.520]  many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill
[03:44:27.520 --> 03:44:30.800]  serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers
[03:44:30.800 --> 03:44:33.760]  right and that was a former industry industry
[03:44:33.760 --> 03:44:38.880]  physician who worked for merc and who made the HPV vaccine Gardasil and he
[03:44:38.880 --> 03:44:42.640]  said that back in 2014 and then we had a doctor
[03:44:42.640 --> 03:44:47.760]  sin hang lee who also back in 2014 examined a little girl who died six
[03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:52.320]  months after receiving the Gardasil vaccine and he found DNA fragments
[03:44:52.320 --> 03:44:57.040]  from the viral gene that that were had coalesced with the aluminum that's in
[03:44:57.040 --> 03:44:59.440]  the vaccine and kind of were just sitting in there
[03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:04.000]  and he believes they caused a lethal shock but
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:07.040]  these being inside her brain caused a lethal shock and then
[03:45:07.040 --> 03:45:11.840]  caused her to die so that's uh that's that's from hope girl blog
[03:45:11.840 --> 03:45:15.040]  Gardasil vaccine becomes international scandal stories like this really need to
[03:45:15.040 --> 03:45:17.600]  get out they really do and the fact that the the way
[03:45:17.600 --> 03:45:21.360]  that they educate people on this it actually ups your odds of getting
[03:45:21.360 --> 03:45:24.400]  all the other different kinds of cervical cancer that are out there because
[03:45:24.400 --> 03:45:27.200]  it's only one or two strains that it affects
[03:45:27.200 --> 03:45:31.120]  and if your body is healthy for the most part your immune system is able to
[03:45:31.120 --> 03:45:34.880]  clear that out especially with regular checkups and this is just a dangerous
[03:45:34.880 --> 03:45:38.080]  vaccine and it's not necessary that rick perry tried to ram down
[03:45:38.080 --> 03:45:41.280]  everybody's throat and it was mandatory and we can't forget that
[03:45:41.280 --> 03:45:45.120]  so this is the united states we've shown video of little villages in
[03:45:45.120 --> 03:45:48.480]  mexico where schoolgirls are writhing on the floor having
[03:45:48.480 --> 03:45:52.640]  convulsions like 20 girls at a time are having convulsions after
[03:45:52.640 --> 03:45:55.840]  getting this and the people on camera going we don't know what's going on
[03:45:55.840 --> 03:45:59.280]  nobody will help us you know and and they just keep saying take the vaccine it's
[03:45:59.280 --> 03:46:02.560]  safe and effective safe and effective and then i had to debate that clown from
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:05.520]  the young turks who's just like well some vaccines
[03:46:05.520 --> 03:46:10.080]  should be mandatory just like yeah okay well you sound like a conspiracy
[03:46:10.080 --> 03:46:14.560]  theorist yeah so talking about another conspiracy theory
[03:46:14.560 --> 03:46:20.960]  so there's this new program out and it's a we've seen all these face swapping apps
[03:46:20.960 --> 03:46:24.720]  like you if you're on snapchat they have where you can face swap with people
[03:46:24.720 --> 03:46:29.360]  and now there's a face swapping technology called face to face
[03:46:29.360 --> 03:46:33.200]  and if you guys can go ahead and roll the b-roll for those of us who are
[03:46:33.200 --> 03:46:37.120]  if you're listening watching us on the live stream you can see this video
[03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:42.080]  that's up there but it's face to face it requires only target footage which in
[03:46:42.080 --> 03:46:46.640]  this case they're using footage of George W. Bush or Vladimir Putin
[03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:50.240]  so that they can take they can take an actor or video from
[03:46:50.240 --> 03:46:56.800]  a news broadcast and then there's an actor who on the side it records
[03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:01.520]  their face and so that actor is able to say whatever they want
[03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:05.680]  and it morphs the video on the news broadcast
[03:47:05.680 --> 03:47:10.400]  so it looks like George W. Bush is saying what this actor wants him to say
[03:47:10.400 --> 03:47:14.240]  or it can be a news broadcast with Putin
[03:47:14.240 --> 03:47:17.440]  coming out and saying something and it's just this actor on the side where
[03:47:17.440 --> 03:47:20.560]  it's tracing there and then somebody releases it out
[03:47:20.560 --> 03:47:23.440]  there and then it becomes news through twitter and
[03:47:23.440 --> 03:47:27.760]  before people have any time to realize it's a hoax it's it's done
[03:47:27.760 --> 03:47:30.160]  people would have to go back and actually find the original clip and go no
[03:47:30.160 --> 03:47:32.480]  here's what he actually said this is something else
[03:47:32.480 --> 03:47:36.240]  now they're saying oh it's it's just a university research project at this
[03:47:36.240 --> 03:47:40.560]  point a university so why are they re why
[03:47:40.560 --> 03:47:44.080]  there's nothing about this that you would want to use it for other than
[03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:48.960]  some sort of nefarious project blue beam type thing
[03:47:48.960 --> 03:47:52.480]  yeah or or just create fake news which we've seen the CIA do and now they can
[03:47:52.480 --> 03:47:55.680]  do it on american soil those laws have been lifted
[03:47:55.680 --> 03:47:58.960]  where they can just go and do whatever they want and and you think
[03:47:58.960 --> 03:48:02.240]  you think this university has this technology and nobody else has it
[03:48:02.240 --> 03:48:07.920]  right sadly sadly sadly mistaken i mean this is just what they are showing us
[03:48:07.920 --> 03:48:10.800]  right and so obviously this kind of technology
[03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:13.920]  already exists the things are already out there so
[03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:18.880]  just be aware that you really do have to be conscious of what they're showing you
[03:48:18.880 --> 03:48:22.080]  i mean we've seen the videos with the with the
[03:48:22.080 --> 03:48:26.480]  crisis actors or where they're doing the run in the drills and it looks just
[03:48:26.480 --> 03:48:29.200]  like the real thing so if all you saw on the news
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:32.960]  broadcast was images of the drill you would think it was
[03:48:32.960 --> 03:48:37.280]  really happening and you'd never know and so this is a real thing that's out
[03:48:37.280 --> 03:48:40.880]  there there he is speaking on behalf for
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:45.440]  vladimir putin who could be declaring war against the united states so then the
[03:48:45.440 --> 03:48:49.440]  united states has to retaliate and nuke russia and they can say well look he
[03:48:49.440 --> 03:48:52.880]  we saw it there on the video on youtube yeah we saw it on the youtube i mean
[03:48:52.880 --> 03:48:56.400]  that's where obama says he doesn't even know with his administration he just
[03:48:56.400 --> 03:49:00.560]  gets all of his his understanding from the news and
[03:49:00.560 --> 03:49:04.480]  internet so you know totally totally bizarre but if
[03:49:04.480 --> 03:49:07.760]  you think that is the height of the technology
[03:49:07.760 --> 03:49:11.520]  sadly mistaken somebody probably got a piece of code brought it to a university
[03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:14.400]  and said hey you guys play with it see what else you can come up with
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:18.480]  and then they're using it as a testing ground to to have it be augmented more
[03:49:18.480 --> 03:49:22.240]  and because a lot of government people they get in these areas and they don't
[03:49:22.240 --> 03:49:26.720]  they're not able to really take projects to the the very end either by lack of
[03:49:26.720 --> 03:49:29.040]  funding or something else so they do it through the university system right
[03:49:29.040 --> 03:49:32.800]  well imagine what they're i mean if this is just some university research
[03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:36.720]  imagine what's going on with darpa and all the others where they go to
[03:49:36.720 --> 03:49:40.720]  invite all the technology entrepreneurs to come join us
[03:49:40.720 --> 03:49:44.880]  we need your help what did you think of what was going on in
[03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:48.160]  utah like ted cruise had a huge victory in utah
[03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:52.880]  that was where the sorrows counting machines were right and
[03:49:52.880 --> 03:49:56.320]  although in all fairness donald trump did have a very small rally in salt lake
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:49:59.680]  city it wasn't like one of his bigger rallies but do you think there's any
[03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:03.840]  well i mean it's just kind of odd that we have all of the elite
[03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:06.880]  no it's it doesn't make any sense if you look at the rest of what's going on
[03:50:06.880 --> 03:50:10.160]  the nation but let's not forget we've got mit romney
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:12.960]  right the Mormon coming out of there but then that was where the establishment
[03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:16.880]  had their big meeting in utah of how we have all got to take down
[03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:19.680]  trump right i mean that was a little odd why is
[03:50:19.680 --> 03:50:22.560]  utah all of a sudden in in the news and all these different places with all
[03:50:22.560 --> 03:50:26.720]  these establishment leaders meeting there talking about how we have to take
[03:50:26.720 --> 03:50:29.280]  down trump let's hand it on all of a sudden the guy
[03:50:29.280 --> 03:50:33.600]  the gop head there in utah comes up with this new technology this brand new
[03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:38.160]  website affiliated with george sorrows to give voters
[03:50:38.160 --> 03:50:41.840]  ease their access to voting by going online with their votes
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:44.960]  meanwhile there were super long lines in parts of arizona where they just cut
[03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:48.560]  out a lot of polling places so definitely chicana re going on
[03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:51.840]  nothing new all right well stick around we'll be right back let you know it's
[03:50:51.840 --> 03:50:54.960]  we'll be taking some calls
[03:50:59.360 --> 03:51:04.720]  my name is don whiskin in 1994 i lost my 62 year old father to complications of

[03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:55.360]  without proper documentation in utah their voters can't decide to vote absentee
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:54:58.080]  the day before they have to print off a ballot
[03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:03.600]  um they have to get it all kind of short up the thursday before the primaries
[03:55:03.600 --> 03:55:06.960]  they can't just go and say oh well i printed it off from the new website
[03:55:06.960 --> 03:55:12.080]  utah.gop now i'm gonna vote absentee so again
[03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:17.520]  lion ted cruise mr gambini what is a you
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:21.600]  what is a you well let's go ahead and very quickly take this phone call from
[03:55:21.600 --> 03:55:26.320]  ozzy in texas you want to talk about terrorist attacks in the usa
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:30.880]  uh yes leon am i on air now yes go ahead and you real quick
[03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:36.320]  yeah awesome um i emailed you on uh on a private message i don't know if you have
[03:55:36.320 --> 03:55:39.600]  read it but i just wanted to make a comment
[03:55:39.600 --> 03:55:45.840]  that um you can make a connection between islam and
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:52.000]  pre-masonry um basically remember the shiners
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:58.320]  this this group of uh uh you know fundraisers and and i think there's an
[03:55:58.320 --> 03:56:02.880]  icis commander that was made of mason um who was telling me that it was uh the
[03:56:02.880 --> 03:56:06.480]  guy we talked to in italy to get his name
[03:56:06.480 --> 03:56:09.840]  right now this is this in order for you to become a
[03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:16.960]  shriner you have to be a 33rd degree freemason and when you uh search nobody
[03:56:16.960 --> 03:56:20.000]  has uh looked into it but when you look at the
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:24.160]  shriner they call themselves the ancient arabic order of
[03:56:24.160 --> 03:56:29.040]  something and it's a very extreme version of islam
[03:56:29.040 --> 03:56:34.240]  anti christian so it makes a lot of sense that our leaders that are free
[03:56:34.240 --> 03:56:40.400]  mason are basically turning us over into islam which is you know what the
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:43.120]  shriners stand for
[03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:47.280]  hmm well aziz that is very interesting because i mean we're all kind of sitting
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:50.000]  back going what in the heck is happening how come they're
[03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:53.600]  destroying christianity but then you can't the symbol you can't
[03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:56.880]  in any way um criticize islam or something so
[03:56:56.880 --> 03:56:59.760]  aziz thank you for your point i'm sure there's a lot of people out there
[03:56:59.760 --> 03:57:02.720]  they're gonna take that and do some uh further digging and
[03:57:02.720 --> 03:57:06.560]  investigating and yeah i i do think there's going to have
[03:57:06.560 --> 03:57:10.080]  some sort of attack here i knew there was going to be some sort of attack here
[03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:14.240]  with this with this election of course they would have to ramp up the terror
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:18.720]  in order to control people um and enhance that surveillance state
[03:57:18.720 --> 03:57:22.960]  as well uh what do you think i think let's go to rey and see what he has to
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:25.440]  say he's talking about a false flag in 2016
[03:57:25.440 --> 03:57:28.640]  okay very rey and go ahead make it quick
[03:57:28.640 --> 03:57:33.280]  how you guys doing um basically i was watching an episode of alex jones talking
[03:57:33.280 --> 03:57:36.160]  about how they're going somebody was going to blow up the sears tower here
[03:57:36.160 --> 03:57:39.520]  chicago in 2015 now it's 2016 so i'm still
[03:57:39.520 --> 03:57:42.800]  wondering i'm kind of scared you know the things that happen in france you know
[03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:46.240]  it might happen here too so what's the deal with the the sears tower getting
[03:57:46.240 --> 03:57:50.320]  blown up well i'll tell you a story i when i was in chicago back in 2010 i
[03:57:50.320 --> 03:57:53.840]  believe it was we were covering a a terror drill that was going on there with
[03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:57.840]  the national guard operation vigilant guard where we showed uh them working
[03:57:57.840 --> 03:58:02.560]  with the boy scouts as terror victims i went to try to film this area
[03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:04.880]  underneath the sears tower where there's some roads
[03:58:04.880 --> 03:58:07.360]  and a guy a security guy came down i said what are you doing down here you can't
[03:58:07.360 --> 03:58:09.840]  be down here with the camera i thought that was pretty odd
[03:58:09.840 --> 03:58:12.400]  considering everywhere else in chicago i was allowed to walk around with the
[03:58:12.400 --> 03:58:16.960]  camera but just that one little spot um i wasn't so yeah well i thought that was
[03:58:16.960 --> 03:58:19.440]  pretty i mean obviously monuments and crowds
[03:58:19.440 --> 03:58:22.480]  stadiums they've been warning about this for quite some time that these are
[03:58:22.480 --> 03:58:25.920]  going to be the the soft target if you see something shoot video of it and put
[03:58:25.920 --> 03:58:28.880]  it on youtube don't necessarily say something to homeland security because
[03:58:28.880 --> 03:58:32.400]  they may or may not be involved all right well tune in to the info war's
[03:58:32.400 --> 03:58:58.320]  nightly news tonight at 7 p.m central with your host chicari jackson
