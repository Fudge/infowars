[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:22.300]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:22.300 --> 00:34.420]  Welcome to this Sunday, November 3rd broadcast at Infowars.com.
[00:34.420 --> 00:40.180]  Mike Adams filling in here just for the first couple of segments, maybe 45 minutes after
[00:40.180 --> 00:46.700]  which Alex, who's returning from an epic trolling episode in Austin, Texas, will bring you some
[00:46.700 --> 00:48.260]  footage of that, by the way.
[00:48.260 --> 00:53.020]  He's returning to the studios, and he will take over the remainder of the show.
[00:53.020 --> 00:58.140]  But between now and then, you've got me, and I'm going to give you the analysis of not
[00:58.140 --> 01:04.620]  only what happened in Austin today, Jedi-level trolling by Owen Shroyer, as well as Will
[01:04.620 --> 01:05.620]  Johnson.
[01:05.620 --> 01:06.620]  It was just amazing.
[01:06.620 --> 01:13.900]  And Alex there, bullhorning the crowd out of an armored vehicle, a truly iconic image
[01:13.900 --> 01:19.380]  for the history of America, as history is unfolding with the Democrats trying to destroy
[01:19.380 --> 01:26.860]  this nation, impeach a duly elected president, and gut every last shred of due process, law
[01:26.860 --> 01:31.380]  fullness, and constitutionality that we may have left in this country.
[01:31.380 --> 01:33.180]  All of that is coming up today.
[01:33.180 --> 01:37.800]  Thank you for joining us with the election just a little over one year away.
[01:37.800 --> 01:42.020]  Everything is now at stake, and it's very clear that Hillary Clinton is running for
[01:42.020 --> 01:43.580]  president.
[01:43.580 --> 01:49.740]  And today, if you would roll some B-roll guys of that event today, let me offer a few notes
[01:49.740 --> 01:50.740]  on that.
[01:50.740 --> 01:57.100]  What can only be described as a zombie march of old white women lining up to see Hillary
[01:57.100 --> 02:03.180]  Clinton lie about everything in history, all the crimes that she has been involved
[02:03.180 --> 02:09.620]  in, all of her defense of pedophiles when she was an attorney, the Clinton body count,
[02:09.620 --> 02:15.500]  the trail of dead bodies behind the Clintons, just a bunch of old white women lined up there
[02:15.500 --> 02:22.020]  being bullhorned by Info Wars reporters who were doing what I call a Jedi level job of
[02:22.020 --> 02:25.780]  trolling those people standing in line to see Hillary Clinton.
[02:25.780 --> 02:26.780]  It was amazing.
[02:26.780 --> 02:31.940]  I watched that for about 30 minutes during the live broadcast on infowars.com.
[02:31.940 --> 02:38.700]  I didn't see one black person in the audience, and I didn't see one Hispanic person.
[02:38.700 --> 02:43.420]  They were all white women and some of their husbands that they had dragged along.
[02:43.420 --> 02:49.140]  It was just incredible, truly a zombie march of old white women, and Owen Schreuer was
[02:49.140 --> 02:55.860]  just giving them the lowdown of what they stood for, what they were defending by defending
[02:55.860 --> 02:57.820]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:57.820 --> 03:02.500]  And those people who were in line there had no clue about any history.
[03:02.500 --> 03:07.940]  They were oblivious to the fact that Bill Clinton is a credibly accused rapist that
[03:07.940 --> 03:13.380]  he allegedly raped multiple women over many years of not only being the governor of Arkansas,
[03:13.380 --> 03:16.060]  but of course the president of the United States.
[03:16.060 --> 03:19.540]  These people standing in line are oblivious to history.
[03:19.540 --> 03:23.020]  They are living in liberal thought bubbles.
[03:23.020 --> 03:25.540]  They're not aware of anything that's going on in the real world.
[03:25.540 --> 03:30.140]  Owen Schreuer, who's a full-time researcher, he understands history.
[03:30.140 --> 03:33.820]  He knows more than all those people in line put together.
[03:33.820 --> 03:35.700]  And Will Johnson there as well.
[03:35.700 --> 03:40.220]  And of course they were just laying it out for those people standing in line to the point
[03:40.220 --> 03:47.340]  where one individual, a man who was dragged along, started to assault Owen Schreuer or
[03:47.340 --> 03:51.500]  at least it looked like some kind of he was grabbing him or pushing him or something.
[03:51.500 --> 03:53.100]  I couldn't quite tell what it was.
[03:53.100 --> 03:57.180]  It didn't get any worse than that, but Owen Schreuer backed away and said, I'm not putting
[03:57.180 --> 03:58.300]  up with this anymore.
[03:58.300 --> 03:59.700]  You keep your hands off me.
[03:59.700 --> 04:01.020]  That is assault.
[04:01.020 --> 04:06.180]  And then of course soon after the police came along, the Austin police, and said, you're
[04:06.180 --> 04:08.060]  engaged in criminal trespassing.
[04:08.060 --> 04:09.340]  This is private property.
[04:09.340 --> 04:10.820]  You have to leave.
[04:10.820 --> 04:15.580]  At which point, Will Johnson said, you know what, thank you for your service as officers
[04:15.580 --> 04:16.580]  of the law.
[04:16.580 --> 04:21.980]  We will quietly and politely leave as you requested, because again, conservatives follow
[04:21.980 --> 04:23.060]  the law.
[04:23.060 --> 04:26.860]  So they left and then they went out front and they continued trolling the crowds that
[04:26.860 --> 04:28.260]  are coming in off the street.
[04:28.260 --> 04:33.100]  Here's a guy, if you're watching, here's a guy who was kind of shoving or pushing or
[04:33.100 --> 04:34.940]  possibly assaulting Owen Schreuer.
[04:34.940 --> 04:35.940]  It wasn't clear.
[04:35.940 --> 04:41.020]  So are you proud of Hillary for getting a child rapist off without any jail time?
[04:41.020 --> 04:42.020]  You are, you're proud of that?
[04:42.020 --> 04:43.020]  I read it.
[04:43.020 --> 04:44.020]  I read it.
[04:44.020 --> 04:45.020]  I read it.
[04:45.020 --> 04:46.020]  Are you proud of this?
[04:46.020 --> 04:47.020]  Are you proud of this?
[04:47.020 --> 04:48.020]  I'm sure I'm not.
[04:48.020 --> 04:52.780]  There he goes, grabbing the microphone, getting all handsy, possibly trying to put his hands
[04:52.780 --> 04:53.780]  on Owen Schreuer there.
[04:53.780 --> 04:54.780]  But you know what?
[04:54.780 --> 04:55.780]  Owen can take care of himself.
[04:55.780 --> 04:58.540]  We'll see you right back after this break, much more analysis straight ahead.
[04:58.540 --> 05:28.380]  Thanks for watching the Alex Jones show on the Sunday, November 3rd.
[05:28.380 --> 05:58.340]  We'll see you in the next one.

[57:58.900 --> 58:03.100]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[58:03.100 --> 58:06.620]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[58:06.620 --> 58:11.980]  They're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian Socialists promised they would
[58:11.980 --> 58:16.100]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[58:16.100 --> 58:19.900]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[58:19.900 --> 58:24.620]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you.
[58:24.620 --> 58:29.500]  Have you arrested in some areas, if you do the OK symbol that's the international sign
[58:29.500 --> 58:33.420]  language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[58:33.420 --> 58:36.580]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[58:36.580 --> 58:40.780]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[58:40.780 --> 58:44.700]  We have a It's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap.
[58:44.700 --> 58:45.700]  It's black and white.
[58:45.700 --> 58:46.700]  Very nice.
[58:46.700 --> 58:47.700]  There's the OK symbol on it.
[58:47.700 --> 58:49.300]  It's a great way to start conversations.

[58:59.460 --> 59:01.620]  All of our bodies are different.
[59:01.620 --> 59:04.500]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[59:04.500 --> 59:07.500]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[59:07.500 --> 59:10.940]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you
[59:10.940 --> 59:14.300]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.

[1:00:21.940 --> 1:00:30.820]  You want answers, well, so does he, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's
[1:00:30.820 --> 1:00:31.820]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:31.820 --> 1:00:34.860]  Well, we've got a little emergency in the studio.
[1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:39.940]  I guess one of these pins I had while I was marking articles blew up before it becomes
[1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:45.180]  a big conspiracy theory that it's a psychological ink test or something.
[1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:51.300]  I'm going to go run a special report and then wash my hands off for these kids, all of everything
[1:00:51.300 --> 1:00:52.300]  in ruins.
[1:00:52.300 --> 1:00:53.300]  Ruin's other shirt.
[1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:58.340]  I'm going to find which pin blew up over here, but I was already going to get to this
[1:00:58.340 --> 1:01:00.460]  and I was going to get to it next Saturday, but I'm going to start getting to it right
[1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:04.100]  now because it's so central to everything we're talking about and we'll play this clip
[1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:09.460]  and come back and I'm going to launch this, this larger discussion here.
[1:01:09.460 --> 1:01:17.980]  We're really being held hostage by a collection of Ivy League brats who got into power in
[1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:26.220]  the last 80 years and then who put their children and grandchildren and fellow travelers into
[1:01:26.220 --> 1:01:31.340]  power and they really believe they own this country and rationalize themselves that they're
[1:01:31.340 --> 1:01:36.420]  the big guardians of it and everything and then they've got real perverted sick leftist
[1:01:36.420 --> 1:01:43.700]  ideology to prove how superior they are as a bunch of feminine candy asses and so that's
[1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:47.940]  why there's this whole anti-family, anti-God, anti-masculine agenda because they've always
[1:01:47.940 --> 1:01:52.260]  hated the military and people that enforce what they're doing, but they're always threatened
[1:01:52.260 --> 1:01:53.260]  by them.
[1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:54.660]  What if they ever woke up to who they are?
[1:01:54.660 --> 1:01:58.460]  Well, they have woken up to who you are, so you're going to lose one way or another.
[1:01:58.460 --> 1:02:01.220]  The question is, how painful is this going to be for you?
[1:02:01.220 --> 1:02:05.220]  And I don't sit in a place of confidence, I sit in a place of research and action, direct
[1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:06.220]  action.
[1:02:06.220 --> 1:02:09.900]  So, you like direct action, you've already seen a lot of it, you're going to see a lot
[1:02:09.900 --> 1:02:13.220]  more of it, different types of it, the more you keep pushing, that's just a fact.
[1:02:13.220 --> 1:02:17.580]  Here's Tucker Carlson laying this out with a guest, the full reports on info wars.com
[1:02:17.580 --> 1:02:19.420]  deserves to be shared.
[1:02:19.420 --> 1:02:22.860]  He talks about how the establishment really hates our representative democracy and they
[1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:24.540]  really think they own it.
[1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:27.020]  They're what you call dictators, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:28.020]  Here it is.
[1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:34.240]  So, Ned, you know, for the first, I would say, couple months that the squad became prominent,
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:37.740]  it was a Republican talking point to say for obvious reasons that they're really in
[1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:42.060]  charge of the Democratic Party, but it started to kind of seem true.
[1:02:42.060 --> 1:02:43.620]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:02:43.620 --> 1:02:48.340]  I think with every passing day, Nancy Pelosi is really speaker and name only, the inmates
[1:02:48.340 --> 1:02:51.780]  have taken over the asylum, which isn't really that surprising, Tucker.
[1:02:51.780 --> 1:02:55.900]  The parasitic far left has been eating the Democratic Party from within for years, and
[1:02:55.900 --> 1:02:57.900]  now it's coming to the surface.
[1:02:57.900 --> 1:03:01.460]  And you're right, they're an amazing blend of ignorance and petulance and stupidity
[1:03:01.460 --> 1:03:02.460]  and hatred.
[1:03:02.460 --> 1:03:06.300]  I mean, the fact that they're selling shirts for $19.99, to which I say knock yourselves
[1:03:06.300 --> 1:03:11.380]  out since Nancy Pelosi announced impeachment, Trump has raised $13 million for his re-elect.
[1:03:11.380 --> 1:03:15.700]  But then you have Adam Schiff out there deciding that the chairmanship of the House Intel Committee
[1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:17.780]  is now a platform for parody.
[1:03:17.780 --> 1:03:19.420]  It's pretty amazing to watch.
[1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:23.780]  The thing that's crazy to me is Dems are willing to destroy all of these norms because
[1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:25.140]  Orange Man bad.
[1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:29.540]  If you think about what's taken place over the last two and a half years, Russia gait,
[1:03:29.540 --> 1:03:33.380]  collusion, Ukraine gait, all of this stuff, it's about one thing, Tucker, it's about policy
[1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:34.380]  differences.
[1:03:34.380 --> 1:03:38.380]  They cannot stand the fact that they are not in power and that Trump has a different approach
[1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:42.220]  to governing not only domestically, but on foreign policy as well.
[1:03:42.220 --> 1:03:45.460]  And so now they're new approach and all of this, we shall impeach all things.
[1:03:45.460 --> 1:03:46.460]  We'll impeach Kavanaugh.
[1:03:46.460 --> 1:03:47.460]  We'll impeach Trump.
[1:03:47.460 --> 1:03:48.460]  Based off what?
[1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:49.460]  Nothing.
[1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:50.460]  Policy differences.
[1:03:50.460 --> 1:03:55.220]  So you've got to kind of wonder, once these people take full control, formal control of
[1:03:55.220 --> 1:04:01.780]  the party, and that's only a cycle or two away, do people like Adam Schiff really believe
[1:04:01.780 --> 1:04:03.780]  they're going to continue to run committees?
[1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:06.780]  I mean, that is the amazing place for Adam Schiff.
[1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:11.420]  No, no, no, the amazing part is if you study history, these revolutions have a way of eating
[1:04:11.420 --> 1:04:12.420]  themselves.
[1:04:12.420 --> 1:04:14.820]  Just look at the French Revolution and Robespierre.
[1:04:14.820 --> 1:04:19.340]  So I think they're going to start to realize they'll start eating each other.
[1:04:19.340 --> 1:04:23.580]  But as you go down this path, I think it shows how deranged they are.
[1:04:23.580 --> 1:04:25.580]  Look at the impeachment polls this week.
[1:04:25.580 --> 1:04:29.340]  And the midst of all of this hysteria about Ukraine gait, Politico Morning Consult only
[1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:34.100]  showed 36% of the American people supporting impeachment of Trump.
[1:04:34.100 --> 1:04:38.660]  And if you get into the heartland where I grew up, Tucker, impeachment drops to the
[1:04:38.660 --> 1:04:42.660]  low 20s, and you start to think about how stupid they are when you get to these swing
[1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:47.460]  districts of Oklahoma 5 and Illinois 14, which are real pickup opportunities for the GOP
[1:04:47.460 --> 1:04:54.180]  in 2020, they're going to make those members watch walk the impeachment plank and lose
[1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:55.180]  the majority.
[1:04:55.180 --> 1:04:59.540]  I really do think so in 2020 if they continue to push this, because I think impeaching Trump
[1:04:59.540 --> 1:05:03.340]  is a fool's errand being pushed by fools.
[1:05:03.340 --> 1:05:06.700]  I think that's what we're going to see.
[1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:12.860]  Hosts ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[1:05:12.860 --> 1:05:19.180]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems and people
[1:05:19.180 --> 1:05:20.860]  will like different formulas.
[1:05:20.860 --> 1:05:23.420]  It's just that simple.
[1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:28.220]  X3 is the Deep Earth crystal iodine and two other types, because some people need all
[1:05:28.220 --> 1:05:29.940]  three types to absorb.
[1:05:29.940 --> 1:05:33.100]  Others like the pure atomic iodine.
[1:05:33.100 --> 1:05:37.500]  It both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other
[1:05:37.500 --> 1:05:39.780]  to family or friends.
[1:05:39.780 --> 1:05:43.140]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it.
[1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:47.460]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[1:05:47.460 --> 1:05:50.580]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:51.580]  It's simple.
[1:05:51.580 --> 1:05:56.220]  Get your high quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war.

[1:05:57.220 --> 1:06:00.700]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[1:06:00.700 --> 1:06:02.660]  It's the iodine challenge.
[1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:15.100]  Different types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[1:06:15.100 --> 1:06:32.140]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:32.140 --> 1:06:39.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now in to hour number two on this November 3rd, 2019 Global
[1:06:39.620 --> 1:06:48.020]  Sunday Transmission, all right, we do have over the horizon radar aimed at the globalist.
[1:06:48.020 --> 1:06:50.780]  We know their plans and other operations and other different scenarios.
[1:06:50.780 --> 1:06:58.620]  And we know that their main operation sets on the public being dumb and distracted and
[1:06:58.620 --> 1:06:59.620]  not paying attention.
[1:06:59.620 --> 1:07:02.900]  So let me lay it on you right now.
[1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:06.140]  What they're currently doing and why they're so confident they can remove the president
[1:07:06.140 --> 1:07:07.940]  from office.
[1:07:07.940 --> 1:07:13.740]  If we're aware of their operation and aren't too confident ourselves, but are fully engaged
[1:07:13.740 --> 1:07:21.300]  with information, we are going to be able to really expose this in a big way.
[1:07:21.300 --> 1:07:25.100]  If we're overconfident, we are going to lose the farm here.
[1:07:25.100 --> 1:07:29.300]  And then they know that they have a huge awakening on their hands.
[1:07:29.300 --> 1:07:34.500]  They're going to come down on all of us harder than ever and we're going to be forced to
[1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:41.780]  obviously really take the gloves off and our children deserve that.
[1:07:41.780 --> 1:07:46.940]  They deserve to not have this system obsessed with brain damaging them and sexually abusing
[1:07:46.940 --> 1:07:49.860]  them and poisoning them and control of them.
[1:07:49.860 --> 1:07:55.540]  And so I tell my fellow humans, not just my fellow countrymen and women that folks better
[1:07:55.540 --> 1:08:01.780]  really understand that our worst analysis, our worst case analysis of the globalist has
[1:08:01.780 --> 1:08:06.020]  turned out to be an understatement and that it's far worse than we thought.
[1:08:06.020 --> 1:08:13.380]  The good news is that our enemies are very pathological and very predictable and can
[1:08:13.380 --> 1:08:21.740]  be defeated if you think of them as demons, as psychotic control freaks who just want
[1:08:21.740 --> 1:08:26.780]  to hurt people and destroy society and dominate others, then you'll know their next move.
[1:08:26.780 --> 1:08:32.300]  If you look at anybody like Pelosi or Hillary or Michael Moore or Barack Obama or George
[1:08:32.300 --> 1:08:40.460]  Soros and their controllers and believe anything they're saying at face value, then we're doomed.
[1:08:40.460 --> 1:08:51.580]  Now let's just start walking through this.
[1:08:51.580 --> 1:08:57.300]  A lot of people say, hey, you were dead on right a couple of months ago, there's never
[1:08:57.300 --> 1:09:01.380]  been really a real whistleblower, these are just partisan hacks using the term whistleblower
[1:09:01.380 --> 1:09:05.460]  because it has some gravitas to it, kind of like the dossier, it's a fancy sounding
[1:09:05.460 --> 1:09:12.180]  French word, dossier, dossier, just some made up political opposition research that
[1:09:12.180 --> 1:09:18.540]  Democrats paid their friends and family $40 something million to cook up.
[1:09:18.540 --> 1:09:23.140]  But that's really the strength of it is its weakness is that they never admit who the
[1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:27.220]  whistleblower is and they find some underlings that say they're willing to say they're the
[1:09:27.220 --> 1:09:32.420]  ones that first reported it, but then all the people actually in the room and the transcripts
[1:09:32.420 --> 1:09:38.380]  say the opposite, so they never want to identify exactly who it is.
[1:09:38.380 --> 1:09:42.940]  So now we learn the person trying to doctor the transcript comes out and becomes a whistleblower
[1:09:42.940 --> 1:09:48.380]  and then, oh, somebody else, they won't say who they are, they won't testify before Congress,
[1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:54.820]  we're supposed to just believe them like they're God themselves and not let Trump faces accuser.
[1:09:54.820 --> 1:09:58.860]  That's all being done because it's just like the Russiagate, there's never any proof and
[1:09:58.860 --> 1:10:04.500]  it's always just another rumor, another lie, another hoax headline, but this is done by
[1:10:04.500 --> 1:10:10.460]  design to change the subject off of all the crimes the Democrats have committed and the
[1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:14.380]  things that the deep state has done and all the crimes of Hillary Clinton and the crimes
[1:10:14.380 --> 1:10:18.420]  of the fake Russiagate investigation itself.
[1:10:18.420 --> 1:10:29.500]  Here's the CNN headline, lawyer says whistleblower willing to answer written questions from Republicans.
[1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:37.300]  Now, you go through this and it would read like Monty Python if the public was educated
[1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:42.020]  about due process and what the West stands for and what America stands for, but it doesn't.
[1:10:42.020 --> 1:10:46.740]  It goes on to say, well, they were talking about maybe testifying in secret if only Democrats
[1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:51.660]  could ask questions, but now they're not, but since Republicans complain about due process,
[1:10:51.660 --> 1:10:56.540]  they can give the lawyer who won't say who this person is questions and maybe they'll
[1:10:56.540 --> 1:10:57.540]  answer those.
[1:10:57.540 --> 1:11:02.980]  So you just give the Democratic Party basically shift a question, it goes into a black hole
[1:11:02.980 --> 1:11:05.420]  and it comes back how the Democrats want to answer it.
[1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:07.580]  This is a complete joke.
[1:11:07.580 --> 1:11:11.420]  You couldn't convict Al Capone of these type behaviors or Jeffrey Dahmer.
[1:11:11.420 --> 1:11:16.980]  You found them with the dead bodies because the due process violations endanger everyone,
[1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:21.940]  so it has to be thrown out better than 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man go
[1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:22.940]  to prison.
[1:11:22.940 --> 1:11:27.380]  You know that saying that's because if you get a government operating like this, it's
[1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:36.740]  called the capital T word tyranny from tyrannous, meaning terrible leader.
[1:11:36.740 --> 1:11:37.740]  That's what tyranny means.
[1:11:37.740 --> 1:11:41.500]  It means terrible, tyrant.
[1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:49.340]  Tyrant just means terrible, horrible, horrible management, horrible abuse, horrible corruption.
[1:11:49.340 --> 1:11:56.140]  Look at California falling into ruination right now being sucked out of the last minute
[1:11:56.140 --> 1:12:02.260]  with all the Dems controllers moving to Texas, their next target licking their lips and their
[1:12:02.260 --> 1:12:06.260]  zombie hordes following them, escaping themselves.
[1:12:06.260 --> 1:12:12.780]  If you run from it, don't bring it, but that's what they're doing.
[1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:19.780]  They're running from themselves and they bring themselves because for the higher level Democrat,
[1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:23.820]  this is a left hand path, legion of doom corruption.
[1:12:23.820 --> 1:12:28.500]  So we've got that Trump Ukraine whistleblower suddenly won't testify lawmakers break off
[1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:35.460]  negotiations amid new revelations and Trump says this is an attack on America and our
[1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:38.540]  basic freedoms and our republic itself.
[1:12:38.540 --> 1:12:40.980]  And that's really, really what it is.
[1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:43.900]  I mean, it's an attack on due process.
[1:12:43.900 --> 1:12:47.940]  It's an attack on reality, but a lot of people are saying, and here's the key.
[1:12:47.940 --> 1:12:48.940]  Here's the big takeaway.
[1:12:48.940 --> 1:12:57.180]  A lot of people are saying, well, Alex, don't worry, they're never going to pass the official
[1:12:57.180 --> 1:13:01.580]  triggering of the impeachment investigation in the House because they don't have any evidence
[1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:08.300]  and they'll never have the Senate votes, you noticed on Thursday they voted to initiate
[1:13:08.300 --> 1:13:12.300]  formal impeachment proceedings in the House by a large margin.
[1:13:12.300 --> 1:13:13.580]  And it's the same thing here.
[1:13:13.580 --> 1:13:20.220]  They're going to trigger all these women that say they've been raped, aka like Kavanaugh,
[1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:23.900]  and they're going to trigger all sorts of all these other hundreds of investigations in
[1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:33.940]  southern New York and in Chicago and just all Florida, South Florida, where they control
[1:13:33.940 --> 1:13:39.300]  the jurisdictions and where they've got blackmailed over the prosecutors and sheriffs and prosecutors
[1:13:39.300 --> 1:13:41.860]  and federal and state.
[1:13:41.860 --> 1:13:46.300]  And so they've got a plan doesn't mean it's going to succeed, but they're going to give
[1:13:46.300 --> 1:13:50.220]  it one hell of a good run.
[1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:55.060]  And I know it's painful for Kavanaugh to have his name brought back up as he was totally
[1:13:55.060 --> 1:13:57.940]  innocent.
[1:13:57.940 --> 1:13:59.940]  But they need to be running ads nationally.
[1:13:59.940 --> 1:14:04.780]  There's going to be fireside chats and addresses to the nation by the president pointing out
[1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:09.980]  how almost all the women came out and said they were threatened to say this or the fact
[1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:13.220]  that they'd been a prostitute or the fact that they'd been a drug addict or the fact
[1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:16.700]  that they'd been in a mental institution would come out and they'd lose their job because
[1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:21.140]  the people running Balazi Ford CCIA, she's head CI recruiter at her college, her whole
[1:14:21.140 --> 1:14:26.660]  family's huge CIA out of DC, and the most powerful Republican law firm, Neocon law firm
[1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:27.660]  right there.
[1:14:27.660 --> 1:14:31.500]  If you look that up, Baker Hostelor.
[1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:36.860]  And so they know good and damn well what they're doing.
[1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:41.860]  And so then these women have said, listen, I got a call and I got told their own record
[1:14:41.860 --> 1:14:48.260]  that if I didn't do this, that they were going to out me and so other women said they never
[1:14:48.260 --> 1:14:49.260]  got the call.
[1:14:49.260 --> 1:14:51.700]  They just saw their name and it was totally made up.
[1:14:51.700 --> 1:14:55.780]  But then they got calls and said, we know about this or that.
[1:14:55.780 --> 1:14:59.300]  So Trump and others need to be going, look, they did this, look, they did that.
[1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:00.740]  Not just Russiagate.
[1:15:00.740 --> 1:15:06.740]  But hey, remember they lied about Kavanaugh and then made fun of the guy starting to cry
[1:15:06.740 --> 1:15:08.380]  up there on the thing.
[1:15:08.380 --> 1:15:09.380]  That's not professional.
[1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:13.580]  Well, you try having a bunch of people you never met, say you raped them.
[1:15:13.580 --> 1:15:17.180]  This is you off.
[1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:20.660]  I mean, this is real people.
[1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:22.660]  And I've gone through it.
[1:15:22.660 --> 1:15:23.660]  I'm not a victim here.
[1:15:23.660 --> 1:15:24.660]  I'm not complaining.
[1:15:24.660 --> 1:15:26.660]  I'm just saying this is a damn war.
[1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:29.300]  These people planted child porn on us and blew up in their face.
[1:15:29.300 --> 1:15:32.860]  They've done everything else you could imagine and they're just a pack of crux and at some
[1:15:32.860 --> 1:15:37.060]  point people got to say, listen, I don't care how this ends, okay?
[1:15:37.060 --> 1:15:38.060]  You want to bang heads?
[1:15:38.060 --> 1:15:39.700]  Let's just get it on, okay?
[1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:45.140]  I just know this, ladies and gentlemen, all these flat jug soft people out there that
[1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:46.300]  think this is all funny.
[1:15:46.300 --> 1:15:47.300]  What's going on?
[1:15:47.300 --> 1:15:50.820]  All you little leftist followers, you're going to pay for this, too.
[1:15:50.820 --> 1:15:53.460]  If this goes to the next level, you're going to pay either way.
[1:15:53.460 --> 1:15:55.900]  And I'm telling you, this is sick.
[1:15:55.900 --> 1:15:58.980]  We put up with evil far too long in this country to come back and finish up how they
[1:15:58.980 --> 1:15:59.980]  plan to take Trump out.
[1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:00.980]  Now we stop them.
[1:16:00.980 --> 1:16:01.980]  We can do it.
[1:16:01.980 --> 1:16:02.980]  It's up to us though.
[1:16:02.980 --> 1:16:03.980]  You understand?
[1:16:03.980 --> 1:16:04.980]  It's up to you.

[1:17:11.260 --> 1:17:14.780]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[1:17:14.780 --> 1:17:20.140]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Thabian Socialists promised they would
[1:17:20.140 --> 1:17:24.260]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:28.020]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping.

[1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:41.620]  they're doing.
[1:17:41.620 --> 1:17:44.740]  These people are authoritarians, and they're dangerous.
[1:17:44.740 --> 1:17:48.980]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.

[1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:00.940]  up Russiagate trial.
[1:21:00.940 --> 1:21:04.420]  Roger has been gagged speaking about basically anything political that could be associated
[1:21:04.420 --> 1:21:06.780]  with it or the threatening to put him in jail.
[1:21:06.780 --> 1:21:08.700]  How American is that?
[1:21:08.700 --> 1:21:13.300]  All the press runs around saying he's guilty and while someone screamed at him and almost
[1:21:13.300 --> 1:21:18.380]  physically assaulted him on the airplane yesterday flying into DC from Florida.
[1:21:18.380 --> 1:21:22.580]  So Mr. Ingalls will be popping in then the last segment I have something really special
[1:21:22.580 --> 1:21:24.620]  and I'm not playing a special report to get out of here.
[1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:26.700]  I was out bull herring Hillary for three hours today.
[1:21:26.700 --> 1:21:30.380]  We're going to have all that HD footage for you tomorrow on the weekday show.
[1:21:30.380 --> 1:21:32.180]  The crew is still out there.
[1:21:32.180 --> 1:21:35.900]  Portally got interface when she left just got that called her in the break.
[1:21:35.900 --> 1:21:41.980]  So this is a lot of wild stuff going on here, but that's coming up.
[1:21:41.980 --> 1:21:45.700]  But let me finish up with the plan to take down Trump.
[1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:52.380]  They're getting the impeachment going and they've got all these committees going to incubate
[1:21:52.380 --> 1:21:58.660]  these federal and state investigations run by Democrats that are then feeding into shift
[1:21:58.660 --> 1:21:59.860]  in the committee.
[1:21:59.860 --> 1:22:04.420]  Then they meet with the individuals, the so-called whistleblowers and others and they're lining
[1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:11.740]  up a crescendo of lawyers of Trump who are as crooked as the dog's back leg.
[1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:13.140]  He's got thousands of lawyers.
[1:22:13.140 --> 1:22:15.100]  Every little jurisdiction he's got a business in.
[1:22:15.100 --> 1:22:16.260]  He hires a local lawyer.
[1:22:16.260 --> 1:22:22.300]  Well, those guys are all being investigated and so they didn't pay for taxi cab taxes
[1:22:22.300 --> 1:22:26.380]  or they didn't pay for a building permit on their own building.
[1:22:26.380 --> 1:22:30.540]  The feds that are Democrat controlled at many levels come to them and Democrat jurisdictions
[1:22:30.540 --> 1:22:35.500]  and say, we're going to put you in prison for 20 years if you don't tell us Trump did
[1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:36.500]  something corrupt.
[1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:37.900]  Now, tell us what he did.
[1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:43.020]  Well, Trump never did anything because he knows how corrupt the system is and how famous,
[1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:49.220]  rich, independent people who don't have pull with the globalist mafia have people trying
[1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:51.260]  to set them up all the time.
[1:22:51.260 --> 1:22:54.420]  I'm nothing like Trump is successful with huge businesses and all the things and I've
[1:22:54.420 --> 1:22:57.460]  learned when people think you're successful, they try to set you up and try to get you
[1:22:57.460 --> 1:22:58.460]  to commit a crime.
[1:22:58.460 --> 1:23:00.820]  And I'm like literally don't even speed anymore.
[1:23:00.820 --> 1:23:02.020]  I'm Mr. Goodie two shoes.
[1:23:02.020 --> 1:23:03.300]  I follow every law.
[1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:08.380]  I always did anyways, but now I'm super neurotic about it.
[1:23:08.380 --> 1:23:15.060]  So they're not able to find anything on Trump and they're freaking out.
[1:23:15.060 --> 1:23:16.060]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:23:16.060 --> 1:23:18.900]  They're just going to go at him with not paying taxes.
[1:23:18.900 --> 1:23:22.260]  They're going to claim when he legally did all these tax things that you're supposed
[1:23:22.260 --> 1:23:23.500]  to do or you can't survive.
[1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:25.980]  That's the way the loopholes are written.
[1:23:25.980 --> 1:23:30.420]  And they're going to go after him for women that he never did anything to it won't matter
[1:23:30.420 --> 1:23:34.580]  if they're known mental patients won't matter if they've been openly threatened.
[1:23:34.580 --> 1:23:40.620]  And they're going to do that during the whole house fiasco and they're going to do it again
[1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:41.740]  in the Senate trial.
[1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:47.140]  So you're going to see it all by Christmas if they stay on their timetable.
[1:23:47.140 --> 1:23:49.700]  There are a little bit behind because the wheels are coming off.
[1:23:49.700 --> 1:23:54.100]  They're getting caught coaching people and not having real hearings and keeping folks
[1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:55.100]  out.
[1:23:55.100 --> 1:23:58.220]  And the whistleblowers are all scared because they're going to lie against a sitting president
[1:23:58.220 --> 1:24:00.300]  and commit massive perjury.
[1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:06.480]  And so it may take them longer, but they want him gone before 2020 is on the board.
[1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:16.300]  Because the optics of removing a sitting popular president who has national polls, 40% of black
[1:24:16.300 --> 1:24:21.660]  men say they're voting for Trump, they've never gotten above 12 points in national polls.
[1:24:21.660 --> 1:24:22.660]  And those polls are skewed.
[1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:24.660]  It's probably higher.
[1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:30.180]  Hispanics massive support over 40% usually for Republicans like 20%.
[1:24:30.180 --> 1:24:32.540]  So they don't know what to do.
[1:24:32.540 --> 1:24:38.780]  They need him out now and they want him gone before 2020 rolls around.
[1:24:38.780 --> 1:24:40.780]  And how far away is 2020?
[1:24:40.780 --> 1:24:42.580]  It's November 3rd.
[1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:47.100]  We're only a year and three days, four days from the next election.
[1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:50.660]  They have said they want him gone by Christmas.
[1:24:50.660 --> 1:24:56.460]  So they passed the official initiation on Halloween in your face for Thanksgiving.
[1:24:56.460 --> 1:24:57.460]  They'll have the impeachment.
[1:24:57.460 --> 1:25:02.620]  That's the indictment in the house and they want him gone or ordered to be removed by
[1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:03.620]  December.
[1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:04.620]  They think he'll blink.
[1:25:04.620 --> 1:25:08.340]  They've had all these surrogates on TV saying, if you just go, if you just give up, we'll
[1:25:08.340 --> 1:25:09.340]  let you go, Trump.
[1:25:09.340 --> 1:25:10.660]  We won't put you in prison.
[1:25:10.660 --> 1:25:12.100]  A, he's done nothing wrong.
[1:25:12.100 --> 1:25:13.660]  B, they want his head on a pike.
[1:25:13.660 --> 1:25:14.660]  They're never backing down.
[1:25:14.660 --> 1:25:20.260]  They want to kill the image of Americana, kill the image of populism, kill the image of
[1:25:20.260 --> 1:25:21.260]  resistance.
[1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:24.980]  Trump has unified this nation like nobody else for those that love America, for those
[1:25:24.980 --> 1:25:25.980]  that hate it.
[1:25:25.980 --> 1:25:28.860]  He's crystallized who they are.
[1:25:28.860 --> 1:25:31.460]  Populism and nationalism is exploding worldwide.
[1:25:31.460 --> 1:25:35.180]  The globalists are in panic mode, so they need to get rid of him now.
[1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:41.380]  What we need to do is get on a plane and go to Congress and go visit the swing state senators
[1:25:41.380 --> 1:25:43.940]  and House members and politely get in their face.
[1:25:43.940 --> 1:25:48.300]  Need to go to their meetings they're having in their districts.
[1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:51.500]  If your Congressperson is good in their district, they'll give them a pep talk and say, get
[1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:55.460]  more aggressive and give speeches for the president and against the deep status saying
[1:25:55.460 --> 1:25:58.020]  you want them arrested and they're criminals.
[1:25:58.020 --> 1:26:02.140]  Then go find the nearest jurisdiction that has a globalist in it or a swing state person
[1:26:02.140 --> 1:26:06.740]  or somebody on the fence, a rhino, and you get in their face at the state level locally,
[1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:10.380]  you get in their face at the federal level, you call them just aggressively every day
[1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:14.980]  a couple of times, you send letters, you call C-span, you get aggressive.
[1:26:14.980 --> 1:26:19.460]  This isn't some football game where we got to win for the team colors and we can get
[1:26:19.460 --> 1:26:21.540]  to the championship.
[1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:23.260]  That's nothing.
[1:26:23.260 --> 1:26:28.940]  That is a facsimile of war to make you dissipate your energy on the national religion of football.
[1:26:28.940 --> 1:26:33.860]  And I'm not judging you for that, but spend as much time fighting for America in its darkest
[1:26:33.860 --> 1:26:39.300]  hour when we got a chance to turn it around that you spend watching football and believe
[1:26:39.300 --> 1:26:43.420]  me, this country will be turned around quickly if we start having the same passion for our
[1:26:43.420 --> 1:26:47.580]  unborn children and our born children and for our sovereignty and for our futures as
[1:26:47.580 --> 1:26:51.980]  we've got for these damn simulated combat events they call sports.
[1:26:51.980 --> 1:26:56.380]  The new national religion, we will turn this around.
[1:26:56.380 --> 1:26:59.100]  But if we don't, it's over.
[1:26:59.100 --> 1:27:05.220]  Now we have Mr. Ingalls joining us and I also want to play a few clips when we come back.
[1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:09.980]  Getting into Elizabeth Warren and getting into how the chips are going to fall because
[1:27:09.980 --> 1:27:13.220]  it's central to understanding how to beat them.
[1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:18.620]  When you see Nancy Pelosi on TV on all these shows saying, we're not socialists, we're
[1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:23.420]  not communists, that's our radical wing, we're not going to win if we talk like that.
[1:27:23.420 --> 1:27:29.180]  She's trying to make other leftist A, stop telling people what they really stand for
[1:27:29.180 --> 1:27:35.180]  and B, she's trying to telegraph to people watching like, oh, that's not really who we
[1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:36.180]  are.
[1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:38.460]  Now I know I'm stating something as obvious as the nose on my face.
[1:27:38.460 --> 1:27:41.660]  I get that.
[1:27:41.660 --> 1:27:47.420]  But she's saying that and it's even come out in the news that all the major nightly comedy
[1:27:47.420 --> 1:27:53.060]  shows and Saturday Night Live work for the Democrats, get calls from Pelosi, from Schumer
[1:27:53.060 --> 1:27:56.500]  and others and that they manage what is on the show.
[1:27:56.500 --> 1:28:01.700]  And these people watch this and have a power trip because they're so old, they still think
[1:28:01.700 --> 1:28:04.820]  national television is dominant.
[1:28:04.820 --> 1:28:07.420]  But it's a view into their brain.
[1:28:07.420 --> 1:28:11.260]  So when you see her saying that on Face the Nation and Meet the Press, and then you see
[1:28:11.260 --> 1:28:16.860]  Saturday Night Live saying Warren's lying to you, we can't afford free healthcare, that's
[1:28:16.860 --> 1:28:22.900]  only to go, oh, even Saturday Night Live is with us, they don't really want to bankrupt
[1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:23.900]  the country.
[1:28:23.900 --> 1:28:29.660]  Yes, they want to bankrupt it, Ezekiel Emanuel admitted it in articles he wrote and on Fox
[1:28:29.660 --> 1:28:32.980]  News, the plan when they passed Obamacare was to bankrupt the country.
[1:28:32.980 --> 1:28:36.460]  When you didn't get free healthcare, then you demand total nationalization but run by
[1:28:36.460 --> 1:28:38.700]  private companies and that will bring us down.
[1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:43.780]  What foreign armies can't do, this would, free healthcare, free housing, cut our energy
[1:28:43.780 --> 1:28:49.180]  sources off, nobody else does, that's how you economically devastate a nation.
[1:28:49.180 --> 1:28:53.420]  This is the fourth world war against the globalist with the chai comms.
[1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:57.300]  Everything the Democrats do is batting and pitching for the other team.
[1:28:57.300 --> 1:28:59.540]  America was never great, it'll never be great.
[1:28:59.540 --> 1:29:01.620]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:06.980]  That's who they are, they're sworn enemies, they know it.
[1:29:06.980 --> 1:29:11.140]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:15.700]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year, they're waging war on
[1:29:15.700 --> 1:29:21.580]  communication itself as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years
[1:29:21.580 --> 1:29:24.100]  ago from their command base in England.
[1:29:24.100 --> 1:29:30.580]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping, the ADL and others will literally bankrupt
[1:29:30.580 --> 1:29:34.380]  you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:40.380]  If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[1:29:40.380 --> 1:29:41.540]  they're doing.
[1:29:41.540 --> 1:29:44.660]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[1:29:44.660 --> 1:29:48.900]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:29:48.900 --> 1:29:54.060]  We have a it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[1:29:54.060 --> 1:29:58.700]  as the OK symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the
[1:29:58.700 --> 1:29:59.700]  back.

[1:30:04.100 --> 1:30:07.580]  while having a great hat.
[1:30:07.580 --> 1:30:12.620]  All of our bodies are different, all of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[1:30:12.620 --> 1:30:15.620]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:19.060]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you
[1:30:19.060 --> 1:30:20.060]  don't know.
[1:30:20.060 --> 1:30:27.620]  But I'm here to tell you every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a
[1:30:27.620 --> 1:30:31.340]  religious basis, my life completely changes.

[1:31:07.380 --> 1:31:09.420]  The Alex Jones Show.
[1:31:09.420 --> 1:31:14.820]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[1:31:14.820 --> 1:31:19.540]  She said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[1:31:19.540 --> 1:31:24.380]  it says that two billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[1:31:24.380 --> 1:31:25.820]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[1:31:25.820 --> 1:31:29.580]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[1:31:29.580 --> 1:31:34.180]  true, but dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[1:31:34.180 --> 1:31:35.180]  you said.
[1:31:35.180 --> 1:31:40.380]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality neuroceutical grade.
[1:31:40.380 --> 1:31:44.660]  Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[1:31:44.660 --> 1:31:49.660]  That's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[1:31:49.660 --> 1:31:50.660]  you're age.
[1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:56.300]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself that other two billion
[1:31:56.300 --> 1:32:00.540]  people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the
[1:32:00.540 --> 1:32:03.180]  earth right now because of iodine deficiency.

[1:32:23.180 --> 1:32:28.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, X2 and X3 are two amazing formulas of iodine.

[1:33:06.860 --> 1:33:33.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:33:33.700 --> 1:33:41.540]  Alex Jones show again, I know I'm stating the super obvious here, but we tend to those
[1:33:41.540 --> 1:33:47.500]  of us that are awake and informed and involved, not state the obvious.
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:52.580]  We tend to move on to all the minutiae, but Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are literally
[1:33:52.580 --> 1:33:57.860]  running the so-called entertainment shows because that's where Netflix and Comedy Central
[1:33:57.860 --> 1:34:02.980]  and the Daily Show and all those programs Saturday Night Live is where they can put
[1:34:02.980 --> 1:34:06.500]  their messages and they admit they run and the writers have come out and say that they
[1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:07.500]  consult with the Democrats.
[1:34:07.500 --> 1:34:12.180]  I mean, hell, the New York Times has a big article about to organize meme wars against
[1:34:12.180 --> 1:34:16.940]  conservatives and how to censor conservatives and block them and how to tell lies better
[1:34:16.940 --> 1:34:21.300]  because the Republicans lie so much, the Democrats have to learn how to lie and the comments
[1:34:21.300 --> 1:34:23.540]  are all like talking about how to tell better lies.
[1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:30.620]  What a bunch of sickos saying we're lying as nationalists as patriots.
[1:34:30.620 --> 1:34:35.100]  And so that's their excuse to become better liars and then talk about how they're liars.
[1:34:35.100 --> 1:34:39.460]  When we're not lying, they play these weird mental gymnastics games.
[1:34:39.460 --> 1:34:43.980]  Here's one of the articles, New York Times declares meme war on Trump supporters ahead
[1:34:43.980 --> 1:34:44.980]  of 2020.
[1:34:44.980 --> 1:34:47.980]  That's an infowars.com article and then it actually links to the New York Times article.
[1:34:47.980 --> 1:34:50.740]  Hey guys, I forgot to print the New York Times article, will you print it for me?
[1:34:50.740 --> 1:34:56.180]  With the comments and they'd somewhere in the stack, but I said they're like 30 minutes
[1:34:56.180 --> 1:35:01.620]  reading probably a hundred comments and it was just, do these people believe what they're
[1:35:01.620 --> 1:35:06.380]  saying or is it an echo chamber where they think they're gaslighting somebody else because
[1:35:06.380 --> 1:35:12.020]  it was just bizarre, bizarre.
[1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:17.700]  How CNN has a headline, Dresden declares Nazi emergency in the e-read article.
[1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:22.860]  There are right wing groups operating, calling for Germany to leave the EU and there must
[1:35:22.860 --> 1:35:29.180]  be Nazis and they just believe all of this hysteria.
[1:35:29.180 --> 1:35:34.300]  But that shows how many people have graduated from college with theater degrees and most
[1:35:34.300 --> 1:35:37.340]  leftist I've noticed have theater degrees, I'm not against theespians.
[1:35:37.340 --> 1:35:40.900]  I'm just saying it's fantasy wind.
[1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:46.620]  They're fiction writers, they're one of the movie stars and the US makes more media than
[1:35:46.620 --> 1:35:49.380]  any other country in the world.
[1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:52.460]  And I think these people are believing their own garbage but here's a few clips and we're
[1:35:52.460 --> 1:35:58.900]  going to our guest of even Saturday Night Live coming out, it's a long piece, it's like
[1:35:58.900 --> 1:36:02.380]  10 minutes long, I'm only going to play about a minute of it, pointing out that Elizabeth
[1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:08.780]  Warren is very deceptive and that there isn't such a thing as free healthcare for everybody.
[1:36:08.780 --> 1:36:11.420]  I mean, you can call it free in Venezuela, just nobody can get it.
[1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:15.820]  It's free in Cuba, just nobody can get this free thing because it's like free pots of
[1:36:15.820 --> 1:36:17.700]  gold and leprechauns, they don't exist.
[1:36:17.700 --> 1:36:22.500]  It's like free pots of gold and unicorns that crap out, you know, diamonds and rubies and
[1:36:22.500 --> 1:36:26.540]  emeralds, listen, they don't exist, folks.
[1:36:26.540 --> 1:36:31.700]  But here they are even saying, oh, she's too leftist, this is impossible because that's
[1:36:31.700 --> 1:36:34.740]  the directive from Pelosi saying let's get away from this.
[1:36:34.740 --> 1:36:38.820]  There's the article, Saturday Night Live, Mox, Elizabeth Warren, 52 trillion Medicare for
[1:36:38.820 --> 1:36:39.820]  all plants.
[1:36:39.820 --> 1:36:43.940]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:49.220]  What military spending, so immediately dead in the water, right?
[1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:56.140]  Two, Jeff Bezos is going to pay, go from paying no tax to a tax.
[1:36:56.140 --> 1:37:02.780]  Yeah, Mr. Bezos, the government is a little like Amazon Prime, you reap the benefits,
[1:37:02.780 --> 1:37:08.900]  you got to pay an annual fee and that's called taxes and unlike you, we can't just take it
[1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:18.420]  out of your debit card for that warning and third, okay, banks, I'm going to tax the banks.
[1:37:18.420 --> 1:37:21.900]  What did you think I was going to do?
[1:37:21.900 --> 1:37:26.900]  Hold up a gas station, come on, they're going to pay for it and not one penny from the middle
[1:37:26.900 --> 1:37:32.500]  class and all we got to do is convince JPMorgan to operate like a non-profit.
[1:37:32.500 --> 1:37:34.620]  Okay, next question, what do we got?
[1:37:34.620 --> 1:37:37.700]  Hi, sorry, I have a follow up because I'm annoying.
[1:37:37.700 --> 1:37:42.860]  You said your plan would cost 20.5 trillion, but other economists have said it could cost
[1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:43.860]  34 trillion.
[1:37:43.860 --> 1:37:48.740]  Right, okay, let me stop you right there and we're talking trillions, you know, when
[1:37:48.740 --> 1:37:51.940]  the numbers are this big, they're just pretend.
[1:37:51.940 --> 1:37:56.700]  There ain't no Scrooge McDuff vault.
[1:37:56.700 --> 1:37:57.700]  You ready to get red-pilled?
[1:37:57.700 --> 1:38:02.900]  Let's stop there, they then go on, she says, I'll make everything free and okay, well on
[1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:08.380]  Friday before this aired, I shot a little seven minute report that's at man.video that I hope
[1:38:08.380 --> 1:38:09.380]  you'll share with people.
[1:38:09.380 --> 1:38:16.980]  Elizabeth Warren caught in hoax bigger than Pocahontas, where they clinic and solve the
[1:38:16.980 --> 1:38:18.460]  national debt with this calculator.
[1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:20.900]  You just put the number in and it just says it's free.
[1:38:20.900 --> 1:38:22.900]  Just magically, here it is.
[1:38:22.900 --> 1:38:25.900]  Boom, national debt, national debt canceled.
[1:38:25.900 --> 1:38:27.900]  Oh my God.
[1:38:27.900 --> 1:38:36.620]  Alex, call Ron Paul, we figured it out.
[1:38:36.620 --> 1:38:40.900]  What you're about to see is so fraudulent, is so criminal.
[1:38:40.900 --> 1:38:42.620]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[1:38:42.620 --> 1:38:45.460]  Those are a bunch of the type of reports I want to get to, but I don't have time because
[1:38:45.460 --> 1:38:48.020]  I want to get our guests on for this segment and part of the next.
[1:38:48.020 --> 1:38:50.580]  I got a few other big stories that I need to hit as well.
[1:38:50.580 --> 1:38:51.740]  There's just so much here.
[1:38:51.740 --> 1:38:54.220]  Tomorrow will be a definite four hour show you don't want to miss.
[1:38:54.220 --> 1:38:57.580]  We'll have all the HD footage of Hillary getting confronted coming to Austin, including in
[1:38:57.580 --> 1:38:58.580]  her face.
[1:38:58.580 --> 1:38:59.580]  It was phenomenal.
[1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:01.380]  It just ended a little while ago.
[1:39:01.380 --> 1:39:05.100]  I didn't do the first 45 minutes so I could be there until four and drive in.
[1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:07.100]  Again, Mike Adams did a great job.
[1:39:07.100 --> 1:39:12.420]  Now, speaking of a great job, Jacob Ingalls is a investigative reporter in Florida.
[1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:15.940]  He's broken a lot of big stories and he covered what happened to Roger Stone when they raided
[1:39:15.940 --> 1:39:16.940]  his house in Moore.
[1:39:16.940 --> 1:39:17.940]  He's friends with Stone.
[1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:21.580]  He's been here to visit the M4 Studios with Stone.
[1:39:21.580 --> 1:39:27.020]  CentralFloridaPost.com, Jacob Ingalls is publisher of that and contributed to New Dawn magazine.
[1:39:27.020 --> 1:39:31.180]  He's committed to truth journalism at a local level and he's going to be covering for us
[1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:36.820]  on the ground in D.C. the globalist show trial of the century of Roger Stone.
[1:39:36.820 --> 1:39:41.100]  The judge even said there's no evidence Russians did any of this, but the jury can't see that.
[1:39:41.100 --> 1:39:43.020]  So no evidence of Russian collusion.
[1:39:43.020 --> 1:39:44.020]  That's all made up.
[1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:45.020]  That's a media hoax.
[1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:48.100]  But Roger's being tried for it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:49.620]  You heard that right.
[1:39:49.620 --> 1:39:53.620]  So Jacob, I know he got accosted quite a bit on his way to D.C. We'll talk about that some
[1:39:53.620 --> 1:39:57.380]  time too, but just give people a bird's eye view of what it's like and what it's like
[1:39:57.380 --> 1:39:58.380]  for Roger.
[1:39:58.380 --> 1:40:00.900]  I mean, he's not allowed to basically say anything.
[1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:06.860]  Yeah, Alex, I've been on the program before and it's great to be back on M4 Wars.
[1:40:06.860 --> 1:40:11.340]  What's happening to Roger Stone is an egregious miscarriage of justice.
[1:40:11.340 --> 1:40:16.500]  He is someone who has done great things for this nation and electing Republican and conservative
[1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:23.860]  presidents over the past four decades and how they are attacking him is disgusting.
[1:40:23.860 --> 1:40:29.100]  And what we see in the attacks on Roger Stone are a precursor to what we are going to see
[1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:34.940]  in the attacks on every single individual American going forward that supports conservatism,
[1:40:34.940 --> 1:40:49.980]  the Constitution and Donald Trump.
[1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:56.180]  Well yes, we got on the plane today going to Washington, D.C. And we had an individual
[1:40:56.180 --> 1:41:01.420]  who was saying very disgusting things, very deranged things to Roger Stone when he has
[1:41:01.420 --> 1:41:05.260]  his family there, his wife, his daughter.
[1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:09.500]  And I kind of stood up to these people and I said, you know, why are you saying that?
[1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:12.420]  It's quite disgusting what you're saying.
[1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:15.140]  And they had no explanation.
[1:41:15.140 --> 1:41:16.140]  He belongs in jail.
[1:41:16.140 --> 1:41:17.140]  He should enjoy jail.
[1:41:17.140 --> 1:41:18.500]  He should enjoy prison.
[1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:19.500]  Why?
[1:41:19.500 --> 1:41:20.500]  Because he disagrees with you politically.
[1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:21.700]  That's not America.
[1:41:21.700 --> 1:41:26.020]  That is a third world dictatorship.
[1:41:26.020 --> 1:41:27.020]  You're absolutely right.
[1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:31.100]  And everywhere Roger goes, people scream and yell and say he's going to go to prison and
[1:41:31.100 --> 1:41:35.700]  I guess now they think they're going to get what they want with this Obama hanging judge.
[1:41:35.700 --> 1:41:40.300]  Well, you know, whatever the judge is going to do, whatever is going to happen in the
[1:41:40.300 --> 1:41:43.900]  court case is going to play out in the next couple of weeks.
[1:41:43.900 --> 1:41:47.940]  All I know is that there are hundreds of patriots on the ground every day that are going to
[1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:53.020]  be there supporting Roger Stone, supporting Donald Trump, supporting alternative media,
[1:41:53.020 --> 1:41:56.900]  independent investigative journalism like MPO wars.
[1:41:56.900 --> 1:41:58.780]  And that's what we can do.
[1:41:58.780 --> 1:42:02.700]  Spread the links, spread the word, get on Facebook, get on Twitter if you're still
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:06.140]  allowed there, if you haven't been banned for no cause and no reason.
[1:42:06.140 --> 1:42:07.140]  That's right.
[1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:08.140]  Remember, you're not supposed to do this.
[1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:11.700]  We're all supposed to shut up and roll over and die so they can all take their time setting
[1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:14.620]  us up with kangaroo Democrat judges and putting us in prison.
[1:42:14.620 --> 1:42:18.620]  We come back, but I want to ask you how Roger Spirits are, how he's doing, but that interview
[1:42:18.620 --> 1:42:20.820]  he did exclusively here blew up.
[1:42:20.820 --> 1:42:25.500]  I've been trying to twist his arm to come back on so much more with Jacob Ingalls on
[1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:27.500]  the other side with Central Florida Post.com.
[1:42:27.500 --> 1:42:33.340]  And I'm going to say this, I have not plugged any today and I need to to help out Roger
[1:42:33.340 --> 1:42:34.420]  and it funds our operation.
[1:42:34.420 --> 1:42:41.140]  I bought 3000 of the Roger Stone did nothing wrong shirt and with info wars.com on the
[1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:42.140]  back.
[1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:43.140]  So it's a different variant of that 3000.
[1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:44.140]  And that's it.
[1:42:44.140 --> 1:42:48.420]  And that proceeds of that part of them went to fund Roger who I know has spent everything
[1:42:48.420 --> 1:42:50.340]  he's got had to sell his house.
[1:42:50.340 --> 1:42:54.820]  You name it because of all the persecution and dozens of lawsuits and Democrats filed
[1:42:54.820 --> 1:42:55.820]  against him.
[1:42:55.820 --> 1:42:57.820]  I want people to take action.
[1:42:57.820 --> 1:42:58.820]  We have taken action.
[1:42:58.820 --> 1:42:59.820]  We've been attacked.
[1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:00.820]  We're okay with that.
[1:43:00.820 --> 1:43:01.820]  We're just asking you to keep us in the game.
[1:43:01.820 --> 1:43:06.620]  Get the shirt at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:06.620 --> 1:43:10.980]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[1:43:10.980 --> 1:43:12.860]  I don't care what your views are.
[1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:16.100]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[1:43:16.100 --> 1:43:17.100]  That's important.
[1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:18.420]  But we have something in common.
[1:43:18.420 --> 1:43:22.460]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:28.020]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied
[1:43:28.020 --> 1:43:29.660]  to Congress in the world.
[1:43:29.660 --> 1:43:34.140]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get
[1:43:34.140 --> 1:43:35.140]  indicted.
[1:43:35.140 --> 1:43:39.900]  But word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[1:43:39.900 --> 1:43:43.580]  From my new home in New Zealand I will.
[1:43:43.580 --> 1:43:48.220]  Oh and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[1:43:48.220 --> 1:43:50.100]  Not so fast criminal.
[1:43:50.100 --> 1:43:54.060]  We're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:58.780]  Because if we don't you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[1:43:58.780 --> 1:44:03.580]  But the American people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at info wars.com
[1:44:03.580 --> 1:44:07.740]  news wars.com and band video.
[1:44:07.740 --> 1:44:08.900]  Here's the bad news.

[1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:43.660]  transmission I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. Central live Roger Stone's trial is about
[1:47:43.660 --> 1:47:49.300]  start this week Jacob Ingalls the reciprocal post.com to be there covering it and he'll
[1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:56.540]  have ground footage you name it he'll be joining us and so much more Jacob this article from
[1:47:56.540 --> 1:48:01.940]  Gateway Pundit talk to the DC police talk of the Virginia police talk to others and
[1:48:01.940 --> 1:48:06.260]  it turns out that Roger Stone was in a flight from Florida there and these people began
[1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:11.020]  to scream at them and yell at them we'll put that article up on screen for TV viewers and
[1:48:11.020 --> 1:48:17.460]  then they had to have a dozen police there waiting for Roger to protect him at the end
[1:48:17.460 --> 1:48:22.460]  on the jet blue flight as people were trying to attack them I guess none of them got arrested
[1:48:22.460 --> 1:48:28.900]  but let's show the image of the individual that reportedly started all this I mean look
[1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:34.340]  at the pleasure of how these individuals enjoy this type of behavior that they do it to me
[1:48:34.340 --> 1:48:39.980]  everywhere even though the deep state and the chai comms that run it are screwing everyone
[1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:45.940]  over these people still feel like they're part of the establishment they're getting
[1:48:45.940 --> 1:48:51.220]  more and more crazed and it's each horrible hoax the Kavanaugh hoax the russia gate hoax
[1:48:51.220 --> 1:48:58.900]  the trumps the KKK hoax dead babies you know from Mexico hoax as all these hoaxes fail
[1:48:58.900 --> 1:49:02.980]  they get more rabid more insane more crazy Jacob Ingalls where do you think this is
[1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:09.820]  going well Alex I think we have to look at this in a certain way these people feel like
[1:49:09.820 --> 1:49:14.820]  they're part of an establishment the deep state the established media the established
[1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:20.980]  political establishment and when they have these outbursts and they act outrageously
[1:49:20.980 --> 1:49:29.500]  and they are not confronted by law enforcement or patriots they feel emboldened so our job
[1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:35.360]  as patriots is to get out there and speak our minds and speak freely and when somebody
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:39.700]  confronts you in public like that you stand up to them and you scream back you point your
[1:49:39.700 --> 1:49:44.700]  finger you stand your ground and if you don't do that then you're really just becoming a
[1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:50.100]  lemming in the endless war on freedom of speech in this nation right now what do you think
[1:49:50.100 --> 1:49:54.700]  these bullies think is going to happen because with any population people begin to rebel
[1:49:54.700 --> 1:49:59.980]  against this but Americans history particularly bullying doesn't make a submit America has
[1:49:59.980 --> 1:50:05.260]  been asleep from entertainment drugs alcohol partying but once they start messing with
[1:50:05.260 --> 1:50:08.500]  the average person they're going to get their head screwed on straight and start politically
[1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:13.100]  kicking ass which is happening it's happening all over the world the bullying is not helping
[1:50:13.100 --> 1:50:20.700]  them no the bullying is not helping them and it's just a matter of how people react to
[1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:26.340]  it are they going to react on the first instance the third instance the tenth instance how
[1:50:26.340 --> 1:50:30.260]  quickly are they going to stand up and fight for themselves and fight for their country
[1:50:30.260 --> 1:50:34.100]  and that's what we have to look at we have to encourage people to sit there and say no
[1:50:34.100 --> 1:50:38.180]  you do not have to take this crap when you're in the airport when you're at a movie with
[1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:41.500]  your family when you're at dinner having a good time when you're at a bar with your
[1:50:41.500 --> 1:50:45.060]  friends you don't have to take crap you don't have to be called a Nazi you don't have to
[1:50:45.060 --> 1:50:49.140]  be called a disinformation agent you don't have to be called a Russian stand up and fight
[1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:55.420]  for yourself and by the way knock on wood the left has seen all these viral videos when
[1:50:55.420 --> 1:50:59.780]  they confront me I scream back at them they don't do it anymore because they want to be
[1:50:59.780 --> 1:51:03.540]  a one-way street it's not and I've seen Roger stand up to him as well there's a lot of videos
[1:51:03.540 --> 1:51:06.980]  of he and I I'll actually dig out and play tomorrow because it's trial starting showing
[1:51:06.980 --> 1:51:10.420]  them threatening him and saying we're going to put you in prison you effing Russian agent
[1:51:10.420 --> 1:51:15.820]  well that whole Russian thing's been disproven but now ladies and gentlemen it doesn't matter
[1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:21.100]  oh look there's video of him in DC in fact I just came out today so there's now video
[1:51:21.100 --> 1:51:24.780]  showing the leftist with you with him Jacob so you're right there with all this happening
[1:51:24.780 --> 1:51:33.100]  yeah and one thing I want to say is that jet blue and the airline and the police and the
[1:51:33.100 --> 1:51:37.980]  people on the ground at Reagan National Airport did a phenomenal job as soon as this individual
[1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:46.780]  started behaving in a menacing harassing and truly deranged way the pilot the crew and
[1:51:46.780 --> 1:51:51.380]  everyone on the ground jumped into action they said Roger shouldn't be treated like this
[1:51:51.380 --> 1:51:57.980]  Roger is innocent until proven guilty they did a great job in standing for some yeah
[1:51:57.980 --> 1:52:02.420]  I notice they've got folks with assault rifles as the left calls them there for the leftist
[1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:07.060]  wow alright Jacob well great job with this and we appreciate you and anytime you've
[1:52:07.060 --> 1:52:10.820]  got breaking news or video call us and we'll get you right on we'll be watching the Central

[1:52:27.380 --> 1:52:37.020]  in a few days Roger is one of the most resilient confident compassionate motivated people that
[1:52:37.020 --> 1:52:41.300]  I know they have put so much on his shoulders they have put so much on the shoulders of
[1:52:41.300 --> 1:52:46.900]  his friends and family yet he is standing so tall right now and he is ready to prove
[1:52:46.900 --> 1:52:52.620]  his innocence at trial against overwhelming odds I mean it is an uphill battle in the
[1:52:52.620 --> 1:52:57.700]  swamp God bless you we'll talk again thank you thank you okay there goes Jacob Ingalls
