[00:00.000 --> 00:25.460]  2016 was not merely another four-year election.
[00:25.460 --> 00:30.860]  This was a defining moment in American history.
[00:30.860 --> 00:56.860]  Check them right there.
[00:56.860 --> 01:13.100]  By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there.
[01:13.100 --> 01:33.340]  You know what I say?
[01:33.340 --> 01:40.500]  The amount of press we have tonight reminds me of the Academy Awards before it went political
[01:40.500 --> 01:46.760]  and their ratings went down the tubes.
[01:46.760 --> 01:54.260]  I stand before you to officially launch my campaign for a second term as President of
[01:54.260 --> 01:56.260]  the United States.
[01:56.260 --> 02:04.660]  Very historic because exactly four years ago this week I announced my campaign for President
[02:04.660 --> 02:09.460]  of the United States.
[02:09.460 --> 02:13.420]  And it turned out to be more than just a political campaign.
[02:13.420 --> 02:22.020]  It turned out to be a great political movement because of you, a great movement.
[02:22.020 --> 02:26.220]  2016 was not merely another four-year election.
[02:26.220 --> 02:31.620]  This was a defining moment in American history.
[02:31.620 --> 02:39.660]  Check them right there.
[02:39.660 --> 02:48.820]  By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there.
[02:48.820 --> 02:54.100]  We took on a political machine that tried to take away your voice and your vote.
[02:54.100 --> 02:59.860]  They tried to take away your dignity and your destiny.
[02:59.860 --> 03:07.820]  But we will never let them do that, will we?
[03:07.820 --> 03:13.100]  Many times I said we would drain the swamp, and that is exactly what we are doing right
[03:13.100 --> 03:33.180]  now with draining the swamp.
[03:33.180 --> 03:42.220]  And that is why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently.
[03:42.220 --> 03:48.660]  For the last two and a half years we have been under siege.
[03:48.660 --> 03:53.860]  And with the Mueller report we won, and now they want a do-over.
[03:53.860 --> 03:54.860]  They want a do-over.
[03:54.860 --> 03:55.860]  Let's do it again.
[03:55.860 --> 03:59.860]  It didn't work out too well, let's do it again.
[03:59.860 --> 04:02.780]  They want a do-over.
[04:02.780 --> 04:06.860]  No president should ever have to go through this again.
[04:06.860 --> 04:12.980]  It is so bad for our great country, our hopes.
[04:12.980 --> 04:18.740]  Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice, and rage.
[04:18.740 --> 04:25.220]  They want to destroy you, and they want to destroy our country as we know it.
[04:25.220 --> 04:26.540]  Not acceptable.
[04:26.540 --> 04:27.860]  It's not going to happen.
[04:27.860 --> 04:32.700]  The only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot
[04:32.700 --> 04:33.700]  box.
[04:33.700 --> 04:38.820]  And they will understand, and they're going to see it.
[04:38.820 --> 04:45.220]  For the last two and a half years we have been under siege.
[04:45.220 --> 04:48.340]  And with the Mueller report we won, and now they want-
[04:48.340 --> 04:54.540]  Our access is more of these amazing compilations coming up on this Wednesday, June 19, 2019
[04:54.540 --> 04:56.180]  global transmission.
[04:56.180 --> 05:00.900]  We are under siege, but we're winning.
[05:00.900 --> 05:09.700]  So the Info Wars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[05:09.700 --> 05:14.620]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[05:14.620 --> 05:15.620]  one another.
[05:15.620 --> 05:20.260]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[05:20.260 --> 05:25.020]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[05:25.020 --> 05:29.260]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[05:29.260 --> 05:30.260]  content goes up.
[05:30.260 --> 05:34.500]  The audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Info
[05:34.500 --> 05:35.500]  Wars.
[05:35.500 --> 05:39.300]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[05:39.300 --> 05:43.140]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[05:43.140 --> 05:48.340]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[05:48.340 --> 05:52.140]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[05:52.140 --> 05:53.140]  to hold.
[05:53.140 --> 05:57.300]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[05:57.300 --> 06:24.180]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:24.180 --> 06:29.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today as we broadcast worldwide.
[06:29.740 --> 06:35.580]  I've done a lot of reflection on why the globalists hate this show so much and why they hate
[06:35.580 --> 06:39.780]  this broadcast so much and why they go to links never before seen to try to take us
[06:39.780 --> 06:40.780]  off the air.
[06:40.780 --> 06:47.820]  And it's because we're covering the technocracy, the global cashless society, the global cryptocurrency,
[06:47.820 --> 06:58.300]  the worldwide Chinese social score also known 2000 years ago in the book of revelations.
[06:58.300 --> 07:03.020]  They hate it because we know their plan and we are alerting our fellow humans to this
[07:03.020 --> 07:08.100]  demonic operation, this off-world operation that the Holy Bible warns us about.
[07:08.100 --> 07:12.620]  Yes, we're on a planet, yes, the enemy is not of this world, yes, everything's being
[07:12.620 --> 07:19.300]  set up to basically kill us but slowly so we never figure out what hit us and I prayed
[07:19.300 --> 07:25.340]  a lot last night and this morning I got up and hung out with my wife and my two-year-old
[07:25.340 --> 07:31.100]  daughter and then I went out and got on the elliptical for about an hour and I was just
[07:31.100 --> 07:37.380]  thinking about the world and what the most important issues are and it's subjects we've
[07:37.380 --> 07:42.460]  covered before but at the start of the next hour I'm going to spend three segments or
[07:42.460 --> 07:49.260]  so really delving into the number one threat of this whole system and a do or die point
[07:49.260 --> 07:51.260]  that we have reached.
[07:51.260 --> 07:56.740]  So that's going to be coming up at the start of the next hour.
[07:56.740 --> 07:59.460]  Trump knocked it out of the park.
[07:59.460 --> 08:05.460]  He's gotten way better and he was super powerful and informative when he first launched operations
[08:05.460 --> 08:10.460]  against the globalist four years ago, obviously got into office two and a half almost three
[08:10.460 --> 08:17.340]  years ago, but very, very powerful presentation last night in Florida.
[08:17.340 --> 08:22.440]  We had a bunch of our reporters there and crew, we've got a lot of amazing videos posted
[08:22.440 --> 08:27.740]  on infowars.com and newswars.com and we're going to go over some of that obviously here
[08:27.740 --> 08:36.220]  today but we also need to keep Trump's feet to the fire because he has a lot of special
[08:36.220 --> 08:40.260]  interest in there and in groups that are trying to block him and keep him from getting his
[08:40.260 --> 08:42.260]  or our agenda through.
[08:42.260 --> 08:50.260]  But Trump's the real deal but it doesn't mean that we agree with everything he's doing.
[08:50.260 --> 08:55.580]  It just means he's trying to be the president and he really cares about humanity and he's
[08:55.580 --> 08:58.700]  not out to get the American people or to screw us over.
[08:58.700 --> 09:05.380]  He doesn't have a systemic hatred of the nation like globalists have instilled in the left
[09:05.380 --> 09:07.660]  in this country.
[09:07.660 --> 09:17.180]  As I said though, Trump is 73 now and he comes from a very conservative family and by that
[09:17.180 --> 09:22.060]  very old fashioned his father and mother and Trump's a dinosaur.
[09:22.060 --> 09:24.140]  Now that's a good thing.
[09:24.140 --> 09:30.580]  It's good to have a throwback because the old fashioned system he follows is the vanguard
[09:30.580 --> 09:31.580]  of western culture.
[09:31.580 --> 09:38.060]  The system we have now is a corrupt collapsing leftist system of cancer from within.
[09:38.060 --> 09:40.900]  So what is old is really new.
[09:40.900 --> 09:44.860]  Our republic, our system, our Magna Carta, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, our
[09:44.860 --> 09:48.140]  Declaration of Independence, it is the Renaissance.
[09:48.140 --> 09:50.140]  It's the best system.
[09:50.140 --> 09:53.500]  So he called Trump a throwback for liking that.
[09:53.500 --> 09:59.260]  Well it just doesn't really hold water but when it comes to loving fast food and loving
[09:59.260 --> 10:02.860]  burnt steaks and ketchup, he's really very blue collar.
[10:02.860 --> 10:08.820]  That's not a bad thing but he's got big fat blind spots for things like 5G and he knows
[10:08.820 --> 10:14.460]  damn well Baron almost got mentally retarded from vaccines and I'm going to talk to folks
[10:14.460 --> 10:15.460]  that know the president.
[10:15.460 --> 10:17.500]  I never had the nerve to ask you myself.
[10:17.500 --> 10:24.460]  Baron came back for most of it but we need to now talk about what we're demanding of
[10:24.460 --> 10:29.900]  Trump because Trump's going to win re-election on the current course.
[10:29.900 --> 10:32.100]  He's doing the right things.
[10:32.100 --> 10:35.580]  He's about to deport a bunch of illegal aliens so the others watching around the world know
[10:35.580 --> 10:38.580]  to not come here to get their free ride.
[10:38.580 --> 10:44.420]  They're moving to change the immigration laws on people that claim that they are asylum
[10:44.420 --> 10:45.420]  seekers.
[10:45.420 --> 10:49.940]  It's all being abused by design to break the nation state, the UN, the globalists admit
[10:49.940 --> 10:50.940]  it.
[10:50.940 --> 10:57.900]  But the things that can sink Trump are things like forced inoculations, gun control, victim
[10:57.900 --> 11:04.660]  disarmament, getting into a war with Iran, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates
[11:04.660 --> 11:08.020]  again which Trump's pressuring him to lower them absolutely.
[11:08.020 --> 11:13.340]  We had no interest rates when Obama was in and then they raised him what, eight times
[11:13.340 --> 11:14.860]  when Trump got in?
[11:14.860 --> 11:20.180]  We need to cut some of those interest rates back because they want to implode the bubble
[11:20.180 --> 11:23.780]  that the globalists started before Trump gets a real recovery in place.
[11:23.780 --> 11:29.300]  So that's in the news that is the Federal Reserve about to cave Trump's demand to cut
[11:29.300 --> 11:30.300]  interest rates?
[11:30.300 --> 11:32.780]  Oh, no, that's just terrible.
[11:32.780 --> 11:39.900]  There's all these reports and there's CNN headlines, can his recovery hold or how can
[11:39.900 --> 11:40.900]  we stop it?
[11:40.900 --> 11:47.540]  You've all seen Bill Maher bemoaning some recovery and hoping we can have a depression
[11:47.540 --> 11:50.660]  so we can teach Americans to hate themselves.
[11:50.660 --> 11:55.260]  So we've been taught to hate the nation, hate ourselves, taught that we're losers, taught
[11:55.260 --> 11:59.300]  to not expect a better life or a better world.
[11:59.300 --> 12:02.420]  It's not going to work if we keep fighting.
[12:02.420 --> 12:04.700]  Meanwhile, AOC really writes the talking points.
[12:04.700 --> 12:08.180]  Now, the Democrats, she came out as you know two days ago and said that anyone being held
[12:08.180 --> 12:13.900]  at the border is basically in a death camp, although it's a concentration camp.
[12:13.900 --> 12:19.860]  Well now top Democrats are coming out with official talking points on MSNBC and CNN.
[12:19.860 --> 12:26.580]  We're going to play those after the break saying that it's all a giant concentration
[12:26.580 --> 12:27.580]  camp.
[12:27.580 --> 12:32.180]  Let me explain something to the leftist who I know know they're lying.
[12:32.180 --> 12:33.740]  How do you tell before their lips even move?
[12:33.740 --> 12:38.860]  You know, they're of their father, the devil, figuratively and archetypally and in reality
[12:38.860 --> 12:40.700]  as well.
[12:40.700 --> 12:43.740]  You don't fight to get into a concentration camp.
[12:43.740 --> 12:47.060]  You don't fight to get into a country that's bad.
[12:47.060 --> 12:51.940]  These people are fleeing collapsing third world hell holes where total corruption has
[12:51.940 --> 12:55.100]  set in.
[12:55.100 --> 12:59.220]  And they're coming here by the millions a quarter.
[12:59.220 --> 13:02.460]  They've caught on average about a million a year and now they're saying that numbers
[13:02.460 --> 13:07.540]  three times what it previously was, so it could be two or three million this year.
[13:07.540 --> 13:14.460]  And many of them are the very worst type, criminal records, mental illnesses, preexisting
[13:14.460 --> 13:18.380]  conditions to weigh down the country.
[13:18.380 --> 13:25.500]  But you just think about the weaponized media and they're having congressional hearings
[13:25.500 --> 13:30.380]  right now about reparations for slavery and there's more and more phenomenon where black
[13:30.380 --> 13:35.980]  people beat up white people and rape white women and say it's because of reparations
[13:35.980 --> 13:38.660]  because of the slavery we went through.
[13:38.660 --> 13:41.260]  This is total mind control.
[13:41.260 --> 13:47.180]  There are cases where women are raped in public and because they're white, we'll be covering
[13:47.180 --> 13:51.700]  it later, and the people videotape it and think it's okay because they're white so
[13:51.700 --> 13:58.580]  they deserve to have their teeth knocked out and their eyes busted open and their bodies
[13:58.580 --> 14:00.860]  raped because they're white.
[14:00.860 --> 14:04.980]  It's total leftist inflicted ideology.
[14:04.980 --> 14:09.340]  You turn on Netflix, a third of the shows are about black people being persecuted.
[14:09.340 --> 14:11.740]  It's not to help black people.
[14:11.740 --> 14:16.140]  It's to have the state further take over your countries, take over your nations, take over
[14:16.140 --> 14:19.300]  your families and make you dependent.
[14:19.300 --> 14:24.180]  Man nabbed for Bronx rape allegedly said she deserved it for slavery while he came with
[14:24.180 --> 14:28.660]  friends and shot videos of it.
[14:28.660 --> 14:40.140]  Imagine the disconnect, she went up with him on the roof at the apartment complex at night
[14:40.140 --> 14:45.540]  and instead of just having sex with her, he beat her half to death and raped her because
[14:45.540 --> 14:50.380]  she deserved it because she did something to him because she was white.
[14:50.380 --> 14:54.580]  That's beyond the KKK, beyond the Nazis.
[14:54.580 --> 14:58.340]  It's just total mindless idiocy.
[14:58.340 --> 15:00.180]  It's the West that ended slavery.
[15:00.180 --> 15:06.260]  It's the West that went in and taught people in Africa to stop eating themselves because
[15:06.260 --> 15:12.340]  we were doing it too a thousand years before but Christianity changed that and then due
[15:12.340 --> 15:16.620]  process and rule of law changed all that and the fourth hour today I'm going to be hosting,
[15:16.620 --> 15:22.940]  I'm going to get into the rule of law and why it's so important, why the West is committing
[15:22.940 --> 15:28.100]  suicide and may be too far gone but we can still have pockets of the West.
[15:28.100 --> 15:34.320]  The West is ideas and culture, not color, but if you don't celebrate it and admit its
[15:34.320 --> 15:41.260]  superiority you will be destroyed by the systems that are inferior.
[15:41.260 --> 15:45.460]  We all must recognize systems that are superior or be destroyed.
[15:45.460 --> 15:52.940]  When we come back, ladies and gentlemen, millions pouring across, you stop any of them, give
[15:52.940 --> 15:56.100]  a medical treatment, put them in a jail cell, is there a convicted criminal?
[15:56.100 --> 15:58.380]  You are a concentration camp guard.
[15:58.380 --> 16:00.780]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:00.780 --> 16:04.700]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.700 --> 16:06.260]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:06.260 --> 16:09.220]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.220 --> 16:12.500]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:12.500 --> 16:14.740]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.740 --> 16:16.060]  I can help you too.
[16:16.060 --> 16:19.060]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:19.060 --> 16:21.300]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:21.300 --> 16:29.420]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.420 --> 16:34.580]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[16:34.580 --> 16:38.820]  backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[16:38.820 --> 16:40.660]  important message you'll ever hear.
[16:40.660 --> 16:44.500]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:44.500 --> 16:49.100]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:49.100 --> 16:50.100]  off the grid.
[16:50.100 --> 16:53.980]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[16:53.980 --> 16:55.500]  bank of the Mississippi.
[16:55.500 --> 16:59.300]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:59.300 --> 17:03.060]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:03.060 --> 17:07.420]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:07.420 --> 17:08.780]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:08.780 --> 17:15.980]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com, that's myownpowergrid.com, over a thousand

[18:00.420 --> 18:05.740]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.740 --> 18:10.900]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.900 --> 18:17.740]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.740 --> 18:23.620]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.620 --> 18:26.940]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.940 --> 18:31.860]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[18:31.860 --> 18:38.220]  of this research a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.220 --> 18:41.820]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:41.820 --> 18:42.820]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.820 --> 18:46.540]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.540 --> 18:52.340]  triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.340 --> 18:55.020]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[19:54.500 --> 19:55.500]  Thank you for your support.
[19:55.500 --> 19:58.620]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[19:58.620 --> 20:03.580]  We're not going to back down.
[20:03.580 --> 20:10.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:33.580 --> 20:53.580]  Let me do this because I did a lot of preparation for this broadcast and sometimes it's those
[20:53.580 --> 21:01.900]  shows that are, I don't want to say bad broadcast, but they're not as informative as they could
[21:01.900 --> 21:08.940]  be because I tend to do so much preparation and so much research that then to try to even
[21:08.940 --> 21:14.380]  get into every quadrant of the news becomes an impossibility.
[21:14.380 --> 21:18.580]  But let me just tell you what's in front of me right now and then what's coming up today.
[21:18.580 --> 21:23.660]  Just to give you a little taste of things and how crazy things are.
[21:23.660 --> 21:29.180]  And then if people just break out of their trance and aren't helpless and break out
[21:29.180 --> 21:35.820]  of the Stockholm syndrome that so many people have been put into, we could game over this
[21:35.820 --> 21:38.940]  globalist system today.
[21:38.940 --> 21:43.540]  It could fall like the Berlin Wall today.
[21:43.540 --> 21:45.180]  Corporate media is already totally discredited.
[21:45.180 --> 21:46.380]  It's already totally bankrupt.
[21:46.380 --> 21:51.060]  It's being completely propped up by the globalist and big central banks and others that make
[21:51.060 --> 21:53.420]  money out of thin air.
[21:53.420 --> 21:57.900]  But their ideology, their world system is dead on arrival, but they're still just going
[21:57.900 --> 21:59.340]  ahead with it.
[21:59.340 --> 22:02.540]  So let me just give you an example.
[22:02.540 --> 22:12.780]  I'm so punch drunk to knowing that the Clintons run pedophilia and are pedophiles that it came
[22:12.780 --> 22:19.380]  out two days ago on NBC News National that indeed they protected a pedophile ring at
[22:19.380 --> 22:23.060]  the State Department that they used to control people.
[22:23.060 --> 22:24.060]  That's the headline.
[22:24.060 --> 22:27.980]  Hillary Clinton covered up pedophile ring at State Department.
[22:27.980 --> 22:29.740]  Now folks, I saw that two days ago.
[22:29.740 --> 22:32.420]  I saw the newscast admitting it.
[22:32.420 --> 22:38.020]  Do you realize that, yes, this just came back out this week.
[22:38.020 --> 22:43.780]  This was reported on years ago and no one even got in trouble.
[22:43.780 --> 22:48.020]  You know, is that the reason Matt Lauer was fired?
[22:48.020 --> 22:54.260]  But the point is, it's back in the news now.
[22:54.260 --> 23:01.860]  Now I have a whole stack about three inches tall.
[23:01.860 --> 23:07.260]  Did you know the woman that she uses to go around and pick up kids and transfer them around
[23:07.260 --> 23:13.700]  the country and the world got convicted of child kidnapping for sex trafficking and then
[23:13.700 --> 23:19.020]  changed her name and somehow runs Amber Alerts today?
[23:19.020 --> 23:22.980]  And when you go look that up, it'll completely blow you away or the group that runs Amber
[23:22.980 --> 23:23.980]  Alerts.
[23:23.980 --> 23:24.980]  Yeah.
[23:24.980 --> 23:33.020]  Got to know where the packages are going.
[23:33.020 --> 23:35.460]  Now that's just one stack, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:35.460 --> 23:42.860]  And then you wonder, document cam shot, please for TV viewers, how they would put out headlines
[23:42.860 --> 23:48.740]  the last two days, like this one.
[23:48.740 --> 23:51.020]  This is associated press.
[23:51.020 --> 23:52.540]  This isn't about me.
[23:52.540 --> 23:56.380]  This is about testing fake news.
[23:56.380 --> 24:00.620]  Robert Barnes, respected litigant, respected, you know, lawyer, a guy that sues a lot of
[24:00.620 --> 24:09.660]  people and wins, called AP four times in the last two days and talked to senior people
[24:09.660 --> 24:10.660]  he knows.
[24:10.660 --> 24:14.780]  And they said, Mr. Barnes, we've called, we can't get it changed.
[24:14.780 --> 24:16.820]  We've called management.
[24:16.820 --> 24:24.020]  They put out a headline 100% false and they know it's false and they made it the front
[24:24.020 --> 24:29.220]  of Yahoo and the top of Twitter almost all day yesterday.
[24:29.220 --> 24:32.020]  Everyone I know saw it basically.
[24:32.020 --> 24:39.780]  And people were like, well, were you convicted or did you do all this or did you just get
[24:39.780 --> 24:44.980]  found guilty civilly and I'm like, no, look at the headline of your radio listener.
[24:44.980 --> 24:49.060]  This is associated press published in hundreds of publications across the world.
[24:49.060 --> 24:51.900]  Wall Street Journal published it as well.
[24:51.900 --> 24:57.380]  Father of Sandy Hook victim wins defamation suit against Alex Jones.
[24:57.380 --> 25:02.660]  Alex Jones is the host of the conspiracy driven in four wars website and wrote a book titled
[25:02.660 --> 25:06.220]  Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[25:06.220 --> 25:09.820]  And ladies and gentlemen, I've never read that book.
[25:09.820 --> 25:12.460]  I have nothing to do with it.
[25:12.460 --> 25:17.500]  I interviewed one of the authors last time was probably 12 years ago, Professor Fetzer
[25:17.500 --> 25:19.820]  about 9 11.
[25:19.820 --> 25:21.140]  Other than that, I have no connection.
[25:21.140 --> 25:22.140]  I've never read the book.
[25:22.140 --> 25:23.900]  I don't own the book.
[25:23.900 --> 25:25.740]  I was not sued over the book.
[25:25.740 --> 25:31.060]  You understand they AP said it's staying up.
[25:31.060 --> 25:34.140]  Now, remember, this is weekend.
[25:34.140 --> 25:37.580]  They said we're at war with Russia and that we've knocked out their power grid in a bunch
[25:37.580 --> 25:42.420]  and tried to bring down their nuclear reactors, an act of psychotic war.
[25:42.420 --> 25:45.020]  Trump came out and said, that's absolutely BS.
[25:45.020 --> 25:47.540]  We didn't do that.
[25:47.540 --> 25:49.820]  He said, what the hell is wrong with the New York Times?
[25:49.820 --> 25:51.580]  Are you trying to start a nuclear war?
[25:51.580 --> 25:52.780]  You crazy people?
[25:52.780 --> 25:54.540]  And yes, they've gone crazy, folks.
[25:54.540 --> 25:57.060]  I don't know exactly what they're trying.
[25:57.060 --> 26:01.300]  But there's a whole stack of news here saying I sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families
[26:01.300 --> 26:03.780]  didn't know such thing.
[26:03.780 --> 26:06.100]  I was sent 9.6 million emails.
[26:06.100 --> 26:08.380]  They subpoenaed anything with Sandy Hook in the name.
[26:08.380 --> 26:09.980]  They got 57,000 emails.
[26:09.980 --> 26:14.580]  There was some hidden link in there that didn't even say child porn about Sandy Hook that
[26:14.580 --> 26:19.500]  they sent me in death threats, whoever it is death threats to me had hidden child porn.
[26:19.500 --> 26:23.500]  And the headline is Alex Jones is sending the child porn around.
[26:23.500 --> 26:29.460]  Now, a lot of folks did retract, Alyssa Milano, the young Turks, you know, they, they said
[26:29.460 --> 26:30.460]  it wasn't true.
[26:30.460 --> 26:31.460]  They were wrong.
[26:31.460 --> 26:40.060]  But not the Wall Street Journal, not the New York Times, not the Associated Press.
[26:40.060 --> 26:45.540]  They say now, I want that to sink in, I want that to sink in real good.
[26:45.540 --> 26:48.780]  They made it the front story.
[26:48.780 --> 26:55.500]  The top of Yahoo for several hours, but the front page of Yahoo all day.
[26:55.500 --> 27:03.340]  And in AP all over the country, that I wrote a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook that
[27:03.340 --> 27:07.620]  I've never read or touched.
[27:07.620 --> 27:09.540]  And then I lost a lawsuit.
[27:09.540 --> 27:14.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, I forgot to somewhere in my stack.
[27:14.180 --> 27:19.140]  We guys typed in it from like six years ago, Obama legalizes the use of domestic propaganda
[27:19.140 --> 27:22.220]  against the American people.
[27:22.220 --> 27:27.580]  Public affairs of the Washington Post, and they legalized the CIA putting out pure fake
[27:27.580 --> 27:28.580]  news.
[27:28.580 --> 27:29.580]  And it's gotten worse and worse.
[27:29.580 --> 27:30.940]  This is leftist in the CIA.
[27:30.940 --> 27:32.380]  They admit that's just running it.
[27:32.380 --> 27:37.420]  The congressional hearings, and they are now saying that I've lost a lawsuit, that I wrote
[27:37.420 --> 27:39.340]  a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[27:39.340 --> 27:40.340]  They know it's not true.
[27:40.340 --> 27:41.340]  They don't care.
[27:41.340 --> 27:42.340]  They know I didn't send child porn.
[27:42.340 --> 27:43.340]  They don't care.
[27:43.340 --> 27:46.460]  And I was asking one of the smart crew members this morning, so what do you think's next?
[27:46.460 --> 27:47.460]  They said more child porn.
[27:47.460 --> 27:51.580]  Yeah, they're just, they're just going to go with that.
[27:51.580 --> 27:54.780]  It's okay, because folks, I know why they're after us.
[27:54.780 --> 27:56.940]  I know why I'm going to cover it at the start of the next hour.
[27:56.940 --> 27:58.860]  I know why they want to software.
[27:58.860 --> 28:02.300]  I know the number one reason.
[28:02.300 --> 28:04.820]  And it's an honor to be here and an honor to go up against these folks.
[28:04.820 --> 28:07.740]  These people are criminal scum.
[28:07.740 --> 28:08.740]  And guess what?
[28:08.740 --> 28:18.860]  It's all coming out in the new nexum cult trial, the devil worship, the torture, the
[28:18.860 --> 28:27.060]  human sacrifice, and of course, Hillary and vault mainstream news.
[28:27.060 --> 28:33.100]  Trafficking children out of Mexico and Haiti that disappear, that disappear and sometimes
[28:33.100 --> 28:36.100]  they're found.
[28:36.100 --> 28:38.820]  You think about that.
[28:38.820 --> 28:44.100]  They are so scared right now and they want me to shut my mouth, never shut my mouth.
[28:44.100 --> 28:49.020]  So you go ahead and try to plant all the child porn you want on me.
[28:49.020 --> 28:50.020]  Nobody's buying it.
[28:50.020 --> 28:52.740]  You pack a knuckle dragon devil worshipers.
[28:52.740 --> 28:53.740]  You got that?
[28:53.740 --> 28:55.700]  You swiney pedos.
[28:55.700 --> 28:59.820]  America knows who you are, trash.
[28:59.820 --> 29:04.300]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[29:04.300 --> 29:08.620]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:08.620 --> 29:13.460]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:13.460 --> 29:17.020]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.020 --> 29:21.540]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:21.540 --> 29:22.540]  across America.
[29:22.540 --> 29:26.380]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.380 --> 29:30.100]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[29:30.100 --> 29:31.100]  healthier I feel.
[29:31.100 --> 29:33.780]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[29:58.300 --> 30:03.340]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[30:03.340 --> 30:07.300]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final
[30:07.300 --> 30:11.300]  bank accounts we have, do their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[30:11.300 --> 30:14.860]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[30:14.860 --> 30:15.860]  We need to end here.
[30:15.860 --> 30:19.940]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage
[30:19.940 --> 30:21.540]  forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[30:21.540 --> 30:25.380]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[30:25.380 --> 30:27.220]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[30:27.220 --> 30:31.260]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just
[30:31.260 --> 30:32.260]  brings more people here.
[30:32.260 --> 30:35.580]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.

[32:10.780 --> 32:17.300]  it's insane and I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time that the stumble
[32:17.300 --> 32:22.940]  up on deck as the captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking I've begged for
[32:22.940 --> 32:26.700]  your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real SOS if you
[32:26.700 --> 32:31.140]  don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be
[32:31.140 --> 32:36.300]  shut down not just crippled and so we've reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but
[32:36.300 --> 32:40.100]  you know whatever we have was stood so many of their attacks we've gone through so much
[32:40.100 --> 32:44.980]  because of your support you have you have been there but let me tell you they are pissed
[32:44.980 --> 32:49.700]  they haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault so we need your prayers
[32:49.700 --> 32:55.380]  your financial support and your word of mouth now at infowarsore.com it's your fight decide
[32:55.380 --> 33:04.100]  whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down you're listening
[33:04.100 --> 33:33.620]  to the alex jones show
[33:33.620 --> 33:56.900]  okay I tried to get started last segment saying that I would just tell you the news in front
[33:56.900 --> 34:00.740]  of me and of course I went into the first stack and just went ahead and went into it
[34:00.740 --> 34:04.620]  I've said this many times it's like the old tootsie roll ads they had back in the 70s
[34:04.620 --> 34:09.860]  and 80s where the kid asked the wise owl how many licks it takes to get to the center
[34:09.860 --> 34:15.380]  of a tootsie pop he goes one two three and three because you can never you know keep
[34:15.380 --> 34:19.820]  yourself from biting into it and it's the same thing let me just give you an example
[34:19.820 --> 34:28.300]  here of the news we've got new york lawmakers legalize illegal aliens getting drivers license
[34:28.300 --> 34:33.700]  and voting and so a bunch of other states and left to cities just totally criminal oh
[34:33.700 --> 34:37.300]  but illegal aliens don't vote they just say they should be able to vote and they do vote
[34:37.300 --> 34:42.380]  now in places like san francisco and then continuing right now on that line we've got
[34:42.380 --> 34:46.980]  all the big trump rally highlights and amazing things we're going to be getting to in the
[34:46.980 --> 34:51.460]  fact that they've invoked jesus christ using that powerful name that absolutely scares
[34:51.460 --> 34:59.540]  the globalist that's the that's the medicine we need we also again have other key reports
[34:59.540 --> 35:05.460]  here dealing with the economy israel holds large military drills ahead of us iran tensions
[35:05.460 --> 35:09.340]  and the us is basically saying that they're getting ready people that run our government
[35:09.340 --> 35:14.260]  to attack iran very unwise i think at this point by the president a lot of evidence points
[35:14.260 --> 35:19.580]  towards false flag but regardless this is the exact type of trap that they could use to try
[35:19.580 --> 35:25.220]  to bring us into a larger war and senator ran paul said this will be worse than iraq
[35:25.220 --> 35:33.540]  i agree by many many magnitudes many many magnitudes and then i haven't gotten into the latest
[35:33.540 --> 35:39.820]  on huawei and five g and what's unfolding with that whole fight and why trump is really
[35:39.820 --> 35:45.380]  shutting him down it's not just about the fact that can spy on us with these it's even
[35:45.380 --> 35:50.900]  bigger than that so wait till we get to that but on shroyer who hosts the war room three
[35:50.900 --> 35:57.980]  p.m. every day is here with us riding shotgun in the next part of the segment the next to
[35:57.980 --> 36:03.580]  announce something important and i want to be very very clear about all of this in the
[36:03.580 --> 36:11.700]  fight against the globalist diversification and having many legs to a stool is critical
[36:11.700 --> 36:15.780]  you know they've been trying for years to shut down info wars and really going to incredible
[36:15.780 --> 36:21.660]  links to do it the latest huge hoax stories that i've lost lawsuits huge hoax stories
[36:21.660 --> 36:26.340]  that i'm sending child porn to people just really dangerous stuff that signifies they're
[36:26.340 --> 36:30.500]  getting ready to try to physically remove trump and all of his key supporters they wouldn't
[36:30.500 --> 36:34.620]  be this reckless with the things they're currently doing if they weren't about to pull the trigger
[36:34.620 --> 36:41.420]  again ap it's still the top of twitter so we're talking 24 hours later please put it
[36:41.420 --> 36:50.340]  on screen for TV viewers twitter has the fake news story associated press father of sandy
[36:50.340 --> 36:54.620]  hook victim ones defamation lawsuit against alex jones alex jones is the host of conspiracy
[36:54.620 --> 36:59.720]  driven info wars website and wrote a book titled nobody died at sandy hook now we've
[36:59.720 --> 37:05.620]  called ap we've talked to senior people they said it's it's it's standing i am not the
[37:05.620 --> 37:09.300]  author of the book i have never read the book i have never touched the book i want to explain
[37:09.300 --> 37:13.700]  something the fact that they're doing the shows that they're signaling to the rest of
[37:13.700 --> 37:18.820]  the media the wall street journal the new york times have also done this that they're telling
[37:18.820 --> 37:23.980]  the young turks and all the sublings that retracted all this that i wasn't sending child porn
[37:23.980 --> 37:27.460]  because they know we're going to sue them they're saying no we're going to teach you
[37:27.460 --> 37:32.820]  how to lie properly we're going to teach you how to be deceptive here is foreign policy
[37:32.820 --> 37:39.900]  dot com part of the council on farm relations through the washington post here they are
[37:39.900 --> 37:48.180]  2013 u.s. replaces u.s. repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans
[37:48.180 --> 37:54.060]  they're going to say it's fake it's false but it is to help us be good americans that's
[37:54.060 --> 38:00.500]  obama well those groups are still in place and so you need to understand folks that it's
[38:00.500 --> 38:06.500]  not just us they're hitting with total fake news weaponized fake news they're hitting
[38:06.500 --> 38:12.500]  everybody out there and so you cannot believe almost anything you hear out of them anymore
[38:12.500 --> 38:17.020]  unless you know the background and the history when it comes out the clintons are in trials
[38:17.020 --> 38:20.740]  and it's coming out that they were involved in pedophile rings well of course they are
[38:20.740 --> 38:24.340]  i told you when this first cult got busted new york a few years ago that it was tied
[38:24.340 --> 38:28.460]  into smuggling out of mexico and kidnapped children and now it's it's in the news that's
[38:28.460 --> 38:35.740]  real but when you see them say that i wrote a book with jim fetzer i lost a lawsuit i'm
[38:35.740 --> 38:41.700]  not on the book it's not true they are testing to see what they can get away with so this
[38:41.700 --> 38:48.540]  is next level now i'm gonna plug right now and then out something very exciting i got
[38:48.540 --> 38:56.140]  paul watson and i'm not bragging i'm a smart to do it i got paul watson six years ago to
[38:56.140 --> 39:01.540]  start his twitter and his youtube in fact we set those up and gave them to him i said you
[39:01.540 --> 39:05.220]  need to get on air okay something happens to me you're just as smart as i am or smarter
[39:05.220 --> 39:09.180]  you need to be on air they can't ever take away the personality you build up and the
[39:09.180 --> 39:14.260]  followers you build up and that you work with he did it and now he's still able to reach
[39:14.260 --> 39:19.460]  millions a day i encouraged him to start his own website to try to hire his own people
[39:19.460 --> 39:23.260]  he didn't want to do all that they started banning him he's getting ready to hire people
[39:23.260 --> 39:27.580]  build a studio launch his own thing i told him get a subscribe star that hadn't been
[39:27.580 --> 39:32.500]  censoring people i told him get folks to donate because i had to cut his pay by more than half
[39:32.500 --> 39:36.940]  because they they're they're trying to kill us and he's an older employee but in 18 years
[39:36.940 --> 39:41.420]  he's highly paid oh and shroyer is not highly paid compared to paul he deserves a lot more
[39:41.420 --> 39:45.420]  but he's a great guy never asked for more money but he's frustrated he wants to build
[39:45.420 --> 39:50.460]  new sites he wants to do new things i said listen start a subscribe star still work here
[39:50.460 --> 39:54.740]  will amplify you will promote you will still pay you but that extra money that comes in
[39:54.740 --> 39:59.540]  you can spend it to build your own operation in case they put me in prison which they're
[39:59.540 --> 40:03.660]  getting close to trying to do they're currently on the news in connecticut saying he'd be
[40:03.660 --> 40:07.860]  arrested for sending child porn because they sent me to me in my email whoever did it and
[40:07.860 --> 40:11.300]  they're saying i death threaded somebody which i didn't they want me arrested they're talking
[40:11.300 --> 40:16.220]  about arresting me so we've got to we've got to build new systems as well so oh and tell
[40:16.220 --> 40:20.940]  folks about your subscribe star you've launched we launched a subscribe star for myself we've
[40:20.940 --> 40:26.900]  gotten a lot of people to donate it's just the beginning a subscribe star for slash alex
[40:26.900 --> 40:32.460]  jones again a subscribe star for slash is that actually url you have a subscribe star
[40:32.460 --> 40:37.260]  without a dot for slash alex jones i'll discover what the url is at some point let you know
[40:37.260 --> 40:43.460]  folks uh but but oh and tell us tell us tell us about this and i mean do you like my idea
[40:43.460 --> 40:48.460]  well here's the thing alex next to you i'm one of the most banned names out there i'm
[40:48.460 --> 40:51.860]  not allowed on youtube paul is still allowed i'm not allowed on facebook paul is still
[40:51.860 --> 40:57.220]  allowed i still have my twitter when i did my video this morning launching my subscribe
[40:57.220 --> 41:02.860]  star on twitter it was it was blocked and shut down so there is no other outlet alex
[41:02.860 --> 41:06.860]  i mean this is what we have to do and if we can find other platforms where we know we're
[41:06.860 --> 41:10.460]  not going to be banned and we where we know they're going to let us monetize and they
[41:10.460 --> 41:14.940]  take a very small percentage they don't steal our data they don't steal our private information
[41:14.940 --> 41:19.860]  uh i think subscribe star takes a very very tiny little percentage i they even show you
[41:19.860 --> 41:25.300]  in the numbers it's very small so the exciting thing for me is alex is you're pushing me
[41:25.300 --> 41:31.060]  to do this and create more content is i am going to create new original content on the
[41:31.060 --> 41:34.660]  subscribe star for my subscribers that you can't get anywhere else now i don't want people
[41:34.660 --> 41:38.260]  to think that this means i'm not working at info wars anymore because i'm not of course
[41:38.260 --> 41:42.940]  i am and i'll still be doing the war room every weekday three to six p.m. central info wars

[41:48.660 --> 41:54.140]  star that i've launched is just because i'm not allowed on any other platforms and because
[41:54.140 --> 41:58.820]  i have to create another outlet for myself because i know what's happening here i see
[41:58.820 --> 42:03.180]  what happens behind the scenes i see the attacks that you're under and alex you know you're
[42:03.180 --> 42:08.220]  just like number one target and people people want to discount you know you or me because
[42:08.220 --> 42:12.740]  i work at info wars so oh yeah shroyer gets banned off youtube uh facebook i hate works

[42:17.820 --> 42:21.500]  all of a sudden i don't have a platform anymore so i have to find a platform i have to create
[42:21.500 --> 42:25.580]  my own content and that's why i've started the subscribe star and we've got the urls

[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:29.660]  to the dark night we're not going to go into this dark night that's we're not going to
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:38.660]  go into dark night that's we're not going to go into this dark night that is we're not
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:46.700]  going to go into this dark night that's we're not going to go into this dark night back
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:54.100]  about world government run by a group of scientists who want to reduce world
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:07:01.580]  population by 99 percent. Now Moonraker was written back in the 1960s by Ian
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:07.220]  Fleming who'd been high-level OSS and then MI6 when they founded that in
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:15.500]  British intelligence. Now you've seen the Kingsman where you've got a rich group
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:23.540]  of billionaires that are going to send a code frequency over cell phones that are
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.700]  going to make people become violent, irritable, and start killing each other.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.940]  And if you pull back and you think about Netflix, which I only watch in the
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:37.500]  morning sometimes if I decide to not watch news, I guess every once in a while
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:46.500]  with my wife, when you tune into it, almost all the science fiction movies
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:52.580]  that they're churning out on a weekly basis with high production value from
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:59.620]  bird box to mother to all these shows are about worldwide extinction and
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:06.020]  everyone running around killing each other. And that's the big secret of bird
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:11.480]  box that no one knew what the movie was about until we said look at the
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.180]  beginning everybody's on their cell phones the people then get activated by
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:24.980]  a phone call. It's a digital slash electrochemical triggering weapon. So I sat
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:32.860]  back last night and this morning I woke up about 3.30 went to bed about 10 and I
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:39.900]  sat at the kitchen table with a piece of paper and I sat there for a good three
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:48.860]  hours till folks started getting up about 6.30 in the morning and I sat back and I
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:54.700]  said how do I warn people and the answer is just cut right to the chase. I don't
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.780]  know if aliens are running this but boy the technologies are coming out so fast
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:05.100]  and a lot of it doesn't look human-made. The way the government's so secretive
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:10.700]  compartmentalized the way the US seems to develop it all first then dole it out.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:16.980]  And what all the technology does is poison us, sterilize us and make us stupid.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:25.100]  All the Trojan horses are pavlovianly training us, conditioning us, ending our
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:30.780]  human relationships and making people irritable and aggressive in thousands of
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:40.280]  studies on smartphones, TVs and flicker rates. And I've been led into classified
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.420]  DARPA facilities. I didn't even realize what was happening at the time that I was
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:53.820]  being recruited almost 20 years ago and I was not recruited but I was allowed to
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:59.060]  see some of it and it was all about flicker rate, it was all about mesmerizing
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:05.700]  you, it was all about addicting you. This was just University of Texas
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:11.460]  facilities where the doors all said DARPA but explained only authorized
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:17.400]  personnel, didn't say classified. They then had computer screens to classified
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.020]  facilities around Texas like the primate research facility the largest in the
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:31.500]  world in Bastrop, Texas. Now let's cut right to the chase here. I don't
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:37.100]  know if Trump knows this but the establishment knows and they have laid
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:43.660]  out a grid worldwide of systems that don't just track the Internet of Things,
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:49.900]  that don't just surveil everything you do but that patently, I'll show you all
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:58.580]  even government documents, report studies, kill you, give you cancer at an
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:03.060]  accelerated rate way worse than spoken three packs of cigarettes a day and they
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:09.140]  can manipulate and throttle the frequencies in 5G that's going to be
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:18.980]  every 300 or 400 yards where they can rattle the DNA and literally split it
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:24.900]  apart causing cancer. They can give you cancer in these studies in a few days of
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:30.340]  being in proximity to one of these 5G that's turned to an oscillation where it
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:34.820]  goes up to a certain frequency and back down back and forth very quickly it
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:38.720]  breaks DNA and they have studies DARPA did studies on these as weapons those are
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.100]  declassified in the 70s where you hit troops with it they don't know what's
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:47.460]  happening they get nauseous they get irritable and then they basically die
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:52.580]  in about a month from cancers all over the body. So the government is putting
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:12:04.220]  in microwave cancer systems to literally fry you. The cover story is that it is for
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.020]  communications and super fast downloads it has nothing to do with that I'm going
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:11.620]  to go further in the Baltimore Sun 20 years ago there was even an article
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:17.580]  admitting that cell phone towers were being tested at the time to see if they
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:23.140]  could calm populations during riots I was on Joe Rogan's podcast a few months
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:28.740]  ago and I said type in cell phones radiation and human behavior he pulled
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.940]  up all the patents he pulled up all the admissions they were like wow we didn't
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:39.540]  know this old-fashioned cell phones who aren't anywhere as strong and whose
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:49.420]  waves are larger not as dangerous heat the brain within minutes one degree just
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:53.460]  type that in just type in cell phones heat the brain you'll get AP Reuters all
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:58.620]  this and they even tell you like a pack of cigarettes says can cause cancer can
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:03.980]  cause birth defects can you know kill you cause emphysema metaphysically they
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:09.220]  have to tell you and now wired in the LA Times the New York Times go yes
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:13.820]  cell phones give rats cancer and they give humans cancer and brain tumors
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:18.420]  associated with cell phones are way up multi-thousand percent and yes 5 g's
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:23.780]  much worse and yes 5 g's much stronger and yes 5 g's much smaller waves and
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:28.860]  yes it it does it does fry your DNA your DNA is why your cells replicate it's
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.780]  why you get cancer is when they start malfunctioning and they start having bad
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:39.660]  code so this is this is the big enchilada you can talk about vaccines and
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.700]  fluoride all the studies and what those are doing and forts and
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:46.580]  occupations have now begun in New York and they're passing laws and the
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.420]  American Medical Association says we're gonna give your kids shots will offer a
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:54.620]  money and no more parental consent will give your kids shots California already
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:59.940]  passed that law as the test five years ago all that is secondary the GMO
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.820]  manipulating your DNA causing the rats to be totally infertile within three
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:08.020]  generations all of that was just the heat up all the allergies all the
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.300]  increased cancers all the increased neurological disorders all of it oh and
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.380]  let me tell you also these systems do Doppler radar I was told by an engineer
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:22.980]  again this is all like 20 years ago 23 years ago and then I talked to other
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.580]  folks that were aware of it and I thought they were crazy and they said
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.300]  listen the power cables are 10 to 20 times stronger going into Doppler radar
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.780]  and there's a federal government program to put it in there really to fry the
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.540]  atmosphere and either cause droughts or cause floods and then later it was all
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:41.780]  declassified the exact same Doppler antennas are used in the Middle East to
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:46.780]  make the desert green to make it rain to form nuclei to rattle the water
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:53.460]  particles and dust particles in the air to make it either not rain or rain or to
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:59.460]  control storms that's now mainstream news there's a super advanced technology
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:03.540]  and civilization that broke away from us okay they just give us the things they
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:07.540]  want us to have like a microwave phone to fry our kids brains to fry their
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:11.380]  genitals to fry their organs to make them habituate to the to the phone and not
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.180]  to their parents and they don't have relationships and all the studies show
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:18.780]  relationships are falling apart and brain damage is everywhere all timers in
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:23.700]  like 25 year olds are setting in and even BBC studies the studies they show
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.700]  said that it's because it's causing rewiring of the brain this is all
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:33.220]  killing us and they're telling us everywhere what they're doing how they're
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:39.740]  doing it you understand and now 5g when we come back I'll explain what it's
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:44.860]  really about and why they won't let the chai comms run it I'm gonna explain why
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:52.660]  when we come back and this is a scientific fact scientific fact ignore
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.540]  this at your peril

[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:03.540]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:11.860]  western world history this is a digital AI enforced gag order not to say the
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:16.700]  name Alex Jones are in four wars dot com
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:24.780]  this is Nazi Germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr. president
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:31.500]  we need your help we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info wars
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:37.020]  as a dominant independent anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign pro-family
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:42.180]  populist organization so they thought first they come for Alex Jones then
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.580]  when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes with
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:51.060]  fall the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:54.940]  a standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:59.140]  take us down they'll take everybody else down
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:21.940]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show I'm Alex Jones your host and the facts
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:28.460]  are in ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna tell you why they're doing this slow kill
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:33.260]  soft kill operation in a moment but first I want to tell you the big secret
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:38.820]  which is all hiding in plain view you can search every term everything I've
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:43.180]  said I can show you a whole stack of mainstream news admitting it wired
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:47.940]  magazine 5g causes cancer period hundreds of major studies way worse than
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:53.620]  regular cell phone radiation why why is Trump in Australia and the UK and
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.700]  Facebook and all these big companies and governments and our military saying
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:03.180]  for five years no wall way phones in our facilities why are they saying no
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:07.380]  wall way 5g well while we'd already been the main 5g in the US going in all
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:12.620]  over rural areas where they would put it in basically at cost or below it but
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:19.540]  only in areas the Pentagon noticed around military bases so let me tell you
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:27.020]  what they admit with 5g it can penetrate hardened facilities you name it it can
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:36.780]  get into unwired boxes and scan what is going on in the chips and that's because
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:41.660]  a lot of classified things but a lot of chips have tiny capacitors and
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:47.580]  transmitters transceivers in them and these systems can then scoop up out of
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:53.020]  the ether pass codes you name it it's a it's a device that goes into all the
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:57.580]  so-called smart devices and big tech has been building this global architecture
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:01.820]  to take over the world the Internet of Things and set up this technocracy it's
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:10.420]  it's bad and so now there's a global rush and a global race who can launch the
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:15.700]  first omnipresent AI system that has this omnipresent vision through all of
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:19.860]  these nodes and all of these 5g systems that's what Elon Musk talked about last
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:27.580]  year but where those who worship AI gods you've now got digital police officers
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:32.140]  actually pulling cars over robot police officers this is the rollout so humans
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.660]  can't say no to the technocracy run by the technocrats the rulers of the
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:41.940]  digital dictatorship that's what a technocracy is a digital dictatorship in
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:48.500]  Davos and the club of Rome have all said humanity's obsolete they're gonna merge
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.700]  with machines soon militaries won't matter soon men won't matter because it'll
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:59.940]  all be automated the post-human era but I digress the big thing you don't hear is
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:04.220]  this and all you gotta do is search engines government documents patents
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:10.260]  that cell phone radiation can alter human behavior not just cost cancer not
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:15.260]  just break DNA and that in many studies they've been testing for more than 40
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:21.820]  years using electromagnetic wavelength systems to change or alter moods or even
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:28.020]  kill people and so our government wants to put in 5g to be able to spy on us
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:37.300]  monitor us track us control us but also change our behavior or even kill us now
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:40.860]  our government shouldn't have that power and hackers shouldn't have the power to
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.100]  get into something like that it's like the ring of Mordor it will only be used
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:51.220]  for bad but imagine if the Communist Chinese put in the 5g grid that can
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:57.460]  make you depressed make you nauseous make you angry make you sexually excited
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:03.380]  this is all declassified with 30 40 year old studies this is all associated
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:13.980]  press daily mail popular much science what I'm telling you is admitted so what
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:21.700]  we do I was looking at my 26 month old daughter this morning so smart so funny
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:26.060]  and I looked at my wife and I said I told everybody I wanted a wired house
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:29.860]  here where everything was wires I paid for it everybody's got wireless and I
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:33.340]  went and I plugged it myself we're not having internet till the wireless is out
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.780]  of here because it's always just by increment getting more and more powerful
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:41.300]  more and more dangerous and I said doesn't matter they got better call Saul
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:45.580]  shows you know with a crazy bad lawyer brother you know is schizophrenic and
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:49.060]  thinks that the others radiation pollution or all this garbage this is
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:53.780]  real and I said to her I said and we've got to have a multi-year plan to get out
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:58.940]  of Austin and get to the country and then try to get people to run for office
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:04.700]  locally to have a town somewhere that says no 5g or above and that's gonna be
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:08.340]  the future because let me tell you I've got a stack of mainstream news la times
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:13.460]  where you'll have a school of a couple hundred kids and 30 of them have got
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:17.580]  cancer and there's a cell tower on the roof and teachers are all dying of
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:22.620]  cancer and getting nosebleeds and don't know who they are
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:27.900]  they've already got 5g in many areas many of these cell towers are beyond 5g
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:33.500]  they've got all sorts of systems going in and ladies and gentlemen they don't
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:36.580]  want to tell you they don't want you to know they don't want you to be aware of
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.660]  it but let me tell you something about radiation there's lots of different types
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:43.180]  of it but the sun will burn your skin if you're out in all day till you die and
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.860]  that stuff only penetrates maybe a quarter inch into you this stuff goes
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:50.900]  right through you it goes right through walls it's ultra fast and it's at the
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:56.220]  exact frequency to rattle DNA don't believe me type in cell phone radiation
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:02.740]  breaks DNA studies show there's hundreds of those breaks your DNA that means
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:08.820]  cancer so here's some of the articles 5g smartphones cause cancer big wireless
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:12.060]  doesn't want you to know wired
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:17.780]  5g services is coming and so are health concerns over the towers that support it
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:23.580]  yeah that's the really bad one the phones bad enough a switch to 5g may be bad
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:27.700]  for the environment newsweek even admits it plan for 5g cell phone towers raises
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:33.020]  health concerns the rollout of 5g wireless services a massive health
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:41.140]  experiment daily mail ripon cell tower to be removed from school grounds mothers
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:45.880]  of cancer survivors share feelings of release and all the kids that are dead
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:51.700]  and dying and it goes through it all maybe we should show some pictures of
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:56.380]  the dead and dying children from the cell tower right above the school right
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:04.300]  there here's LA Times data shows it causes cancer
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:15.620]  protest in Albany to new to Europe to Russia want 5g out people know and so
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:21.100]  here's the answer we oppose it we speak out against it and if you've bought a
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.500]  house you live somewhere and you've said no and that stuff goes up it's time to
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:30.700]  start fighting with civil disobedience because this does cause cancer it's way
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:34.820]  more powerful than the previous radiation and we're not gonna let them
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.700]  they want to abort our kids before they're born they want to kill them after
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.100]  they're born now they want to kill them when they're living and they can't do
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:44.220]  that they want to teach them to cut their genitals off that's who they are
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:48.980]  that it's an evil frequency it's an anti-human operation it's why I say it's
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:53.700]  alien and I don't get into UFOs and all that stuff I'm reading the Bible folks
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:58.340]  there's a fallen entity that hates our guts because we were made by God his
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:03.620]  enemy and it's obsessed with rolling something out but we have free will we
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:07.740]  have to accept it we have to get addicted to it and everything it does is
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:12.140]  dumb us down break up our families give us cancer rewire our brains make us
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:15.860]  depressed and all of us live in this all of us are hypocrites I'm in this
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:20.580]  quicksand with you I'm in this La Brea tar pit Facebook came out last week and
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:24.100]  said we're watching you in your home watch what you say now they've announced
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:29.300]  a global government currency with the big banks and they say if you don't act
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.660]  like they want they'll shut you off it's all here it's all happening it's all
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:40.620]  real so why does Trump want it shut down from the Chinese not the spine that's
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:46.100]  secondary the Chinese can kill you with it not just slowly they could kill you in
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:51.380]  days with 5g in days for the right back
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:01.340]  hi I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:05.660]  seize my mother's house I sued the IRS and won I beat the IRS then and I've
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:09.060]  been beating them ever since I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.020]  helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be

[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:03.140]  listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:07.300]  this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info or 50% off
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:11.500]  but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.980]  like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:17.940]  okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.860]  get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:23.860]  bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:28.060]  millions of dollars a product I want to expand that contract and for six months
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:31.140]  we've not just made a standstill the enemy's been winning and I have labored
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:35.320]  and labored and labored and labored on this I like to be expanding I like to be
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.940]  winning I like to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's why we're
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:41.980]  so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:44.940]  up we never have time to get in the drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:49.660]  and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really gonna plant child porn
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:52.860]  on us then they're gonna kill me or you or anybody else I mean the Democrats now
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.780]  we're going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the

[01:32:56.580 --> 01:33:22.380]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show he aligns himself with the truth and
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:32.180]  it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones let me just
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:36.420]  say one more thing about the rollout of all these toxic systems that are meant
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:40.940]  to reduce our population by stealth because the system knows that we'll
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:45.980]  adapt to rising cancer rates will adapt to rising infant mortality will adapt
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:51.860]  to lowering IQs we'll never know what hit us with a soft-kill weapon silent
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:56.980]  weapons for quiet wars there's an article out of zero hedge a morphological
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.380]  adaptation smartphones now transforming the human skeleton modern lives
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:04.940]  transforming the human skeleton humans are now developing a bone spike at the
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:09.180]  back of the head caused by regularly looking down at their smartphones or a
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:12.620]  derogable hump according to recent study the phenomenon is called the
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:18.300]  external occipital protuberance a lump on the back of the head believed to be
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:22.940]  caused by the body reacting to the smartphone used by growing new bone
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:30.340]  layers on the back of the skull now I'm gonna explain this again what's
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:32.940]  happening is we're losing our relationships we're losing our
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:36.380]  communication with each other young people especially that's all the studies
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:42.100]  look it up it's causing real-time brain damage real-time rewiring of the brain
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:48.300]  that's just the manipulation of the Pavlovian flashing screen and the way
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:52.300]  it manipulates our dopamine you have the former co-founder of Facebook all these
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:56.780]  people saying we did it immorally to manipulate you and control you so that
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:00.860]  bots would then be your friends and bots would then manipulate you not even
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:05.980]  humans anymore but the avatars you believe are humans and that's how they
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:10.100]  then maneuver leftist into being so vicious so crazed such maniacs because
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:15.540]  they're mainly living online in closing it's the old parable of the vampire
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:21.060]  vampires aren't real but the archetype is real that you have to invite evil in
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:29.380]  you have to go buy the cell phone you have to bring it into your home you have
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:33.620]  to learn to get look into its eyes when it says come here and give it your
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:37.580]  worship and give it your time and it beings and it buzzes like Pavlov's
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:42.980]  bell to the dog and before you know it you are entranced you are entranced
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:46.020]  people aren't having sex anymore because of Netflix people aren't having babies
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:48.940]  anymore because of Netflix the study show because their smartphones because
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:52.820]  it's their whole world we try to talk to someone particularly mesmerized by it
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.300]  they'll look at you angrily because you can't deliver the dopamine the instant
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:03.100]  manipulation that it can so they're pulling me away you're associated with
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:08.100]  depression you're associated with not being a good person you're associated
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:11.780]  with taking them out of the matrix they want to be back in the matrix but
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:17.820]  slowly in the matrix they're being destroyed that's what the studies show
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:24.180]  so Trump knows that 5g and all the studies is able to manipulate human
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:27.860]  behavior they don't want the Chinese to have access to that well our government
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:31.820]  shouldn't have that and so I'm glad to see movements and lawsuits and people
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:35.060]  saying no to 5g because of what we know what's doing the other stuff's been
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.380]  deadly so why would they ratchet it up why would our government to do
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:42.380]  something like that why would systems bring things in like this with they
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:48.500]  know hurts us well there's some letters that have been found between French and
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:54.060]  British Kings where they talk about oh cousin I've had an uprising oh I'm
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:57.500]  married to your sister oh I'm married to your cousin they're the same family
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:02.660]  it's time to have a war and so they kill off a bunch of people in a war well
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:06.380]  you're killing off some of your strongest men so they want to pose you but
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:10.460]  what about hurting the DNA of everybody what about dumbing everybody down and
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:13.620]  breaking up the family in the human system well that's the decision that's
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:18.260]  been made the city has been made that we're a cancer by our leaders whoever's
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:22.820]  directing them and we're entering a post-human era and so I want to have a
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.820]  pro-human era and I want to see space exploration and I want to see us
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:31.500]  transcend this planet but the decision has been made that that's not going to
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.580]  happen and Elon Musk and others have been inside the boardrooms so as Bill
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:38.340]  Joy they've told you that you'll have several hundred top-tech people
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:44.540]  billionaires all and they agree they have votes on this program they have votes
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.940]  on the global program of world population reduction by any means
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.340]  necessary the sterilization the dumbing down and if you look at what they're
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:55.540]  mainly attacking it's not the third world the truth is the globalists are
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:59.740]  threatened just like kings were of their best men it's focusing on the highest
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:07.420]  IQs the most aggressive and smart populations it is a parallel to a
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:18.340]  grizzly bear male that's drawn to have sex with a female bear and what's the
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:23.820]  technical sign of it no a female bear looked that up for me a sow I forget but
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.420]  but she's got her cubs you've got the what's the male called a bull I'm going
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:31.940]  from memory here you know I know a female fox is a vixen they all these weird
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:37.180]  names for male this female that in the animal kingdom but even though it's his
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:42.980]  cub if it's a male he'll try to kill it and and that's what the globalists are
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:47.900]  they're trying to kill the best that's the secret of eugenics they're not
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:51.660]  threatened by people that aren't that high IQ they're threatened by people that
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.220]  are because they see them as pretenders to the power and that's what this is this
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:39:08.900]  global infanticide male bears are called boars did I get it right and then she's
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:15.540]  called a sal I didn't get it right well did I wow okay what is a group of
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.980]  crows called a gaggle what's a really big group of crows called a murder now
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:23.340]  this is I read a book once that had all the old English names for things and it
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:30.460]  is it gets really wild a male fox is called a dog the females of vixen anyways
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:33.660]  I digress shifting gears out of that we're about to go to Robert Barnes with
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:37.220]  big updates on the First Amendment battles here in a moment first off again
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:43.100]  please do not forget that they are in the news trying to frame me with child
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:46.620]  porn and when I say somebody who said they're mad at me for covering Sandy
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:50.740]  Hook sent me hidden child porn I never opened the national news now says I'm
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:53.820]  sending child porn around and then and then they say oh and you're calling a
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:58.140]  lawyer the person responsible no I didn't I said their whole canard is what's

[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:29.140]  with Robert Barnes Bob so much has happened and I'm here to have some
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:33.340]  updates for us on the other side but first off they're still running AP
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:37.540]  articles saying when I lost a lawsuit and that I wrote a book I didn't write
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:42.580]  it's still the front of Twitter that means this must be on purpose no doubt I
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:47.260]  mean the market watch is involved with that AP at one time was involved in that
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:51.380]  they clearly know it's false they've been told it's false they have not but
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:55.820]  yet still there has been a failure to issue corrections and issue
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:00.100]  retractions by a wide range of people there's there's many that have but
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.620]  there's many that have not and it's clearly deliberate fully intentional goes
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:07.420]  back to about you know I think about a year ago where there was some random
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:12.420]  crime on some California or Texas highway and they stuck your face on the
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:15.820]  photo I mean they they stuck your photo in a news story that has nothing to do
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.940]  with you whatsoever in terms of this other lawsuit out of Wisconsin they're
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:23.540]  definitely testing yeah yeah yeah yeah somebody attacked the police on the road
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:28.900]  then you said it was Alex Jones exactly so they put that up there then and now
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:32.420]  they've done it again if someone the headlines actually falsely list your
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:35.660]  name they claim you wrote a book you had nothing to do with there have been so
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:39.980]  many sandy hook lies told it by the media in this contact but the biggest ones
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:44.060]  have been told about you and against you and that's what's ultimately gonna get
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:47.300]  exposed and the lawsuits that we're going to have to bring and we're gonna
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:51.340]  have to help create an organization stay there exactly let's talk about why
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:54.460]  they're so bold right now I think it signals they're about to make a move on
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:43:06.100]  Trump stay with us

[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:04.540]  info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:08.780]  self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:12.100]  free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:16.620]  sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:20.900]  of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:24.940]  self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:28.540]  structure that because the audience determines what content goes up the
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:32.060]  audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:35.020]  supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:39.220]  whatever it is whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:42.500]  that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:46.580]  ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech support
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:50.220]  letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:53.500]  want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression and
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:57.180]  experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:01.620]  markets only very very clear with everybody about all of this we're
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:05.300]  going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:08.260]  final mega counts we have do their criminal activity in there and their
[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:12.500]  digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:16.500]  year we need to end here we need to be provisioned and you've got my total
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.100]  commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.940]  fearlessly I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:26.900]  their skin I'm bloody and then I'm up politically I'm banging heads with them
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:30.460]  and they can't help but attack back with lies that just brings more people here
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:35.020]  so I'm in one hell of a fight so are you and I need war bonds I need gas I need
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:39.300]  ammo politically now but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:42.260]  us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're

[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:51.820]  that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:55.500]  back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and more
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:59.900]  understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:06.060]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:27.580]  you can add somebody else to the clinton body counter appears yeah we upon it
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:33.060]  dot com reports corrupt clinton foundation foreign policy director
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:40.500]  desia appears to have vanished and while NBC news reports Clinton covered up
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:46.020]  had a fall ring at the State Department's all starting to break and in the
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:51.860]  next film cult trial we learned there was devil worship children trafficked
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:58.500]  and disappearing oh and the clentons were involved blackmailing people
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:03.580]  involved any direction the clentons go there's aircraft and small children
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:09.580]  disappearing but don't worry if you talk about about them they'll have the
[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:15.540]  front page of Twitter for two days now say alex jones is a pedophile and that
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:19.860]  I wrote a book about sandy hook not happening and I lost a suit none of its
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:25.540]  true and not as if you search alex jones it's the top thing yesterday it was the
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:31.700]  top link and again robert barnes constitutional lawyer represents
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:35.540]  covington kids represents you know famous hollywood folks represents
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:39.700]  billionaires he's an admitted top litigator you know courthouse junkyard
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:44.540]  dog killer of giants and he says he's never seen anything like it I was talking
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:49.580]  to him last night he called high-level AP people and they said I'll tell you what
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:55.100]  he wants to tell you they said again this is bigger than us Bob just to I've
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:57.900]  never seen something of this magnitude but we know what it is
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:02.300]  Obama legalized the CIA engaging in domestic propaganda the washington
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:07.460]  post reported foreign policy dot com the foreign policy journal the washington
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:12.100]  post basically a CFR paper and they admit we're lying to you and we're
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:16.420]  putting out this info inside the US and it's still going on and trump hasn't
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:24.060]  stopped it what do you think this is a test or what is this Bob I mean I it's
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:27.260]  an onslaught I mean in part it's a reflection of the fact that they are
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:31.740]  losing the battle at multiple levels so the fact that the audience has not gone
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:36.940]  away the audience has stayed with stayed with the audience has continued to
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:41.100]  contribute has continued to be involved has continued to buy a product and
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:45.420]  support info wars make sure info wars can stay afloat despite this
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:50.820]  unprecedented onslaught and attack clearly has agitated those who are
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:54.220]  against you and want to see you destroyed they thought the lawsuits would
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:58.980]  achieve that objective they did not they thought the the various PR and press
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:02.740]  attack would achieve that objective they have not they thought the politicians
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:06.300]  calling for you to be banned would achieve that it has not they thought the
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:10.860]  de-platforming by Twitter and by YouTube and by Google would have that effect it
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:14.860]  did not they thought that Facebook and Instagram banning the use of even your
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:19.340]  name and a favorable positive light would have that effect it did not they
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:23.580]  have been unable to defeat the info wars audience and and that do in that
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:27.820]  frustration and that exasperation with their inability to achieve their
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:32.020]  objective also to take out the president at the same time in terms of all of the
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:35.660]  two attempts effectively that were being waged by the rogue Mueller
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:40.420]  investigation when that ultimately shut down and was shut down by the general
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:46.060]  bar the combined effect of seeing the president to achieve and attain success
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:50.820]  continue to be in a good position to win 2020 while continuing to see the info
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:55.780]  wars audience support you and support itself by by being involved in you're
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:00.260]  saying we're seeing a massive temper tantrum exactly a temper tantrum of
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:03.340]  unparalleled proportion the things they accuse you of are things that they
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:07.900]  themselves are doing so the and this is a consistent and continuous pattern of
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:12.540]  the press and the politicians and your political adversaries making things up
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:16.700]  and this particularly it starts with a motion filed in court where they say
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:21.180]  lawyers said things that the lawyers never said the lawyers were careful in
[01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:24.300]  what they said the lawyers never said any of the things that were in the
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:28.820]  headline then you have a verdict from another case in Wisconsin that has
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:32.420]  absolutely nothing to do with you whatsoever initially they liable by
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:36.140]  just taking your photo in but not mentioning you by name and then some
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:39.620]  idiot editor at the Associated Press and Market Watch and these other places
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:44.220]  says oh that photo is Alex Jones so the lawsuit must be about Alex Jones even the
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:48.300]  new story never was and this is editors who are doing this so I mean I've talked
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:51.860]  to a reporter at the Associated Press who didn't know how in the world this
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:56.020]  story happened and was trying to find ways to track it down and fix it many of
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:59.900]  these stories have no reporters name attached so that means they took the
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:03.980]  story from someone else and it's editors who are doing this it's the people at
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:08.540]  the top oh we know this this this has CIA written all over it that's exactly
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:12.460]  who goes in and an operation mockingbird in the group Obama set up is
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:16.740]  shadowy unnamed editors just put out fake news and they think people are so
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:20.900]  stupid they say I've lost a suit so they can probably use that against banks and
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:24.660]  say oh look he's insolvent when I'm not and I wrote a book about kids and I'm
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:28.700]  sending out child porn none of which was said in court none of which is true all
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:32.260]  of which is made up this is next level which which again it's not about me
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:35.100]  sure they're scared of the populist audience that's who they're really scared
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.900]  of it's true I'm not building the audience up they admit their own internal
[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:42.020]  documents that have gone public but we're a focal point a gathering spot but
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:46.140]  it means they're about to make a move on Trump I really think them saying that he
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:49.660]  attacked Russia when he didn't and all this other credit and attempt you know
[01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:54.180]  the ship I think that this is really signifies they're getting ready to do
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:58.900]  something well they're clearly accelerated so there's the accelerated they
[01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:02.980]  failed to get any of the impeachment investigation talk stuff going they fail
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:06.220]  to be able to get the Mueller report to lead to anything consequential or
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:10.060]  impactful they know that impeachment actually motivates more of Trump's base
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:14.620]  than motivates their opposition and so all of this sort of rhetoric I mean they
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:18.380]  were originally greenlighting violence and the sort of cultural celebration from
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:23.260]  the from the play in Broadway that was just shown here to the the play in New
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:27.700]  York to the to later on with Snoop Dogg doing something similar so they're
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:32.220]  trying to create an environment that would justify somewhat act violently against
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:36.340]  the president you saw this sort of a welcoming of milkshaking quote unquote
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:40.780]  which was physical assaults on people in the United Kingdom hoping that that
[01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:44.620]  would translate here here they're trying to accelerate the allegations against
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:47.900]  you that they know are completely and utterly false they're going to create a
[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:51.460]  wide range of potential libel claims against some of the biggest members of
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:56.540]  the institutional press in the world and at the that usually parallels and
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:00.900]  proceed and seeds an attack on the president and it would be logical for
[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.580]  them to do so the perspective of everything they've thrown out of his
[01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:07.380]  failure and yesterday he launches his political rally in Orlando it goes
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:12.340]  incredibly successfully it has a huge crowd that is a long line outside of it
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:17.700]  CNN is so affected by the success of the presentation that they shut down and
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:22.140]  broadcast six minutes six minutes into it so you have these sort of you have this
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:26.820]  dynamic of the president excited of the populist revolution the humanitarian
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:30.740]  revolution succeeding and all of a sudden you get these escalating talks
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:34.700]  that are encouraging a war with Iran escalating talk before that of trying to
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:38.740]  encourage a war that as well well up escalating talks trying to encourage
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:43.940]  encourage a conflict with pressure and this parallels the unprecedented assault
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:48.220]  on info wars and you based on complete lies and libel's that they know are lies
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:53.900]  a lot so whatever is happening to you is usually a is usually a at the beginning
[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:58.140]  the it's a foreshadowing of what they're going to do to the president so the
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:01.940]  president needs to be awake and alert all of this also happens after Attorney
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.580]  General Barr generally shut down the Mueller investigation but green lights a
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:10.660]  anti-trust investigation into big tech today Senator Holly introduced the
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:14.700]  legislation for the first time in the United States Senate that would call for
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:19.580]  ending big tech special immunities for their censorship activity that section
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.980]  230 would be modified and changed and not allow them to do what they're doing
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:26.880]  today where Twitter is is promoting articles that they know are lies and
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:30.820]  libel's about that they're only able to get away with as a platform because they
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:35.940]  pretend they're not a publisher and that's another key point Bob is that
[01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:41.220]  I'm off these platforms I cannot even respond and say I didn't write that book
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:46.180]  that they didn't say I sent child porn it's just devastatingly reckless
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:48.980]  meaning they think either they're going to be destroyed or we're going to be
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:52.940]  overthrown and we're going to be shut down so it won't matter what they did
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:56.860]  they are acting in a desperate scorched earth policy now I want to say one
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:02.380]  thing critical to the viewers viewers and listeners I wouldn't be here if it
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:05.900]  wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:10.780]  seen but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:14.700]  tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:18.460]  week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars you
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:22.660]  went and looked it up and found out the truth and so I feel very strong and I
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:26.460]  feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart I want you know
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:30.980]  that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've done
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:34.140]  with your word of mouth and your prayers your financial support because I'm
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:38.980]  committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm going to be
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:42.780]  destroyed and it's not going to be fun but that's not what's important the
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:47.940]  enemy could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by God
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:52.140]  you're being used by God this is providence so I salute you and I thank
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:56.660]  you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart Bob we're going to break you
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:57:01.660]  come back with us some next hour what are other things on your radar so I think
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:05.020]  in general you're looking at for example of the what happened in the
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:08.660]  Connecticut court case you're seeing judges issue rulings that say they're
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:12.660]  controlling over their ability to control a party means they have a right
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:16.020]  to suppress or punish their first amendment speech that's disconcerting
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:19.340]  but we're going to bring that up to the constitutional structure and what you
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:23.340]  also mentioned is the dystopian future that the combination of deep platforming
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:27.660]  and defamation create and that is that here they're able to lie in liable you
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:32.820]  and you have no ability and no means to make a personal defense on the very
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:36.620]  platforms and against the very publication that are lying libly you
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:40.740]  because they have completely removed you from the ability to do so this is the
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:43.940]  future they want to create for all Americans that's right absolutely this
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:46.860]  is critical stay with us
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:51.260]  briefly folks please do not forget this is the maximum alert we wouldn't be here

[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:55.900]  life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:14.220]  you found it the kryptonite to globalist whatever it is we're doing they
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:17.380]  don't like it I haven't heard one of the local newscasts or all the national
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:19.940]  newscasts lying about us it's one thing look at the news articles another thing
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:26.060]  to watch people attack you and lie about you but the judge up there in
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:31.500]  Connecticut we'll talk about her some because it's bigger than info wars and
[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:36.260]  does she not understand how the internet works or what's going on we're in a
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:40.180]  place of that newscast next segment but you talk about the Connecticut post
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:45.820]  that's very unrespected you know a known kind of rag like the inquires like the
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:50.140]  high mark compared to them judge sanctions alex jones for child porn
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:56.700]  frame claim so and I guess that is what the judge said like that's why we're
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:01.180]  appealing it in her letting the suit go forward basically what's happened we were
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:04.060]  even challenging to throw it out we still have another chance obviously several
[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:09.900]  to throw it out but she is saying you shouldn't question that anybody we were
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:15.300]  sent this by people death-threading us we're getting it all from the FBI they
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:19.500]  said we were the victim I'm saying I'm being set up so they say that I'm saying
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:24.660]  Chris Matty set me up no I'm not saying that I'm saying Chris Matty I believe
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:27.500]  went to the FBI to try to get me arrested they basically admit that now
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.340]  they say it's illegal that I transmitted child porn no somebody sent me
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:35.460]  unopened emails they went and asked for all our Sandy Hook emails it was buried
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:39.940]  hidden in a Sandy Hook email hidden links and then I'm supposed to the bad guy of
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:44.260]  course I'm pissed off and then these articles come out you know saying that
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:48.300]  I've transmitted child porn and then Matty goes out and does a press conference
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:54.340]  it goes along with it so it's just unbelievable Bob well precisely the
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:02:00.140]  big issue here is you have courts and lawyers advocating for a position that
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:04.540]  says that there's a exception to the First Amendment if you're a party to a
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:10.580]  lawsuit and if there's a special safe space for lawyers which I find sort of
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:15.700]  lucre the idea of being a lawyer in a case does not entitle you to be immune
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:21.860]  from criticism even harsh even harsh criticism that's that's the reality that
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:25.540]  goes with it clear my main criticism was whoever tried to frame me with a child
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:29.540]  porn and then I said in this whole gaggle trying to bring me down me thinks
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:33.140]  they protest too much I did not say Chris Matty was who sent it to me but then
[02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:36.260]  the media said it was him and now he's bought into that narrative is the
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:41.540]  victim correct yes and I think independent of I think the judge got
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:45.700]  things wrong here about what the place and what transpired but putting aside
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:49.340]  that she I think got the fact wrong I think that the facts show that there
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:52.700]  wasn't any attempts to take your time we've got next segment too so I mean
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:56.660]  walk through that it's interesting absolutely so I mean the underlying facts
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:01.140]  are different than what the judge had apparently concluded in the sense that
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:05.820]  there wasn't the criticism was focused on whoever it was who was sending these
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:11.580]  malware attacks sending these child porn embedded attacks on info wars that
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:15.660]  was where the criticism was that's where the anger was expressed or and there
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.980]  was some confusion and deliberate confusion on the behalf on behalf of
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:23.420]  the press to try to confuse that but independent of that the as a general
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:29.380]  matter as a universal matter no court should ever sanction use its power to
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:33.740]  sanction a person for speech that occurred outside of court when there's
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:38.060]  not even a constitutionally imposed gag order in play and in general well most
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:42.700]  gag orders are unconstitutional that's why courts now don't issue them they
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:47.620]  cannot circumvent that constitutional requirement by imposing punishment on
[02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:52.220]  people for questioning or critiquing other the other side to the judge got the
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:57.700]  facts wrong even if the judge was right about the fact she it is very dangerous
[02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:04.100]  for courts to use its extraordinary power over litigant and parties to a case to
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:07.900]  punish them for their speech that's just wrong period
[02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:11.680]  paddice thinks that paddice obviously case of Connecticut he thinks even in
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:16.900]  Connecticut being very liberal that the courts are gonna overturn this yes they
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:21.140]  have to there's simply no precedent for this there is no precedent where a court
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:25.540]  has been allowed to sanction someone for their out of court well paddice claims
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:29.380]  there's a case where somebody outside said something to a party who was a
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:34.660]  woman and that intimidated her but but I mean the that's called fighting work so
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:38.020]  if you have imminent lawless action where you're the physical presence of
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:41.380]  someone then that's a different dynamic that isn't what happened here at all
[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:45.340]  even by the judges this misunderstanding the facts it's not what happened so if
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:49.700]  if courts start you miss using their power to censor suppress or punish
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:53.020]  people for their speech we're in a dangerous position in our let's talk
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:57.980]  about this isn't a dangerous power grab the globalists know that if they
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:01.180]  suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:06.940]  fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:11.060]  population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:16.060]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:19.900]  iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block
[02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:23.620]  us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:28.300]  nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:32.780]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:37.340]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:41.460]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:48.220]  iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available
[02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:51.580]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:57.380]  incredible discovery x3 now available at m4's live dot-com
[02:05:57.380 --> 02:06:18.780]  from the front lines of the information war
[02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:29.580]  it's alex jones
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:36.580]  gleam in their eyes as the ship's clothes every man decided to get some
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:49.660]  action field ships barreling over closing the other ships are running we'll
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:57.220]  catch it when we do there's gonna be a new world order all right but not the
[02:06:57.220 --> 02:07:04.700]  one they thought all right coming in with some ministry you know ministries
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:10.260]  a big fan of al jorgensen its last four or five albums are in fours inspired he
[02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:17.580]  is quite interesting character I'll leave it at that not name-dropping there's a
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:21.060]  lot a lot of folks are listeners of the show
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:25.100]  it reminded me of something sad with another friend of mine that's in music
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:29.180]  but I'm gonna get into that today Bob Barnes let's talk about this judge and
[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:33.220]  play this newscast because this again now this is not Alex Jones I would not
[02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:37.420]  have a show every day spending 30 40 minutes about me but but the way we're
[02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:41.380]  being persecuted what's happening the way the news is saying judge sanctions
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:45.340]  Jones for thinking he was framed with whoever sent me child porn well whoever
[02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:48.900]  sent it said I'm gonna kill you and had hidden porn links of course they were
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:53.460]  trying to frame me the media said that I was saying that Chris Maddie was that I
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:56.740]  made it clear then and the next day before they followed these motions that
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:01.220]  it wasn't Chris Maddie when the press said that this former Democrat federal
[02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:05.700]  prosecutor so recapping how dangerous this is there's no precedent out there
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:10.660]  for what this judge said Norm Pattis was blown away by the judge and the fact
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:15.020]  that reportedly she was even thinking about a default judgment against us but
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:20.380]  didn't go that far my god and only only said oh we're not gonna you know
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:26.900]  consider your slap motion we're gonna set a trial date for this because Chris
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:31.340]  Maddie made himself the victim I mean this is this is new in American law isn't
[02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:35.860]  it yes it is I mean there have been prior attempts to issue gag orders on
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:40.300]  parties but here there was no gag order in place because constitutionally there
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:44.260]  wouldn't there shouldn't be one and the other side wants to be able to talk to
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:48.380]  the press it will so when you have a situation like this for people out there
[02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:52.100]  generally might our greater concern is even the court got certain facts wrong
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:56.700]  here it's much bigger than your case or your situation this is about the
[02:08:56.700 --> 02:09:00.980]  public's right because the public gets educated about their legal right through
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:04.780]  high-profile cases and it's one reason why I have been involved in these for
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:08.420]  many years and have commented on even in cases I'm not involved in because the
[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:12.300]  public gets their interpretation and their legal education through how the
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:15.620]  high-profile cases are covered and what they think they're entitled to or not
[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:19.380]  entitled to what rights they believe they have or do not have are shaped by
[02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:24.100]  that and the very dangerous precedent that was being attempted to be set here
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:29.820]  was that if a court didn't like the out-of-court statement of a party to
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:33.540]  criticizing the lawyer for the other side not a party for the other side but
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:37.100]  criticizing a lawyer for the other side even though she got a lot of the facts
[02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:41.380]  wrong about what she assumed to place here putting that aside even if she was
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:46.660]  right it is a dangerous pattern and precedent to set to say that out-of-court
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:50.260]  speech that is otherwise completely protected by the First Amendment by
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:09:55.180]  everybody's admission and acknowledge is somehow no longer subject to the First
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:59.420]  Amendment's protection and is outside the First Amendment's protection and a judge
[02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:04.220]  can use their mighty power of the gavel to effectively suppress, censor, and
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:09.420]  punish speech they dislike so that's the scary part part one so not only would a
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:13.460]  gag order here would have been unconstitutional you can't circumvent
[02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:18.620]  that unconstitutional unconstitutional provision by effectively punishing
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:21.860]  someone for engaging in speech you couldn't prohibit under the Constitution
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:25.580]  in the First Amendment in the first place the second scary component of this
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:29.580]  is there's more and more lawyer who appear to believe that this isn't being
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:32.900]  particularly critical of the lawyers in Connecticut this is about the general
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:36.220]  mindset of the lawyers across the country where there are more lawyers that
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:39.340]  I'm running into who believe that they're supposed to have a safe space
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:43.780]  protection around them that means that if they bring a lawsuit magically
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:47.140]  somehow because they bring a lawsuit they're supposed to be immune from
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:51.900]  public criticism I have been subject to more attacks that on probably almost any
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:55.980]  high-profile lawyer and I mean after I was involved in the Covington case is
[02:10:55.980 --> 02:11:00.060]  just the most recent example I have the FBI still investigating bomb threats
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:04.300]  against my offices the I had death threats on a repeated basis I have
[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:09.220]  people hack my email account or try to try to hack my social media account they
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:13.580]  created a fake website a fake site online I was supposed to be Barnes law and
[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:18.100]  created fake reviews to defame me and libel me and they did it behind and an
[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:22.660]  anonymous rank this is annoying but it's part of the course this is what
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:26.740]  happened all of that behavior is actually illicit behavior what I never
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:30.660]  even thought of it is to go to a bar association or go to a court and
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:34.700]  complain about other people saying bad things about me because I filed a suit
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:38.820]  that's just insane but that's what that's what the other lawyers in Texas are
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:41.580]  doing they're trying to create a system where you can't even talk about what a
[02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:45.740]  lawyer has said about us they can talk the left can talk but we can't and then
[02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:49.940]  liberal judges go or leftist judges say that's the case you're gonna be here
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:53.620]  next week we're gonna make a big announcement I'm gonna leave it at that
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:57.940]  and the next week and a half or so but we are definitely taking action then
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.540]  there's gonna be some lawsuits after that we're not litigious we're not looking
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:03.940]  for that but folks you want people to fight for America you want people to
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:06.860]  stand up and say no to the globalist you want people to report on the Clintons
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:10.180]  and all the pedophile rings that are now in the news you want people to you know
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:16.140]  expose globalism or the Islamic invasion we're doing it and we're not backing
[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:20.500]  down and we're exposing the Covington hoax first we expose it first we're
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:23.780]  exposing it all we are the tip of the spear you are the tip of the spear and
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:28.820]  that's why everybody has to remember we're running a save in full wars special
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:33.140]  right now to get more capital in because we've not been able to expand we've
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:36.860]  actually been contracting some the enemy has been winning with all their attacks
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:41.140]  we're still reaching a lot of people thanks to you but we need capital to get
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:44.020]  more reporters in the field to launch a bunch of stuff we've got ready to do
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:47.980]  that is gonna devastate the globalist and we've proven we don't talk we
[02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:52.820]  deliver but I need war bonds I need capital info or store.com store

[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:41.660]  got to go that's fine if you didn't I'm not putting on the spot if you got to go
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:44.260]  it's fine with me you want to do one more segment I haven't gotten to this
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:48.900]  newscast with the media attacking me with with what they're saying what
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:52.340]  they're doing just as a template and an example if you've got time I'd hold you
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:55.700]  over and play that get your take if not closing comments the last two minutes we
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:14:00.100]  have. No I definitely have time I mean I think as I've said the other day and I
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:05.020]  said to the people in the press your case is the template case for American
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:09.060]  freedom moving forward and the and it's the whether or not they can break the
[02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:12.860]  info wars base whether or not they can stop the info wars audience from
[02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:16.860]  supporting the info wars network. Because again what you said in corporate
[02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:20.980]  documents the model of self-funding self-sales is the thing that the
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:24.940]  corporations the globalist fear because crowdsourcing and individuals doing this
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:29.420]  scares the living daylights out of them. Absolutely it's not only that you have a
[02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:33.580]  unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's
[02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:38.540]  unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:42.460]  backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:46.620]  billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign government that's not
[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:50.980]  being backed by corporate advertising it is completely independent of all that.
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:56.380]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.260]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:04.060]  concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:08.140]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:11.540]  wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:15.260]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been
[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:19.660]  able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:24.460]  or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that the
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:29.460]  they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age of
[02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:32.620]  ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:37.660]  unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and
[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:42.100]  libel targeting youth. But as you said like the Star Spangled Banner in the
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:45.820]  morning the flag was still there and now the enemy is getting really pissed and
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:51.100]  putting out giant mega hoaxes against us I see it as a sign of weakness we'll see
[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:53.900]  what Bob thinks on the other side then we're gonna play this news report then

[02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:54.980]  here it is
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:22:00.340]  there is Alex Jones in trouble here in Connecticut Jones who once called the
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:05.140]  Sandy Hook massacre a hoax is causing another store and this time it's over
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:08.900]  implying that an attorney representing those families tried to frame him with
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:12.220]  child pornography today both sides were in court for a hearing and so was
[02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:15.620]  channel 3 new Haven bureau chief Matt McFarland who joins us live now with
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:23.060]  what happened man well Dennis the judge came down on Jones and his attorneys
[02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:28.220]  sanctioning the info wars host claiming and saying that his behavior was
[02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:33.540]  indefensible unconscionable and possibly criminal they say when he made
[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:37.860]  those statements online they said the judge said if he wanted to have an
[02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:41.260]  issue and he thought he was being framed and set up she says he could have gone
[02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:44.780]  to authorities she says he could have a filed a motion with a court but she says
[02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:48.980]  when he went on his web show and actually named attorney Chris Maddie and
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:54.100]  made these allegations she says that's when he crossed the line let's zoom in
[02:22:54.100 --> 02:23:07.260]  on Chris Maddie oh nice little Chris Maddie what a good American what a good
[02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:16.260]  boy you think you'll put on me what you want it you got it it's this recent
[02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:20.420]  roughly 20 minute ramp by info wars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones with
[02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:23.940]  his attorney Norm Pettis by his side that led to lawyers meeting in this
[02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:27.540]  bridgeport courtroom today attorneys representing Sandy Hook families in
[02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:31.620]  their defamation lawsuit against Jones filed a motion with the court asking for
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:35.300]  sanctions and penalties saying they've had to reach out to law enforcement and
[02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:38.940]  are getting threats after Jones mentioned attorney Chris Maddie by name
[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:43.060]  showing his picture and inferring that Maddie was behind the child pornography
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:47.540]  that turned up in emails handed over during discovery Jones and his attorney
[02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:51.620]  argued the emails had been sent to him by others and that no one associated with
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:55.500]  him ever opened them even offering a reward to anyone who could provide
[02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:59.860]  information leading to a conviction they say the FBI is now investigating who
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:04.580]  sent the emails today in court attorneys representing Jones argued he had walked
[02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:08.460]  back his initial comments claiming what Jones said wasn't a threat or
[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:12.620]  harassment and that is a right to free speech but the judge wasn't buying it
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:16.660]  handing down the sanctions saying Jones's words and actions were unacceptable
[02:24:16.660 --> 02:24:22.500]  let me say this about mr. Jones's conduct his conduct and I think the court
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:26.100]  concluded this really threatened the integrity of judicial proceedings here
[02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:30.100]  in Connecticut and that was the basis for why she imposed sanctions and we think
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:35.460]  it was appropriate now we're told Jones's attorneys will appeal today's ruling
[02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:39.160]  now up on that 6-4 courtroom today's part of the sanctions the judge ruled that
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:43.020]  Jones has lost his special motion to dismiss this case he'll also be
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:47.380]  responsible for paying the plaintiff's attorney's fees regarding the child
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.940]  pornography issue as for the defamation lawsuit a trial date has been set for
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:55.220]  November of 2020 we're live with the mobile newsroom in Bridgeport Matt
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:25:02.660]  McFarlane Channel 3 eyewitness news so Bob what's your take on that couple of
[02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:05.700]  things you notice how they're mixing and matching things so this is how the media
[02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:09.140]  lies when they are at least more successful at lying outside of the
[02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:13.220]  libel law what they do is so they took something that involved a legitimate
[02:25:13.220 --> 02:25:16.940]  concern where if there's no question the FBI has already confirmed you're
[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:20.780]  innocent the FBI has already confirmed if someone was sending you malware the
[02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:24.260]  FBI has already confirmed that someone was trying to frame you none of that is
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:28.500]  in dispute none of that is in controversy but they confuse and conflate
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:33.460]  that issue with the separate issue of whether or not at negative statements
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:38.500]  made about the lawyer constitute a basis for sanctions and instead they make it
[02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:43.140]  sound like oh you know Jones says he was set up but really the Jones the judge
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:46.660]  didn't make that determination and the judge is really sanctioning him for
[02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:50.020]  saying he was set up which is all fault that isn't what happened in the court
[02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:52.980]  proceedings that isn't what the judge did that isn't what the lawyers did it
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:56.420]  isn't what happened so that's the creative way in which the press lies they
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:26:01.300]  lie by association they lie by affiliation they lie by any window they
[02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:04.820]  lie by connecting things that are actually not connected to one another to
[02:26:04.820 --> 02:26:10.060]  create a bigger broader wider deeper lie so part of what the media station here
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:13.020]  is doing that and that's what the media coverage is trying to do they're trying
[02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:16.980]  to say oh actually the judge rebuked Jones for saying that he was set up or
[02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:20.660]  that he was framed totally fault just said no such thing there's didn't rule on
[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:24.620]  that at all in fact undisputed and incontroverted that someone tried to
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:29.340]  deliberately sabotage you deliberately undermine you deliberately tried to
[02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:34.500]  frame you and the press went along with it with their false and libelous
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:38.900]  headline that is not be nobody in court has ever said anything different so
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:42.620]  there that's the biggest sort of innuendo lie that they're trying to tell the
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:46.820]  second part there is the attempt by the defense lawyer the plaintiff's lawyer to
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:51.140]  defend the court's ruling by saying that somehow judicial proceedings were
[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:55.420]  jeopardized complete nonsense the first amendment is clear the first amendment
[02:26:55.420 --> 02:27:00.380]  does not allow a court to say well I want lawyer lawyers to be specially
[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:05.540]  protected and so I'm not going to allow harmful speech to be issued against them
[02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:10.020]  that's just not the case there has to be a call for imminent lawless action under
[02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:13.940]  the Brandenburg decision under the Skokie decision under along under the West
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:17.420] boro Baptist decision in each of those cases people were saying things that
[02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:21.820]  were truly offensive I mean you had the Nazis marching in the in the neighborhood
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:26.180]  that had the highest per capita number of Holocaust victims in America you had
[02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:30.300]  the Klan organizing in in the Brandenburg case right outside of an
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:34.020]  African-American neighborhood and Bob we're almost out of time but in closing
[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:37.460]  here we talked last night I mean you want to get into the fact that we didn't
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:41.020]  do this on purpose I got mad they mixed together what I said they misrepresented
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:43.740]  we're not worried about that yeah they're trying to get criminal charges all
[02:27:43.740 --> 02:27:47.900]  the rest of it whatever whatever just it'll just make us more of a martyr
[02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:50.740]  people don't know this is true so fill your hand if that's what you want to do
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:54.660]  politically but you made the point that the judge was probably gonna throw out
[02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:58.140]  our slap deal anyways the way she's been behaving but now they've got an
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:03.300]  actual appeal we've got a good chance of winning by this precipitous action and
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:06.940]  no doubt they made a mistake and the tactical decisions they made and the
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:10.620]  judge made a mistake because the judge made it clear that there's a frankly
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:14.580]  lack of respect in the Connecticut court system for the First Amendment of the
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:19.100]  United States Constitution the First Amendment for the lawsuit itself is a
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:22.620]  slap in the face of the First Amendment the United States Constitution and the
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:25.980]  court's order is a slap in the face for the First Amendment the United States
[02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:30.340]  Constitution and now that issue is clearly cleanly presented alright so I
[02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:35.140]  think that's why I think consequently if the protection of the First Amendment of
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:39.420]  the United States the lead person doing it the lead organization doing it is
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:45.060]  important you are the key to defending the First Amendment for everybody and I
[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:48.980]  have no criminal record no history of it I'm in another state it's clearly they
[02:28:48.980 --> 02:28:52.180]  just made all this up alright God bless you Bob we'll talk to you in the studio
[02:28:52.180 --> 02:28:57.780]  soon we'll be right back with a big news attention GCN self-reliance listeners
[02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:01.700]  if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but we're
[02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:05.860]  waiting for prices too crazy to pass up this will be the most important message
[02:29:05.860 --> 02:29:09.140]  you'll ever hear Bill Hyde here I want to tell you about a huge sale with his
[02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:13.060]  historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's gonna let you
[02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:16.380]  produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid the clearance
[02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:19.780]  price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the
[02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:23.260]  east bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:26.900]  our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:29.820]  warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:33.900]  unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory so here's what you
[02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:38.300]  should do right now check out the PPX microgrid system at my own power grid
[02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:42.700]  dot-com that's my own power grid dot-com over a thousand dollars in great
[02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:46.340]  off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too in the best part you're not gonna
[02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:52.140]  pay 750 or $500 300 or even 200 go to my own power grid dot-com to learn more
[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:57.980]  that's my own power grid dot-com Frank in North Carolina thanks for holding so
[02:29:57.980 --> 02:30:02.220]  long go ahead yeah I just have to say something man it seems like every time

[02:30:57.340 --> 02:31:01.420]  everybody about all of this we're going into the season of war and they have
[02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:04.860]  been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have do their criminal
[02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:08.460]  activity in there and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've got
[02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:12.580]  capital to go six months a year we need the in here we need to be provisioned
[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:16.380]  and you've got my total commitment that I am gonna rampage forward against the
[02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:20.460]  enemy fearlessly I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under
[02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:24.420]  their skin I'm bloody and then I'm up politically I'm banging heads with them
[02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:27.980]  and they can't help but attack back with lies that just brings more people here
[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:32.460]  so I'm in one hell of a fight so are you and I need war bonds I need gas I need
[02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:36.780]  ammo politically now but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood
[02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:39.740]  us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're
[02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:42.700]  unstoppable we're unstoppable together I want to send a strong message to the
[02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:46.060]  enemy I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know
[02:31:46.060 --> 02:31:49.300]  that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never
[02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:52.980]  back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and more
[02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:57.420]  understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this I just want
[02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:01.020]  listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[02:32:01.020 --> 02:32:05.220]  us and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off
[02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:09.420]  but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:13.220]  like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton okay
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:16.380]  but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty
[02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:19.220]  thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the
[02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:22.220]  lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of
[02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:26.340]  dollars of product I want to expand not contract and for six months we've not
[02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:29.780]  spent a stance till the enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:33.540]  and labored and labored on this I like to be expanding I like to be winning I
[02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:36.260]  like to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's why we're so hated
[02:32:36.260 --> 02:32:40.300]  but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed up we
[02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:43.820]  never have time to get into dry we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:48.060]  wants to silence us then they're really gonna plant child porn on us then
[02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:50.860]  they're gonna kill me or you or anybody else I mean the Democrats now we're
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:54.060]  going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the tricom
[02:32:54.060 --> 02:32:57.780]  show go to infowars store.com
[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:04.380]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:19.460]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[02:33:19.460 --> 02:33:25.780]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you've got one
[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:33.300]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:52.940]  I'm hosting the 4th hour today we were gonna pop in but I've got three really
[02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:58.500]  powerful reports that I saw on YouTube and so many of these people I've never
[02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:04.020]  heard of and I just get stuck for hours watching their great research so I want to
[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:08.460]  talk about those folks and alert you to the presence though many of you are
[02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:12.340]  probably already aware of who they are and one of them I found out about
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:16.460]  because they were that banned on YouTube so there was a big protest I went and
[02:34:16.460 --> 02:34:21.420]  watched it very intellectual from a liberal perspective not a leftist
[02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:27.540]  perspective but a liberal perspective that's coming up next hour Paul Watson
[02:34:27.540 --> 02:34:33.180]  did a very informative report on cyberpunk that came out in the 1980s that
[02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:39.940]  a black writer created and people are wondering how they predicted everything
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:45.540]  so exactly I'm gonna explain something I'm not saying that the author of the
[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:51.260]  cyberpunk series is a bad guy my dad was in research science when he was in
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:55.620]  high school and he was in plan 2 at UT where high school kids went to UT okay
[02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:59.220]  and they're like the public doesn't know about our nuclear reactors or our
[02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:05.500]  computers or by the time he was going to UT as a you know adult young adult
[02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:11.780]  they already had CD-ROM all this stuff what you're shown in the news and what
[02:35:11.780 --> 02:35:17.500]  you're what they admit to is only the tip of the iceberg and so we're gonna
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:21.940]  play that cyberpunk the eerily accurate predictions of cyberpunk 2020 next hour
[02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:30.900]  as well with my analysis so it's a big fourth hour today and we're doing a lot
[02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:41.480]  of exciting stuff I bought Millie Weaver and crew because they're contractors an
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:49.060]  RV our RV burn up in a big famous fire that happened in Round Rock a few
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:54.780]  months ago it was like hundreds of RVs burn up some electrical fire so I took
[02:35:54.780 --> 02:35:58.740]  the money from the insurance of that and I just bought them an RV just I didn't
[02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:03.780]  give it to them I gave them an interest-free loan over the years but I'm
[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:08.060]  not I'm not bragging here they're on fire Caitlyn Bennett works whether she
[02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:11.780]  hired Caitlyn Bennett or their contractors together and they she goes
[02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:15.740]  around with her husband and Caitlyn goes around their fiance and they get
[02:36:15.740 --> 02:36:20.460]  physically attacked and they get everything and you know Caitlyn Bennett
[02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:24.020]  comes along and says I've got an idea or I got her to town they were so busy
[02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:26.860]  shooting stuff going down to the abortion rallies the pro-abortion rallies
[02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:30.940]  to cover them and getting beat up by those women that I could never get with
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:35.460]  Caitlyn even have time to go how can I finance while I still have money getting
[02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:40.180]  you on your feet even more because you kick ass so much you see and I'm gonna
[02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:43.940]  go back to this I'm gonna hit all the news when I get up here talk about Paul
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:49.660]  me throwing him out of the nest that's not like bragging it had to be done
[02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:56.940]  anybody ever read Oliver Stones and and Millis is Conan the barbarian it's a
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:37:01.100]  very good movie credit destroyer is a terrible movie but Conan's already the
[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:07.260]  top gladiator in the world the known world and and he's sleeping outside they
[02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:11.260]  come out with an axe and hack off the chains and say go because it's just not
[02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:17.140]  right to have somebody who's successful and strong and and and good under your
[02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:22.860]  wings anymore it's time for them to go it's time to be emancipated it's time to
[02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:26.620]  not be a slave I'm saying Paul is my slave but but I know Paul that talks
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:29.700]  folks that know him well in England's like yeah I like y'all looks like what
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:34.220]  he does but he is kind of a maniac and I want to be my own person I'm like well
[02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:39.420]  good let me help you be your own person and it's the same thing with Owen it's
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:41.980]  the same thing with Millie it's the same thing with all these people I've
[02:37:41.980 --> 02:37:48.060]  probably got 15 reporters I want to hire I don't have the money to do it but I'll
[02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:53.940]  tell you this the reason when Millie pitched me this lower tier RV but it's
[02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:58.660]  new what's the point of having one breaking a lot it's one of the lower
[02:37:58.660 --> 02:38:02.940]  end ones but it's you know kind of the planes anyone that has a good record I'm
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:06.380]  like yeah I'm paying for hotels and I'm paying for airplanes everywhere it's
[02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:10.220]  cheaper just to get you the RV but I said the great part about it is it's
[02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:15.100]  yours and you just go into the future and hopefully you pay me back but I'm in
[02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:19.740]  the process here with the enemy trying to shut us down of trying to get as many
[02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:25.140]  people as I can ready trained in the field and I want to really expand that
[02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:29.420]  operation but that takes capital and let me take the Marine Corps or the US Army
[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:33.660]  or any military that has a history you don't have the officers and the people
[02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:37.820]  trying to stay in charge forever and and looking down on the troops they're
[02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:41.540]  you're looking for who's the best in the organization to promote them up and
[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:45.740]  teach them everything you know so they'll be better than you and then when
[02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:50.820]  it comes time to die I don't mean physically but time to be destroyed in
[02:38:50.820 --> 02:38:53.740]  case you get shot when you're out there you know leading armies on the
[02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:58.180]  battlefield you need to have other officer corps ready to step in and take
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:02.580]  action and we've had a 25 year run ladies and gentlemen but let me tell you
[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:06.860]  when they're running front page Twitter for two days that I'm that I'm sitting
[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:09.860]  out child porn when it's not true and then I write books about stuff I didn't
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:14.820]  write and it's totally made up that means they're letting me know buddy this is
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:18.860]  the last straw well guess what I get it and I'm not backing down so do whatever
[02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:22.420]  you got to do you have to deal with Jesus Christ and if it's God's plan I'm
[02:39:22.420 --> 02:39:27.220]  destroyed that's the way it is I have no fear I have fear and I'm about to cover
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:32.580]  what I have fear of I have fear of letting monsters like Hillary Clinton and
[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:38.380]  Jeffrey Epstein others continue to do what they do and so you know if vampires
[02:39:38.380 --> 02:39:42.580]  were real and I opened a door and there was a vampire been over one of my kids
[02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:46.900]  about to bite him I would attack that vampire with everything I got doesn't
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:50.780]  mean I want to fight some six foot seven vampire with superhuman strength but I'm
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:54.540]  gonna do it and you know there's a chance I might actually get a good stab
[02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:58.620]  into him okay maybe he'll limp off at somebody else gets him the point is is
[02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:03.540]  that you want to fight man you got one you understand that so but I think the
[02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:08.380]  listeners you understand we've entered more door info wars myself particularly
[02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:13.660]  is now right down to the wire with the enemy and we've grievously wounded them
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:18.100]  we've grievously hurt them and they intend to take us out of the fight but
[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:22.500]  how are the breaks happen however the dice roll however Providence works we
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:26.620]  know God's on our side that's what matters and it's God's plan Satan is not
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:31.940]  in control Satan is only in control of his minions his pathetic servants so
[02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:36.820]  thank God you're not part of that when we come back the huge stack that I didn't
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:43.860]  even have the will to cover yesterday okay because I reread all this this
[02:40:43.860 --> 02:40:47.820]  morning I spent about 30 minutes looking over this and it's it's when you
[02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:53.620]  understand that convicted child traffickers child sex traffickers run
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:41:01.460]  amber alert you're not in Kansas anymore and when you realize Hillary it's on
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:08.260]  NBC News was caught running a pedophile ring and that's why they brought up a
[02:41:08.260 --> 02:41:11.860]  whole pizza gate thing and twisted all that to have one part of it not true so
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:16.820]  they could discredit the whole thing it's just unbelievable so what I want to
[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:24.300]  do is I want to really just take on the enemy whatever we got and I just want to

[02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:55.220]  attorney general of Missouri top of his class American Patriot I get a good
[02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:59.460]  feeling about him not just his words talk about the value of family and of a
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:03.740]  little fishing pond behind your house and of and of and of just being hard
[02:49:03.740 --> 02:49:07.140]  working and not want to be part of Hollywood or the globalist system but
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:12.100]  just wanting to be on the PTA or you know wanting to help fix old people's
[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:17.140]  cars or just being a good human that's so fulfilling loving Jesus and he's been
[02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:24.940]  fighting Google since he was the attorney general and I've watched him over
[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:27.380]  and over again when he brings out the chai comms and the globalist and says
[02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:32.300]  it's time for action all the bills he introduced are amazing so I've been
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:36.340]  signaling him out as as the type of leadership we need just watching the
[02:49:36.340 --> 02:49:40.980]  work he's done the last year or so Josh Hawley takes on big tech which means
[02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:43.540]  they're going to come after him you understand that's like taking on the
[02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:48.380]  CIA and everybody else the same time Josh Hawley takes on big tech sensors
[02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:53.460]  with a new bill that would strip them of immunity I'm going to cover this more

[02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:34.860]  allegations this morning facing the State Department that's right according to
[02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:38.540]  internal State Department memos the agency might have called off or
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:42.740]  intervened in investigation into possibly illegal and inappropriate
[02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:47.660]  behavior within its ranks allegedly to protect jobs and avoid scandals this
[02:51:47.660 --> 02:51:51.460]  concerns a time that Hillary Clinton was secretary of state we want to get
[02:51:51.460 --> 02:51:54.060]  right to NBC's chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd with the
[02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:57.180]  latest Chuck good morning to you good morning Savannah you know there's an
[02:51:57.180 --> 02:52:00.900]  old saying in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime but in
[02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:05.060]  this case both parts of it are disturbing allegations of prostitution
[02:52:05.060 --> 02:52:10.340]  and pedophilia and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not
[02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:13.500]  looked into so the State Department this morning is having to respond to those
[02:52:13.500 --> 02:52:18.220]  claims and those investigations above misconduct by State Department officials
[02:52:18.220 --> 02:52:23.420]  including by an ambassador and security agents attached to then secretary of
[02:52:23.420 --> 02:52:26.820]  state Hillary Clinton and the allegations are that these investigations
[02:52:26.820 --> 02:52:32.660]  were whitewashed quashed all together and that those orders came from high up
[02:52:32.660 --> 02:52:38.020]  NBC News has obtained documents related to ongoing investigations into some
[02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:42.100]  disturbing allegations involving State Department personnel and at least one
[02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:46.780]  ambassador a State Department memo says the ambassador quote routinely ditched
[02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:51.180]  his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both
[02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:55.260]  prostitutes and minor children the memo also says a top State Department
[02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:58.780]  official directed Department investigators to quote cease the
[02:52:58.780 --> 02:53:03.300]  investigation into the ambassador's conduct it's just one of what another
[02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:07.860]  document describes as quote several examples of undue influence from top
[02:53:07.860 --> 02:53:13.220]  state officials okay so let's go ahead and get into the breaking news that just
[02:53:13.220 --> 02:53:20.700]  came in Andrew Gillum said Hillary you must be exhausted on Twitter because

[02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:55.220]  and Hillary Clinton and just goes on for this is a 12-page article and then
[02:55:55.220 --> 02:55:57.940]  this is all over even mainstream news but it's getting no attention and
[02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:04.220]  remember Stone got implicated in this cult only because they they had a bunch
[02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:07.820]  of sub companies and they said we want you to come speak to our group well Stone's
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:10.900]  a public speaker he came and spoke it was really weird he thought it was a cult
[02:56:10.900 --> 02:56:14.660]  got out of it they were doing that trying to compromising but he smelled it
[02:56:14.660 --> 02:56:19.980]  and got out so Claire W. Rothman an heiress to the Seagram company Business
[02:56:19.980 --> 02:56:25.060]  Empire allegedly implanted a keylogger virus on a computer of her late father
[02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:31.020]  Edgar in Rothman senior so they always go after rich men's daughters and then
[02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:35.900]  get them to do that to their husbands or fathers got to watch out folks so
[02:56:35.900 --> 02:56:41.020]  officials with the ex-NXIVM corporation could secretly monitor his emails
[02:56:41.020 --> 02:56:44.620]  including his exchanges with world leaders and Democratic presidential
[02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:47.780]  candidate Hillary Clinton according to reports this is just all a bunch of scum
[02:56:47.780 --> 02:56:51.980]  spying on each other and again he's they're all involved with Epstein and
[02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:59.660]  and the Lolita Express and just all of it it's unbelievable and the people like

[03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:47.180]  version of which was set in a fictional 2020 the game takes place in a
[03:08:47.180 --> 03:08:52.980]  dystopian future where multiculturalism has failed and America is quote divided
[03:08:52.980 --> 03:08:57.300]  by class race and economics the main themes of the game pertain to
[03:08:57.300 --> 03:09:02.100]  futuristic transport weaponry and transhumanism but it's the cultural and
[03:09:02.100 --> 03:09:06.580]  sociological tropes featured in the game that makes some of its predictions
[03:09:06.580 --> 03:09:12.340]  eerily prescient again to emphasize this RPG was originally created 30 years

[03:09:25.260 --> 03:09:29.620]  scholars that in the decades before the collapse America suffered from the
[03:09:29.620 --> 03:09:34.420]  sickness of racism and cultural identity everyone wanted to be seen as
[03:09:34.420 --> 03:09:39.260]  special every group had to be equal to a preferably better than its neighbors and
[03:09:39.260 --> 03:09:44.060]  fought to protect its special rights if anyone had something that someone else
[03:09:44.060 --> 03:09:49.700]  wanted they were painted as racist sexist elitist or worse this divisive
[03:09:49.700 --> 03:09:54.340]  me first attitude eventually tore the fabric of American culture apart and
[03:09:54.340 --> 03:09:59.300]  caused it to self-destruct in a fireball of competing ideologies none of which
[03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:05.420]  truly recognized each other's validity diversity led inexorably to anarchy
[03:10:05.420 --> 03:10:11.020]  wow I guess the designers of cyberpunk 2020 must have been racists yeah actually
[03:10:11.020 --> 03:10:14.700]  it was created by this base black dude but anyone who has followed modernity's
[03:10:14.700 --> 03:10:19.700]  obsession with identity politics and the sanctification of victimhood as a form
[03:10:19.700 --> 03:10:25.500]  of special status exploited to impose political and cultural hegemony that's
[03:10:25.500 --> 03:10:30.620]  a creepily prophetic observation given that it was made nearly three decades
[03:10:30.620 --> 03:10:35.020]  ago but that wasn't the only prediction that cyberpunk 2020 got banged on the
[03:10:35.020 --> 03:10:40.980]  money the games 1988 rulebook predicted quote a great Britain swamped by mass
[03:10:40.980 --> 03:10:47.220]  immigration leading to streets almost explosively as dangerous as the United
[03:10:47.220 --> 03:10:52.260]  States mmm that kind of rings a bell a wave of stabbings have given London a
[03:10:52.260 --> 03:10:56.860]  higher murder rate than New York City every 14 minutes there's a knife crime
[03:10:56.860 --> 03:11:00.300]  across England and Wales
[03:11:02.060 --> 03:11:07.060]  knife crime is at a near record high with more than 40 blade offenses every day
[03:11:07.060 --> 03:11:10.460]  in London your child is involved in a gang and there's nowhere for him to
[03:11:10.460 --> 03:11:14.260]  hide you take him back to Africa you know it's safer there than it is in
[03:11:14.260 --> 03:11:17.940]  London when your parents in your child back it's a risk you're taking but
[03:11:17.940 --> 03:11:21.740]  unfortunately some parents feel like it's also a risk leaving their kids in
[03:11:21.740 --> 03:11:24.780]  the streets of London diversity is a strength the game also predicted the
[03:11:24.780 --> 03:11:29.860]  rise of the quote me first worldview which is now exemplified by exploding
[03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:34.780]  narcissism driven by social media addiction the RPG also foresaw a
[03:11:34.780 --> 03:11:40.020]  future in which quote entertainment has become generic and a conglomeration of
[03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:45.300]  TV networks emerged to deliver hundreds of channels that produce a product which
[03:11:45.300 --> 03:11:50.700]  is quote bland mindless and caters to the lowest possible denominator that kind
[03:11:50.700 --> 03:11:55.580]  of rings the bell to in a successful attempt to distract the population from
[03:11:55.580 --> 03:12:00.020]  the dystopia that surrounds them in the game the so-called media nets ensure
[03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:05.220]  that every apartment has access to this idiocracy style mass entertainment the
[03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:09.100]  game also predicted the decline of traditional media platforms with old
[03:12:09.100 --> 03:12:13.420]  fashion newspapers and print magazines fading into oblivion the original
[03:12:13.420 --> 03:12:19.260]  cyberpunk game was inspired by a 1986 sci-fi novel called hardwired in
[03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:23.620]  hardwired and by extension cyberpunk ruthless corporations have created
[03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:28.380]  vast monopolies have amassed more power than countries and everyone is
[03:12:28.380 --> 03:12:34.180]  completely dependent on them according to cyberpunks 1988 rulebook in 2020
[03:12:34.180 --> 03:12:38.460]  quow dissenting opinions and independent productions are usually buried
[03:12:38.460 --> 03:12:44.260]  under an avalanche of media hype or worse co-opted or destroyed by the vicious
[03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:49.940]  competitive practices of the major media corpse that definitely reminds me of
[03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:55.180]  some things can't quite put my finger on it imagine this for a second one man
[03:12:55.180 --> 03:13:00.500]  with total control of billions of people stolen data all their secrets their
[03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:06.700]  lives their futures I owe it all to specter specter showed me that whoever
[03:13:06.700 --> 03:13:11.780]  controls the data controls the future but at least it's not that bad yet right
[03:13:11.780 --> 03:13:16.700]  we can still express dissenting opinions without being silenced by mega corpse
[03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:21.620]  at least when someone tried to post about cyberpunk 2020 on reddit under the
[03:13:21.620 --> 03:13:26.740]  title in the original cyberpunk 2020 rulebook diversity was the downfall of
[03:13:26.740 --> 03:13:32.660]  America the post wasn't immediately removed right oh it was immediately
[03:13:32.660 --> 03:13:38.180]  removed a big cyberpunk 2020 theme is augmentation of the body with cyber
[03:13:38.180 --> 03:13:43.100]  technology which in turn causes an ensuing loss of humanity as the
[03:13:43.100 --> 03:13:47.740]  characters become more synthetic which was another adept example of prescient
[03:13:47.740 --> 03:13:52.260]  social commentary on our increasing addiction to smartphones and the wider
[03:13:52.260 --> 03:13:57.780]  body modification transhumanist movement the Stockholm subway system also has
[03:13:57.780 --> 03:14:02.100]  plans to modify their turnstiles so they can be opened with implanted chips
[03:14:02.100 --> 03:14:08.460]  over 3,500 Swedes now have microchips under their skin you got the gym
[03:14:08.460 --> 03:14:14.020]  according to the 1988 rulebook quote as each new technological enhancement
[03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:20.980]  slammed into place a sort of cultural techno shock set in in a 2006 update to
[03:14:20.980 --> 03:14:25.620]  the game called cyberpunk 23x corruption of the internet has made
[03:14:25.620 --> 03:14:31.700]  quote all data intangible and recent recorded history is in doubt again this
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:36.020]  speaks to the contemporary lurch towards internet censorship and digital
[03:14:36.020 --> 03:14:41.700]  book burning in addition to fears over fake news this update also accurately
[03:14:41.700 --> 03:14:46.020]  predicted the rise of deep fake technology misleading people about the
[03:14:46.020 --> 03:14:51.540]  nature of reality and the power of memes to influence culture and society
[03:14:51.540 --> 03:14:58.580]  cyberpunk 2077 a new video game starring Keanu Reeves based on the original RPG
[03:14:58.580 --> 03:15:03.700]  is set to be released next year in the game the metropolis of night city is
[03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:08.740]  divided up into six different regions one is the domain of elitists another of
[03:15:08.740 --> 03:15:13.380]  criminal gangs and another of immigrants in other words diversity and
[03:15:13.380 --> 03:15:19.460]  integration appears to have failed segregation is a way of life and nearly a
[03:15:19.460 --> 03:15:23.940]  year before the game is even released we're already seeing a progressive
[03:15:23.940 --> 03:15:30.420]  backlash to cyberpunk 2077 in this tweet a leftist expresses his outrage at a
[03:15:30.420 --> 03:15:35.300]  certain level of disgust expressed by characters in the game to the site of a
[03:15:35.300 --> 03:15:39.860]  heavily technologically augmented naked woman in a bathtub although the
[03:15:39.860 --> 03:15:44.900]  objective in the game is to rescue the woman she is seen as profane unclean and
[03:15:44.900 --> 03:15:48.660]  not fully human because she is quote augmented
[03:15:48.660 --> 03:15:54.420]  she's more even though
[03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:57.780]  i started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's
[03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:01.140]  house i sued the irs in one i beat the irs then

[03:18:01.460 --> 03:18:04.580]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[03:18:04.580 --> 03:18:08.260]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[03:18:08.260 --> 03:18:12.820]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[03:18:12.820 --> 03:18:16.660]  researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[03:18:16.660 --> 03:18:20.500]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[03:18:20.500 --> 03:18:24.420]  they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[03:18:24.420 --> 03:18:27.700]  we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting

[03:18:39.620 --> 03:18:42.740]  activity of tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies
[03:18:42.740 --> 03:18:45.860]  immune and inflammatory responses in the body

[03:20:25.860 --> 03:20:29.300]  billy weaver was at the big trump mega rally
[03:20:29.300 --> 03:20:33.220]  last night info wars.com reporters she'll be joining us the last segment
[03:20:33.220 --> 03:20:36.660]  but i wanted to start every day when i have time singling out
[03:20:36.660 --> 03:20:40.580]  amazing youtubers and and other people online that are really
[03:20:40.580 --> 03:20:45.380]  breaking down some amazing stuff this video was produced a couple years ago
[03:20:45.380 --> 03:20:49.140]  it's only got 800 000 views it deserves 10 million views
[03:20:49.140 --> 03:21:00.100]  and it was put out by black pigeon speaks it's the end game why the west is lost
[03:21:00.100 --> 03:21:04.420]  and it's from a liberal historic perspective and it's actually pretty
[03:21:04.420 --> 03:21:08.500]  accurate now the black pigeon speaks was banned off youtube for a week or so it
[03:21:08.500 --> 03:21:12.660]  was a big backlash they they they put them back up but
[03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:16.420]  they're laying out the history of countries the west why the west was
[03:21:16.420 --> 03:21:19.780]  special and why it's under so much attack it'll take this segment part of
[03:21:19.780 --> 03:21:24.180]  the next segment to get to this report but it's really important so here it is
[03:21:24.180 --> 03:21:30.100]  odious cretins like antifa the fulsome street fair in san francisco
[03:21:30.100 --> 03:21:34.980]  children having sex reassignment surgery dogs having sex reassignment surgery for
[03:21:34.980 --> 03:21:38.180]  that matter bug chasing and gift giving
[03:21:38.180 --> 03:21:42.500]  mili siris massive uncontrolled immigration of cultural groups that are
[03:21:42.500 --> 03:21:47.300]  totally incompatible we tell ourselves we're being vibrantly enriched
[03:21:47.300 --> 03:21:50.820]  when rotherham orlando and cologne happened
[03:21:50.820 --> 03:21:54.420]  what kind of civilization have we inherited
[03:21:54.420 --> 03:21:59.780]  well what we are doing is in fact living the end game of western civilization
[03:21:59.780 --> 03:22:05.380]  this is the end result of the west's unique experiment an experiment that
[03:22:05.380 --> 03:22:09.620]  many think has gone wrong but in fact is going totally
[03:22:09.620 --> 03:22:13.860]  as should be expected in the next several minutes i will explain why the
[03:22:13.860 --> 03:22:17.700]  transgender antifa children on hormone blockers
[03:22:17.700 --> 03:22:21.460]  and those intentionally trying to contract hiv
[03:22:21.460 --> 03:22:25.220]  the bug chasers are in fact the true inheritors
[03:22:25.220 --> 03:22:30.020]  of western civilization the genesis of this video was around a few pints at the
[03:22:30.020 --> 03:22:32.340]  local pub with a friend that goes by the moniker
[03:22:32.340 --> 03:22:36.100]  the renegade of funk please find a link to his blog and twitter in the
[03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:40.340]  description well what we were doing was doing as we usually do talking about a
[03:22:40.340 --> 03:22:44.740]  plethora of abstract topics when he brought up a book called the troublesome
[03:22:44.740 --> 03:22:50.580]  inheritance written by nicolas wade so what follows is basically a rehash of
[03:22:50.580 --> 03:22:54.260]  that conversation so the key or foundational
[03:22:54.260 --> 03:22:57.620]  understanding that underpins any civilization
[03:22:57.620 --> 03:23:01.140]  is that the state is superior to one's own tribe
[03:23:01.140 --> 03:23:04.820]  this applies to the samarians the egyptians the greeks the phoenicians
[03:23:04.820 --> 03:23:09.540]  the carthaginians the romans as well as it does to modern americans
[03:23:09.540 --> 03:23:13.060]  so going back in time after the collapse of roam
[03:23:13.060 --> 03:23:15.940]  europe was a fractured patchwork of small kingdoms
[03:23:15.940 --> 03:23:21.380]  while the chinese of the same period had built a government based on meritocracy
[03:23:21.380 --> 03:23:25.540]  at least in its administration while for example the islamic world
[03:23:25.540 --> 03:23:29.860]  wed religion with the state in a theocracy of the caliphate
[03:23:29.860 --> 03:23:33.300]  all societies and all civilizations of the time
[03:23:33.300 --> 03:23:37.300]  were de facto dictatorships in one fashion or another
[03:23:37.300 --> 03:23:42.180]  but it was in the west that developed a unique way in which to order
[03:23:42.180 --> 03:23:48.020]  its society the rule of law that's not to say that the japanese indians
[03:23:48.020 --> 03:23:52.340]  chinese or arabes didn't have law but the key difference
[03:23:52.340 --> 03:23:56.580]  is that the laws were never seen as superior or could countermand
[03:23:56.580 --> 03:24:01.700]  the ruling class in that whoever ruled made the laws and everyone else obeyed
[03:24:01.700 --> 03:24:07.060]  for a modern example of this look no further than kim jong-un of north korea
[03:24:07.060 --> 03:24:10.260]  but what the west created in terms of the rule of law
[03:24:10.260 --> 03:24:14.580]  was revolutionary and superior to even roman law
[03:24:14.580 --> 03:24:19.460]  the magna karta was the starting point of the uniquely western adaptation known
[03:24:19.460 --> 03:24:22.260]  as liberalism the concept of which is very
[03:24:22.260 --> 03:24:26.660]  difficult and hard to pin down but is best understood by looking at the sum
[03:24:26.660 --> 03:24:30.420]  of its parts it is anti tribal or anti in group
[03:24:30.420 --> 03:24:33.860]  as authority is abstracted away from local family groups
[03:24:33.860 --> 03:24:37.620]  the rule of law takes precedence over even in theory
[03:24:37.620 --> 03:24:43.060]  the ruling class the rule of law also applies to all groups thus in time it
[03:24:43.060 --> 03:24:47.700]  eventually becomes secular and secular law leads to individual
[03:24:47.700 --> 03:24:52.740]  rights as well as and i might add undermining religious authority
[03:24:52.740 --> 03:24:57.460]  as liberalism evolved representative government more often than not became
[03:24:57.460 --> 03:25:01.300]  the standard and in time as we have seen that government
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:05.700]  becomes progressive when liberalism reaches its apex
[03:25:05.700 --> 03:25:09.380]  it then begins to deconstruct its own traditions and society
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:12.980]  intentionally generating new norms and standards
[03:25:12.980 --> 03:25:16.340]  this is where we are today in wade's book he presented
[03:25:16.340 --> 03:25:19.860]  clear and convincing evidence that human evolution
[03:25:19.860 --> 03:25:24.900]  has been in his words copious regional and recent
[03:25:24.900 --> 03:25:29.780]  we can observe huge shifts in intelligence psychology and behavior
[03:25:29.780 --> 03:25:34.820]  in as little as the past 20 generations consider the reality of medieval life it
[03:25:34.820 --> 03:25:38.500]  was nasty brutish and short for entertainment people
[03:25:38.500 --> 03:25:41.940]  would gather in the town square to watch grizzly torture
[03:25:41.940 --> 03:25:45.300]  executions or fill large containers with cats
[03:25:45.300 --> 03:25:49.380]  and burn them alive while they enjoyed listening to the screams of the dying
[03:25:49.380 --> 03:25:52.660]  animals people ate with their hands farted at the
[03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:55.860]  dinner table and wiped their snot with their clothing
[03:25:55.860 --> 03:26:00.340]  interpersonal violence was also commonplace liberalism changed that
[03:26:00.340 --> 03:26:04.740]  in a real sense it created a more polite and better mannered society
[03:26:04.740 --> 03:26:08.180]  murder rates declined as people became less tribal informed
[03:26:08.180 --> 03:26:12.660]  nation-states etiquette improved and the concept of chivalry was born
[03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:16.180]  and it should be noted that despite the pedantic prostrations
[03:26:16.180 --> 03:26:19.700]  of the evil that is christianity it did help very much
[03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:24.820]  in this regard as people became less tribal they began to outsource violence
[03:26:24.820 --> 03:26:29.380]  to the state seeing it as a legitimate arbiter of conflicts
[03:26:29.380 --> 03:26:32.820]  the triumph of parliament over king in england
[03:26:32.820 --> 03:26:37.300]  thus led to the bill of rights in 1689 which was followed by quite
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:41.540]  predictably in hindsight the american and french revolutions
[03:26:41.540 --> 03:26:46.500]  liberalism led to more individual rights and it led to capitalism
[03:26:46.500 --> 03:26:50.420]  europe not only began the great exploration of our planet
[03:26:50.420 --> 03:26:55.700]  but also into the nature of reality with the birth of modern science
[03:26:55.700 --> 03:27:00.100]  all of this propelled the western world to become wealthier and more importantly
[03:27:00.100 --> 03:27:03.540]  the dominant civilization for the first time
[03:27:03.540 --> 03:27:08.020]  globally there was nowhere that the west did not stand high
[03:27:08.020 --> 03:27:11.700]  and through the same force liberalism ideas
[03:27:11.700 --> 03:27:16.980]  about the condition of man came into question the west abolished slavery
[03:27:16.980 --> 03:27:20.020]  in its colonies but it also forced the rest of the world to give up the
[03:27:20.020 --> 03:27:22.740]  practice while slavery still exists of course in
[03:27:22.740 --> 03:27:25.940]  many parts of the world to this day mostly in the middle east and africa
[03:27:25.940 --> 03:27:29.780]  the west and only the west came to see the inherent
[03:27:29.780 --> 03:27:35.140]  inhumanity of chattel slavery as it came to believe in the idea
[03:27:35.140 --> 03:27:39.380]  of the dignity of all men and the key turning point which
[03:27:39.380 --> 03:27:44.980]  if you look at the progression of liberalism was the idea of egalitarianism
[03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:48.660]  at first this would be extended racially to a point
[03:27:48.660 --> 03:27:52.420]  as well as between the genders again to a point
[03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:56.500]  after liberalism destroyed slavery the next target in the progressive era was
[03:27:56.500 --> 03:28:01.140]  women's rights which led to the 19th amendment to the u.s constitution
[03:28:01.140 --> 03:28:04.900]  not so coincidentally however we're going to break come back with a powerful

[03:28:25.700 --> 03:28:30.100]  that came out of a true expression of christianity
[03:28:30.100 --> 03:28:34.180]  from the christian ethos of love those as yourself or as your brother or lay down
[03:28:34.180 --> 03:28:37.620]  your life for others but this is from a liberal that then gets into the true
[03:28:37.620 --> 03:28:40.980]  cancer of the left that is destroying the

[03:34:02.980 --> 03:34:06.260]  lost by black pigeon speaks from a
[03:34:06.260 --> 03:34:10.580]  historical liberal perspective that minus not giving christianity credit is
[03:34:10.580 --> 03:34:14.900]  very accurate here it is once women were in franchise the concept of the
[03:34:14.900 --> 03:34:19.300]  welfare state was born and the welfare state is the culmination
[03:34:19.300 --> 03:34:24.900]  of marrying individualism with egalitarianism this is a profound
[03:34:24.900 --> 03:34:32.020]  and very anti-ingroup secular idea that is again uniquely western universal
[03:34:32.020 --> 03:34:36.100]  man-made salvation the expansion of the franchise
[03:34:36.100 --> 03:34:39.780]  relates to this idea as does the enshrinement
[03:34:39.780 --> 03:34:45.060]  of democracy as the ultimate political ideal liberalism has also led to
[03:34:45.060 --> 03:34:48.340]  another very important and in most other society's
[03:34:48.340 --> 03:34:54.100]  alien concept that of the immigrant an immigrant is distinct from a foreigner a
[03:34:54.100 --> 03:34:58.340]  foreigner goes to another country and lives there as an outsider an
[03:34:58.340 --> 03:35:02.580]  immigrant is seen as having equal standing with the natives even though
[03:35:02.580 --> 03:35:06.820]  having no ties history and at times very different world views
[03:35:06.820 --> 03:35:12.100]  than the dominant in group and this is important because despite what vacuous
[03:35:12.100 --> 03:35:15.860]  little girls playing house and pretending that the west's
[03:35:15.860 --> 03:35:20.500]  concept of immigration is universal and that they can just walk into a non
[03:35:20.500 --> 03:35:25.460]  western country and be part of that in group well the reality is much
[03:35:25.460 --> 03:35:28.980]  different societies throughout the world do not
[03:35:28.980 --> 03:35:34.020]  have the concept of the immigrant rather they cling to the concept of a
[03:35:34.020 --> 03:35:39.060]  foreigner for non-western societies that have retained their ethnic tribalism
[03:35:39.060 --> 03:35:43.780]  which is most the immigrant is still a shaky concept
[03:35:43.780 --> 03:35:47.780]  ethnic Koreans that have lived in japan for generations are still considered
[03:35:47.780 --> 03:35:51.460]  outsiders zainichi is the term that is applied to them
[03:35:51.460 --> 03:35:56.100]  the concept of in group and out group is to this day the way most societies
[03:35:56.100 --> 03:35:59.620]  operate from muslims to australian aborigines and all points
[03:35:59.620 --> 03:36:03.700]  in between immigration was never a concept until
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:07.380]  that is other societies learned the idea from the west
[03:36:07.380 --> 03:36:10.820]  capitalism as well feeds on immigration
[03:36:10.820 --> 03:36:14.100]  it did do in the 19th century just as it does today
[03:36:14.100 --> 03:36:18.500]  influxes of irish and italians into the u.s were just as disruptive as
[03:36:18.500 --> 03:36:23.460]  mexicans are today but both groups assimilated and while america did change
[03:36:23.460 --> 03:36:27.780]  its core of liberalism persisted the next step in the evolution of
[03:36:27.780 --> 03:36:31.780]  liberalism came after the horror of the first and second world wars
[03:36:31.780 --> 03:36:35.140]  which in turn led to civilizational exhaustion
[03:36:35.140 --> 03:36:40.820]  and civilizational self-doubt in the west it was the upending of established
[03:36:40.820 --> 03:36:45.460]  thinking with regards to empire that allowed the process of decolonization
[03:36:45.460 --> 03:36:49.620]  to go relatively peacefully after the end of the second world war
[03:36:49.620 --> 03:36:53.220]  no longer was it europe's burden to civilize the world
[03:36:53.220 --> 03:36:57.060]  the new paradigm was one of rigid egalitarianism
[03:36:57.060 --> 03:37:00.340]  for all it's still the current held belief that
[03:37:00.340 --> 03:37:04.820]  all cultures are valid and all cultures are equal despite
[03:37:04.820 --> 03:37:08.100]  observable differences in outcome prosperity
[03:37:08.100 --> 03:37:12.660]  and human dignity all thought regarding cultures as being equal was
[03:37:12.660 --> 03:37:17.060]  elevated to a sacrosanct fact that only a perceived
[03:37:17.060 --> 03:37:23.380]  idiot could dispute and again another completely anti-in-group preference
[03:37:23.380 --> 03:37:28.020]  that is uniquely western and as liberalism continued to evolve
[03:37:28.020 --> 03:37:31.780]  the civil rights movement sought to convince all that there are
[03:37:31.780 --> 03:37:34.820]  absolutely no differences between the races
[03:37:34.820 --> 03:37:37.860]  as the sexual revolution sought to convince men
[03:37:37.860 --> 03:37:40.820]  that there are no differences between the genders
[03:37:40.820 --> 03:37:45.460]  that's not to say that races are not equal or that one is superior to the
[03:37:45.460 --> 03:37:49.460]  other to the contrary inuit amazonian tribesmen
[03:37:49.460 --> 03:37:52.980]  european or thai fishermen each have their strengths
[03:37:52.980 --> 03:37:56.180]  and weaknesses but there are obvious differences
[03:37:56.180 --> 03:37:59.700]  in easily quantifiable things such as bone density
[03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:04.020]  muscle mass and for better or worse cognitive abilities
[03:38:04.020 --> 03:38:08.660]  the same for gender prior to the last few decades men and women
[03:38:08.660 --> 03:38:11.700]  instead of being at odds with each other as they are now
[03:38:11.700 --> 03:38:16.020]  filled roles that complemented each other and whether we like it or not created
[03:38:16.020 --> 03:38:19.300]  and maintained families which is the building block of
[03:38:19.300 --> 03:38:25.380]  societies and civilizations much better than our post-modern sensibilities do
[03:38:25.380 --> 03:38:29.380]  the suppression of in-group preference has led logically
[03:38:29.380 --> 03:38:32.820]  to mass uncontrolled immigration of people from completely
[03:38:32.820 --> 03:38:36.900]  incompatible cultures most of whom are not even able to take care of
[03:38:36.900 --> 03:38:41.540]  themselves once they arrive and as they pour into the west
[03:38:41.540 --> 03:38:46.020]  social stability and community cohesion is destroyed
[03:38:46.020 --> 03:38:49.700]  the suppression of observable differences between the genders
[03:38:49.700 --> 03:38:53.780]  has also given us the ridiculous hollywood movies of superhuman women
[03:38:53.780 --> 03:38:56.980]  being able to beat down a dozen men twice their size
[03:38:56.980 --> 03:39:00.900]  but also real problems of declining fertility
[03:39:00.900 --> 03:39:04.580]  and malignant family laws that discriminate toward
[03:39:04.580 --> 03:39:08.260]  men that are at the core of the grievance that many have
[03:39:08.260 --> 03:39:12.340]  in the migthau movement as society has become more secular
[03:39:12.340 --> 03:39:15.940]  enriched with vibrant diversity and much less cohesive
[03:39:15.940 --> 03:39:19.060]  standards of personal behavior and even personal appearance
[03:39:19.060 --> 03:39:23.220]  are ebbing lower daily search the term people of walmart
[03:39:23.220 --> 03:39:27.220]  which is a very good visual example of where society
[03:39:27.220 --> 03:39:31.620]  is at this point in time this may seem like regression but it's still
[03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:36.740]  in line with the same liberal ideal immigration was ramped up in the 1960s
[03:39:36.740 --> 03:39:40.580]  while simultaneously the concept of assimilation was destroyed
[03:39:40.580 --> 03:39:43.700]  after that came gay rights which took less than the generation
[03:39:43.700 --> 03:39:47.620]  to go from the defense of marriage act to full legalization in virtually
[03:39:47.620 --> 03:39:51.780]  all western countries norms are all but gone now
[03:39:51.780 --> 03:39:54.820]  and in most cases norms are to be socially ridiculed
[03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:59.140]  kids don't need a mom or dad heterosexuality is just one option
[03:39:59.140 --> 03:40:02.180]  among many sexual relations with animals
[03:40:02.180 --> 03:40:06.420]  is a choice the current normalization of the transgender
[03:40:06.420 --> 03:40:10.020]  is almost complete and thus there will need to be
[03:40:10.020 --> 03:40:14.020]  new frontiers in the long march of liberalism
[03:40:14.020 --> 03:40:19.380]  and on and on it will proceed at the moment female genital mutilation
[03:40:19.380 --> 03:40:23.460]  which has arrived incidentally with the flow of culturally incompatible
[03:40:23.460 --> 03:40:26.740]  immigration is something that we're seeing in the news these days
[03:40:26.740 --> 03:40:30.100]  and we're told by the mindless cnn talking heads and their
[03:40:30.100 --> 03:40:34.500]  ilk that we whatever that means that we in the west
[03:40:34.500 --> 03:40:40.100]  universally revile it as it is fundamentally against our values
[03:40:40.100 --> 03:40:44.500]  way to decade and the demographic changes that that decade will bring and
[03:40:44.500 --> 03:40:48.660]  see what that argument is the same talking heads will be calling
[03:40:48.660 --> 03:40:52.180]  anyone who disagrees with it in several years as a bigot
[03:40:52.180 --> 03:40:57.540]  or a female genital mutilation phobe think pedophilia normalization is
[03:40:57.540 --> 03:41:02.420]  unthinkable two words aisha and islamophobia
[03:41:02.420 --> 03:41:07.460]  normalizing anything it back in three seconds this was made two years ago
[03:41:07.460 --> 03:41:10.660]  i have stacks of news i don't even want to cover
[03:41:10.660 --> 03:41:15.380]  where the democratic party the the the labor party in england
[03:41:15.380 --> 03:41:18.660]  with parents taking their kids out naked letting men hump them
[03:41:18.660 --> 03:41:22.820]  with erections and they're saying oh it's kink kids like sex that's in the news
[03:41:22.820 --> 03:41:25.540]  today but if you oppose it they say you're in a
[03:41:25.540 --> 03:41:29.780]  child porn with no proof these people are sick
[03:41:29.780 --> 03:41:33.140]  and so what it is is the west openness is being used against it
[03:41:33.140 --> 03:41:37.540]  to bring it down and conquer it by a broken coalition strategy
[03:41:37.540 --> 03:41:42.660]  of groups of piratical criminals continue anyone who disagrees with it
[03:41:42.660 --> 03:41:46.180]  in several years as a bigot or a female genital
[03:41:46.180 --> 03:41:51.220]  mutilation phobe think pedophilia normalization is unthinkable
[03:41:51.220 --> 03:41:55.620]  two words aisha and islamophobia normalizing
[03:41:55.620 --> 03:41:59.780]  anything at this point is a possibility none of this presentation is to say
[03:41:59.780 --> 03:42:03.060]  that people don't deserve to have their rights but some
[03:42:03.060 --> 03:42:06.820]  rights have in part always been surrendered for the good of the community
[03:42:06.820 --> 03:42:10.020]  and to keep it cohesive the problem is there is no
[03:42:10.020 --> 03:42:14.500]  collective community anymore only atomized we're gonna go to break
[03:42:14.500 --> 03:42:17.220]  i'm going to post the full video to info wars.com

[03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:42.100]  she cried when i left her now i cry
[03:47:42.100 --> 03:47:46.100]  she forgets her old house through the showers
[03:47:46.100 --> 03:47:52.100]  they ever want to be
[03:47:52.100 --> 03:47:56.100]  next scene is how you're supposed to pronounce it but it's nxivm
[03:47:56.100 --> 03:48:00.260]  he had a love over the first to expose it like three years ago i said there's
[03:48:00.260 --> 03:48:03.620]  a cult in hollywood new york where they ran women and they starved them to
[03:48:03.620 --> 03:48:07.220]  death and harvey weinstein has sex with them and the huffington post came out
[03:48:07.220 --> 03:48:12.260]  and said i had defamed him no i was told by people in
[03:48:12.260 --> 03:48:15.780]  hollywood that harvey weinstein was part of a cult where they chain women up and
[03:48:15.780 --> 03:48:19.220]  branded them and brainwashed them when the clintons were involved and that
[03:48:19.220 --> 03:48:23.620]  movies like fifty shades of gray based on the book were priming on women to be
[03:48:23.620 --> 03:48:26.420]  part of it so i can tell you about it first but i can't
[03:48:26.420 --> 03:48:29.060]  pronounce it right and i wasn't told it was even
[03:48:29.060 --> 03:48:32.980]  nexium when i was told about it by multiple sources
[03:48:32.980 --> 03:48:35.780]  and then roger stone confirmed it and turned out in court documents he to the
[03:48:35.780 --> 03:48:39.860]  head guy just got convicted today that roger was recruited by a subgroup
[03:48:39.860 --> 03:48:42.900]  they didn't tell him it was even this group and he got out of it and like you
[03:48:42.900 --> 03:48:46.100]  know a week he was there as a consultant there as a speaker it turned out he was
[03:48:46.100 --> 03:48:50.340]  a target of them because he was close to trump
[03:48:50.340 --> 03:48:54.020]  they wanted to break into his phone and be able to get him like get roger stone
[03:48:54.020 --> 03:48:56.020]  on i know he can't come on about the gag order
[03:48:56.020 --> 03:48:58.660]  with the whole russia fake thing but he can come on about this we should get
[03:48:58.660 --> 03:49:01.940]  roger on tomorrow because he told me all this on air he said it all
[03:49:01.940 --> 03:49:07.940]  he has vindicated well millie weaver is awesome and she recruited
[03:49:07.940 --> 03:49:10.420]  katlyn benham who's not going out of the park as well she went to the big trump

[03:49:28.020 --> 03:49:31.540]  see him and she tweeted i forgot to tell folks about us
[03:49:31.540 --> 03:49:34.420]  saying she didn't want to watch the info wars last night
[03:49:34.420 --> 03:49:38.740]  meaning uh trumps events so they are they are really angry at us rebooting
[03:49:38.740 --> 03:49:41.940]  america with your help millie you've been doing reporting for us what
[03:49:41.940 --> 03:49:45.540]  seven years so we commend you thank you alex
[03:49:45.540 --> 03:49:49.620]  you know the trump rally was massive i tried to
[03:49:49.620 --> 03:49:54.100]  follow the trump line to get into the event because i thought oh we can you
[03:49:54.100 --> 03:49:56.660]  know do a time lapse and speed it up and show
[03:49:56.660 --> 03:50:00.020]  people how long the line was but after walking i think at
[03:50:00.020 --> 03:50:03.540]  least a mile and a half we got tired we're like all right
[03:50:03.540 --> 03:50:07.860]  the line is never ending we're not going to find an end to this line i mean
[03:50:07.860 --> 03:50:12.340]  the line was so long alex it was insane
[03:50:12.340 --> 03:50:16.900]  and it i almost think they're underestimating 130 000 people
[03:50:16.900 --> 03:50:20.820]  there were so many people there the whole city was full of trump supporters
[03:50:20.820 --> 03:50:26.020]  now they also had a permitted area where these anti-trump protests could go on
[03:50:26.020 --> 03:50:30.340]  and the police were surrounding that area it was like a whole city
[03:50:30.340 --> 03:50:36.020]  like a whole city street that they blockaded and they literally had a you
[03:50:36.020 --> 03:50:40.980]  know leftist democrat transgender person that
[03:50:40.980 --> 03:50:44.900]  was part of the event organization standing there with the police
[03:50:44.900 --> 03:50:49.700]  like a bridge troll telling people who could and could not pass
[03:50:49.700 --> 03:50:53.780]  so i tried to go up and talk to some of the protesters but
[03:50:53.780 --> 03:50:56.820]  the police advised me they said you're not allowed in here
[03:50:56.820 --> 03:51:00.740]  i'm like what do you mean i'm not allowed in here yeah the event organizers
[03:51:00.740 --> 03:51:03.940]  said that they don't want you here they don't want you or they don't want
[03:51:03.940 --> 03:51:09.220]  infowars here at all katelyn Bennett like somehow got past their radar and was
[03:51:09.220 --> 03:51:12.100]  in there for about 10 minutes and she got spit on
[03:51:12.100 --> 03:51:16.100]  and assaulted and then you know at that point the police then
[03:51:16.100 --> 03:51:18.820]  had her leave the area by the way what's that story i love that was a little
[03:51:18.820 --> 03:51:22.020]  kid my kid three billy goats gruff
[03:51:22.020 --> 03:51:26.660]  yeah the bridge trolls you will not pass i mean it was crazy you notice the
[03:51:26.660 --> 03:51:30.180]  first little one comes across it says the much fatter and juicy words coming
[03:51:30.180 --> 03:51:35.620]  the second one goes oh a really big juicy ones coming
[03:51:35.620 --> 03:51:39.860]  sorry go ahead yeah so it was just wild but
[03:51:39.860 --> 03:51:43.860]  the real action the real great story what that's out there
[03:51:43.860 --> 03:51:46.980]  is that all these people came out to support the president and you would not
[03:51:46.980 --> 03:51:51.940]  believe i mean florida has a lot of people who have a cuban descent
[03:51:51.940 --> 03:51:55.780]  you would not believe how many cuban americans are out there and they love
[03:51:55.780 --> 03:51:59.060]  president trump they really do and the other thing
[03:51:59.060 --> 03:52:02.660]  i kid you not i was asking michael our camera guy after this i'm like
[03:52:02.660 --> 03:52:06.100]  how many people do you think out of everyone we talked to or just
[03:52:06.100 --> 03:52:09.300]  came into contact with all the trump supporters out there
[03:52:09.300 --> 03:52:12.740]  out of all the trump supporters out there how many do you think were info wars
[03:52:12.740 --> 03:52:16.580]  fans he's like at least 70 percent i mean
[03:52:16.580 --> 03:52:20.340]  that is how much love we got out there alex people
[03:52:20.340 --> 03:52:24.820]  love info wars the scary thing is is that many of these people are like
[03:52:24.820 --> 03:52:29.220]  where do we find info wars alex is gone now they don't know to go to info wars
[03:52:29.220 --> 03:52:32.500]  store.com that's why those of you guys who are listening
[03:52:32.500 --> 03:52:36.100]  no millie millie that was so critical they always because we were number one
[03:52:36.100 --> 03:52:38.980]  on itunes number one news tab everywhere i mean i didn't want to
[03:52:38.980 --> 03:52:40.740]  because when they were banning us everywhere i was sitting there going to

[03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:51.860]  he'd only been on like a year that being the show show
[03:52:51.860 --> 03:52:56.100]  it was huge and when they hit that was like whoa being punched in the stomach
[03:52:56.100 --> 03:52:59.460]  but exactly and then all these people are like we wish alex was on air

[03:54:26.420 --> 03:54:29.140]  people who don't know we know you the listener
[03:54:29.140 --> 03:54:32.100]  you know where to find it but there's many listeners
[03:54:32.100 --> 03:54:35.860]  for info wars and alex jones that don't know that we still are out here
[03:54:35.860 --> 03:54:39.380]  and where to find us so i just ask you the listeners
[03:54:39.380 --> 03:54:43.540]  please share the link to info wars show.com
[03:54:43.540 --> 03:54:47.140]  absolutely because you're getting what i'm getting now you go to a trump rally
[03:54:47.140 --> 03:54:50.100]  and i would always say half the people are listeners you're saying even more
[03:54:50.100 --> 03:54:53.540]  and you see all the info shirts and very few of the new ones
[03:54:53.540 --> 03:54:56.660]  and it's because they just were used to seeing us in their feeds and everywhere
[03:54:56.660 --> 03:54:59.940]  we've got to say hey the system thinks you're dumb and won't come find the
[03:54:59.940 --> 03:55:02.580]  source that's why drudge came here three years ago he said alex
[03:55:02.580 --> 03:55:05.860]  at dinner and on air he said listen they're gonna kick everybody off the
[03:55:05.860 --> 03:55:08.740]  big platforms you've got to like drudgereport.com
[03:55:08.740 --> 03:55:12.180]  you've got to tell everybody get to info wars now get to news wars now
[03:55:12.180 --> 03:55:15.620]  he and i said but we are doing our own thing he goes listen at dinner
[03:55:15.620 --> 03:55:19.620]  he even kind of pointed a fork at me he said i'm not trying to lecture you man
[03:55:19.620 --> 03:55:22.980]  but i'm telling you you got to start telling people now and only having
[03:55:22.980 --> 03:55:24.980]  content on your own thing you point them at
[03:55:24.980 --> 03:55:28.980]  because they're not going to remember when it happens drudge is so damn smart
[03:55:28.980 --> 03:55:32.900]  and i wish i would have listened other people because he made public statements
[03:55:32.900 --> 03:55:35.540]  too did not listen to him they're totally wiped out
[03:55:35.540 --> 03:55:39.540]  they're not even having a fighting chance we halfway listened to them
[03:55:39.540 --> 03:55:42.740]  and we'd already instinctively built our own thing because of censorship but
[03:55:42.740 --> 03:55:46.100]  absolutely listeners you're the people that are smart enough i don't mean that
[03:55:46.100 --> 03:55:51.540]  meanly we're all habituated i get lazy like hawaii 5o used to be on
[03:55:51.540 --> 03:55:54.980]  some local tv station i have rabbit ears for and i'd watch that with my kids
[03:55:54.980 --> 03:55:58.500]  because it's a pretty wholesome show well now that tv station changed and it's
[03:55:58.500 --> 03:56:01.620]  like spanish tv i can't i don't know how to find why 5o so i
[03:56:01.620 --> 03:56:04.100]  stopped watching i don't know about the old show and the new show
[03:56:04.100 --> 03:56:08.180]  so it's the same thing people got to be reminded hey it you know they don't want
[03:56:08.180 --> 03:56:12.180]  you to get it they're trying to stop you it's an info wars calm
[03:56:12.180 --> 03:56:16.820]  tell everybody pass it on it's an info wars calm pass it on
[03:56:16.820 --> 03:56:20.500]  but let me tell you millie what do you make
[03:56:20.500 --> 03:56:23.700]  i'm not going to get back into this but it's too crazy the ap said that i lost
[03:56:23.700 --> 03:56:27.540]  a lawsuit over a book i was not even in or wrote or ever read
[03:56:27.540 --> 03:56:30.500]  and that and that and that i'm going to be arrested and all this stuff and it's
[03:56:30.500 --> 03:56:33.860]  been the top story everywhere and the whole fake child porn thing what do you
[03:56:33.860 --> 03:56:37.380]  make of that it's absolutely disgusting it's an
[03:56:37.380 --> 03:56:42.900]  outright hit piece against you alex by the liberal democrat controlled
[03:56:42.900 --> 03:56:46.660]  mainstream media outlets they are trying to tear info wars down and
[03:56:46.660 --> 03:56:50.580]  destroy you because they think that info wars they
[03:56:50.580 --> 03:56:54.100]  know that info wars played a massive role in the election outcome they know
[03:56:54.100 --> 03:56:57.140]  it uh every other person out there the trump
