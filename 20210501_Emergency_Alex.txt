[00:00.000 --> 00:09.120]  Now ask yourself, COVID-19, we've discussed before Alex, is an offensive biological warfare
[00:09.120 --> 00:14.200]  weapon that has been DNA genetically engineered.
[00:14.200 --> 00:22.360]  It has been given gain of function properties to make it more lethal, more infectious.
[00:22.360 --> 00:27.440]  It has HIV right in there, and it also involves synthetic biology.
[00:27.440 --> 00:31.080]  They are giving you literal cells of this.
[00:31.080 --> 00:35.440]  They say, well, it's an innocuous little cell, but they're putting it right into your body.
[00:57.440 --> 01:14.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:14.400 --> 01:18.240]  It's Saturday, May 1st, 2021.
[01:18.240 --> 01:20.240]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:20.240 --> 01:25.700]  I'm about to lay out some of the most incredible information in the history of humans on this
[01:25.700 --> 01:34.900]  earth that parallels the amazing mind of Rod Serling in his 1968 sci-fi film, Planet of
[01:34.900 --> 01:35.900]  the H.
[02:04.900 --> 02:34.140]  Oh my God, I'm back, I'm home, all the time, he finally really did it, you maniacs, you
[02:34.140 --> 03:02.140]  blew it up, oh damn you, God, you all to hell.
[03:02.140 --> 03:11.580]  On this May 1st, high holy day of the Satanists, I come to you to challenge their plan of global
[03:11.580 --> 03:13.020]  domination.
[03:13.020 --> 03:18.020]  And just as their French revolution failed, and just as their great Soviet revolution
[03:18.020 --> 03:24.380]  collapsed, their Maoist operation and their great reset of the Rockefeller's Rothschild's
[03:24.380 --> 03:27.900]  will fail as well.
[03:27.900 --> 03:36.660]  Thank you so much for joining us for this emergency transmission today.
[03:36.660 --> 03:42.480]  I want to thank the crew for coming in to produce this very special transmission.
[03:42.480 --> 03:48.780]  Much of this crew has been working seven days a week since long before the fraudulent election
[03:48.780 --> 03:49.780]  of November 3rd.
[03:49.780 --> 03:54.980]  And now everything that was speculation about the new world order is now out in the open.
[03:54.980 --> 03:59.300]  And of course, it's exactly as I said it was because I was going off the enemy's own
[03:59.300 --> 04:05.860]  blueprints and their own plans, which very frustratingly are public.
[04:05.860 --> 04:09.900]  But you'll have it put out in white papers, put out at the UN level, put out at the Davos
[04:09.900 --> 04:18.580]  level, put out at the Bilderberg level, put out at the Politburo CCP level.
[04:18.580 --> 04:21.360]  But then they'll have the national news come out in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.760]  and say, there is no great reset.
[04:23.760 --> 04:26.580]  There is no plan to restrict meat consumption.
[04:26.580 --> 04:28.520]  There is no plan to break up the family.
[04:28.520 --> 04:30.280]  There is no plan to take your guns.
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.040]  There is no plan to get rid of the borders.
[04:32.040 --> 04:33.040]  There is no plan.
[04:33.040 --> 04:35.160]  Joe Biden's the most eloquent man.
[04:35.160 --> 04:41.440]  He just his, his, his voices, his, his oratory skills are the most devastatingly powerful
[04:41.440 --> 04:43.260]  we've ever seen.
[04:43.260 --> 04:48.840]  That's what they said on Wednesday night about his bizarre speech where he sounded like an
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.840]  Alzheimer's patient.
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.940]  And Tucker Carlson put a compilation together Thursday that we're going to play some of
[04:55.940 --> 04:58.420]  coming up next hour.
[04:58.420 --> 04:59.840]  That is just insane.
[04:59.840 --> 05:05.220]  I mean, they literally worship him because it's gaslighting.
[05:05.220 --> 05:09.000]  It's meant to make you not believe your own instincts and your own common sense.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.920]  So again, thank you so much for joining us right before we went on this afternoon, right
[05:15.920 --> 05:21.240]  as we were about to go live.
[05:21.240 --> 05:22.240]  Live tape to air.
[05:22.240 --> 05:24.560]  We do this like it's live, then air it later on Saturdays.
[05:24.560 --> 05:28.480]  All the other shows are live in real time, the late 10 seconds for radio stations and
[05:28.480 --> 05:29.480]  TV stations.
[05:29.480 --> 05:30.880]  But, but this is tape to air.
[05:30.880 --> 05:33.280]  I'm taping this at 1250.
[05:33.280 --> 05:36.880]  We started and it'll be airing sometime this afternoon as soon as we get it ready on all
[05:36.880 --> 05:39.240]  our satellite feeds going out to people.
[05:39.240 --> 05:44.680]  Right before we went live tape to air, I said, go get the end of the original Planet of the
[05:44.680 --> 05:46.600]  Apes written by Rod Serling.
[05:46.600 --> 05:50.000]  When the astronauts come back to earth, he doesn't know where he is.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.240]  He's gone through some type of wormhole.
[05:51.240 --> 05:55.680]  He's come back 5,000 years later and it isn't till the end of the movie he figures out he's
[05:55.680 --> 06:00.400]  on the Eastern seaboard of what was the United States destroyed a giant nuclear war.
[06:00.400 --> 06:03.400]  He says, you've really done it.
[06:03.400 --> 06:04.960]  You've really blown it all up.
[06:04.960 --> 06:10.540]  Well, it was concerned about nuclear war that got global government first established out
[06:10.540 --> 06:15.340]  of the club of Rome, Bilderberg group, council on foreign relations.
[06:15.340 --> 06:20.380]  And they got most intellectuals of the world, whether they were Chinese, Japanese, Mexican,
[06:20.380 --> 06:27.180]  German, Brazilian, British, French, South African, didn't matter to sign on to global
[06:27.180 --> 06:30.980]  government in the name of stopping a nuclear war.
[06:30.980 --> 06:37.260]  They tried to get the first league of nations back in 1918, 1919 after the first great war.
[06:37.260 --> 06:41.020]  They call it the war to end all wars, but that didn't go through.
[06:41.020 --> 06:47.700]  Then the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did get the Rockefeller funded and founded and
[06:47.700 --> 06:50.380]  donated UN land established.
[06:50.380 --> 06:54.180]  So this is a Rockefeller Rothschild project.
[06:54.180 --> 06:57.420]  Their names are on the buildings.
[06:57.420 --> 07:04.540]  They have established this system, but in the name of stopping nuclear war, the Carnegie
[07:04.540 --> 07:07.700]  endowment and the Rockefeller foundation put out public reports.
[07:07.700 --> 07:13.180]  They got brought out in 1977 in the church committee hearings in the Senate that they
[07:13.180 --> 07:19.360]  were going to get rid of the family, get rid of masculinity, show that war would be impossible.
[07:19.360 --> 07:21.440]  They would do it through chemicals in the food and the water.
[07:21.440 --> 07:25.020]  Now it's mainstream news that within 10 years, almost no one will be able to even have children
[07:25.020 --> 07:27.020]  anymore in Western countries.
[07:27.020 --> 07:29.660]  As soon as other countries industrialized, suddenly they can't have children.
[07:29.660 --> 07:33.380]  That's the chemicals in the food and the water.
[07:33.380 --> 07:40.620]  But now they've decided to just accelerate towards a very deadly gene therapy that killed
[07:40.620 --> 07:48.560]  on average, 80% of lab rats, pigs, chinchillas, goats, dogs, horses, and primates it was given
[07:48.560 --> 07:50.100]  to.
[07:50.100 --> 07:54.340]  In some species, it has a 100% kill rate in ferrets.
[07:54.340 --> 07:57.540]  Now it would take six months on average for all the ferrets to die.
[07:57.540 --> 08:02.620]  And a ferret only lives a fraction of a human, but if you add out that time ferret dies in
[08:02.660 --> 08:07.820]  six months, you die in 10 years on average.
[08:07.820 --> 08:10.580]  And that's a guesstimation, but that's why they use those certain lab rats.
[08:10.580 --> 08:15.960]  They found rats and pigs are the closest to humans with drugs, even closer than the chimpanzee.
[08:15.960 --> 08:21.200]  Not saying we're related to them, but drug reactions on average with rats, mice, and
[08:21.200 --> 08:26.420]  chimpanzees aren't even as close to that as rats, mice, and pigs.
[08:26.420 --> 08:27.420]  Now I'm digressing here.
[08:27.540 --> 08:33.860]  The point is they did MRNA testing on the same viruses and the same families for over
[08:33.860 --> 08:37.620]  a decade in China, in the United States, at Chapel Hill.
[08:37.620 --> 08:38.620]  That's all over the news now.
[08:38.620 --> 08:42.060]  We told you about a year ago, 14 months ago.
[08:42.060 --> 08:47.120]  And they gave it gain of function.
[08:47.120 --> 08:49.840]  And now they are deploying it against humanity.
[08:49.840 --> 08:56.140]  And they knew that the vaccines that they gave the animals, again, pigs, goats, you
[08:56.140 --> 09:06.380]  name it, chinchillas, guinea pigs, rats, mice, chimpanzees, what they gave them did
[09:06.380 --> 09:08.200]  not help them.
[09:08.200 --> 09:14.820]  It made them sick, infertile, diseased, autoimmune responses, allergic to everything, and caused
[09:14.820 --> 09:18.860]  most of them to have accelerated death.
[09:18.860 --> 09:23.620]  Whereas a year old ferret would usually live to be about 10 years old, well, they were
[09:23.620 --> 09:24.620]  dead in six months.
[09:24.620 --> 09:26.900]  So that gives you an idea.
[09:26.900 --> 09:32.260]  Now humans are a lot tougher than a chinchilla or a guinea pig.
[09:32.260 --> 09:34.700]  But that said, it's why they do the animal testing.
[09:34.700 --> 09:39.820]  And so they are introducing with the Pfizer and the Moderna shots, this gene editing system
[09:39.820 --> 09:46.620]  that is going to kill a large part of the population very, very quickly.
[09:46.620 --> 09:51.060]  Some will die in a year, some will die in six years, some will die in 20 years.
[09:51.380 --> 09:54.760]  But there's really no way to detox from this like there is other toxins.
[09:54.760 --> 10:02.820]  This directly attacks your body, hasn't released all sorts of poisonous proteins.
[10:02.820 --> 10:08.740]  And that's why they've got in future insurance actuaries that the population by 2030 in the
[10:08.740 --> 10:11.220]  US will be 160 million.
[10:11.220 --> 10:14.600]  So that's what they're budgeting for, that's what they're preparing for, having our population
[10:14.600 --> 10:16.260]  cut more than half.
[10:16.260 --> 10:17.860]  That's in the Diegal report and other reports.
[10:17.860 --> 10:20.180]  But I'm just digressing.
[10:20.180 --> 10:24.100]  Here's what I should say up front.
[10:24.100 --> 10:26.940]  Those of you that are aware of all this are the blessed and lucky ones.
[10:26.940 --> 10:31.100]  Can you imagine people here in the US, which is one of the main targets, and around the
[10:31.100 --> 10:34.700]  world being hit by this that have no idea?
[10:34.700 --> 10:38.580]  We told you it was in the Davos Group documents from two years ago and in the lockstep and
[10:38.580 --> 10:42.940]  other documents that they would first say one shot, then they'd say five shots and they'd
[10:42.940 --> 10:43.940]  say 10 shots.
[10:43.940 --> 10:46.220]  Then they're just going to say they don't work, but you still got to happen to leave
[10:46.220 --> 10:47.600]  your house.
[10:47.600 --> 10:50.720]  And if one shot is already, or two shots is already maiming and killing so many people,
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.960]  and I have the CDC's own numbers here coming up, can you imagine the long-term devastation
[10:55.960 --> 11:02.080]  of this, where it is going to weigh down society and make it collapse, which is the post-industrial
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.620]  world Great Reset Plan?
[11:05.620 --> 11:11.600]  So we're up here on this very special Saturday transmission to get Dr. Francis Boyle on,
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.880]  who is the author of the US biological weapons law that then became the UN treaties, also
[11:17.880 --> 11:20.720]  been the top war crimes prosecutor for the UN.
[11:20.720 --> 11:26.240]  He has the special PhD that only one person gets a year.
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.080]  Henry Kissinger got one after World War II, he went on to teach.
[11:31.080 --> 11:36.640]  Klaus Schwab was one of his graduates, and so at Harvard he's only trained about 40 of
[11:36.640 --> 11:37.640]  these people.
[11:37.640 --> 11:40.320]  He only goes in and trains one person a year.
[11:40.320 --> 11:44.400]  He doesn't do it every year, and so we have one of those people here who was trained by
[11:44.400 --> 11:45.400]  him.
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.140]  I'm not actually going to show you Klaus Schwab this year saying he was trained by Henry
[11:49.140 --> 11:50.720]  Kissinger at Harvard.
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.360]  So Boyle is an insider, and that's why he was here 14 months ago and laid out everything
[11:55.360 --> 11:56.360]  was going to happen.
[11:56.360 --> 12:01.240]  And he said it'll be a depopulation weapon, the rest of it, because he was actually trained
[12:01.240 --> 12:08.480]  by them, but he was secretly against them and later exposed them.
[12:08.480 --> 12:11.520]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[12:11.520 --> 12:16.000]  I mean, I know he's not Brad Pitt or something, I know our audience isn't into that, but the
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.880]  general public thinks Brad Pitt is important, but somebody like Francis Boyle is important.
[12:20.880 --> 12:23.220]  Brad Pitt reads off a teleprompter or off a script.
[12:23.220 --> 12:28.820]  This man is one of the only people ever to be on the inside of the globalist operation
[12:28.820 --> 12:33.420]  that's nestled at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, the main two groups.
[12:33.420 --> 12:34.420]  Everybody else are underlings.
[12:34.420 --> 12:37.320]  I mean, that's why Gigi Ping's daughter goes to Harvard.
[12:37.360 --> 12:39.220]  That's why Schwab went there.
[12:39.220 --> 12:43.180]  You don't go there to learn how to be a smart person, you go there to try to grovel and
[12:43.180 --> 12:49.360]  be part and get a position on betraying humanity and engaging a nasty population.
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.240]  So we're going to have him on about Biden announcing, which I already told you the military
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.720]  told me, high level sources, that they intend to make right after July 4th, COVID vaccinations
[12:59.720 --> 13:03.800]  that are experimental and illegal, mandatory for the military.
[13:03.800 --> 13:08.020]  And that is now a tough call, Biden considering mandatory COVID vaccines for U.S. troops.
[13:08.020 --> 13:09.020]  That's coming up.
[13:09.020 --> 13:14.420]  Also, traveling this summer, federal mask mandate extended to September for plans for
[13:14.420 --> 13:17.060]  trains and buses and planes.
[13:17.060 --> 13:18.060]  And it gets worse.
[13:18.060 --> 13:33.060]  We now have not just CNN, but USA Today coming out and saying that you must take your inoculations
[13:33.060 --> 13:35.780]  and it's now time to bully people.
[13:35.780 --> 13:38.680]  It's now time to control people.
[13:38.680 --> 13:40.620]  So they're coming with the forced inoculations.
[13:40.620 --> 13:42.020]  That's always been the plan.
[13:42.020 --> 13:43.340]  And this is war.
[13:43.340 --> 13:45.080]  This is a military attack.
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.980]  This is just like shooting black people up with syphilis at Tuskegee.
[13:49.980 --> 13:54.220]  And this is their depopulation operation.
[13:54.220 --> 13:57.820]  So that's all coming up.
[13:57.820 --> 14:04.920]  Now I want to get to some great reset clips for you right now, because if you go to Google
[14:04.920 --> 14:08.620]  and type in the great reset, all you get is hundreds of pages of globalist propaganda
[14:08.620 --> 14:09.620]  saying it doesn't exist.
[14:09.620 --> 14:12.100]  It's a white supremacist term.
[14:12.100 --> 14:15.140]  The ADL saying they'll have you arrested if you talk about it, literally, well, that's
[14:15.140 --> 14:16.920]  not dangerous.
[14:16.920 --> 14:19.580]  But then when you actually go to Twitter, which still operates as a search engine or
[14:19.580 --> 14:22.340]  DuckDuckGo for that matter, you type in great reset.
[14:22.340 --> 14:23.820]  There was so much of it loading this morning.
[14:23.820 --> 14:28.100]  I spent three hours just reading and watching videos, a bunch of which I hadn't seen.
[14:28.100 --> 14:32.260]  I mean, it's got Trudeau calling for communism and dictatorship, and it's got them all been
[14:32.260 --> 14:35.560]  in great reset, uses COVID to take over.
[14:35.560 --> 14:40.420]  But I found like 30 clips, we'll play some now and some after Boyle leaves us, of just
[14:40.420 --> 14:47.660]  incredible admissions from world leaders, from Klaus Schwab, from Hillary Clinton, from
[14:47.660 --> 14:55.900]  Tony Blair, from Boris Johnson, from Barack Obama, from Joe Biden, and from Greta Thunberg,
[14:55.900 --> 15:03.420]  from Bill Clinton, from them all, telling you what they're going to do to you.
[15:03.420 --> 15:05.560]  You'll have nothing, you'll own nothing.
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.420]  They're going to get rid of your bank accounts and take them and then quote, give them to
[15:09.420 --> 15:13.000]  poor people, but only a part of it to get the general public to accept taking money
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  from the middle class.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.500]  But then the ultra rich are exempt.
[15:15.500 --> 15:20.480]  I mean this, and they talk about stationing troops in your neighborhood and making you
[15:20.480 --> 15:24.700]  station migrants in your home that watch you and are spies of the system.
[15:24.700 --> 15:25.840]  That's already done in Europe.
[15:25.840 --> 15:27.520]  You cannot make this up.
[15:27.520 --> 15:35.580]  This is just maximum martial law, tyranny rollout brought to you by Prince Charles,
[15:35.580 --> 15:43.820]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, who brag that they tell Biden, Boris Johnson, Macron, Merkel
[15:43.820 --> 15:44.820]  what to do.
[15:44.940 --> 15:50.780]  They've all said on TV, we take our orders from the trifecta, Prince Charles, Bill Gates
[15:50.780 --> 15:51.780]  and Klaus Schwab.
[15:51.780 --> 15:58.500]  So I'm going to play you some of those clips, but this is the global assault.
[15:58.500 --> 16:01.020]  The communists and the fascists learn you can't win in an open assault.
[16:01.020 --> 16:04.420]  You've got to do it with, oh, you're dirty, you're bad, humans are bad, oh, you're dirty,
[16:04.420 --> 16:07.260]  wear a mask, oh, you got to have all these shots, you'll be free once you do, oh, sorry,
[16:07.260 --> 16:08.940]  now you're not free.
[16:08.940 --> 16:09.940]  This is their takeover.
[16:09.940 --> 16:10.940]  This is the rest of our lives.
[16:10.940 --> 16:11.940]  This is everything.
[16:11.940 --> 16:14.020]  The struggle against this is now survival.
[16:14.020 --> 16:15.020]  This is everything.
[16:15.020 --> 16:21.340]  You got full grown men going and watching Marvel comic shows and getting into the Avengers,
[16:21.340 --> 16:26.700]  this and that, and I have like people I know in government and FBI agents and Green Berets
[16:26.700 --> 16:29.780]  or want to talk to me about, man, you want to go watch a Marvel comic movie?
[16:29.780 --> 16:38.260]  And I'm like, listen, the real end games now, a real end game got made in 2007, not in 2018.
[16:38.260 --> 16:39.260]  This is real.
[16:39.500 --> 16:40.780]  Okay, you're under attack.
[16:40.780 --> 16:46.160]  We're all being hit and I just need to get men to start not being into Hollywood and
[16:46.160 --> 16:50.260]  start getting in to the real world, okay?
[16:50.260 --> 16:52.020]  Because the prosperity is going to be gone.
[16:52.020 --> 16:55.740]  They want to get rid of it and make you love it and then use that for total control and
[16:55.740 --> 17:00.820]  then use the starving masses as weapons against those of us that are still middle-class while
[17:00.820 --> 17:02.320]  the global is set off shore.
[17:02.320 --> 17:09.140]  This is a high-tech version of the Bolshevik resolution revolution.
[17:09.140 --> 17:13.980]  So let's go ahead and play a clip, clip three.
[17:13.980 --> 17:17.380]  This is COVID-19 impact on climate change.
[17:17.380 --> 17:22.620]  So this is Greta Thunberg, the anointed person that her email's been hacked, her Twitter's
[17:22.620 --> 17:23.620]  been hacked.
[17:23.620 --> 17:27.660]  She gets orders from the UN of what to say, an action plan, and she says, this rolled
[17:27.660 --> 17:34.700]  us back to 2016 levels, so the earth doesn't end in 2030 now, that's a 10 to 2030.
[17:34.700 --> 17:37.320]  We've got a few extra years we do what they say, but it's not enough.
[17:37.320 --> 17:41.440]  We need more climate lockdowns.
[17:41.440 --> 17:45.360]  And so the whole COVID thing was really, really about saving the earth by starving humans
[17:45.360 --> 17:47.720]  by the tens of millions to death.
[17:47.720 --> 17:50.320]  So here is that clip.
[17:50.320 --> 18:00.600]  The pandemic has led to a global shutdown.
[18:00.600 --> 18:04.120]  Air travel has dramatically reduced.
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.240]  Factories have closed.
[18:07.240 --> 18:13.120]  And roads and motorways are empty.
[18:13.120 --> 18:20.320]  In one of the most profound changes to human society and living memory.
[18:20.320 --> 18:23.000]  The impact on the planet itself is being calculated.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.520]  Have you ever seen changes this drastic before?
[18:27.520 --> 18:30.840]  Such a change was completely unprecedented.
[18:30.840 --> 18:33.280]  We had to check that the data was correct.
[18:33.280 --> 18:39.720]  So from January since the beginning of the lockdowns up to April, on the global scale,
[18:39.720 --> 18:46.240]  there is a decrease of about 17% in the CO2 emissions over this period.
[18:46.240 --> 18:50.460]  It's 17% lower than in the previous year.
[18:50.460 --> 18:56.280]  When was the last time we were down at those kinds of emissions levels?
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.600]  With what we have now, we are back in 2006 levels.
[19:01.600 --> 19:10.120]  So that really shows the scope of the challenge that we are facing when we shut down our societies
[19:10.120 --> 19:11.120]  completely.
[19:11.120 --> 19:17.120]  We only go back like 14 years to 2006.
[19:17.120 --> 19:23.040]  So yeah, it's really shocking.
[19:23.040 --> 19:26.480]  And they officially say it's a good thing on their website.
[19:26.480 --> 19:27.480]  Let's move along.
[19:27.480 --> 19:31.640]  And they've now proposed yearly and bi-yearly lockdowns for the earth.
[19:31.640 --> 19:34.880]  So official martial law, but it's okay, it's for the earth.
[19:34.880 --> 19:38.160]  And the elites, of course, still fly around their private jets and live on a huge palatial
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.880]  estate to do whatever they want.
[19:39.880 --> 19:42.000]  The masks are all for show.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.880]  Now here is clip five, build back better.
[19:44.880 --> 19:49.120]  We've got compilations of leaders saying it or puppet globalist.
[19:49.120 --> 19:51.120]  We also have individuals saying it.
[19:51.120 --> 19:53.200]  Here is clip five.
[19:53.200 --> 19:57.240]  It's a very pertinent question to ask how do we build back better?
[19:57.240 --> 19:59.040]  To build back better or whatever.
[19:59.040 --> 20:03.840]  We have a chance to reset the clock and build back better than before.
[20:03.840 --> 20:05.840]  To build back better than before.
[20:05.840 --> 20:12.640]  Remember the terrible damage of COVID as we try to build back from this global pandemic.
[20:12.640 --> 20:15.640]  Joe Biden calls it build back better.
[20:15.640 --> 20:17.920]  Build back better.
[20:17.920 --> 20:18.920]  Building back better.
[20:18.920 --> 20:21.120]  To do things differently.
[20:21.120 --> 20:23.760]  To build back better.
[20:23.760 --> 20:26.680]  We're going to build it back better.
[20:26.680 --> 20:28.960]  And build it back better.
[20:28.960 --> 20:32.840]  My plan to build back better.
[20:32.840 --> 20:37.160]  Start taking all the problems that have been created in education and mental health and
[20:37.160 --> 20:40.880]  start to build back in a positive way.
[20:40.880 --> 20:45.640]  I have launched a booklet called build back better.
[20:45.640 --> 20:48.840]  Britain after coronavirus.
[20:48.840 --> 20:52.840]  It's about building this country back better.
[20:52.840 --> 20:55.080]  Growing conspiracy following it.
[20:55.080 --> 20:57.920]  It is called the great reset.
[20:57.920 --> 21:03.840]  Unprecedented opportunity to rethink and reset the ways in which we live.
[21:03.840 --> 21:06.900]  The great opportunity for reset.
[21:06.900 --> 21:14.560]  The theory even calls Mr Biden's campaign slogan build back better a front for the conspiracy.
[21:14.560 --> 21:16.320]  Build back better.
[21:16.320 --> 21:19.240]  Building back better our economy.
[21:19.240 --> 21:22.840]  Build back better.
[21:22.840 --> 21:28.120]  All elements of the great reset are fundamental to building the future we need.
[21:28.120 --> 21:34.240]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.360]  It's a big effort to some would say to build back better.
[21:39.360 --> 21:43.480]  We would say to really have a great reset.
[21:43.480 --> 21:44.480]  Conspiracy.
[21:44.480 --> 21:45.480]  Conspiracy.
[21:45.480 --> 21:46.480]  Conspiracy.
[21:46.480 --> 21:52.080]  So remember it doesn't exist the New York Times the ADL says literally arrest anyone
[21:52.080 --> 21:54.120]  talking about it who's not for it.
[21:54.120 --> 21:56.000]  If you're for it you're a wonderful person.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.600]  Now let's play Modi.
[21:57.600 --> 22:03.040]  He recently came out and said we need to build back better the great reset for a new world
[22:03.040 --> 22:04.240]  order.
[22:04.240 --> 22:10.200]  Here is the leader of the second most populous nation in the world India.
[22:10.200 --> 22:17.440]  The biggest question before the entire world is how to restart.
[22:17.440 --> 22:22.560]  The restart will not be possible without a reset.
[22:22.560 --> 22:25.320]  A reset of mindset.
[22:25.320 --> 22:31.200]  A reset of processes on a new world order.
[22:31.200 --> 22:39.400]  New protocols that develop and world change itself.
[22:39.400 --> 22:42.520]  Okay but you just saw on screen the ADL so the property law center says that does not
[22:42.520 --> 22:43.520]  exist.
[22:43.520 --> 22:47.040]  Okay and there's not directly story time with convicted pedophiles either and the borders
[22:47.040 --> 22:50.400]  aren't wide open they're not coming for our guns and there's not people dying all over
[22:50.400 --> 22:51.400]  from the vaccines.
[22:51.400 --> 22:53.960]  By the way I have stacks of mainstream news that the majority of people in the hospital
[22:53.960 --> 22:57.720]  they now have to say you have COVID that are actually sick and dying were given the vaccine
[22:57.720 --> 22:59.480]  two weeks to a month before.
[22:59.480 --> 23:03.480]  Oh you come in contact with a regular cold virus you're gonna have an autoimmune response.
[23:03.480 --> 23:10.040]  There's a lot of different syndromes but yeah very very evil very very sick ladies and gentlemen.
[23:10.040 --> 23:15.920]  It's called a technocracy and all these world leaders are in line or they'll be removed
[23:15.920 --> 23:19.600]  via fraud just like Trump and Trump partially went along with it as well do you know what
[23:19.600 --> 23:20.600]  he was doing?
[23:20.600 --> 23:26.360]  I don't know but it doesn't matter now we've got the real puppet chief Biden ensconced
[23:26.360 --> 23:30.680]  installed now let's look at a microcosm of this and then we're gonna get our guest on
[23:30.680 --> 23:36.360]  and come back to the full research on this that I prepared to go over well with you today
[23:36.360 --> 23:41.440]  and how to stop it by the way and the ways to actually defeat this but let's go ahead
[23:41.440 --> 23:46.600]  and look at Trudeau who has said he wants a dictatorship like China for Canada I played
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.240]  that clip a hundred times I'm not gonna play it anybody wants to type in.
[23:49.240 --> 23:54.480]  Trudeau says he wants a dictatorship like China and Canada but here's Trudeau announcing
[23:54.480 --> 23:58.720]  federal government deploying Canadian Armed Forces and they've got up to a hundred police
[23:58.720 --> 24:03.140]  going to small churches putting fences up around them and not letting them go but Walmart
[24:03.140 --> 24:08.400]  and Target are all open and then you've got locals describing what it's like to go bankrupt
[24:08.400 --> 24:12.680]  and are becoming homeless and the reports of Chinese troops and again the Chinese troops
[24:12.680 --> 24:17.520]  don't show up and take your guns right away they're just suddenly there and of course
[24:17.520 --> 24:21.600]  the Chinese troops are there it's come out in the news the rebel media broke it show
[24:21.600 --> 24:27.000]  the secret documents they got via for your request now the CIA they wanted him to know
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.400]  I guess and the Pentagon is doing investigations into Ezra Levant as a terrorist and of course
[24:33.400 --> 24:38.180]  Biden announced anyone opposing them is a terrorist and the main threat is white people
[24:38.180 --> 24:42.640]  in America he said so this is the Marxist globalist takeover with the ultra-rich as
[24:42.640 --> 24:50.180]  usual funding and all here is the Prime Minister of Canada Mr. Trudeau to beat back the third
[24:50.180 --> 24:55.980]  wave and protect Ontarians we're deploying federal health care workers to the province
[24:55.980 --> 25:02.260]  this mobilization includes three medical assistance teams and nine critical care nurses from the
[25:02.260 --> 25:07.680]  Canadian Armed Forces yesterday the forces carried out their assessment of the needs
[25:07.680 --> 25:13.440]  on the ground in Ontario to finalize the details of this operation we're working
[25:13.440 --> 25:19.000]  with our provincial partners on next steps and Armed Forces members will be mobilized
[25:19.000 --> 25:26.120]  in the coming days let's be clear sending men and women in uniform to help in Ontario
[25:26.120 --> 25:35.200]  is a serious step we're doing this because the situation requires it today the first
[25:35.200 --> 25:41.240]  deployment of nurses and doctors from Newfoundland and Labrador will also be arriving in Ontario
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.840]  for the GTA they'll land this afternoon at Pearson aboard a Canadian Armed Forces
[25:46.840 --> 25:53.360]  airplane Newfoundland and Labrador is already organizing a second team of health care workers
[25:53.360 --> 25:59.280]  who will rotate in to help our government is covering the costs of deploying these teams
[25:59.280 --> 26:04.720]  and we're ready to do the same for any other province or territory that can also step in
[26:04.720 --> 26:05.720]  with support
[26:05.720 --> 26:12.480]  now my friends we're gonna go to break here in just a moment and come back with Dr. Francis
[26:12.480 --> 26:20.360]  Boyle and look at the dangerous frankenshot rollout of the vaccines of the the maiming
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.660]  of the the death they're not even attempting to cover it up now and Dr. Boyle 14 months
[26:25.660 --> 26:33.720]  ago on this broadcast predicted all of this he also laid out the fact that this was part
[26:33.720 --> 26:38.920]  of a larger Henry Kissinger globalist plan and now Klaus Schwab has come out we'll play
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.600]  the clip when we come back and said that he got trained at Harvard how to do this and
[26:44.600 --> 26:50.560]  that the greatest influence on him was Henry Kissinger and Dr. Francis Boyle also trained
[26:50.560 --> 26:55.280]  under Henry Kissinger in that special PhD that they only issue one of a year so he is
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.480]  a major whistleblower when it comes to that to understand this by the way Joe Rogan four
[27:00.480 --> 27:08.320]  days ago had a major Washington Post reporter on admitting that it came out of the lab
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.040]  that leaked out of the lab that Fauci's covering it up because he was involved in it and moved
[27:12.040 --> 27:16.040]  it from Chapel Hill North Carolina that was called breaking news and I'm glad they quote
[27:16.040 --> 27:21.280]  broke it but it was Dr. Francis Boyle broke that here in well on other shows in February
[27:21.280 --> 27:29.360]  of last year in our show in early March over a year ago so that is the reality ladies and
[27:29.360 --> 27:35.560]  gentlemen but there is the latest report Fauci behind Wuhan COVID-19 leak Washington
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.200]  Post reporter tells Joe Rogan very important article very important report in the Gregory
[27:40.200 --> 27:45.860]  section of Band on video and that's how that information gets out is when you share it
[27:45.860 --> 27:52.380]  so Josh Rogan the Washington Post on with Joe Rogan no relationship so we're going to
[27:52.380 --> 27:59.080]  go to clip 10 please and then we're going to come right back with Dr. Francis Boyle
[27:59.080 --> 28:07.260]  Henry Kissinger was Klaus Schwab's mentor and got that special PhD at Harvard and I
[28:07.260 --> 28:11.600]  don't know if Dr. Francis Boyle knew that but he's been on the show 20 years and he
[28:11.600 --> 28:15.560]  always talked about the importance of that particular Harvard PhD to getting into the
[28:15.560 --> 28:22.000]  real driver's seat of the larger globalist plan but the main reason we've got Boyle coming
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.880]  on is the fact that he's talked about it's one thing to say we're going to mandate regular
[28:25.880 --> 28:30.180]  vaccines but if you mandate experimental things that aren't even vaccines it violates
[28:30.180 --> 28:35.880]  the Nuremberg Code Geneva Convention he would know he didn't just write US biological weapons
[28:35.880 --> 28:40.080]  law he also got a lot of that got adopted by the UN he was also one of the top UN war
[28:40.080 --> 28:45.680]  crimes prosecutors at the UN so he can definitely lay out the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.340]  Code for us and talk about as they try to say it's the law for the military Biden's
[28:50.340 --> 28:53.600]  saying the military is going to be forcibly inoculated I already have that for military
[28:53.600 --> 28:58.000]  officers a month ago we broke that callers said hey we're being told in July it's gonna
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.880]  be mandatory at our at a marine base army bases I made some calls and confirmative officers
[29:03.880 --> 29:07.500]  that they're told in July is when Biden's gonna do that well he's announced that basically
[29:07.500 --> 29:16.520]  that's coming and so much more and then now CNN and USA Today are saying forced inoculations
[29:16.520 --> 29:21.920]  are needed it's time to bully the American people it's time to shun those of us that
[29:21.920 --> 29:26.520]  don't take all these shots which they also admit don't even work anymore so here's that
[29:26.520 --> 29:31.240]  clip of Klaus Schwab we'll come back with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[29:31.240 --> 29:38.280]  I have met practically every leader in the last 40 years and so we're only three or four
[29:38.280 --> 29:48.920]  leaders who really made a lasting impression on me and to a certain extent changed my thinking
[29:48.920 --> 29:54.720]  and one of those one of those was Mandela one another one was my teacher at Harvard
[29:54.720 --> 29:59.960]  50 years ago professor Henry Kissinger let's put it all together let's take this from the
[29:59.960 --> 30:06.600]  arch globalist himself Mr. New World Order Henry Kissinger who wrote as I'm sure you've
[30:06.600 --> 30:13.120]  seen by now an op-ed recently the coronavirus pandemic will forever alter the world order
[30:13.120 --> 30:17.280]  nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity
[30:17.280 --> 30:22.560]  arrest its impact and restore stability when the COVID-19 pandemic is over many countries
[30:22.560 --> 30:27.420]  institutions will be perceived as having failed whether this judgment is objectively fair
[30:27.420 --> 30:32.560]  is irrelevant the reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus to
[30:32.560 --> 30:39.960]  argue now about the past only makes it harder to do what has to be done so people assume
[30:39.960 --> 30:45.520]  we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal
[30:45.520 --> 30:52.720]  again in how we are used to normal in the old-fashioned this is let's say fiction it
[30:52.720 --> 31:03.320]  will not happen see see cut which we have now is much too strong in order not to leave
[31:03.320 --> 31:10.220]  traces there's a need for a new world order but it has different characteristics in different
[31:10.220 --> 31:17.180]  parts of the world that we have to bring about together with other countries a different
[31:17.180 --> 31:21.460]  consciousness of what a world order is that yes we're living in a period of tremendous
[31:21.460 --> 31:27.540]  turmoil now but I think that at the end of this administration with all its turmoil and
[31:27.540 --> 31:36.340]  at the beginning of the next we might actually witness the creation of a new order because
[31:36.340 --> 31:43.500]  people looking in the abyss now is the historical moments of time not only to fight severe virus
[31:43.500 --> 31:50.900]  but to shape the system for the need for the post-corona era we need a great reset so he's
[31:50.900 --> 31:54.760]  been saying that for four years they said they'd use a virus to do it it's in the rockefeller
[31:54.760 --> 31:59.860]  operation lockstep plan it's all premeditated they don't even deny that now I just in the
[31:59.860 --> 32:07.500]  last 45 minutes showed you massive evidence of all of that dr. Francis a Boyle professor joins
[32:07.500 --> 32:15.900]  us I'm not gonna go over his whole bio or his doctorate of law magna cum laude PhD political
[32:15.900 --> 32:21.940]  science for both Harvard University and of course all of the books that he's written but there you
[32:21.940 --> 32:26.540]  have it only one person a year gets that globalist PhD Boyle got it they thought it was one of them
[32:26.540 --> 32:32.020]  but he's been exposing him ever since and he's really is inside their head so I can't think of
[32:32.020 --> 32:38.260]  a better guest to come on with us to talk about the big picture the million foot of you and then
[32:38.260 --> 32:47.460]  also zooming in to the microscopic on this literally with their forced inoculations with
[32:47.460 --> 32:52.500]  the Franken shots saying that it's experimental but we're gonna make you take it we're gonna make
[32:52.500 --> 32:56.780]  the general public take it the lawyers are attacking this with classical religious exemptions
[32:56.780 --> 33:02.700]  but what about going after it other ways in the law if they couldn't approve mRNA all over the
[33:02.700 --> 33:07.940]  world for the last ten years so now they've used this crisis to just stampede it through
[33:07.940 --> 33:14.180]  an emergency if Boyle twice on record I had him all the time went and got the military to stop
[33:14.180 --> 33:18.500]  giving experimental anthrax shots that killed tens of thousands of troops on record then if
[33:18.500 --> 33:22.260]  you can't make the military take it then how do you make the public take it this is just such a
[33:22.500 --> 33:27.780]  stampeding so I'm gonna try to give you the floor to start wherever you like this is commercial free
[33:27.780 --> 33:33.420]  on this special Saturday transmission dr. Boyle thank you for joining us all right well yes to
[33:33.420 --> 33:40.260]  get to the first point about Kissinger and Schwab I didn't know Schwab had studied with Kissinger
[33:40.260 --> 33:47.580]  but it doesn't surprise me at all yes as you correctly pointed out when I was a young man I
[33:47.780 --> 33:55.380]  decided to get the most elite education I possibly could and turn it against the people running the
[33:55.380 --> 34:06.700]  American Empire so I did it her Harvard Law School in 1971 I was in the exact same 1l class with Mitt
[34:06.700 --> 34:14.380]  Romney back in those days he went by will and he was even running for president then we took all
[34:14.380 --> 34:26.340]  our 1l courses and then the next year 1972 yes I deliberately entered the exact same PhD program
[34:26.340 --> 34:34.780]  at Harvard that had produced both Kissinger and Brzezinski before me and that is the Harvard
[34:34.780 --> 34:41.900]  Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Department of Government where they train future Harvard
[34:41.900 --> 34:51.060]  professors of political science and high-level government officials like Oh Kissinger McGeorge
[34:51.060 --> 35:02.460]  Bundy before him Brzezinski Huntington Allison Joe Nye I could go on with these types of figures so
[35:02.460 --> 35:10.740]  yes I went through the exact same program and I was an associate at Harvard Center for International
[35:10.780 --> 35:17.620]  Affairs for two years there and they gave me Kissinger's old office for one year when I was
[35:17.620 --> 35:24.100]  there it was kind of spooky sitting there with his old file cabinet staring me in the face and
[35:24.100 --> 35:28.040]  again so the reason this is so important is out of all the globalist groups this seems to be the
[35:28.040 --> 35:34.820]  central brain hub where the most powerful directives come out of it seems to be the the
[35:35.540 --> 35:40.900]  headquarters of this evil operation so can you describe who's behind it why they're so
[35:40.900 --> 35:46.960]  powerful why they're eugenicist why they're pushing this well as I said McGeorge Bundy
[35:46.960 --> 35:52.260]  went through the exact same thing so he taught in the government department at Harvard I taught
[35:52.260 --> 35:57.860]  there for two years before I decided to become a law professor so that takes us back to Kennedy
[35:57.860 --> 36:04.340]  and the best and the brightest back to 1961 and these are the people you know been running the
[36:04.380 --> 36:12.060]  world at least in my political lifetime as for Kissinger and the Harvard government department
[36:12.060 --> 36:21.900]  Kissinger's completely Machiavellian he does not have a principal bone in his body it's not just me
[36:21.900 --> 36:30.020]  saying that I can't hear you there Alex it's not just me saying that but also his colleague
[36:30.020 --> 36:36.380]  Stanley Hoffman who was my PhD dissertation supervisor started out in that program with
[36:36.380 --> 36:43.460]  Kissinger so he's thoroughly Machiavellian the Harvard government department they're all neo
[36:43.460 --> 36:51.780]  conservative power-hungry in and outer innards and outers with Washington DC advising Democrats
[36:51.780 --> 36:58.860]  and Republicans alike I mean this is so historic this is so big and I was about to ask the crew to
[36:58.860 --> 37:07.620]  put up on screen State Department memorandum 200 and public law 7277 that also all came out of
[37:07.620 --> 37:13.180]  Harvard for global depopulation carried out by a global government a disarming of our police and
[37:13.180 --> 37:18.460]  military and a world government takeover run by corporations so now that we've set the table with
[37:18.460 --> 37:23.940]  this you were there and I'll be showing this for TV viewers while you're talking 14 months ago
[37:23.940 --> 37:27.940]  laying out everything that's now come out predicting the vaccines wouldn't be vaccines
[37:27.940 --> 37:32.860]  predicting they'd kill a bunch of people so how did you know all that and then tell us what you
[37:32.860 --> 37:37.700]  think currently of the news of them saying hey these vaccines don't even protect you now but
[37:37.700 --> 37:42.860]  you've got to keep taking them and by the way you you still can't take the mask off you you predicted
[37:42.860 --> 37:48.860]  they would do all of this they now admit it's nothing but a giant corporate power grab right
[37:48.860 --> 37:53.780]  well Harvard trained me to be one of these people I mean they basically beat trade me to be a
[37:54.020 --> 38:02.300]  Kissinger for my generation but I they they didn't realize my agenda was to oppose them
[38:02.300 --> 38:14.300]  up as for the these Franken shots and the COVID-19 all the rest that is no I got involved in opposing
[38:14.300 --> 38:22.020]  US government biological warfare weapons and programs shortly after the Council for responsible
[38:22.020 --> 38:30.660]  genetics was founded there in Cambridge Mass and several my friends there in the life sciences
[38:30.660 --> 38:39.820]  department at Harvard were involved and I guess they vouch for me and I got involved that way so
[38:39.820 --> 38:48.500]  I've been fighting these people since about 1984 or something and they just have a Nazi mentality
[38:48.500 --> 38:55.300]  like like Kissinger what what could I say it's that they brainwash you that way at Harvard and
[38:55.300 --> 39:00.380]  here I'm not talking about the Harvard Kennedy School people get those confused Kennedy School
[39:00.380 --> 39:07.460]  came later and basically they just trained US Imperial operations okay but I went through the
[39:07.460 --> 39:15.620]  real thing Kissinger and also Brzezinski but I I I went there because of Kissinger because I figured
[39:15.700 --> 39:22.340]  as you correctly said that's where the power is Harvard is the brains of the American Empire
[39:22.340 --> 39:29.020]  certainly in my political lifetime would you know which goes back at least I guess to the Cuban
[39:29.020 --> 39:35.340]  Missile Crisis so that's why I went there that's why I went through that program and if and if
[39:35.340 --> 39:40.980]  Harvard is the Sun orbiting it are some planets well I think the biggest next body would be what
[39:40.980 --> 39:47.180]  the Chicago Business School seems to also be key in Harvard's orbit and and as you have said before
[39:47.180 --> 39:53.100]  a true Nazi ideologue was the leader of the neo-con movement out of out of the Chicago
[39:53.100 --> 40:00.660]  Business School yes I went to the University of Chicago as an undergraduate and was in the
[40:00.660 --> 40:09.620]  political science department there and they were these Straussian neo-conservatives that's where
[40:09.620 --> 40:17.420]  the neo-conservative movement started under Leo Strauss Strauss had just retired when I got there
[40:17.420 --> 40:26.700]  but I studied with his right-hand man co-author and later literary executor of his estate Joseph
[40:26.700 --> 40:32.540]  Cropsey so I went through that whole neo-con program and I was at the top of my undergraduate
[40:32.540 --> 40:38.300]  class there and graduated in three years instead of four but but what we have to understand about
[40:38.460 --> 40:48.940]  the neo-cons is that Leo Strauss's mentor and sponsor in Germany was Carl Schmidt and Carl
[40:48.940 --> 40:59.420]  Schmidt was the leading Nazi law professor of that benighted era the the crown jurist of the
[40:59.420 --> 41:08.380]  Nazis and Carl Schmidt justified every hideous atrocity Hitler and the Nazis inflicted on
[41:08.380 --> 41:14.420]  everyone including the Jews I don't interrupt you dr. Boyle but you're not a pompous person
[41:14.420 --> 41:18.380]  like Kissinger these other people but you're one of the few people that actually gone through two
[41:18.380 --> 41:23.100]  of the key schools that we know got influenced by the British Royal Roundtable groups then as
[41:23.100 --> 41:27.180]  they handed off their empire to us after World War one and World War two we became the Empire
[41:27.220 --> 41:31.620]  and of course Carol Quigley at Georgetown wrote tragedy and hope where he detailed that from a
[41:31.620 --> 41:36.620]  positive perspective what is it like for you to write all these books and you have all these
[41:36.620 --> 41:40.580]  speeches and be a top war crimes prosecutor and you've been at the highest levels of basically
[41:40.580 --> 41:46.420]  the system to be able to study it and then for decades been exposing it to then see Republican
[41:46.420 --> 41:51.780]  politics Democrat politics as you said the Kennedy School all these sub flavors that are really just
[41:51.780 --> 41:57.220]  false political paradigms where people follow a compartmentalized system and never even figure
[41:57.220 --> 42:02.060]  out the real politic of Kissinger that's been adopted by the global elites and whereas the
[42:02.060 --> 42:06.860]  general public would adopt real politic not believing it not following it but knowing it's
[42:06.860 --> 42:11.740]  the opposition to freedom we could defeat it very easily but instead if you talk about the great
[42:11.740 --> 42:15.900]  reset or you talk about anything they go all that doesn't exist in the New York Times they talk to
[42:15.900 --> 42:21.100]  us like children and and so this information is there and you come on the show and get tens of
[42:21.140 --> 42:25.620]  millions of views over the years but still we've just groveled at the feet of these people that
[42:25.620 --> 42:30.300]  that that intellectually could be defeated because all they are is authoritarians masquerading as
[42:30.300 --> 42:37.740]  our leaders yeah I've been up against all the top lawyers and international lawyers and whatever
[42:37.740 --> 42:47.900]  and I've been able to demolish them in in court or in debate Alan Dershowitz I demolished it was
[42:47.900 --> 42:54.780]  so bad that Dershowitz admitted I was the expert on international law and international human
[42:54.780 --> 43:00.660]  rights so sure I've been fighting these people I guess ever since I entered the University of
[43:00.660 --> 43:08.500]  Chicago in 1968 but that's what I decided to do when I was 17 so here I am I've been doing it I
[43:08.500 --> 43:13.540]  can't complain or anything but well it's very historical and it's great to talk to you on those
[43:13.540 --> 43:20.300]  points now we've done your curriculum vitae let's drill into the law because I see all these great
[43:20.300 --> 43:24.420]  lawyers that meanwhile out there addressing this like hey First Amendment you're trying to violate
[43:24.420 --> 43:30.420]  religious exemption I'm not a lawyer but but studying what you've said in history if you could
[43:30.420 --> 43:33.940]  get it where the military didn't have to take experimental shots and that this is even more
[43:33.940 --> 43:38.660]  Frankenstein than the than the anthrax shots and isn't even in the vaccine family how could they
[43:38.660 --> 43:43.900]  be trying to pass laws now in six states saying you will take an experimental shot and then now
[43:43.900 --> 43:49.900]  they've got CNN MSNBC even Fox News saying no let's go ahead and make people take this I mean this is
[43:49.900 --> 43:56.620]  over my dead body type level stuff so as a international war crimes tribunal guy as the guy
[43:56.620 --> 44:01.460]  that authored the US biological weapons law you're the probably one of the top experts to speak to
[44:01.460 --> 44:05.980]  this so I'm gonna send this to a bunch of lawyers I'm gonna send it to everybody that's listening so
[44:05.980 --> 44:11.140]  that they get advice on how to counter this and for citizens to counter this this giant violation
[44:11.140 --> 44:18.220]  of the Nuremberg Code and Geneva Convention right Alex and that's the reason I've been appearing on
[44:18.220 --> 44:26.860]  your show since February of 2020 to try to explain this to common ordinary everyday Americans you
[44:26.860 --> 44:34.220]  have to understand I've been living this since 1968 so of course I understand it and I've been
[44:34.220 --> 44:40.740]  fighting against it and opposing it most Americans haven't haven't done that I understand that they
[44:40.740 --> 44:49.140]  just have to go out there and support their spouses and their kids so fine but I tried to explain it
[44:49.140 --> 44:56.220]  and explain it in terms that that I hope ordinary people can understand and I write in not plain
[44:56.220 --> 45:04.100]  English not you know this high fluting legalese now you are correct what happened was in the run
[45:04.100 --> 45:13.060]  up to Gulf War one in about I believe it was maybe December of 1990 and I was doing everything
[45:13.060 --> 45:21.220]  possible to oppose the war at that time all of a sudden Dick Cheney ordered US Armed Forces to take
[45:21.220 --> 45:30.380]  two experimental Franken shots for anthrax and botulin and it just came out of nowhere and I was
[45:30.380 --> 45:37.420]  blindsided by it because even though I had been following US biological warfare weapons I didn't
[45:37.420 --> 45:45.100]  know why later on we found out that the neo cons in the Reagan administration had ordered the Center
[45:45.100 --> 45:53.300]  for Disease Control a bunch of Nazis an American type of culture collection to send 40 shipments
[45:53.300 --> 46:02.740]  of weapons specific biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq in the hope and expectation
[46:02.740 --> 46:10.780]  that he would use them against Iran in the Iraq Iran war that had been encouraged by Jimmy Carter
[46:10.780 --> 46:18.820]  and Zbigniew Brzezinski who was also ahead of me in that same Harvard PhD program so I go way back
[46:18.820 --> 46:31.820]  with him too and and so I came to the defense of the leading military captain doctor medical doctor
[46:31.820 --> 46:39.100]  captain dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn who refused to give these Franken shots because she correctly
[46:39.220 --> 46:45.820]  knew that they violated the Nuremberg code on medical experimentation the Helsinki code
[46:45.820 --> 46:56.820]  and her ethical obligation as a doctor to do no harm that was in February 1991 I agreed pro bono
[46:56.820 --> 47:04.300]  publico to help defend her I'm not going to go through it all here but we did put on trial those
[47:04.380 --> 47:11.740]  Franken shots from that time and in the course of those proceedings I publicly accused President
[47:11.740 --> 47:19.300]  Bush senior Cheney Secretary of Defense Colin Powell Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Schwarzkopf
[47:19.300 --> 47:27.700]  of committing Nuremberg crimes on our own troops for forcing them to take those original Franken
[47:27.700 --> 47:35.500]  shots that went out all over the country on satellite I was told by lawyer in the White
[47:35.500 --> 47:43.500]  House they heard it there and they were quite upset as we eventually found out those original
[47:43.500 --> 47:51.900]  Franken shots were given to five hundred thousand members of US Armed Forces eleven thousand died
[47:51.900 --> 48:00.500]  a hundred thousand were disabled and in addition the Gulf War syndrome in addition to Gulf War
[48:00.500 --> 48:09.460]  syndrome also was conveyed by veterans suffering from it to their families and to health care
[48:09.460 --> 48:16.020]  workers that that were treating them so it was clear there was a biological warfare agent at
[48:16.020 --> 48:25.300]  work in those Franken shots the tip of here Alex is this the British troops also were forced to
[48:25.300 --> 48:35.060]  take those same Franken shots I got involved in exposing that over in the UK TV for Channel 4
[48:35.060 --> 48:43.740]  the dirty war I started advising them in 1993 they had heard of my expertise on these things
[48:43.740 --> 48:48.060]  and again dr. bowl for folks that are just joining us we're not just telling these stories because
[48:48.060 --> 48:52.380]  they're interesting history you what you did you're the guy that stopped this with it with
[48:52.380 --> 48:56.620]  a few other Patriots and heroes you have stopped this over and over again that's why I should have
[48:56.620 --> 49:00.820]  said that up front hey we got the guy coming on that stopped the fraud before we got the guy
[49:00.820 --> 49:05.500]  coming on that stopped the illegal experimental shots before and we can stop them again ladies
[49:05.500 --> 49:09.420]  and gentlemen that's why we're giving you this whole history on his bona fides he went to the
[49:09.420 --> 49:14.780]  same training under Kissinger as Klaus Schwab he's the insider he's the whistleblower and he's
[49:14.780 --> 49:18.060]  I'm getting chills right now because they're coming for all of us they're trying to have a
[49:18.060 --> 49:22.660]  medical tyranny they're announcing forced inoculations now for the troops and us next
[49:22.660 --> 49:28.380]  they're preparing the mind so we better listen to dr. Boyle please continue right and Alex here's
[49:28.380 --> 49:35.300]  the important point that the French troops did not take those Franken shots the first time because
[49:35.300 --> 49:44.500]  they had used experimental anthrax vaccines in their Indochina war and it had poisoned all their
[49:44.500 --> 49:49.660]  troops so that's right they were the only ones that did not go for syndrome that's correct and
[49:49.660 --> 49:57.060]  they did not have Gulf War syndrome the British troops did the American forces did that some of
[49:57.060 --> 50:02.540]  their families and health care workers did the French troops did not accept a small number of
[50:02.740 --> 50:11.820]  them in their staff command in order to serve with the joint staff command with us they they
[50:11.820 --> 50:18.100]  did and some of them did come down but was a very small number but the key is the French troops did
[50:18.100 --> 50:25.100]  not take the Franken shots and they did not come down with Gulf War syndrome unlike unlike our
[50:25.100 --> 50:35.780]  forces where we had probably I would say two percent killed twenty percent disabled and those
[50:35.780 --> 50:44.060]  were healthy young men and women in our armed forces so I think and later on Senator Jay
[50:44.060 --> 50:50.660]  Rockefeller also held hearings on those original Franken shots and he too publicly at the end of
[50:50.660 --> 50:57.540]  these hearings commit accused Bush and the rest of them committing Nuremberg crime on our own troops
[50:57.540 --> 51:06.220]  so we're back at this stage this exact same stage again I've heard from I know many of our armed
[51:06.220 --> 51:14.260]  services men are members listen to your program I hear from many of them and that's why I designed
[51:14.300 --> 51:24.900]  my Nuremberg notice that I just sent to Scott again today a very short little succinct notice
[51:24.900 --> 51:32.980]  that well that's the Nuremberg code but I drew I distilled it all into a little bitty three sentence
[51:32.980 --> 51:40.660]  oh yes sir we've got it and and we'll post it in the live show feed under the live show feed along
[51:40.660 --> 51:48.180]  with the Nuremberg code right and and in addition to that I have a fix there I work with an
[51:48.180 --> 51:57.740]  investigative journalist I gave a 32 minute word by word line by line explanation that that about
[51:57.740 --> 52:04.140]  what what it says what it means what is its history and how it can be used and all that is
[52:04.140 --> 52:10.500]  due to people from your audience asking me for help especially members of our US Armed Forces
[52:10.500 --> 52:19.140]  and I designed it for them I've been told it's now in widespread circulation all over the military
[52:19.140 --> 52:23.460]  fabulous news I know you want it it's usually hard to get you on because you're so busy with
[52:23.460 --> 52:28.900]  your students you actually wanted to come on three four months ago to warn people about consent about
[52:28.900 --> 52:35.100]  the law and so absolutely when we're done today send us any recordings any videos any documents
[52:35.100 --> 52:39.780]  will add them to the live show feed as a resource for everybody and then it's imperative that viewers
[52:39.780 --> 52:44.140]  and listeners get this information just because you know this listeners your friends your neighbors
[52:44.140 --> 52:48.860]  perfect strangers the military base down the road they don't know so print up a bunch of copies bring
[52:48.860 --> 52:53.780]  it down to the PX you really care about our troops and let them know their rights because if they can
[52:53.780 --> 52:58.820]  do it to them they're gonna do it to us and what do you make of my sources that after July 4th
[52:59.300 --> 53:04.180]  Biden is going to announce forced inoculations yet again of the troops and then I said that a
[53:04.180 --> 53:10.420]  month and a half ago from the sources it's now a Biden says he's looking at doing it it doesn't
[53:10.420 --> 53:17.420]  surprise me Alex it was just reported he's considering it right as for what I would
[53:17.420 --> 53:24.740]  recommend Alex's you take that excellent program we did March 17th because that's the last good
[53:24.740 --> 53:31.740]  one you and I did about all these issues I've heard from several troops about this my advice
[53:31.740 --> 53:41.340]  to them it looks like it's coming is at this time to line up a lawyer you have my Nuremberg
[53:41.340 --> 53:49.260]  notice you have my 32-minute explanation for it those members of our armed forces who do not want
[53:49.300 --> 53:54.700]  to take these franken shots because of what the last set did to you made all of you sick
[53:54.700 --> 54:03.700]  and your your spouses and even your children and your health care workers um line up a civilian
[54:03.700 --> 54:11.100]  lawyer I don't mean any disrespect here for JAG lawyers I've worked with JAG lawyers that's fine
[54:11.100 --> 54:18.300]  with me some of them are very courageous lawyers I advise some of those of defense JAG counsel
[54:18.340 --> 54:26.180]  defense down at Guantanamo who've taken steps that they knew would end their military careers
[54:26.180 --> 54:32.380]  which which they did but the problem is JAG lawyers are in the chain of command and they're
[54:32.380 --> 54:37.820]  not going to do anything to shake up the chain of command they know that will be the end of their
[54:37.820 --> 54:45.820]  JAG career so you're going to need to find a civilian lawyer my advice right now if you're
[54:45.820 --> 54:54.540]  concerned about this in armed forces line up a civilian lawyer give him my materials the the
[54:54.540 --> 55:00.340]  our interview today and especially the one you and I did March 17th which which was quite
[55:00.340 --> 55:08.660]  comprehensive and then have have that civilian lawyer research a strategy for you ready to go
[55:08.660 --> 55:17.180]  you do have my Nuremberg notice that you can use the first time you're given that order and but
[55:17.180 --> 55:22.620]  but at that point they very well might threaten you with court-martial and at that point you'll
[55:22.620 --> 55:28.340]  have to have a lawyer lined up and again there's way more opposition now than when you first stood
[55:28.340 --> 55:32.300]  up to this 30 years ago and 20 years ago I remember having you on at the time the second
[55:32.300 --> 55:37.540]  time you did it I mean I'm seeing numbers they put out public numbers of 50 plus percent of said no
[55:37.540 --> 55:43.740]  but that was controlled groups I'm seeing numbers of many bases up to 75 to 80 percent of marine and
[55:43.740 --> 55:50.420]  army bases have said no I've seen the Marines even higher you know my dad was a marine in World War
[55:50.420 --> 55:57.980]  Two invaded Saipan, Tinian and Okinawa so that warms my heart to see that the Marines here are
[55:57.980 --> 56:03.740]  going to act to protect themselves from these Franken shots right so that is the advice I've
[56:03.820 --> 56:11.180]  given armed forces today line up a civilian lawyer not not a JAG lawyer because the JAG lawyers in
[56:11.180 --> 56:16.740]  the chain of command you're really going to be up against the system with this my experience I have
[56:16.740 --> 56:24.500]  actually appeared live in five different US military court-martials for GI resistors as
[56:24.500 --> 56:31.340]  matters of principle that's explained in my book protesting power war resistance and law so you
[56:31.340 --> 56:36.660]  know when you go up against the system here you know the JAG lawyers are going to be kind of
[56:36.660 --> 56:42.100]  cautious you're going to need to get a civilian lawyer who's willing to push the envelope
[56:42.100 --> 56:46.420]  generally speaking JAG lawyers aren't going to do that because they know that will be the end of
[56:46.420 --> 56:52.460]  their JAG career and those who have pushed the envelope they have seen their JAG career in so
[56:52.460 --> 56:59.220]  my advice that all military board bases around there they have former JAG lawyers who you know
[56:59.220 --> 57:07.980]  advise counsel represent US troops so I first you've got my my my notice have that on hand pull
[57:07.980 --> 57:14.500]  the notice out listen to my interview and and just read the thing and then say you know if you have
[57:14.500 --> 57:22.060]  any questions you can contact professor boy but then at that point I'll have to work with with
[57:22.060 --> 57:27.500]  a civilian defense counsel for absolutely and we're gonna add today just because you brought
[57:27.500 --> 57:35.220]  this up I'm gonna go ahead and run the entire interview global conversations that you did you
[57:35.220 --> 57:39.380]  can resist the vaccine Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation so you don't have to repeat that
[57:39.380 --> 57:48.420]  show 72 of those great folks Regis Tremblay and friends another great podcast we're gonna we're
[57:48.420 --> 57:53.780]  gonna re-air that here how people go and share that from the YouTube because I see you know it's
[57:53.780 --> 57:58.660]  got four thousand views it needs about a hundred thousand needs ten million views Francis Boyle
[57:58.660 --> 58:03.380]  Nuremberg Code is your defense and some of your interviews with us have millions of views your
[58:03.380 --> 58:09.140]  last one has a hundred and forty eight thousand views which is great from March 17th but we need
[58:09.140 --> 58:13.700]  tens of millions of views its information is power so just spend a few minutes before I shift years
[58:13.700 --> 58:19.500]  into just the overall police state and I've got an excerpt of a speech you gave about the 9-11
[58:19.500 --> 58:23.620]  powers how you predicted they would be used against the American people now Biden in his
[58:23.620 --> 58:30.380]  joint address to Congress Wednesday night did indeed say we're gonna the other main terror
[58:30.380 --> 58:34.980]  threat is Trump supporters anyone that opposes this is a white supremacist I mean this is a
[58:34.980 --> 58:41.260]  serious train jumping the rails here so one of your expertise on that as a lawyer and also a war
[58:41.260 --> 58:46.620]  crimes prosecutor about where you see this going and how to oppose this this this unabated power
[58:46.660 --> 58:51.300]  grab we're seeing but spend a few minutes for people that don't know why they should wait when
[58:51.300 --> 58:57.340]  we hear this in about an hour after you've gone and and why this is so important explain people
[58:57.340 --> 59:02.980]  dr. Boyle the what the Nuremberg Code is what the Geneva Convention is I mean obviously we already
[59:02.980 --> 59:07.620]  had informed consent laws we already had laws against some stuff but we talked about Tuskegee
[59:07.620 --> 59:13.620]  experiment 40-plus years black people given syphilis allowed to spread syphilis allowed to
[59:13.620 --> 59:19.980]  die painful deaths basically microscopic worms eating their brains we can show some of that
[59:19.980 --> 59:25.220]  footage we have some b-roll archival footage of the ski experiment of this being done and you talk
[59:25.220 --> 59:32.500]  about Nazis at at the CDC I mean it was a Nuremberg you code that came along for the Nazis but it was
[59:32.500 --> 59:37.040]  the Nazis as you know that were trained by the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute who was trained by the
[59:37.040 --> 59:43.580]  Cold Springs Harbor group and so this really comes out of England comes out of New York comes
[59:43.580 --> 59:49.820]  out of the US and so the scientific elite has had this real eugenics depopulationist Malthusian
[59:49.820 --> 59:56.660]  system in their veins for close to 300 years since since Malthus proposed cramming the poor
[59:56.660 --> 01:00:01.180]  into small buildings and letting them die of smallpox and not feeding them enough we saw this
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.260]  used against the Native Americans as well with the blankets with the smallpox on it that's in
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:10.940]  a British Colonel's dispatches that really went on and and and so we see a history of Tuskegee we
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:16.220]  think of this as 50 years ago or 30 years ago but really we know they did syphilis studies all over
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:21.660]  the world the the US government and others did and so really if you go to Fauci the people that
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:27.220]  trained Fauci were the ones that were doing this and so this is really handed down explain that to
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:34.420]  people please well it's like let me just there's a long history here and I discussed that my book
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:40.320]  bio warfare and terrorism and another book I wrote future of international law and American
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:47.280]  foreign policy right you can't I can't couldn't have gotten that PhD from Harvard in international
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:53.000]  relations if unless I had studied everything there was to study about the origins the First
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.200]  World War in the Second World War the rise to Nazis and everything else like that so of course
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:07.440]  we're seeing this Nazi mentality that that's what they tried to brainwash into me in the University
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.120]  of Chicago the the neat well I went there under the reputation the place had under Robert Bernard
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:21.240]  Hutchins and when I got there it had been unbeknownst to me hijacked by the neocons and then
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.800]  I knew what I was getting into Harvard that was the brains of the American Empire and that's why
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:33.320]  I went there I went there to find out how the brains of the American Empire think and how they
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:39.000]  operate what they read and what they do so quantified for me that's what I'm saying is why
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.560]  are they into secret experimentation why did Kissinger write memorandum 200 on how to depopulate
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.240]  the third world and then they call themselves liberals and they're obsessed I mean it's like
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.000]  Richard Pearl walked up to a bunch of women at a Washington Post dinner famously like 14 years ago
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.320]  and said I kill people I'm powerful and the women thought he was creepy and ran away from him he
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.760]  thought like it's powerful to just kill millions of people he thought it was sexy not even knowing
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:10.080]  women don't think that's sexy there's something wrong with these people well that's correct as I
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.720]  said you get brainwashed at the University of Chicago I was there for three years and Harvard
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.720]  for seven years that that's all they do it you know I don't know what to say Kissinger is a
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:27.360]  consummate Machiavelli he does that if you read all of his theoretical works which I've done to
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:34.320]  get that PhD and what's come after that he doesn't have a principal bone in his body he is completely
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:42.240]  Machiavellian to the core to get that PhD from Harvard I had to know my Machiavelli backward and
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.600]  forward upside sure I'm asking though is it isn't almost a form of mental illness to say you have no
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.240]  morals and stand for nothing well then what do they stand for just the accumulation of power
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:58.520]  into themselves period right as Kissinger said he once said quote power is the ultimate aphrodisiac
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:06.360]  uncle in other words it's better than sex for as far as Kissinger is concerned and it takes a lot
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:12.680]  of work to you know take you have to understand a lot of kids go to Harvard I spent two years
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:19.760]  teaching undergraduates there so they go there many of them to make the world a better place
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:28.040]  but after four years of brainwashing in this they come out with with their values completely
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:36.560]  perverted right it's it's it's all there in the prince where the prince has to learn how not to
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:45.400]  be good and that's what Harvard does it teaches you how and why and justifies to you why you do
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:51.920]  why you have to commit evil absolute evil to make the world a better place exactly but see that's a
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.880]  paradox that's a paradox because I know quote Delta Force their final training is after all
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.040]  the weeks of you know testing is to get in a shack for a day and read the prince and then write a
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.840]  report on it and then the guys that go oh this is wrong and justifies the means is wrong they go
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.280]  you're right we'll shuffle you over here you passed but they really didn't pass and then the
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.080]  guys that say they'll do anything for the you know the end justifies the means get promoted
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.160]  but if they're soulless people what is the end well it's global domination depopulation selfishness
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.280]  and and really this is a cancer taking over our country George Washington was not Machiavelli he
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.240]  was straightforward in his attack straightforward and what he had to say Julius Caesar wasn't even
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.280]  Machiavelli he was even though he's a dictator he would tell you what he was going to do and he
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:39.760]  would do it how do you run a society with this backstabbing and lying and double dealing it's
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:47.440]  disgusting box look around you and this is what we have today I regret to say but I wanted to get
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:52.560]  to the Franken shots right now let's get to that right now the big threat that's in front of us
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:05:02.880]  and understand I drafted my Nuremberg warning for ordinary everyday people to use it not just troops
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:12.240]  and ordinary everyday people can read that warning they can listen to my interview explaining it and
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:21.120]  how to use it and then if they are told they have to take the Franken shot they can produce that
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:27.760]  that'll throw off balance whoever has given them the order but eventually they're going to have to
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:34.960]  get a lawyer that I can work with in their community but right now Alex it seems to me
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:41.760]  that the strategy of the people running the show here the you know the Fauci's the columns
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:49.680]  the rest of them Ron Klain he was behind me at Harvard Law School Biden's chief of staff
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.960]  probably the deputy president these days Klain covered up the Ebola
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:06.640]  catastrophe there in black west Africa that Ebola pandemic that was all produced by
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:17.760]  Ebola Franken shot that they had developed at the Kenema BSL-4 in Kenema Sierra Leone it was
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:26.000]  funded by USAID which is a front organization for the CIA Fort Detrick was over there
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:35.360]  the death scientists at Tulane were over there the Harvard Broad MIT Institute were there that's
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:42.720]  a major study a center for synthetic biology the Pentagon's DARPA defense advanced research
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:51.280]  programs they set up the entire field of synthetic biology they've they've owned it
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.040]  bought it paid for it whatever synthetic for folks that don't know what that means that's
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:02.400]  all this nanotech it's the mRNA please continue right and and that's involved in the COVID-19
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:10.080]  what's going on itself but the bottom line is as I see it today what they are trying to do
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:19.040]  is to scaremonger and coerce and trick as many people as possible into taking
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:27.440]  even one of these Franken shots to to get this poison into your body whether it's the messenger
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:35.280]  RNA or the other Franken shots like AstraZeneca or Johnson and Johnson that will actually be
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:43.040]  giving you COVID-19 cells now ask yourself COVID-19 we've discussed before Alex is an
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:53.440]  offensive biological warfare weapon that has been DNA genetically engineered it has been given gain
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:01.840]  of function properties to make it more lethal more infection infectious it has HIV right in there
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:08.960]  and it also involves synthetic biology they are giving you literal cells of this they say well
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:14.160]  it's an innocuous little cell but they're putting it right into your body so of course you're going
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:22.320]  to get it that's why the AstraZeneca Franken shot is already slashed crashed and burned
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:30.960]  Johnson and Johnson's crashed and burned I suspect I don't know when we're going to see
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:40.240]  the same thing happening to Pfizer BioNTech that's Bill Gates and Moderna and you I'm sure
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:46.320]  you've already broadcasted all the adverse reactions but Dr Boyle you are one of the
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.520]  leading experts with multi-jurisdictional multi-disciplinary understandings I think
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.120]  really of anybody that's done all the different things you've done at the level you've done them
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:02.800]  so looking at this to me it's a bunch of synthetic biology technologies they've had for decades that
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.200]  they've now gotten a lot more sophisticated and quote perfected and so they want to roll this out
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.720]  but no government would approve it they couldn't get it through the FDA so they use the COVID
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.840]  crisis to break the wall down and now they're saying oh dozens of shots a year and flu and
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:25.920]  MRA for for this and MRA for that and it's just the normalizing of doing mass Tuskegee mass Joseph
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:32.480]  Mingola level experimentation on the entire world and what we've seen done in the third world
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.200]  secretly is now breaking through into the first world and they organize society around the
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.440]  tracking they have the contact tracers they have the surveillance apps and and so it's authoritarian
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.760]  on every level they use it to lock down to bring in the new great reset to bankrupt people to get
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:53.520]  financial control I mean they admit that this is the global corporate elites takeover plan
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:59.280]  on every front I'm just shocked that they didn't give people a placebo shot just as a pretext to
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.840]  declare themselves heroes and then roll out some deadly shot later they want to depopulate us
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.280]  it looks like they're compressing everything and accelerating their agenda 2030 programs that I've
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.000]  read about and I just have a really bad feeling that they got panicked by populism they got
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.440]  panicked by Trump and Bolsonaro they got panicked by people wanting to get out of the EU and that
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.520]  this is their 21st century war on civilization and stability itself that if we're so busy just
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.720]  trying to feed ourselves and dying from all these viruses that we won't worry about the big mega
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.200]  banks and their slave camps in China so I know you don't like to speculate as a lawyer and a
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.560]  researcher and all this but what is the motive for these people how would they well this is so bold
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.560]  what they've done I mean the diseases that even mainstream news admits that 60 percent of people
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.920]  now in the hospital with COVID are sick from the vaccine they admit huge numbers of deaths so many
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.920]  celebrities dying people I know have died after they take the shot then they tell you it doesn't
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.840]  protect you once you take it but you still got to wear a mask and they lied to us and they bypassed
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.240]  the animal trials because they did secret trials before this even happened as you know with similar
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.600]  gain-of-function coronavirus systems and it killed many of the animals in some studies all
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:17.360]  of them I mean the more I learn about this I keep pinching myself thinking I'm in like a nightmare
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.760]  simulation but then if you look at Stalin Hitler and Mao and this is what happens when you get
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.840]  lunatics with this crazy will to power and control and so many times whether it was Mao or Hitler or
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:37.280]  Stalin or Lenin we see mad scientists being the enablers and the handmaidens of these of these
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.800]  crazy people so historically can you speak to the motive and where this is going and and why it
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:54.640]  seems so accelerated well as I said it you and I can disagree in good faith but obviously the Wuhan
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:03.920]  BSL-4 was developing this offensive biological warfare weapon with the University of North
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:13.040]  Carolina BSL-3 and it does appear if you read through all the studies and things yes we have a
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:24.240]  cabal of Nazi scientists elite around the world who consider that they are the
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:33.520]  übermensch and we are the untermensch and we simply should be doing whatever they tell us to do
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.640]  it's you know what what they train you at that Harvard PhD program I was that's what Rothkop
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.160]  and I have the globalist try to hire me a few times off record so I'm a journalist I don't
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.200]  violate the confidence but Rothkop when he headed up the Kissinger group 13 14 years ago in front
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.560]  of John Armand my producer said he still works here said Alex you're part of the superclass his
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.920]  book was out superclass he goes just join us lead the opposition you're an elite because you
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.320]  understand this you can't help the public they're going to tear you apart they're a bunch of animals
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.560]  you're meant to be a ruler and I guess a lot of people he goes come on up to New York it's going
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.120]  to be great Alex come on up to he thought that as soon as they offered me something
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.200]  that I would suddenly join him instead I just got my producer on the phone so he
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:24.720]  could hear this for himself I mean did they ever try that with you sure when I was 21 years old
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:35.600]  I was offered a slot on Henry Kissinger's National Security Council which I politely declined because
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:43.360]  that did not fit in with my my my agenda as I said my agenda having lived through the Vietnam
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:51.920]  War and opposed the Vietnam War shortly after I became 17 I decided to get the most elite
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:58.320]  education I possibly could and turn it against the people running the American government the
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:05.360]  American empire sure I could have had all the money all the power all the fame I wanted I
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:11.200]  explained this to my three sons with those three degrees from Harvard but I just decided to make
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.400]  the world a better place that's all maybe probably goes back to my what do your sons think of all
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:23.680]  this they got to be smart too I mean what do they think I I I don't want my sons involved in the
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.600]  work I do it's sure sure I would just imagine what they think of you well you know I tell you
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.520]  Dr Boyle it's just crazy it's totally out of control in closing you never talk about your
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.720]  books here we're talking about how people contact you tell people about some of your books most of
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:43.920]  them are still in print available at amazon.com yeah I've got a I just finished 22 books so you
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:51.200]  know you can read there what you want but certainly biowarfare and terrorism I think pretty
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:15:00.160]  much explains what is going on here and if you look at that book the Ford is written by my
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:07.600]  colleague professor John King professor of molecular biology at MIT and a founder of the
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:14.240]  council for responsible genetics he's one of the top life scientists in the world and also my
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:21.840]  friends at Harvard that got me involved in council for responsible genetics I dealt with top life
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:29.040]  scientists in the world MIT Harvard the University of Chicago and they knew you know I'm not saying
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.280]  I'm a scientist myself but they knew of my expertise I was the top of my biology class there
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:41.520]  at classes at the University of Chicago I took their bio pre-med sequence straight A's
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:48.480]  won the sigma xi certificate merit and prize in biology etc so they knew I had basic
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:56.480]  scientific training competence and could understand these highly complex technological
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:04.000]  matters and then try to apply the law to rein them in as a matter of fact if you look at my
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:11.280]  biological weapons anti-terrorism act I criminalized by name synthetic biology even
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:18.640]  before there was synthetic biology that's because the at the first meeting conference of the
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:25.440]  synthetic biologists one of their top recommendations was to repeal my biological weapons
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.280]  anti-terrorism act because they knew that the whole purpose of synthetic biology
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:38.080]  funded by DARPA was to get into biological weapons by means of synthetic I totally agree
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.200]  but let me ask you this then what is the why roll the dice if they want to be able to forcibly
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.280]  inoculate us and then have trackers to you know to track to have a world id world social
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:52.640]  credit score we know that's part of the equation why go with an mrna vaccine that engages word
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.960]  has to be so strong it's going to hurt or kill 700 000 people that's a quote from that maniac
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.120]  I guess they just want the power now to kill people they want to just get used to
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.240]  you got to take this and some of you are going to die and a lot of you are going to get sick
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.480]  is it just all about raping us it's all about they want to be in our bodies because because
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.920]  these are going to be the most hated people in history now I mean already Klaus Schwab and
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.800]  Bill Gates are the most hated people in the world in global polls I mean I mean they have
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:26.320]  made themselves fabulously hated well Alex of course Gates went to Harvard too what could I say
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:36.960]  but Alex were you know if your listeners have a chance they can read Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:42.400]  Brave New World it's the two of them together that's what that is exactly what we are facing
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:48.480]  today as as human beings as the human right Huxley wrote Brave New World Revisited in 61
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.520]  before he died his speech is online it's an hour long at Berkeley he said it's these two books
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:00.720]  merged is the future we are that's where we are now that's exactly right this is what confronts
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:07.200]  us as human beings Alex and the reason I've appeared on your shows uh uh for over the last
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:15.200]  year now is is to give the best knowledge I have to encourage people to resist uh the the
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:24.080]  the end game that they have in mind is horrible uh we're talking about you know uh uh genocide
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:31.840]  uh we're talking about uh totalitarian dictatorship uh uh uh we'll become a slave race here this is a
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.880]  conquest of the human genome a conquest of reality by mad scientist playing god a final question I
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.240]  don't know if you saw Biden's bizarre speech his so-called joint session speech Wednesday but he
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.600]  said in that that anyone that disagrees with us basically is a white supremacist they call me one
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.680]  Tucker Carlson is preposterous they call everybody one that resists them liberal conservative that's
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:56.480]  their new go-to and he goes and if you're a white supremacist you are a terrorist and the CIA and
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.920]  the FBI will come after you well we've seen Nunez on the intelligence committee say we're having
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.680]  briefings on the main threat for the Pentagon and the CIA is now Americans well two weeks after he
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.240]  said that Biden said a bigger threat than al-qaeda and ISIS which you know they run
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:18.320]  is the American people so in law as a as a international lawyer and also a U.S. lawyer
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.160]  that's why it's prosecuted sloven melagovic you've been at the highest levels in the world this
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.080]  how big a rubicon crossing is this for you wrote books about it you gave speeches about it you sent
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:33.440]  me to speak today warning of when they set up this parallel thing where enemy combatants and
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:38.720]  you have no right we can torture you and kill you and blow up a whole wedding to kill one person
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:44.400]  it's so easy to flip a switch and turn the train on the people and now they're doing it and said
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.800]  they're gonna the FBI says they're gonna disrupt Trump networks well even if I didn't like Trump
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.280]  networks they have a right to operate but they see me as a main Trump network and they're saying
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:59.440]  we're going to disrupt Jones by name well we know what disrupt means I mean normally that when they
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.240]  say the Pentagon disrupts means they they send green berets to go kill people so so I mean the
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:10.000]  level of what they're doing and now it's confirmed what do you make of that well the most dangerous
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.400]  thing here Alex is that they are using all this rhetoric to promote the passage of a domestic
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:26.720]  terrorism statute and then that is what they're going to use to repress all dissent so my advice
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:34.640]  is for all of you listening out there now don't let them pass to everything humanly possible
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:43.600]  to prevent the passage of a domestic terrorism statute we have even after the anti-terrorism
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:52.160]  effective death penalty act of after the murrah bombing the feds had all the power they needed
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:59.360]  to go after anyone for acts of terrorism or anything else they needed the feds do not need
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:06.080]  more power than they already have and indeed the usa patriot act was the blueprint for for a
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:12.960]  an american police state and that's what we're living in today and to give you just an example
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:22.480]  here a few years ago two agents to the fbi and the cia came into my office and proceeded to
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:30.400]  interrogate me for one hour and tried to get me to become an informant on my arab and muslim clients
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:37.440]  which would have violated their uh constitutional rights and my ethical obligations as a lawyer
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:43.200]  so of course i refused they put me on all the united states government terrorist watch list
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:50.320]  as far as my lawyer has been able to determine i'm on all of them so uh alex i'm one step ahead
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.360]  of you as far as the united states government is concerned well exactly nick foyntez is like
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.760]  a mainline conservative they call him a white supremacist he wasn't even in the capital he's
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.760]  been put on a no-fly list now and then and they're saying they want me on a no-fly list
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:09.200]  so you said it it's and of course that brings me another question juliani say what about juliani
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:14.240]  he's the president's lawyer we now know that in the first impeachment and the second they were in
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:21.120]  his iCloud watching him in live time without even having a warrant then they raided his unprecedented
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.680]  a the president's lawyer raided by them obviously as a shot across the ballot against trump for
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.960]  folks that don't know even CNN admits this is unprecedented that they're going after people's
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:40.560]  right to counsel right they went after me both the FBI and the a cia tried to get me to become
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:47.120]  an informant for them on my clients right they have no respect the FBI is not your friend you
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:53.520]  have to understand that if the FBI comes to talk with you you should say fine i'll talk with you
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:58.400]  with my lawyer you should always bring a lawyer with you to talk to the FBI they are not your
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:05.360]  friends i can assure you that as far as the FBI is concerned i am an officially designated terrorist
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:11.360]  right unbelievable dr francis Boyle thank you so much professor for all your time extremely
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.800]  important historic interview and i'm going to finish some news after you leave we're going to
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.040]  air your great interview on the technicals of the Nuremberg code we're also going to post
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:24.800]  that authority notice as well in the live feed of this show so thank you so much dr Boyle
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:31.440]  well thanks Allison hey Allison again i'm very happy to be here since february since you've tried
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:38.880]  to you know get the message out about what's going on here and the need for people to organize and
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:48.720]  resist what obviously is going to be is developing is 1984 and brave new world together outright
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:54.560]  genocide and totalitarian dictatorship there's no question about it no doubt about it thank you
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:58.720]  dr Boyle there he goes i really appreciate him spending so much time with us on his busy saturday
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.680]  he teaches a lot of classes and more and appreciate his family letting us do that
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.560]  again i wouldn't even call him a whistleblower you call him that he was a major insider who never
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:12.960]  sold out the system and who just went past the grades did the stuff sat there and then they tried
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.400]  to hire him to be Kissinger's assistant and you know the rest of that i mean these people are out
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:26.000]  of control and all i know is they're crossing rubicons with me man you know i'm not an enemy
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.360]  of the fbi i'm not an enemy of the democratic party i'm sick of it i don't want to be in dc
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.320]  i don't want to be in la i don't want to be in the cool club and i'm not bragging when i say this but
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.320]  you know hollywood came to me and kept trying to put me in all these movies and
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.320]  give me all these tv shows until they finally said hey you figured it out yet we want you
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:52.000]  to knock it off and join us and they they even like hey you want to meet with an astronaut
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.960]  he'll tell you what's coming in the future and sure as hell that astronaut told me what
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:03.360]  would be on the future in a year and it happened that's the level that's the power trip they've got
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:09.920]  is that it's all been scripted out ladies and gentlemen but you it's empty and you've sold
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.040]  out when you're with them it doesn't have a good feeling and but other people just fall
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:22.960]  over themselves to join them and say oh it's you don't want money how about pain it's like in lord
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:28.480]  of the rings when saruman's talking to gandalf he goes join with me gandalf join with mordor
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.480]  and he goes are you insane he goes if you won't take the way of power then you will take the way
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.560]  of pain and in the real world that's an archetype of what this is like i mean you could put a gun to

[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:18.640]  back the bible says it's a foregone conclusion but that doesn't mean we're not supposed to stand
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:27.520]  up against it but i can tell you this it's our job to warn everybody metaphysically that's that's
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.880]  why god put us here those of us that are already awake the fact you're already tuned into the show
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:39.040]  means that god wants you to be a messenger an ambassador a oh what's the term you use when
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.280]  christians send out missionaries missionaries i mean you listen the fact that you're tuned in
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:48.080]  is great don't be depressed about this it means god's real good and evil is real this is a great
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:53.040]  contest of humanity's destiny and of course there's a scientific group that wants to control
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:56.880]  humans humans are amazing and beautiful and creative and there are bad people that want
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:02.480]  humans as slaves there are bad people that want to harness that and want that power trip and and
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.240]  they're going to tell you you're bad and you're sick and you're fallen so they can build you back
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:12.320]  up because they're trying to play god only god can have you be reborn and because you have that
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:17.520]  connection to god and the infinite they don't like that and they want to encapsulate you in a prison
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:23.840]  a prison planet they control and so i don't hate and i don't say this so they don't attack me i
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:29.040]  don't care about that i say it because i realize when i as a man get mad and get aggressive and
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.680]  get my feathers puffed up like a rooster that it only plays into the enemy's operation
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.640]  and if i have to defend my family i will i've got those capabilities but
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.280]  when i sit there and say you dumb globalist you dumb idiots in the street or you dumb
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:44.880]  government people that go along with this they're all just slaves like everybody else they're all
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.800]  just scared hacking through it acting like they know what's going on living in denial wanting to
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.880]  get the new car wanting to go on vacation wanting to take care of their sick kid not asking why
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:57.840]  their kid's sick or why their wife's sick or why they're sick and as it gets worse and worse people
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:03.680]  are gonna do more and more crazy stuff just trying to keep the ball rolling we've got to
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:09.920]  explain to people like a record skipping or a car wreck sound that it only gets better when you
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:14.880]  recognize we're on a poisonous trajectory that's destructive by design and when you get informed
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.160]  and when you get involved and when you know what you're talking about people all the time hear me
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.200]  talk on air they think this guy's just spouting stuff he doesn't know any of this stuff he's
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:27.520]  making it up or in lawsuits against us the lawyers always say the democrats where's the
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:34.880]  teleprompter who's writing this well research is writing this being committed to truth is writing
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.920]  this my brain is writing this minute to minute as it projects and understands the truth and interfaces
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:45.600]  and that's how i can interview people in secret government agencies of the military or the former
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.080]  heads of agencies and they ask how do you know that that's super classified or or even without
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:54.960]  with the stuff i knew i never saw the pieces how'd you know that and it's because i i that's all
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:33:01.120]  i do is study this folks and i know you've got great insights as well so share them and i know
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:05.280]  the average person goes oh you're showing off you're beating me over the head with that you

[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.920]  to test to see if they could do it a lot more because they think you're a dumb useless eater

[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:28.560]  spirit in me i resonate with the creator of the universe that tells me not to take advantage of

[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:43.520]  conversations my guest today returning for the second time is francis boil he's a professor of
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:52.720]  international law and he's the authority on covet 19 as a bioweapon he recently created a statement
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:36:00.560]  people can use to resist the covet 19 vaccine and this statement is based on the nuremberg principles
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:08.800]  francis welcome back to the show well regis thank you very much for having me on my best to your
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:18.640]  viewing audience and happy new year to everyone well you you published that statement that you
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:26.000]  gave people permission to republish and to share explain to me just exactly what it is
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.320]  right well regis as you know i've been giving continuous interviews on
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:44.160]  covet 19 since january 24 and i won't go through all that here because i gave you a very lengthy
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:55.680]  interview on that but uh starting then in the fall uh with these uh uh what so-called vaccines
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:02.000]  uh it's clear that uh they are existentially dangerous
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:09.680]  um and uh you know i won't go through all that here but uh the two we have
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:20.720]  pfizer bioentech and moderna uh are uh dna genetically engineered and they were funded
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:30.400]  by the pentagon darpa uh the defense defense uh advanced research uh project so i've been giving
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:37.600]  interviews uh against these uh vaccines as well i call them franken shots there's no other word
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:47.520]  for that and how uh dangerous they were so uh what happened was a lot of people in different
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:59.920]  stations in life contacted me and said can you give me something i can use uh to resist these
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:07.120]  shots these these franken shots from being uh forced to take them i've also been caught i've
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:13.600]  been contacted by by people in the u.s military about that we had the previous goal for syndrome
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:20.960]  this will be go for on steroids and i've also been contacted by health care workers who don't want to
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:26.640]  give these franken shots uh because they know they're existentially dangerous and as you know
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:35.200]  large numbers of health care workers are not taking them well all these requests happened
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:42.480]  in the fall but i was teaching a full-time course load and a lot of students and getting a new book
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:49.920]  out so i would just say look download the uh section from one of my interviews on your cell
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:39:01.280]  phone and use that well uh eventually i was ended for the semester uh got my grades in classes done
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:08.960]  spent some time with my family and then what happened was president-elect joe biden
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:20.880]  gave this speech where he said he is going to inject 100 million of these franken shots
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:33.840]  into 100 million americans in the first hundred days of his administration now this will be a
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:42.560]  total catastrophe it's already shaping up uh as a catastrophe even before uh as today trump is
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:53.680]  leaving office thank heavens for that um and at that point then i decided okay i had to respond
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:40:00.880]  to the requests that all these people had made to me to give them something that they could use
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:14.800]  so i sat down and drafted this notice that can be used for people to resist getting the franken shots
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:25.360]  or doctors health care workers health technicians pharmacists others to resist giving
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:32.400]  the franken shots so let me uh just go through it with you to explain it here
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:43.440]  i decided to keep it very short very succinct but hard hitting and to reduce it to
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:52.880]  its bare bones minimum so i entitled it notice with an exclamation point by authority of the
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:41:04.960]  nuremberg code on medical experimentation now this goes back to the doctors medical case at
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:16.800]  nuremberg where the german doctors were put on trial uh for all sorts of experimental uh
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:26.400]  uh uh techniques that they applied on on completely innocent uh human beings including
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:36.480]  especially jews as as we all know um and these uh uh doctors medical doctors um some of them
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:44.560]  were executed and as a result if you read through the entire judgment it's quite lengthy but you'll
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:52.880]  see all the terrible types of experiments that german doctors were were doing and procedures
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:59.600]  and drugs and everything else we're doing to people um and uh you know we we're all aware of
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:06.240]  dr mengala and what he did at auschwitz okay so everyone is aware of that but there were many other
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:14.080]  german doctors involved in this and the um judgment came up with what was called the
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:25.280]  nuremberg code on medical experimentation that set forth uh requirements for engaging in any type of
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:34.560]  experimental uh techniques or procedures or drugs or anything like that on human beings
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:43.920]  and this nuremberg judgment in particular and the nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:55.440]  became part of customary international criminal law now i had dealt with this once before
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:08.880]  in the uh defense of captain dr yolanda huett vaughan who was the highest ranking uh military
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:20.880]  officer in gulf war one by bush senior to refuse to give experimental medical vaccines for the
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:31.920]  biological warfare agents of anthrax and botulin because she correctly believed that these uh
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:41.680]  vaccines violated the nuremberg code on medical experimentation so she couldn't give them as well
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:49.200]  as i think there was a helsinki code and her ethical obligation as a doctor she took when she
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:56.160]  swore in the hypocritical do no harm and she was court-martialed for this
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:03.120]  among other things uh for desertion she did not desert i helped defend her
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:11.680]  and uh at her uh court-martial we argued the nuremberg code on medical experiment
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:22.960]  experimentation on her defense um and uh you know it's very tough situation now she was given a uh
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:32.480]  kangaroo court-martial proceeding down at uh fort leonard wood uh in missouri uh and i won't go
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:39.680]  through it all here she was facing five years uh but at the end of the kangaroo court proceeding
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:50.480]  um she got about oh i would say three years and they took her away in um chains
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:58.640]  uh to fort leavenworth where they stuck her in medium security a little bitty woman um
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.680]  well at that time i was on the board of directors of amnesty international and i got her immediately
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:12.960]  adopted a prisoner of conscience by amnesty international and i think due to amnesty's
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:21.360]  efforts uh they got her we all got her sentence cut down to uh 14 months and then i got her out of
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:30.400]  leavenworth after eight months now in the course of this court-martial both in the article 32
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:36.000]  hearing and then in the court-martial itself we went through the applicability of the nuremberg
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:44.560]  code on medical experimentation to these uh biological warfare uh frankenschatz for anthrax
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:51.040]  and botulin went through the whole thing so i was completely familiar and by the way these
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:46:02.080]  these first frankenschatz led to the go for syndrome for us troops that out of about
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:06.640]  and these are just estimates because the pentagon is still lying and covering it up
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:17.920]  out of about 500,000 troops were inoculated uh 100,000 were disabled and 11,000 were killed
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:28.800]  and these were healthy young men and women in u.s armed forces so you can imagine then
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:39.680]  what these uh uh new uh uh biological warfare agent uh vaccines frankenschatz are going to do
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:47.280]  uh especially to the uh elderly senior citizens etc and we're seeing
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:55.600]  them being killed right now as we speak they're in norway 23 of them died they were killed um
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:06.240]  now at the end of the uh kangaroo court-martial we had a press conference with uh the uh actress uh
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:15.200]  margo kidder introducing me to to the media and we had satellite dishes there um and i said that
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:24.880]  bush senior colin powell cheney schwartzkopf had all inflicted a nuremberg crime
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:32.320]  on our own troops in violation of nuremberg code on medical experimentation that went out
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:38.160]  nationwide i was told by a lawyer who was at the white house at the time that they heard me and
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:47.600]  they were all shaken up well later on senator uh j rockefeller held hearings uh on these uh
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:54.000]  frankenschatz the first ones and he came out and said the exact same thing i had said that they had
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.440]  bush and the rest of them had violated the nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:07.120]  and had committed a nuremberg crime on our own troops you can read about that
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:16.240]  in my book uh bio warfare and terrorism and the write-up of my defense on captain hewitt vaughan
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:24.640]  is in my book destroying uh world order so that all being said with that background
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:34.080]  i realized that uh what we were going to have here was the gulf war syndrome on steroids
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:43.520]  especially for the people targeted i mean this is basically the nazi philosophy of useless eaters
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:54.000]  so i put this uh uh together this notice on the basis of that experience litigation experience
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:01.280]  that i had previously dealing with these issues and understand regis i'm not part of any anti-vax
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:08.160]  movement i i you know i'm agnostic on that they can do what they want on that i've been attacked
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:16.880]  and disparaged saying well you're an anti-vaxxer i am not my specialty is vaccines alleged vaccines
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:27.360]  dealing with biological warfare agents which covid is and for anthrax and botulin was that's how i
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:35.200]  first got involved here so i started out by saying by the authority of the nuremberg code on medical
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:41.840]  experimentation now that's a lot of background just for the beginning there but i didn't want
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:48.400]  to scholarly write a scholarly treatise here or a law review article i wanted something that
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:56.640]  ordinary people could read and understand okay and the word nuremberg there you know that that
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:04.240]  i would think most people would have a general idea uh that the united states the soviet union
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:11.120]  uh france and britain prosecuted nazis at nuremberg so that people could understand the
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:20.640]  severity of the situation then i continue i do hereby exercise my right under the nuremberg
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:30.880]  code to refuse to submit so that people who were contacting me and saying i need something to
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:38.880]  prevent taking these frankenschatz they would have it and you know large numbers of employers
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:43.680]  are telling people now we have to have these frankenschatz and i've given them something
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:51.840]  that they can use to say no i'm not taking them indeed you know i just heard from a active duty
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:57.760]  military guy uh yesterday on this and i sent it to him he said thank you he's going to use it
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:05.920]  because they're giving it to people now in the military and then the second prong uh refused
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:18.320]  to submit or to administer so that health care personnel can use it uh doctors nurses
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:25.520]  health care workers medical technicians as you know even here in the united states they're having
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:32.400]  pharmacies uh do this pharmacists and they're even hiring other people to do it we don't even know
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:40.720]  what their qualifications are so i i did it two-prong so that it can be used by health care
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:49.120]  workers like dr huett vaughan to say i'm not going to inject human beings with this nazi
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:56.720]  franken shot and i've already heard from health care workers thanking me saying this is exactly
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:04.480]  what i want i'm going to use and i will circulate it uh to to my fellow health care uh workers
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:16.160]  then you know uh i wanted to make it clear how serious this was this wasn't a joke it isn't a
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:27.440]  fraud and i wanted to shake up anyone who was reading this notice that one of my clients i
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:37.520]  guess you would put it would give uh to their employer and so i said the united states government
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:46.240]  has prosecuted convicted and executed medical doctors who violated the nuremberg code on
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:54.960]  medical experimentation yes that is correct you can read the medical doctor's judgment
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:05.360]  you should be able to find it online and at the end of the judgment they have the uh sentences of
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:15.120]  the uh convicted and several of these doctors were sentenced to death now what um really got me
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:24.160]  was that i heard from a medical doctor saying sentenced to death you must be exaggerating
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:32.080]  and that undercuts the significance of everything you're saying and my response was obviously
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:40.320]  you were never required to read the nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:48.640]  in medical school because if you did you would know in fact medical doctors were
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:58.560]  sentenced to death and executed and this shows i think the problems with medical school education
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:06.160]  today and i'm not here uh uh to say the the legal profession is much better being a law professor
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:15.680]  since 1978 and entered harvard law school in 1971 but at least we made a concerted effort to reform
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:26.320]  teaching ethics uh to students but if you read the news media everywhere in print on tv everywhere
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:34.800]  you see all these doctors advocating these nazi frankenschutz it's astounding and it's very clear
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:45.680]  that in medical school they were never required to read the nuremberg uh medical doctor's case
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:52.640]  let alone the nuremberg code on medical experimentation and it just shows you that that
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:58.720]  medical doctors certainly here in the united states uh have not been properly trained
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:08.800]  in medical ethics and are not aware of what the standards are dr hewitt vaughan was but i regret
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:18.800]  to report uh at that time she was the only doctor in the you know entire united states military
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:26.720]  doctors corps and nurses corps and medical technician corps who refused to give out
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:36.240]  the those nazi frankenschutz so we're seeing the abject failure of the medical profession here in
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:46.000]  the united states certainly to train medical doctors in accordance with appropriate ethical
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:56.080]  standards here and i would say the same thing for the so-called life scientists uh who you know get
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:06.800]  their phds in the life science industry just look at how many of them have come out and advocated
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:13.200]  these nazi frankenschutz in violation of the nuremberg code on medical experimentation
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:22.560]  and there you know i do have a first-hand experience uh i had you know i had three degrees
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:32.080]  at harvard and i had friends and teachers at harvard uh at least three of them who were three
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:42.720]  of the most ethical and principled human beings i ever knew in the world and of course they taught
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:53.680]  their qehd candidates to be ethical um what happened everywhere else where are the life
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:57:04.160]  scientists saying the nuremberg code on medical experimentation prohibits these covid-19 nazi
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:18.240]  frankenschutz then i added a third sentence just to deal uh with others that is not not the the
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:27.760]  potential victims or the health care workers but others uh assisting for example i i had a person
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:34.320]  saying well what what do i tell if a police officer comes and forces me uh to take one of
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:44.400]  these these shots so i added a third sentence aiders and abetters of nuremberg crimes are
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:54.160]  equally guilty and have also been prosecuted convicted and executed and that is a correct
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:58:06.000]  statement of law uh regis that goes back to the zyclone b case where uh zyclone b the trade name
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:15.360]  for prussic acid uh was originally used by the ss in concentration camps to exterminate vermin
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:24.080]  and then the ss decided to try it out to exterminate human beings and as we know
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:33.520]  large numbers of jews but others as well um and uh the uh uh owner and the uh chief operating
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:41.040]  officer and another fellow were prosecuted at nuremberg in the zyclone b case and two of them
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:48.000]  were found guilty of aiding and abetting nuremberg crimes war crimes and they were sentenced to death
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:59:01.120]  and executed so i drafted this little statement for the purpose of being used by people who either
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:10.640]  did not want to take these shots or did not want to give these shots and to shake up anyone who
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:19.360]  would force them to take these shots or to give these shots or any other way aid in or abet them
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:28.560]  now others have said well what if this doesn't work well at that point what i i say is you've
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:37.440]  got to get yourself a lawyer then in the jurisdiction where you live and try to use
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:46.320]  these arguments uh either to prevent getting the shot or prevent giving the shot and that all
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:56.320]  depends on the uh health laws of the states in the union in the united states and yeah first i'm not
[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:02.720]  licensed to practice law in all of them i only licensed to practice law in one of them uh and
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:10.160]  there are a variety of laws so you'll need to get yourself a lawyer if it push comes to shove my
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:20.960]  warning doesn't work and work out with that lawyer uh an appropriate defense based upon using the
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:28.480]  my warning my notice here under the applicable health care laws in that state for example
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:37.920]  california has adopted the nuremberg code on medical experimentation it's in there so i don't
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:46.240]  have time to you know research 50 states of union or anything like that uh i did have take the time
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:53.520]  to to draft this uh uh notice for people to use and then i tell them for a follow-up and get get
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:01:01.520]  a local lawyer and i'm happy to work with you know your local lawyer uh based upon what your
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:07.840]  health care law says there your health care laws there are a variety of laws in many states uh and
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:18.400]  see if we can we can use the nuremberg code on medical experimentation wow francis um i was
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:25.040]  going to ask how effective can this be if an ordinary person or an ordinary health care person
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:32.560]  or even a police officer how effective they can be just knowing about this notice that you wrote
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:42.720]  knowledge is power regis and that's why i circulated this all over the internet
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:50.560]  um for people to use yes well i'm gonna i'm gonna post it on in this particular interview
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:57.920]  but i want to know uh could i have your permission to put your contact information your email address
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:03.920]  in case lawyers or doctors or anybody wants to contact you for some kind of guidance
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:11.440]  sure i i've been giving this guidance all along yes yeah but i'm just understand i i'm just
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:18.720]  understand i'm just at the start of this process i because for the reasons indicated uh i didn't
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:26.960]  feel compelled to draft this notice until joe biden president-elect biden announced that he
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:34.880]  was going to inject a hundred million of these frankenshots into a hundred million completely
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:42.880]  innocent americans in a hundred days we have a uh i believe a humanitarian catastrophe on
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:51.840]  our hands here this is what motivated me to act um and uh uh fortunately uh uh to your credit
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:59.680]  you're the first person who has given me an interview on this matter and so i would hope
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:08.080]  bridges that you could take this interview uh i gave you and circulate it all over the internet
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:18.720]  because uh this uh notice is valid anywhere in the world where people are contemplating
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:27.520]  these frankenshots it is drawn up under international criminal law that applies
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:35.360]  anywhere in the world these arguments apply if you do not want to give the frankenshots
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:45.040]  or take the frankenshots yes so people all across the planet all across europe and and thousands
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:53.040]  are resisting this they will be able to use this statement as well obviously um yeah i would
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:04:00.320]  recommend it be it be translated i mean they say english is a universal language but being of
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:07.520]  french ancestry i know the french certainly disagree uh so i i would recommend it be you
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:14.960]  know translated uh in into different languages but i regret to say uh i used to have conversational
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:21.120]  friends at french and it's uh i didn't i was involved in so many anti-war activities i
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:28.960]  couldn't keep it up so what can i say well it definitely needs to be translated uh uh into uh
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:34.960]  french maybe you could do that right just for me well we can we can certainly make an appeal to
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:41.840]  people to do that you know the show we did last month on covet 19 is a bioweapon has been seen
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:50.480]  almost 60 600 times on my youtube channel i have no idea where else it's it's spread but i'm hoping
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:58.640]  that this show uh will will attract many many more people as i think it is so important people who
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:05.440]  are terrified and afraid all over the world and many people are unwittingly just lining up and
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:11.200]  begging to have the shot uh you know well aegis but let me let me say that please understand
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:21.920]  you are the first person in the media who has had this interview and so there is a responsibility
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:28.400]  on your part to get it out as widely as possible i know you'll do that that's why i've given it
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:34.160]  to you yes i i haven't given this interview to anyone else just you well i appreciate that
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:40.640]  francis my advice would be don't take these things but do take this quite seriously
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:48.560]  social distancing uh mask washing your hands yes all those things must be done
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:56.960]  well francis i i can't thank you enough for the time you've offered to me and i'm i'm really
[02:05:56.960 --> 02:06:01.600]  kind of happy that i'm the first one you've given this interview to and you can count on me
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:08.320]  to do everything everything in my power to get this out as widely and broadly as possible so

[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:33.680]  regis and again thank you so much for taking the time to to do this interview and get the message
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:45.600]  out
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:13.600]  so
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:21.520]  i've always had a drive and a push to resist tyranny since i was a little kid i didn't like
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:28.880]  bullies and sometimes i might have beat him up a little too bad and that's my fault but i grew out
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:37.600]  of that but i've never had a sense of urgency like i have now my sense of urgency is like
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:45.280]  10 times what it's ever been and in my gut but also at an intellectual level
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:53.600]  at a political analysis level i know we have a chance to lessen how bad this globalist
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:59.040]  takeover attempt is going to be and the nature of evil is it doesn't stop it wants more more more
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:02.240]  it's like that uh
[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:06.640]  song money power glory
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:14.960]  maybe we'll end the show today with that and where the line is i'm going to take you for everything
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:19.040]  you got well they don't want to just take the money from you they want to take your genetics
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:24.320]  they want to rape you they want to mark you they want to dominate you that's what real evil is all
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:31.280]  about and again i'll say it because the average person is not wanting power and wanting to control
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:37.360]  people like a megalomaniac you have a blind spot you have a place that you can't see
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:43.120]  and i get that you keep wanting to not believe this hell i didn't want to believe this
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:46.240]  when it was theoretical and the globalists were just beta testing it on
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:52.400]  disadvantaged people but i'm not stupid they want to make us all disadvantaged
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:58.880]  and so i don't do this because i'm some loving guy worried that they're killing all the africans
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:02.720]  i mean as a human i have built in circuitry where i do feel for them
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:09.760]  but that circuitry because i know i'm next
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:15.440]  i had that emotion because my my head screwed on straight my i come from good people
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.840]  and i had experiences in life through nature that that triggered me to realize this
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:26.320]  other people have been confused since birth don't know where they are so i don't care if you're a
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:31.760]  poor person that's white a poor person's black a rich person whoever you are if you have a connection
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.520]  to god and you want justice and freedom then god loves you and you're god's child and i want to
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:41.200]  god's child and i want to protect you and i want protection too we need each other
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:46.880]  but so many people go oh well that's just happening to the third world
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:54.160]  remember when bill gates i got to find this clip where they were trying to find out the other day
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:59.120]  it was like a 13 months ago or so he was on japanese tv and they said mr gates
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:02.960]  because it was in english they go it's like a business channel they go there is talk that the
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:09.360]  vaccines will be tainted and more will cause infertility or for depopulation he goes oh well
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:12.960]  there'll be different vaccines for different parts of the world such an incredible clip i've
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.280]  been able to find it since then but he was telling him hey don't worry it's not for you
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:20.160]  and something like three percent of japanese have taken the shot they're not stupid
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.560]  but see japan doesn't have an overpopulation problem they're 1.3
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.400]  for every two adults 1.3 children are had japanese are dying out
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:36.160]  and and if you don't have a slight population increase society's collapsed well that's the
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:41.280]  post-industrial world great reset that's its plan and so here's what i'm trying to say
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:47.440]  people that are pretending they're part of the power structure and people that are pretending
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.360]  that oh just because you're like yeah there are too many people okay big deal
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:56.560]  you're going to be in the crosshairs you are in the crosshairs
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:03.680]  liken it to an island and the water's coming up and you're 20 foot your your house is 20 foot
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:09.440]  cliffs and other people are built down two feet from the beach and you see them flooding but if
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:12.720]  the water is going to raise all the way up to where you're at as well you've got just as big
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:16.560]  a problem so you shouldn't be sitting there laughing at them so i'm speaking directly to
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.800]  the sociopaths and directly to the psychos and others and i don't know there's any reason them
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:28.400]  but i you know i try to reach the general public but they are just like children
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:33.440]  suffer the little children
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.000]  i just have studied this so long i've been around it i've been inside it
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:43.440]  and i i'm just warning you ladies and gentlemen that
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:48.560]  i know why you don't want to hear this because i don't want to hear it but
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.360]  this is the biggest salt this is just the beginning it's not going to get any better
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.880]  after this until the globalists their whole program are scrapped and defeated and stopped and
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:59.680]  this whole malthusian mindset that goes back to plato
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:02.880]  2300 years ago
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:12.560]  is only going to get worse and that's the positive news i have like i started the broadcast at least
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:17.520]  you know the truth at least you are dialed in at least you are giving me information i'm giving
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:23.120]  you information we're we're watching we're aware of the problem and i'm a strong guy i'm not a guy
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:30.240]  that lives in fear but i also have a survival instinct and every instinct i've got is sell
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:37.520]  everything in the city and then haul ass to the most remote middle of nowhere place there is
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:41.440]  and and try to take some friends and family so we've got a big enough group to defend ourselves
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:45.440]  but you know they're just going to send drones and troops and kill anybody that's trying in the
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.360]  future but we're not able to do that you're going to have to organize and you're going to have to
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:54.800]  try to stop this head on uh and not just wait for them to come dig you out somewhere i mean i i mean
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:13:00.240]  i've definitely everybody i know is moving a distance away from the city of the camp
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:12.000]  but man man i mean you can see all the different scenarios that are going to be happening
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.680]  together at the same time and it's
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.960]  it's going to be spectacular and the globalists enjoy this like like you like watching a football
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.400]  game or a hockey game or whatever you like watching people beat each other up with uh
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:31.840]  hockey sticks globalists like watching you starve to death they like watching big wars and burning
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.760]  cities and hydrogen bombs going off they like watching people bleeding out their eyes and ears
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:38.960]  and ass with weaponized Ebola and that's what they're getting ready for you
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:47.680]  you know back when the fbi wasn't completely globalist dr eric pianka the head of the biology
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:53.040]  department at ut said soon airborne Ebola will be released and we'll kill 90 of the earth and i
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.040]  told my family we're all ready to die for the earth and he also pledged himself to lucifer on
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.840]  his website and i said the fbi to visit him the fbi went to him and said are you and do you have
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:06.640]  any bioweapons because that's a normal thing when a guy's in a biology lab that's level four access
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:11.760]  access to galveston's level four bioweapons lab you might want to ask the guy that wants
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:15.520]  to kill everybody or says he can't wait for everybody dies if you know he's planning anything
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.640]  but that's not the story the story was in the local newspaper in houston
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:25.920]  when he projected skulls with a red background up and said soon we'll all die it's gonna be
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:31.360]  beautiful that there was a three minute standing ovation i had witnesses that were there they told
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:38.000]  me even more in the paper standing ovation crying when he said we've got to kill everybody they all
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.040]  began like i have a demonic celebration and we're because they're demon possessed they're getting
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:48.000]  off on we're in a meeting we're the scientists we're the smart ones and we're going to kill
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:53.200]  everybody and pianka the head of the ut biological department who dresses up in druid robes and says
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:57.760]  he likes lucifer he's telling us we're going to kill everyone and that gives us demonic energy
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:04.080]  the same energy of killing a child killing the future i mean this is a thrill to them to announce
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:09.040]  as adherents to the world we will kill everybody
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:16.560]  and they're all like weird little chicken neck liberals all
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:20.480]  oh little potbelly liberals you know just oh and they love it it's oh
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:30.320]  and so a lot of doctors are great a lot of doctors are good but a good portion of them
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:35.600]  are crazy control freaks and i had that medical doctor on who was amazing friday
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:40.720]  but day and and i i said hey we went to medical school did you ever run into people like this
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:45.600]  that like got off in the experimental laboratories basically killing people and she said yeah i ran
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.400]  into some of that because i mean who do you think works in a research hospital who do you think can
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:56.720]  be around stuff that scared any horror movie i mean to describe something for you where people
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.880]  sign on for quote science i know i'm going to die i'm not two weeks from his cancer do whatever
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:05.280]  you want to be a lot of folks are like that people don't just give their bodies of medical
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:10.800]  experiments you know when they die they do it before they die and my dad was there and he
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:16.000]  thought he was joining nasa in high school when he was a sophomore was not joining nasa
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:22.000]  and he went down to md anderson he told me i was kidding he goes yeah some of these scientists you
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.760]  got to watch them you know don't sign your organ donor card some of the hospitals in dallas will
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:29.680]  kill you for your organs if you're in a car wreck later dallas was listed as one was killing people
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:36.480]  on 60 minutes they told me about the stuff like like again the description was people's tongues
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:42.800]  wagging out of their necks saliva running down them old ladies uh old men cigarettes the missing
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:47.040]  mandibles he'd say don't smoke cigarettes so you don't have a missing mandible you know where they
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:51.360]  cut everything off the cancer and then and then and then these people are sitting there and then
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:55.520]  and then these bad scientists he said would just come in and like people signed forms like inject
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:58.480]  them with like plutonium they'd inject him in the doctor when he would do it would go
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.960]  my dad would make the face like doing it so when you see bill gates that's who he is you understand
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:16.800]  and my dad thought well that's just md anderson then he goes to ut in high school and it was all
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:22.160]  the same stuff and all they talked about was world government how they're going to kill everybody
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:30.080]  and he didn't tell me that until 2007 when he saw the raw cut of ngan that hadn't come out yet
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.760]  so that it's not that my dad's even that exceptional this is wide
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:42.160]  spread there's probably 10 million people in the us that are consciously part of this okay
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:50.080]  that's why a lot of research scientists won't even talk to the gardener or even talk to their
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:54.400]  neighbors and they hate everyone i've been around research scientists had friends in college and
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:57.600]  high school research scientists and now i like dial back remember how they wouldn't even talk
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:03.440]  to their own kids because they're part of the elite you see they're they're very insect-like
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:08.480]  very reptoid-like very that's who they are they believe in survival of the fittest and they're
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.120]  going to kill you and your family and and they believe you're not going to be able to stop them
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:21.760]  so again i say to the people that serve the system the military the police all of you well that's a
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:26.880]  whole other report i'm going to get you tomorrow well the daily caller got a video that was that
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:33.680]  they shot openly of the uh class because everything's you know remote and it's the
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:38.160]  liberals saying we don't want police police are inherently bad and evil but they never talk about
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:52.080]  the feds oh no no it's just it's just the local police which they want control of and she says
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:57.520]  we shouldn't be able to have a gun and we shouldn't have the police all we need is the
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:05.680]  feds you see which means the un these people have no logic they have no nothing and don't worry the
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:08.640]  police are being taken over by the globalists all over the world they're running the illegal
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:13.360]  lockdowns most of the police will take you to a death camp in liberal areas because they've
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:20.400]  gotten control and gotten injustifies the means people in charge but those aren't the police that
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:25.600]  the left wants to get rid of the left just wants to control of the police i'll i'm gonna play that
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:32.160]  tomorrow on the sunday show four to six pm i need to move along here because i'm definitely talking
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.640]  a lot let's just let's just let's just play a few more of these clips here well let me do this
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:43.520]  because the producer just reminded me of this um if you don't find this we won't be here and you
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:47.600]  won't have this groundbreaking type information that nobody else covers nobody else understands
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:52.720]  at this level and believe me my job is to get people up to this level and past it and there's
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:57.840]  still nobody out there performing at this level other than like tucker carlson and i mean performing
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:02.160]  not jose mitzi's a performance artist i mean performing like a race car engine or a or a gun
[02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:09.920]  or an idea no one is is laying it out like this other than us and other people are starting to
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:13.200]  get it there's a lot of other great folks to understand it that's wonderful it's just there's
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:19.040]  nothing this big and this important and i don't want to be in that position i want to be made
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:23.280]  obsolete and defeat the globalists but that's not where we are we need to stay on air so i need you
[02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.000]  to fund us the film in-game blueprint for global enslavement predicted all this it's evergreen
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.960]  you can buy them for as low as 395 apiece when you buy them in bulk one copy is 14.95 get it
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:37.600]  make copies share it it has a zero country code it works anywhere in the world it would sell a
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:43.040]  lot of them to make money because i thought a lot of folks would buy them at 14.95 or 9.95 you know
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:49.600]  one copy 14.95 more copies 9.95 but only everybody's buying it for 395 and getting 10 copies
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:55.040]  which is great i've already gotten 20,000 out the door but then it doesn't fund the operation at the
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:59.920]  level it would if they sold most of them at you know 9.95 we'd make you know eight nine bucks at
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:04.400]  ebd to fund the operation i'm not complaining but we're gonna have to end that sale very very soon
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:10.000]  because i need to fund my operation i'm gonna just jack it the price up to 9.95 soon which is still
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.640]  a great deal it's a three-hour film it's seminal and it funds the whole operation but that's what's
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:19.680]  going to happen if i take advantage of that and separately um this is selling out but i'm still
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:23.920]  keeping it discounted vitamin mineral fusion all the vitamins all the minerals amino acids

[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:20.800]  hell i keep talking i'll be on the sunday show at 4 p.m i'll just be here for 14 hours but let's go
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:24.720]  ahead and go to these clips i was mentioning about the great reset because they're telling
[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:29.520]  you at the un the head of the who who ran a giant genocide in his own african country they're
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:34.400]  telling you on the news this never ends the vaccine's only part of it you get tracker codes
[02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:40.320]  you you wear a mask it never stops it is a permanent emergency earlier we played Klaus Schwab
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:47.600]  saying the same thing so here's 19 and 20 here it is there will be another crisis it will be more
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:53.680]  significant and you know we need to actually start preparing for that now when we do see this next
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:24:02.560]  crisis it will be faster than what we've seen with covid the exponential growth rate will climb
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:11.520]  be much steeper the impact will be greater and as a result the economic and social implications will
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:18.320]  be even more significant vaccine would be essential for bringing the pandemic under control which is
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:26.640]  why who proposed the act accelerator but it's important to emphasize that a vaccine will
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:35.680]  complement the other tools we have not replace them a vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic
[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:43.200]  surveillance will need to continue people will still need to be tested isolated and cared for
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  contacts will still need to be traced and quarantined communities will still need to
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:56.800]  be engaged and individuals will still need to be careful we still have a long road to travel
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:04.400]  what a scumbag he is a admitted marxist lennonist and he also helped cover up a million cholera
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:09.360]  deaths in his own country ethiopia and covered it up and he's anti-christian so that's why the
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:16.240]  chai koms have him as their minion and the guy before that uh is uh jeremy jurgens managing
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:23.760]  director of the world economic forum so the number two to clausch schwab isn't that just disgusting
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:30.880]  okay let me go through some of the covid 19 info to me this is the biggest news of the week public
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:37.600]  health administrator and we went and looked at something professor yale 60 of new covid 19
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:41.360]  patients have received a vaccine meaning they're really just sick from the vaccine they're calling
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:46.480]  it covered 19 and i found other news documenting that seeing an analyst says white house should
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:50.960]  tell americans the moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated that's called being held
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:56.960]  kidnapped that's called being a hostage it's time to start shunning the vaccine hesitant they're
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.560]  blocking covid herd immunity oh yes so the covid vaccine doesn't work it's our fault we haven't
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:08.240]  taken it total lies total fraud it's not even a vaccine lies on top of lies cdc studies break
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:13.760]  through covid cases among people already vaccinated mpr oh it's not working don't worry though that's
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:17.360]  why they already told you it'll be five to ten shots a year it's already been pre-planned people
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:20.400]  are saying how did jones know this how did jones know this how did jones know this because it was
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:27.200]  all in the documents moderna ceo will need booster vaccine shots against covid starting in the fall
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:32.000]  in just four or five months see oh doesn't even last two months it's all doesn't last ever
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:39.040]  it's a lie you need permanent mrna for the safe from the cold virus and all it does is lower your
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:42.800]  own immunity they make you have huge autoimmune responses to regular cold viruses and then you're
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:50.480]  in the hospital then they make more money when the head of the who at the un talks about getting the
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:57.040]  getting the virus under control he means you you're the virus getting you under control
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:03.840]  we will need surveillance on the virus and they're cutting off resources everywhere
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:08.480]  starving millions but it's okay because he's black he's like i'm black i'm murdering you
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:13.040]  tim cook's gay run death camps well i'm black oh that's even better oh you're black well
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:19.200]  then kill even more that's right bombshell 60 of new covid patients are vaccinated wow
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:30.480]  this date on mask versus unmasked schools will be ignored by the mass cult oh yeah then biden has
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:37.840]  extended the back of the mask emergency oh my gosh wow wow cdc.gov only wants to examine post
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:43.920]  vaccine infections with a pcr test at 28 or under so that they won't be positive but when they
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:48.400]  wanted to show a high number they turned it up to 40 or 45 now they want to show the number went
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:52.880]  down they turn it down to 28 and so when you've had the vaccine they don't want to show that you
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:57.840]  still have covid because you really don't uh it's just you just have rna in you and so now they turn
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:04.000]  it down that's how lying by statistics works why did bill gates pose with the book lying by
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.480]  statistics on his desk last month and have it circulated because he likes to rub it in and enjoy
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:14.640]  it majority of us companies will require workers to provide proof of vaccination it's not even a
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:20.240]  vaccination it's an experimental mrna gene therapy you need to sue them and explain to them this
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:24.960]  isn't even a regular vaccine has its own problems and make them sign a form that if you get hurt
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:29.920]  they're going to pay for you the rest of your life they won't do it it's all a hoax notice they say
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:35.600]  they're looking to do it it's all to stampede you normalizing the abnormal from we're not planning
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:41.760]  covid passports to they may be needed long term in three easy months to now saying they will be

[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:18.400]  so instead of three thousand five hundred deaths do that times a hundred and then it just goes on
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.520]  hospitalizations eight thousand urgent care sixteen thousand office visits nineteen thousand from
[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:30.400]  adverse reactions and it goes on and on traveling this summer federal mask mandates extended

[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:42.800]  even vaccines it's experimental gene therapy which is why the pentagon didn't make it mandatory

[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:36.800]  mp modi speaks about the new world order in great reset how much money that america's billionaires
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:42.480]  have made during the pandemic they've doubled or tripled their profits because they're essential
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:50.000]  and you're not that's your basic dictatorship then i want to play this clip of this young lady
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.280]  because we played trudeau talking about how they're going to put troops on the streets
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:57.120]  and it's confirmed they've got chinese troops all over canada he says he wants a dictatorship
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:06.640]  by canada but here she is locked up dealing with all of this and i forget which clip this is
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:12.400]  clip six woman in canada breaks down what's going on and she just is hearing what's going on she
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:16.640]  just knows she's locked in her house she's under martial law but she's just hearing this see we
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.520]  can show you the documents we had the folks that did the foyer and got the documents they think
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:25.600]  by accident they gave them to them about the tens of thousands of chinese troops now the military
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:30.320]  say they're taking over that's just the canadian military don't listen to them gg pings our friend
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:34.480]  now dare this woman not like being locked down for over a year here is this thought criminal i'm
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:39.120]  sure she'll be in a death camp soon i've had a lot of american followers message me and ask
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:43.920]  me what the hell is going on i do live in ontario so i am living in the strictest lockdowns in the
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:48.800]  world um the only time we can leave our houses if we're going to get groceries or if you're an
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:52.240]  essential worker obviously me being a photographer i'm not an essential worker so if you're a small
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:56.320]  business owner you basically either been bankrupt or they're giving you minimal to live on and when
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:03.200]  i say minimal they give us 900 every three weeks now in canada that doesn't go far rent here cheap
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:09.840]  for a crappy ass apartment is like 1200 a month um so we are barely barely hanging on um
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:16.160]  so yeah like when we go to walmart we can't buy anything for our kids we can't you know buy books
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:21.280]  or toys or anything like that so that's what it's like to live in canada right now and apparently
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:26.240]  there's a ton of chinese troops now here so and you can't go to church though sweetheart
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:32.560]  well you'll be dead soon it's all right a lot of swab needs room stop submitting stop giving in
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:36.960]  stop bowing down your submission is why your lockdown will never end because canadians are
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:41.680]  so nice they intend to have texas phase into this in a few years and places like south dakota and
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:46.640]  florida but they've got to get the real bioweapon ready which is the vaccine and now they've got
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:51.440]  to cover up it's an exercise of covering up how much debt they cause then they'll put more deadly
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:55.920]  stuff in the next vaccines if they get away with you know killing 10 of people with this vaccine
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:00.000]  the next couple years and people go along with that well hell we already autism their kids we
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.600]  already killed 10 million people 21 people in the us well hell let's kill 100 million
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:11.600]  you understand climate change means killing humans climate change means giving schumer total
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:16.480]  control over your life you know what i'm gonna do there's so much on the great reset i'm gonna
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:22.080]  cover this tomorrow and the cyber polygon how they're gonna crash the economy that's their next
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:26.240]  big move this is the cover for them crashing the economy and consolidating it they actually
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:34.080]  admit all of that so guys leave my stacks all here and when i come back at 4 p.m tomorrow on
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:40.800]  the sunday show we're gonna have four hours of live radio tv now we also have sunday live i'm
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:45.680]  going to cover all of this what we're going to do right now and we're going to air these back to
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:53.840]  back they're all incredibly important is we're going to play fauci behind wuhan covid 19 leak
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:58.480]  washington post reporter told joe rogan and the fact that they're trying to not joe isn't but
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:02.080]  the reporter's trying to cover for obama but the fact is it's coming out but what boils said 14
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:06.480]  months ago here on air and then we're going to have here comes the purge great new interview
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:12.000]  with larry pinkney that uh mcgreen did it's nine minutes long and then we've got also total proof
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:16.480]  that joe biden has dementia and is a puppet you need to share this video it's the latest update
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:21.680]  it's the most powerful one out there that we've seen so there's those three reports we're going
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:30.080]  to end this transmission uh that's going to be uh airing at six o'clock central standard time
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:36.400]  and it's going to re-loop until i go on at 4 p.m tomorrow this infrastructure that we've built
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:42.800]  is the only network radio and tv that's actually on stations that actually has a huge audience
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:47.520]  that is still around we're it and so remember everything here is our own infrastructure radio
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:52.160]  satellites tv satellites the encoders the bandwidth they they've had companies come through
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:57.520]  and scan everything we've got we've had hundreds of suppliers software groups come and say you
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:02.240]  can't even use our software we've paid for i mean we we and i'm not complaining it's okay we're
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:06.640]  going to fight until the end and now they're like okay we can't shut you down we're going to kill
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:11.840]  you well okay we're all dead anyways you guys your families are dead too dumbasses so fire away just
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:15.920]  you know i'm not going to resist just try to get a couple clean head shots i'm ready to go up to see
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:20.320]  the big guy i'm not going to commit suicide i don't want to die i love life so much i love my
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:26.480]  children but i am already with god i mean i am i am in a war i'm right where i want to be and don't
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:30.560]  be violent folks they're the ones attacking us it's information warfare they want to trick us
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.080]  into being violent offensively so that they can try to shut us down so that we can't peacefully
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:41.440]  defend against these murderers wait till the military learns that the vaccines are killing
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:46.000]  most of them like just like last time wait till all the feds start dropping dead from their own
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:51.600]  masters and they're asking why wait we're going to win this thing be like gandhi who copied jesus
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:56.480]  be like martin luther king and i got to take one for the team like there's somewhere they might
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:01.840]  kill me to get a revolt going or something listen don't do that if they kill me just spread the word
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:07.760]  alex jones uh lives get the information out and i don't say this to be dramatic okay i mean they
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:12.640]  are making their move they've already killed a lot of people and uh so i'm not worried about it
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:17.760]  really at a certain level i i got a lot of responsibility right now and i've already been
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:21.280]  through a lot of stuff in my life and you know i've already gone through a lot more stuff than
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:27.280]  dying i'll tell you that and it and it's all made me stronger and so put on my tombstone pro-human
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:33.120]  not a sellout but i may be here in 50 years i hope i am i'm just telling you folks we're down to the
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:37.760]  wire and the stormtroopers could blow the doors off any moment and they're coming for you with
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.880]  with contact tracers run by the un and the clintons so it just thank god our forebears
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:47.280]  and like florida and texas and south dakota say no to tyranny so we're not living under what others
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:51.040]  are it's hell on earth all over the world they're starving the indians together millions of every
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:53.840]  few months are starving to death africans are starving by the millions i mean they're just
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.400]  murdering everybody right now and all the liberals love it and get off on it and most of youtubers
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:02.720]  are getting money to push the vaccine and being paid off to do it and a lot of people i mean it's
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:07.840]  sick folks but it's okay because we're not part of that and this crew isn't part of that and so thank
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:13.680]  god we we got our spirits lined up with our north star and we're gonna win this thing in the end
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:28.400]  so anthony fauci the hero of the pandemic is the most important person in the world of gain of
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:38.640]  function research there is many of us have heard this before in april of 2020 it was reported that
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:46.160]  anthony fauci funded dangerous gain of function research at the wuhan lab in china dealing with
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:53.920]  bat coronavirus and in early february of 2020 this was reported by dr francis boil
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:41:00.960]  writer of the biological weapons anti-terrorism act but the mainstream media machine never picked
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:07.280]  up the story other than labeling it a conspiracy theory the mainstream media has been loyally
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:13.840]  protecting fauci while propping him up as our savior this is why joe rogan is currently being
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:20.400]  attacked in the mainstream media for being anti-vaccination on the same day rogan published
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:27.040]  his josh rogan episode media matters published an article about an older episode dealing with
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:34.880]  vaccinations mainstream media ran with this old hot button topic while ignoring the bombshell news
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:40.960]  that went out live to rogan's massive audience josh rogan is an american journalist who works
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:46.800]  for the washington post and cnn he is part of the mainstream media machine which makes his
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:52.240]  appearance on the joe rogan podcast rather interesting here are the highlights okay now
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:57.440]  here's the part where i'm going to get a little controversial are you ready is it okay sure okay
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:03.840]  so if i've gotten you that far again just to say that i don't blame anyone out there for
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:08.320]  having this notion that like this lab accident theory is kind of a kooky thing that like
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:12.000]  was cooked up by mike pompey or something like that i get why you think that but now
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.520]  trump's not he's not here anymore right we don't have to argue about trump anymore hopefully
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:21.840]  ever again right and we can just look at the piles of circumstantial evidence and there's a
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:25.760]  plenty of circumstantial evidence that it could have come there's some circumstantial evidence
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:30.080]  that could have come from nature i feel that the lab theory has more compelling circumstantial
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:34.400]  evidence because again they were doing that kind of research they also there was a huge cover-up
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:39.360]  and the virus database went mysteriously offline somehow in december 2019 there's also the
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:44.720]  evolution of the virus itself right that's what robert so robert redfield who was the cdc director
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:49.360]  at the time a trained virologist he says i took a look at this virus and i concluded that it's so
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.240]  powerful that it must have been evolved in a lab setting and he pointed to the gain of
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:58.160]  function research and they called him a racist conspiracy theorist and all the rest yeah all
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:05.760]  right now here's the controversial part that the godfather of that industry the head of the the
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:10.720]  of the pyramid is a guy you may have heard of called anthony fauci i've heard of that guy right
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:20.400]  yeah do you want to hear more yeah okay so anthony fauci the hero of the pandemic
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:25.840]  is the most important person in the world of gain of function research there is
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:31.520]  in other words he is and not just him there's francis collins at the nih and some other people
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:37.280]  but basically he he is the one dispersing all of the grants for this he is the one who pushed to
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:41.200]  turn it back on after obama turned it back off that's a whole nother crazy story he turned it
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.000]  back on without really consulting the white house that's breaking news never been reported just broke
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.800]  some news on your show right really yes uh he consulted the office of science and technology
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.880]  policy which is like a part of the white house but he didn't uh you know the the white house
[02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:59.920]  put a pause on it and then he like undid the pause it the details are a little sketchy i'm
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:05.040]  not saying that he did anything necessarily wrong or illegal i'm just saying that a lot of people
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:08.400]  that i know inside the trump administration had no idea this had turned back turned back on he
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:12.560]  found a way to turn it back on in the mess of the trump administration because the trump
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:16.960]  administration is full of a bunch of clowns right so at the end you could get stuff done if you just
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:21.760]  know how to work the system fauci is the head of that system why what was his incentive that's his
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:27.760]  that's everything that's his whole career that's so what he would say and to be fair again to be
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:31.040]  perfectly fair to him he's trying to predict the next pandemic he thinks this is the way
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:35.200]  that you predict the next pandemic by digging up all these viruses we got to dig up more and more
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:38.400]  viruses and play around with them because we're going to find how they evolve then we're going
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:41.920]  to come up with therapeutics and vaccines and all this stuff there were no therapeutics
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:48.800]  right but we did have vaccines quicker than most because the darpa funded a program to make our
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:53.920]  mrna vaccines 10 years ago that actually worked you know that was a military funded program but
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:45:02.000]  we can get to that in a second that's not related to this right so that's that's a very fair
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:07.680]  observation in other words the the 200 million dollar program to predict and preempt the pandemic
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:12.640]  failed to predict and preempt the pandemic but it may have also sparked the pandemic may have sparked
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:19.840]  but here's my my question when i read all about the research they were doing i didn't see what
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:24.560]  they were doing to prevent it i just saw they were what they were doing was examining these
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:29.200]  viruses and trying to find out how they work and trying to see what happens when they get more
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:34.880]  virulent but what i didn't see is that the invention of therapeutics or i hear what you're
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:39.760]  saying i'm i'm i'm willing to give these scientists the benefit of the doubt that their honest goal
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:45.920]  was to create do good science to prevent predict oh i am too that's not what i'm saying well i
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:49.840]  don't know if they produce therapeutics what i'm saying what did they have a lack of funding in
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:55.440]  that department was all the funding i you know allocated towards examining the viruses themselves
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:46:01.040]  and not towards developing some sort of uh a therapeutic i i don't it's a good question i
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:05.200]  don't know the answer to that question okay but what i do know is that the majority of their time
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:09.520]  was spent digging up viruses in the wild and bringing them back to these labs but fauci
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:16.480]  when he started it back up did he start it back up with the intent to just uncover more information
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:22.400]  so we'll be better informed his argument was this is vital research the longer we pause it the more
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:27.040]  danger that we're in i'm trying to save the world and so we got to turn this stuff back on because
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:30.080]  this is how we're going to save the world from the next pandemic which i'm sure he believed
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:34.000]  i'm sure a lot of these people believed but there is another school of thought out there
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.400]  and the other school of thought is hey instead of taking 200 million dollars to dig up viruses and
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:41.360]  make them more dangerous why don't you put that money into monitoring and surveillance in the
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:45.840]  places where the bats are in other words if you put resources where the outbreaks are likely to
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:49.840]  occur then you can squelch them when they pop up because actually viruses change every day
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.720]  and trying to predict the pandemic is a fool's error that's another scientific school for that's
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:58.880]  not the one that fauci's in right but the reason that there's no debate about this is because the
[02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:03.520]  nih and niaid structure are such that everyone gets funded by them they're funding everybody
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:09.200]  so if you are in the field of virology there's a 99.99% chance that you're getting money from
[02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:14.640]  anthony fauci in one way or another your grants your careers your chairmanships so there's no
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:18.480]  there's no dissent allowed in that community i learned a lot about the scientific community
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:24.000]  and the virology no descent allowed so no debate i talked i talked to scientists all the time who
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.040]  say i think this gain of function research is really dangerous i can't say anything i'm gonna
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:31.360]  lose my grant i'm gonna lose my career this happens to me all the time and when robert robert
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:37.440]  redfield spoke up because he's a big macher and he's ahead of the head of the cdc he said it it's
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:42.320]  my opinion that it came from the lab because he can't declassify a bunch of classified information
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:48.080]  on cnn but he's talking about what he knows right it's obvious to everyone who's in the know that
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:52.400]  he's seen the intelligence and he's not just talking out of his ass he's not some joe schmo
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:56.960]  virologist he was the head of the cdc he's seen all of the secret secret stuff even the stuff i
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:02.720]  never got got a whiff of and he and he went on tv and said hey uh i think this probably came from
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:07.040]  the lab we should probably look at the lab and he was called a racist and a conspiracy theorist
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:11.600]  but but what he's saying but fauci's disagreed with him publicly right so that's the thing so
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:16.560]  if you if you just think about it just for once again i i'm begging people out there just like
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:20.400]  think again whatever you thought about the lab accident it doesn't matter whatever you tweeted
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:25.920]  in 2020 march it doesn't nobody cares right and the same thing for the let it go yeah because
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:30.800]  it's all confirmation bias now like oh i i said i tweeted this in march 2020 and i want it to
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.680]  hold up nobody cares what you tweeted in march 2020 let's just have a rational moratorium
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:41.040]  conversation about what are the likely ways we got into this horrible crisis that we're in
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:45.200]  and so for people in the know who are listening to robert redfield it's clear that he's calling
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.120]  out anthony fauci in other words he's pointing to the gain of function research which he knows
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:54.080]  because he's the head of the cdc reports up to fauci he knows that right right but he's not
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:58.160]  saying that because even that's too hot for him to say it's hot and the scientists are not going
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:02.560]  to say that either now you have a lot of people sort of on the on the right wing media and the
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:05.920]  maga media who've been saying that for a long time but they don't have any credibility with
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:10.320]  the mainstream media and i'm just like in that weird space where like i wrote a book about you
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:14.720]  know u.s china relationship so i had all these this good reporting and i'm not maga media because
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:19.120]  i criticize trump and mike collins all the time so i am mainstream media but i'm saying we should
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:23.040]  look at the lab and it messes with people's minds because they're like oh why is he doing this why
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:27.120]  is josh pushing the lab i'm not pushing the lab that's the problem today with these rigid
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:31.920]  ideologies exactly everyone's on teams it's all factional yes but i don't care i don't even care
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:37.360]  if the lab accident theory is true if the natural origin theory is true then great i will leave the
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:43.360]  ticker tape parade celebrating peter dazzick and anthony fauci through down you know fifth avenue
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:49.520]  i'm happy to do that all i'm saying is that we have to also look into this lab these labs rather
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:53.440]  and that we can't hire the best friends of the lab to look into the labs because
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:55.600]  they have a clear conflict of interest and they fucked it up already
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:05.520]  info wars is truly a grassroots organization it's funded by viewers and listeners

[02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:09.200]  pinkney page right here right now at band.video
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:18.960]  right in front of our very eyes we are seeing the globalist deep state at work black lives
[02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:28.560]  matter and antifa what a terrible terrible blight upon all people antifa which they claim means
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:36.720]  anti-fascist is absurd ludicrous and totally opposite of what they claim to be they are not
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:46.000]  anti-fascist they are the fastest black lives matter it's a ruse r-u-s-e if black lives matter
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:54.080]  then why don't we do something about what is happening black on black killing black in places
[02:51:54.080 --> 02:52:02.000]  like chicago detroit baltimore washington dc it's an endless list that won't be missed so the bottom
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:09.600]  line here is that it's about divide confusion chaos and conquer what we're watching here
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:18.560]  is insanity and particularly the deep state democrats and their seditious despicable lying
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:25.680]  media are fanning the flames i urge all of my brothers and sisters don't go for the ghost
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:33.200]  okay don't be duped good week bamboozled okay understand that we are in this struggle as
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:39.760]  patriots as u.s citizens together what we have on our side is we have each other
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:47.600]  each other and that's extremely powerful and that's something that the media the deep state
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:52.800]  democrats and the rhino republicans for that matter they don't want you to know that they
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:58.640]  want you to think that you're alone you're by yourself you're not alone you're not by yourself
[02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:05.360]  and there are a lot of people millions millions who are thinking just like you
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:13.520]  this is our republic this is all about fun and games and hurting people and destroying
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:20.960]  not building not serving the people body and soul but the exact opposite so i plead with
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:29.600]  implore with to all my brothers and sisters of all colors get a grip on reality stop this madness
[02:53:29.600 --> 02:53:35.680]  stop this insanity and those who won't stop it need to be stopped
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.920]  so
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:43.840]  and those were powerful words of wisdom from my good friend larry pinkney who joins us now
[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:51.440]  from occupied minneapolis larry i want to jump right into this and let's talk about real quick
[02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:58.240]  the fbi says you are a dangerous man why do you think the establishment thinks you are so dangerous
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:07.120]  because i dare to attempt to get people to critically think to think outside the box to
[02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:16.720]  to actually be logical to to actually go beyond the crap that we constantly get from our so-called
[02:54:16.720 --> 02:54:23.440]  news media that's why they would certainly consider me and people like me to be dangerous
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:29.520]  well it also says right there in your fbi profile that they consider you dangerous because of your
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:37.520]  ability to unite black and white well of course i mean uh the fact of the matter is is if you
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:43.680]  unite black white brown red yellow people citizens of our country together then what happens what
[02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:50.080]  happens is people wake up and they begin to realize that there have been and are being
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:57.120]  manipulated so of course in that sense i would certainly be considered dangerous that's right
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:01.600]  and it's all about divide and conquer and that's exactly what they're doing to the nation right now
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:07.440]  i want to talk about the great purge because there is a great purge that is going on the deep state
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:14.480]  is persecuting and prosecuting their political enemies no better example of what's going on with
[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:19.680]  the so-called dc riot when all the people the trump supporters there were that were there at
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:28.960]  the capitol on january 6th the fbi has arrested and jailed over 400 people so far 400 and counting
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:34.240]  some people that i know personally joe biggs for example good friend of mine is behind bars right
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:40.160]  now as we speak these guys are being charged for attempting to violently overthrow the u.s
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:45.600]  government you and i both know that that's a bunch of bs they weren't attempting to overthrow
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:53.360]  this wasn't a coup attempt but i think that the deep state just like joseph stalin this is how
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:58.640]  they go after and target their political enemies and i was thinking this probably looks very
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:03.280]  familiar to you because you went through the same thing didn't you with the black panthers
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:09.200]  fbi infiltrated the black panthers they broke you guys up they imprisoned you a lot of you or worse
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:14.560]  and tell me about some of the similarities you're seeing with the fbi targeting the black panthers
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:19.920]  and what they're doing with trump supporters right now okay let me let me clarify something
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:26.160]  first of all yes i totally agree uh let's make it clear we're talking about the original black
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:34.560]  panthers okay the party that was formed in oakland in october of 1966 now having said that the fact
[02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:42.160]  is is that what we are seeing today is a campaign of terror it's coined telpro the
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:49.760]  counterintelligence program on steroids that's what we're seeing brother all right it's a campaign
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:58.880]  of terror that's meant to terrorize to discredit to silence the political uh enemies of the
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:06.400]  neoliberal fascist democrats and i said exactly what i meant to say neoliberal fascist democrats
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:13.120]  so instead of you know this is not just about uh president trump or former president trump
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:22.400]  this is about anybody who dared to exercise their constitutional rights okay to vote their
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:30.400]  conscience and who did not i repeat did not choose to support joe stalin also known as joe
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:37.120]  biden okay so let me let me be very very clear about that and let me just i want to interject
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:47.600]  this very quickly you know let us remember that joe biden and his cohorts but joe biden specifically
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:55.040]  said quote you ain't black you ain't black if you don't vote for me end of quote end of quote
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:58:02.320]  all right now that statement in and of itself should have warned people not just black people
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:13.840]  this statement was all about and is all about dehumanizing and marginalizing okay dehumanize
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:20.320]  marginalize that's what it's all about the democrats and i call the neoliberal fascist
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:26.720]  all right because that's what they are they are let's call it if it if it walks like a dog
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:34.400]  quacks like a dog acts like a duck it is a duck and i totally agree with you uh real quick i just
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:39.840]  want to say that um i have a question for you and normally this would be one of the dumbest
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:44.960]  questions you ever heard in your life but there's a method to my madness and i'll explain after
[02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:53.440]  i ask you this how would you compare the so-called dc riots to the civil war well first of all let's
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:59:02.080]  let me just uh humbly state there was no dc riot the only people rioting okay were the the
[02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:09.440]  authorities they're pushing forth an agenda that is not only warped but it's absolutely
[02:59:09.440 --> 02:59:14.880]  untrue what riot what riot well the reason the reason why i ask you this the reason why i'm
[02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:21.520]  asking you this is last night joe biden's first speech he said that the so-called capital riot
[02:59:21.520 --> 02:59:28.800]  was the worst attack on democracy since the civil war he actually said that that's insane it's not
[02:59:28.800 --> 02:59:36.400]  only insane but i would expect somebody like benito mussolini or joe stalin or adolf hitler
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:42.320]  to say something like that that's insane and it's inaccurate untrue and ridiculous
[02:59:43.440 --> 02:59:48.560]  and now they're starting to put people on the no-fly list we've got guys that were didn't even
[02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:54.080]  step foot inside the capital but they were outside at the time and they're being thrown on a no-fly
[02:59:54.080 --> 03:00:00.640]  list laura loemer is unable to purchase firearms and that goes without saying all the the social
[03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:06.640]  media purge that's going on you yourself getting kicked off of twitter recently we are now the
[03:00:06.640 --> 03:00:12.480]  enemy to the establishment they're coming after us what do we do now how are we supposed to face
[03:00:12.480 --> 03:00:19.120]  this well the first thing we do is do exactly what you're doing brother and that is you're putting it
[03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:26.240]  out there all right uh they they they look what they did to info wars to all you brothers and
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:33.600]  sisters there okay look what twitter does has done to me and numerous other numerous other people
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:40.400]  okay so let's get the information out there the second thing uh not necessarily in that order
[03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:47.600]  but the second thing that we have to do is to stop regurgitating their nonsense stop it just
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:54.480]  stop regurgitating their vomit okay because these people are and i keep saying this i don't know how
[03:00:54.480 --> 03:01:04.080]  to emphasize it anymore but they are fascists they are 21st century fascists which is why i
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:11.600]  refer to them as neoliberal fascist democrats all right and we need to act accordingly that's what
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:18.080]  you know that's what we're dealing with and we can deal with it we the people we the people
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:24.320]  they hate that concept they can't stand that concept my god it comes from the constitution
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:31.440]  they hate the constitution especially when it doesn't coincide with their nefarious agenda

[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:58.640]  it's been four weeks what's it like how's it different i get up in the morning look at you
[03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:03.760]  and say where the hell are we so the best way to get something done if you if you hold near
[03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:09.200]  and dear to you that you uh um like to be able to anyway
[03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:17.440]  i'm we're ready to get a lot done but the big flood is the diarrhea of the mouth coming out
[03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:23.680]  of the reanimated corpse the perfect rotting edifice of the corrupt democratic party
[03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:30.160]  joe biden but this is the guy they have planning to run against trump in two years i mean look
[03:07:30.720 --> 03:07:38.640]  joe biden looks like a dead body that frankenstein electrocuted and that stood back up on its hind
[03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:45.760]  legs look at how he steps and look how i step watch how i run up ramps and he stumbles down ramps
[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:57.840]  okay now when president harris and i took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in arizona
[03:07:57.840 --> 03:08:02.880]  i took it to instill public confidence in the vaccine president-elect harris took it
[03:08:02.880 --> 03:08:07.840]  took hers today for the same reason harris biden administration is going to relaunch that effort
[03:08:07.840 --> 03:08:16.400]  also today um i've uh i said when uh we uh became a team got elected that
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:20.800]  the uh vice president's going to be the last person in the room
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.160]  she didn't realize that means she gets every assignment
[03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:32.240]  if if if i reach something where there's a a fundamental disagreement we have based on
[03:08:32.240 --> 03:08:39.120]  a moral principle i'll uh i'll i'll develop some disease and say i have to resign joe biden
[03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:44.000]  whatever his merits as a human being has no active role in running the u.s government
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:49.840]  everyone knows that everyone pretends otherwise but it's true get down to business here and uh
[03:08:50.960 --> 03:08:57.760]  and ron who am i turning this over to thank you very much mr president i think it's time for our
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:02.560]  friends and the press to leave now thank you he just was reading off his notes and he still got
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:09.920]  confused and uh has to ask his aides about what to do who speaks next and of course they said let's
[03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:15.840]  wrap this up no questions from the journalist joe biden said he didn't know the lincoln project knew
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:22.000]  the guys who covered up child molestation but joe biden says he didn't know that this raid was
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:30.320]  coming do you take that at face value uh maybe he doesn't remember i'm not sure if he can retain
[03:09:30.320 --> 03:09:35.360]  anything for more than about you know the time it takes to read it i just want to thank you both and
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:43.760]  i want to thank the the uh former general i keep calling him general my my uh the guy who runs that
[03:09:43.760 --> 03:09:51.360]  outfit over there uh i want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he's done to try to implement
[03:09:51.360 --> 03:09:58.320]  what we've just talked about and for recommending these two women for promotion thank you all may
[03:09:58.320 --> 03:10:12.320]  god bless you all and may god protect our troops okay um hang on uh sorry oh sing me miss kim
[03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:20.640]  can anybody that's got a an active mind and is not politically biased take joe biden seriously i
[03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:26.800]  i've turned off watching the bloke i mean he's barely able to get through a speech and perhaps
[03:10:27.920 --> 03:10:33.520]  most cruelly of all if donald trump has his way the complications from covid 19
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:42.160]  which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died
[03:10:42.720 --> 03:10:48.320]  probably by the time i finish this talk i think the masters golf tournament should be moved out
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:53.280]  of georgia i think that's up to the masters look
[03:10:57.280 --> 03:11:07.760]  you know um it is reassuring to see that for-profit operations and businesses
[03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:16.240]  are speaking up about how these new jim crow laws are just antithetical to who we are
[03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:23.040]  wasn't that the president united states talking no that's what you thought in fact it was jesus
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:29.040]  and aviator glasses joe biden spoke to the soul of america he connected with people who don't even
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:35.040]  deserve to be connected with redeemed by his voice alone a voice that is not and we want to be clear
[03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:40.160]  about this the fading monotone of a 78-year-old man who is losing his grip no it's not joe biden's
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:46.160]  voice modulates it is the capacity to change pitch in a way that is and we're quoting now
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:52.080]  rather extraordinary looking for my mask i'm in trouble we can keep going with this if we wanted
[03:11:52.080 --> 03:11:57.440]  cable news is a rich vein but we will stop and return to reality so we've got to make sure
[03:11:57.440 --> 03:12:00.960]  there's access for them thank you so much
[03:12:20.960 --> 03:12:25.040]  we have to do more than just build back better but build back after build back better how
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:30.160]  to build back better how have americans been responding to the president's address
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:36.000]  hey there elaine you all were talking about the president's polling in the last uh segment so that
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:41.440]  was a very nice segue here uh because we have some new polling what we did was we talked to
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:48.320]  we talked to a sample uh representative sample of the audience nationwide who watched the speech and
[03:12:48.320 --> 03:12:54.400]  they liked what they heard we got 85 approving of the speech now i've got to add right off the bat
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:13:01.600]  here that as is typical with presidential speeches a lot of his own partisans made up
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:07.280]  the bulk of the audience so this audience was majority democrats watching it and you know for
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:12.320]  context back when president trump was giving speeches a lot of republicans watched those so
[03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:17.040]  that's you've got to know that behind these numbers but that said the audience said that
[03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:22.880]  they liked what they heard and then how did they describe it well this is a word we found in other
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:28.720]  polling and again in this one people using to describe joe biden presidential uh caring in
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:33.280]  this case they thought the speech many thought the speech was inspiring and then this one folks
[03:13:33.280 --> 03:13:38.720]  have been talking about where his plans you know big uh were the things that people wanted and this
[03:13:38.720 --> 03:13:45.680]  word bold was used by 80 percent of the audience too so to that extent he kind of hit his mark if
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:50.720]  he wanted to convey bold it seems like he did elaine interesting well what did people make
[03:13:50.720 --> 03:13:56.080]  anthony of the tone of president biden's speech did they feel he was unifying in his remarks
[03:13:57.040 --> 03:14:03.840]  uh yes that also came up we also did see unifying and of course that's been one of his campaign
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:09.680]  promises right to be unifying to the country to reach out to be bipartisan and we've seen
[03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:15.120]  in the national polling that led up to this people did think that he was reaching out to republicans
[03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:28.800]  over a year ago i told you that the masks are never coming off until we demand they come off
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:33.680]  and that at-risk populations poor people minorities and children would be targeted by the
[03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:38.080]  globalist cult by the medical tyranny to never take the mask off and that's exactly what's
[03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:43.360]  happening school districts colleges major corporations authoritarian governments they're
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:49.600]  announcing that this lockdown this mass system this forced inoculation program is never going
[03:14:49.600 --> 03:14:54.240]  to end it's the great reset and now tucker carlson has come out and said when you see children being
[03:14:54.240 --> 03:14:58.800]  forced to wear a mask tell the parents it's abuse because experts agree it is and they're calling
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:03.280]  him a bully they're the ones bullying us with forced inoculations they're the ones bullying us
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:08.000]  with vaccine passports they're the ones bullying us to wear the damn mask to cause bacterial pneumonia
[03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:14.160]  serious psychological problems bill gates claus schwab the un the chai comms they all admit that
[03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:21.520]  they cooked up the mask the inoculations the authoritarianism the fear the pcr test all of it
[03:15:21.520 --> 03:15:26.720]  and now tucker carlson comes out and says it's time to push back they're trying to bully us into
[03:15:26.720 --> 03:15:32.720]  illegal untested gene therapies they're trying to make us wear masks forever they're now openly
[03:15:32.720 --> 03:15:37.840]  announcing on cnn and he says hey it's child beliefs that's what all the experts agree
[03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:42.320]  don't make children wear these and if you see somebody making a child wear one say something
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:48.160]  to them we always knew under sharia law making women wear mask was wrong it's an act of total
[03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:53.600]  domination and control we've got a special report on this tucker carlson calls for americans to
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:59.360]  push back against the mass cult at band dot video i hope you go there and i hope you share the
[03:15:59.360 --> 03:16:03.760]  report and i hope you understand that infowars for over a year has been out there almost every
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:09.360]  week across the us telling people to take their mask off it's so important we need you to join us
[03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:15.360]  now today masks are for the guilty they're signifiers of shame and submission until recently
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:20.320]  many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public only clansmen and armed robbers wore
[03:16:20.320 --> 03:16:25.760]  masks the rest of us showed our face we were free people but then we gave in to the demands of
[03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:31.040]  people like eric garcetti and because we did give in this grotesque version of halloween went on for
[03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:37.040]  more than a year and it's still going on not even tony fauci still pretends that masks are medically
[03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:42.800]  necessary instead masks are purely a sign of political obedience like kim il-sung pins and
[03:16:42.800 --> 03:16:48.480]  pyongyang we wear them because we have to the only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are
[03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:55.360]  zealots and neurotics how neurotic are they well we know a pew survey from last march found that
[03:16:55.360 --> 03:17:01.680]  64 of white americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with
[03:17:01.680 --> 03:17:06.240]  an actual mental health condition and you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any
[03:17:06.240 --> 03:17:11.200]  major city if you dare to go on foot from union station to the capital for example in washington
[03:17:11.200 --> 03:17:16.640]  without wearing a mask angry biden voters will snort at you in judgment how could you they're
[03:17:16.640 --> 03:17:22.960]  saying from behind the gauze how could you that's the question we should be asking of them in return
[03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:28.000]  the rest of us should be snorting at them first they're the aggressors it's our job to brush them
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:32.880]  back and restore the society we were born in so the next time you see someone in a mask on the
[03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:38.000]  sidewalk or on the bike path do not hesitate ask politely but firmly would you please take off
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:43.440]  your mask science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it your mask is making me
[03:17:43.440 --> 03:17:49.600]  uncomfortable we should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:55.120]  as socially accepted as lighting a marble on an elevator it's repulsive don't do it around other
[03:17:55.120 --> 03:18:00.640]  people that's the message we should send because it's true as for forcing children to wear masks
[03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:05.680]  outside that should be illegal your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should
[03:18:05.680 --> 03:18:10.240]  be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid at walmart call the police
[03:18:10.240 --> 03:18:16.080]  immediately contact child protective services keep calling until someone arrives what you're looking
[03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:20.960]  at is abuse it's child abuse and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it
