[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.160 --> 00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[00:19.680 --> 00:26.840]  alex jones welcome ladies and gentlemen i am jason vermas sitting in for alex
[00:26.840 --> 00:36.660]  jones we are live this april 8 2010 and out of the gates it is tax season and the
[00:36.660 --> 00:41.120]  globalists are openly telling you you will be paying more taxes than ever in
[00:41.120 --> 00:47.240]  the coming years on top of the health care bill they just signed on top of the
[00:47.240 --> 00:52.560]  give act they passed on top of all the socialism that has been going on and
[00:52.560 --> 00:57.640]  progressing in this country bernackie is now saying that the u.s. must face
[00:57.640 --> 01:05.000]  difficult tax choices they want even more and there's another article out
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.840]  there from the Associated Press that dovetails with this nearly half of all
[01:08.840 --> 01:14.320]  u.s. households escape federal income tax see they're turning neighbor against
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.120]  neighbor they're saying look your neighbors aren't paying taxes they're
[01:18.120 --> 01:23.760]  the reason no it's the corporations that pay literally zero tax and absorb
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.280]  multi-billions in corporate welfare this one's out of the ap facing
[01:30.280 --> 01:34.320]  unsustainable budget deficits the united states will have to make difficult
[01:34.320 --> 01:38.920]  choices between higher taxes and social spending federal reserve chairman ben
[01:38.920 --> 01:42.880]  bernackie said this is the same guy that said that we were out of the recession
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.880]  then doubled back made up a term and said we were in a double dip recession we
[01:48.880 --> 01:54.640]  can't say depression anymore in this country we can't own up to the over 20
[01:54.640 --> 02:00.080]  percent unemployment in this country that's the reality folks waiting into a
[02:00.080 --> 02:03.560]  fiercely contested political debate bernackie said trimming the deficit was
[02:03.560 --> 02:09.320]  made more urgent by the rapidly aging u.s. population inevitably addressing the
[02:09.320 --> 02:12.680]  fiscal challenges posed by an aging population will require a willingness
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.880]  to make difficult choices and this is why they want a lower standard of living
[02:17.880 --> 02:22.040]  this is why they want socialized medicine this is why they want death
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.720]  panels this is why we saw the cover of Newsweek not only saying we are now
[02:26.720 --> 02:32.600]  socialists but also the case for killing granny and how it's a good thing and how
[02:32.600 --> 02:36.640]  we'll just have to have end-of-life care we don't really need them to live
[02:36.640 --> 02:42.760]  another two five ten fifteen or twenty years if you've lived 55 or 60 years that
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.480]  should be enough you should die gracefully for the state this out of
[02:47.480 --> 02:54.680]  control collectivist mindset is being thrust upon a global population and
[02:54.680 --> 02:57.880]  now the United States more than ever and they're openly telling you they are
[02:57.880 --> 03:03.560]  going to tax you to death as well to avoid large and unsustainable budget
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.280]  deficits the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes
[03:08.280 --> 03:13.080]  modifications to entitlement programs such as social security and medical
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.200]  we've been telling you for years they were going to take your social security
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.080]  and I promise you they will they're openly the banks are openly saying
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.280]  they're going to take your pensions isn't it great you work 30 or 40 years so
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.080]  you could live your twilight years out in comfort well guess what they don't
[03:30.080 --> 03:34.480]  want you to live your twilight years out at all forget about comfort they'll be
[03:34.480 --> 03:39.680]  stealing everything from you so you have a hard road ahead in your 60s 70s 80s
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.240]  and 90s what a loving government let me read that again this is from Bernanke's
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.200]  mouth to avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits the nation will
[03:49.200 --> 03:55.000]  ultimately have to choose among higher taxes which they'll do modifications to
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  entitlement programs such as social security and Medicare now modifications
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.400]  means you don't get it that's what the modification is they're not just going to
[04:03.400 --> 04:06.800]  take a little way they'll take a little way at first it'll be incremental but
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.760]  you'll wind up with nothing in squalor that's what always happens when you let
[04:11.760 --> 04:17.800]  an out-of-control government grow and grow and grow and grow until again the
[04:17.800 --> 04:23.000]  state becomes God you no longer have inherent human rights you are there to
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.720]  serve the state like in communist China and we all know about the push towards
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.000]  that type of society even in this country again during the 60th anniversary of
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.720]  the Mao regime we let the Empire State Building up in those communist Chinese
[04:40.720 --> 04:44.840]  Maoist colors it's all featured in my new film Invisible Empire a new world

[08:07.200 --> 08:09.640]  network
[08:13.400 --> 08:19.000]  we are back I am Jason Burma sitting in live for Alex Jones I want to remind
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.960]  everybody we have two new films coming out in visible Empire in New World water
[08:22.960 --> 08:28.480]  define my film two hours and 12 minutes plus extras really not only takes the
[08:28.480 --> 08:33.520]  term New World water and defines it as a global tyrannical government in which
[08:33.520 --> 08:38.520]  every part of your life is micromanaged by a ruling elite but we also have
[08:38.520 --> 08:43.560]  police state for I'm also in that I spent some time out of the G20 in Pittsburgh
[08:43.560 --> 08:48.000]  this is the film by Alex Jones Rob do and Jason Douglas and we have a brand new
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.920]  trailer coming out at the 30 aftermarker so stay tuned for that this is a great
[08:52.920 --> 08:56.600]  film this really breaks down COG continuity of government that's what
[08:56.600 --> 09:01.000]  the shadow government is this is how these people move they create these
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.160]  organizations that are above the Constitution above the Bill of Rights
[09:04.160 --> 09:09.360]  that don't have checks and balances and over time they infiltrate and control
[09:09.360 --> 09:13.600]  them this is why we have sole-source contracts this is why we have soldiers
[09:13.600 --> 09:18.480]  in the Middle East laughing about killing civilians we really have to get
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.640]  back to the way we used to be a constitutional Republic a society that
[09:23.640 --> 09:29.240]  was not morally degraded one that had the high ground not an imperial nation
[09:29.240 --> 09:34.080]  that is literally hell bent on bringing in a new world order so look for that
[09:34.080 --> 09:39.120]  police state for trailer coming up at the 30 break also want to thank some of
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.720]  our great sponsors they make this program possible without them we wouldn't
[09:43.720 --> 09:46.880]  be able to bring you prisonplanet.com and info wars.com for free we wouldn't be
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.920]  able to post all of our films for free on YouTube survivalseedbank.com
[09:51.920 --> 09:58.480]  that's 877-327-0365 or go to survivalseedbank.com they literally have
[09:58.480 --> 10:06.440]  the best non-hybrid storable seeds out there you can get a full acre crisis
[10:06.440 --> 10:14.200]  garden survivalseedbank.com 877-327-0365 all right I want to get right back to
[10:14.200 --> 10:18.160]  what Bernacke is now out in the open telling you he is telling you they are
[10:18.160 --> 10:24.360]  about to raise taxes they are about to take away medicare medicaid social
[10:24.360 --> 10:29.000]  security and much more they say it's going to be modified let me just read
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.800]  the quote for everybody to avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits well
[10:34.800 --> 10:38.240]  of course we have large and unsustainable budget deficits when the
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.800]  Federal Reserve literally prints the milk the money out of nowhere for the
[10:42.800 --> 10:47.360]  private bankers literally prints the money out of nowhere we're not backed
[10:47.360 --> 10:50.840]  by anything of course we're gonna have unsustainable debt when we spent
[10:50.840 --> 10:56.960]  multi trillions in illegal wars overseas but that's our fault the people
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.200]  are bad so the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes and
[11:02.200 --> 11:06.760]  it won't be a choice you're gonna get the higher taxes modifications to
[11:06.760 --> 11:10.880]  entitlement programs see you're supposed to be entitled it's not an entitlement
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.200]  program you pay your entire life into social security they just take it out
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.040]  of your paycheck entitlement programs please such as social security and
[11:20.040 --> 11:25.000]  medicare less spending on everything else from education to defense so now
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.480]  we're literally telling you we're going to dumb down your children and the
[11:29.480 --> 11:33.800]  defense budgets never going away folks that's a laughable joke the black ops
[11:33.800 --> 11:38.320]  defense budget is off the charts these are the people that are dealing the
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.100]  drugs into this country and we're going to get to that later we have Peter Dale
[11:42.100 --> 11:47.960]  Scott coming up in the second hour to really go over the heroin drug smuggling
[11:47.960 --> 11:53.040]  that's been going on in Afghanistan for years years that network has been set up
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.480]  over there in those poppy fields for years and when they kind of got out of
[11:56.480 --> 12:01.400]  our control prior to 9-11 9-11 was the excuse to take it over and now Karzai's
[12:01.400 --> 12:07.400]  brother is the lead opium dealer let me repeat that amid Karzai our puppet
[12:07.400 --> 12:13.280]  dictator that we put into Afghanistan that was an ex chevron executive that
[12:13.280 --> 12:18.720]  said thumbs up to the big you know cool oil pipeline that was said no to by the
[12:18.720 --> 12:25.080]  Taliban prior to 9-11 his brother is the lead opium dealer there wow that's
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.120]  incredible right what's even more incredible that's superseding both
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.320]  administrations through the Bush administration and now the Barack Obama
[12:33.320 --> 12:38.240]  administration for the past eight years he's been a CIA asset on the payroll and
[12:38.240 --> 12:43.040]  that's not Jason Burma is telling you this this is the New York Times in
[12:43.040 --> 12:49.960]  October brother of Afghan leaders said to be paid by CIA the Central
[12:49.960 --> 12:55.800]  Intelligence Agency one of the arms of this continuity of government illegal
[12:55.800 --> 13:02.680]  shadow government takeover that's how the country is run but our leaders tell
[13:02.680 --> 13:09.680]  us that we're bad we need to be taxed more our programs need to leave tackling
[13:09.680 --> 13:13.280]  the massive u.s. budget deficits and ballooning debt has become a hot button
[13:13.280 --> 13:16.720]  political issue in Washington is President Barack Obama but Barack
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.120]  Obama and his predecessor George W. Bush has spent billions of taxpayer money to
[13:21.120 --> 13:27.560]  stave off economic collapse a total lie to stave off economic clubs no we gave
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.240]  27 trillion plus dollars to the bankers so that they could consolidate power so
[13:33.240 --> 13:36.800]  that they could move out people from their homes they created the housing
[13:36.800 --> 13:41.080]  bubble and the banks could take over massive parts of infrastructure that's
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.080]  what happened that's what those bailouts were they literally put a gun to the
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.400]  congressional heads that actually wanted to stop it people like Brad Sherman and
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.920]  said you know what if we don't pass this thing we'll have martial law in the
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.440]  streets of America martial law in the streets of America and don't think they
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.920]  won't pull that card again when they want another bailout when they say they
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.760]  have to raise taxes from 30 and 40 percent to 50 and 60 percent because
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.280]  again the model is squeezing out the middle class the upper middle class the
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.200]  elite don't want any competition they want to be up here and they want to
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.640]  create a surf slave class down here and that's what we are to them we are no
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.360]  different from those routers journalists that were gunned down in
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.200]  Iraq by soldiers were literally cannon fodder in their eyes in their policy
[14:35.200 --> 14:40.520]  papers we are referred to as sheeple and shadow it is time to wake up folks it's
[14:40.520 --> 14:45.000]  time to step up to the plate say I'm not paying higher taxes these are not
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.560]  entitlement programs these are programs I paid into my entire life my entire
[14:51.560 --> 14:56.840]  life Bernack you said quick steps to balance the books would hurt the
[14:56.840 --> 15:01.160]  fragile recovery but that a credible long-term plan could spark economic
[15:01.160 --> 15:04.960]  growth today oh they can always spark growth today people like Larry Summers
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.560]  told you again the recession was over and what do they say it's around 10%
[15:09.560 --> 15:15.040]  unemployment meanwhile we're at 22% real unemployment in this country and for
[15:15.040 --> 15:20.840]  people my age in their late 20s their early 30s even their early 40s it's much
[15:20.840 --> 15:26.040]  higher it's much more difficult to get an entry-level position they want you
[15:26.040 --> 15:30.720]  flipping burgers they want you to be meaningless bank tellers they don't want
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.480]  you to have a career they don't want you to create commerce and business they
[15:34.480 --> 15:40.280]  don't want you to compete and the way they're turning people against one
[15:40.280 --> 15:44.160]  another they're saying this is America's fault these are the citizens fall if we
[15:44.160 --> 15:49.200]  don't hire taxes we're doomed the people are bad after all nearly half of US
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.480]  households escape federal income tax that's an actual headline tax day is
[15:54.480 --> 15:57.920]  a dreaded deadline for millions but for nearly half of US households it's
[15:57.920 --> 16:03.280]  simply somebody else's problem do you see the psychological warfare that is
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.520]  being waged on you so that you're mad at your neighbor about 47% will pay no
[16:08.520 --> 16:14.000]  federal income taxes at all for 2009 that's a cooked number the real people
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.600]  not paying the taxes let's repeat it folks are the large corporations they're
[16:19.600 --> 16:24.680]  the ones that not only don't pay taxes they get huge tax credits and corporate
[16:24.680 --> 16:31.320]  welfare under government programs that's the big secret that's the joke see
[16:31.320 --> 16:35.720]  those squeeze out the guy that does make two or three million dollars and has a
[16:35.720 --> 16:39.640]  successful small business they don't want him to succeed they don't want him
[16:39.640 --> 16:43.760]  making 20 to 30 million in the next five years because that could turn into
[16:43.760 --> 16:49.400]  200 to 300 million in the next 10 and then what happens oh then the elite have
[16:49.400 --> 16:54.880]  to work with them or they have to take them over or they have to find a way
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.240]  for them never to get in that position in the first place and that's again
[16:58.240 --> 17:02.440]  putting them in that tax bracket where they take 60 to 70 percent of their
[17:02.440 --> 17:08.400]  income and then they blame the other middle class for not paying taxes about
[17:08.400 --> 17:13.160]  47% will pay no federal income taxes at all for 2009 either their incomes were
[17:13.160 --> 17:16.960]  too low or they qualified for enough credits deductions and exemptions to
[17:16.960 --> 17:20.240]  eliminate their liability that's according to projections by the tax
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.560]  policy center a washington research organization of course it's a dc
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.880]  research organization that is putting out this type of propaganda if you really
[17:28.880 --> 17:32.280]  want to understand how the economy works how the federal reserve system works
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.440]  you can easily pick up america freedom of fascism from info wars dot com and we
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.400]  have our interview with Aaron Russo reflections and warnings free in many
[17:41.400 --> 17:44.880]  cases when you buy other films i think if you get invisible empire you can get
[17:44.880 --> 17:51.200]  reflections and warnings for another five dollars folks and again why are we
[17:51.200 --> 17:57.680]  paying taxes to a criminal government that deals the drugs the heroin and the
[17:57.680 --> 18:04.200]  cocaine that is in illegal wars in afghanistan and iraq and they're beating
[18:04.200 --> 18:09.040]  the drums against iran and we'll get to that momentarily because russia and the
[18:09.040 --> 18:15.000]  united states did sign this new agreement this new nuclear arms packed and the
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.840]  other headline that follows that that's right after that is iran will not beg
[18:20.840 --> 18:25.960]  to avoid sanctions and that's from amadeena denjad obama and medvedev
[18:25.960 --> 18:29.920]  sign arms treaty press i ran the united states and russia signed a landmark
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.080]  strategic nuclear disarmament a treaty on thursday and said new sanctions may be
[18:34.080 --> 18:37.760]  necessary to put pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear ambitions president
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.600]  barack obama and dmitry medvedev signed the pact and a ceremony in the medieval
[18:42.600 --> 18:47.120]  uh... prod castle after talks that covered nuclear security iran's atomic
[18:47.120 --> 18:51.760]  program and uprising in the central asian state of kursakistan
[18:51.760 --> 18:56.280]  we're both major powers have military bases and this is
[18:56.280 --> 19:00.080]  kind of put in the fear of god into iran but they're not going to back down is
[19:00.080 --> 19:01.160]  that what we want
[19:01.160 --> 19:04.520]  do we want another hot war in the middle east
[19:04.520 --> 19:09.440]  where the united states and nato u n forces go in
[19:09.440 --> 19:13.080]  and further the progression of a eurasian union
[19:13.080 --> 19:15.840]  under our establishment control
[19:15.840 --> 19:18.680]  under the anglo-american empire
[19:18.680 --> 19:22.680]  iran's president said on thursday he would not plead with opponents of tehran's
[19:22.680 --> 19:26.160]  nuclear program order to avoid sanctions as russia in the united states that new
[19:26.160 --> 19:30.520]  measures might be necessary and that's very dangerous because there has been
[19:30.520 --> 19:35.400]  somewhat of a rift between russia in the united states not the phony cold war
[19:35.400 --> 19:36.440]  rift
[19:36.440 --> 19:41.960]  but right now those two big powers are buying for the number one and number two

[24:48.680 --> 24:52.280]  fed boss greenspan says no one saw the crisis
[24:52.280 --> 24:56.040]  coming and of course alan greenspan helped orchestrate
[24:56.040 --> 25:00.280]  this crisis he is featured in my next film invisible empire
[25:00.280 --> 25:05.480]  april 15th folks pre-order it today only in america could the man responsible
[25:05.480 --> 25:09.240]  for interest rates and banking regulation at the time alan greenspan
[25:09.240 --> 25:13.800]  incredulously insist as he has again in testimony at the financial crisis
[25:13.800 --> 25:17.000]  commission that they had very little to do with it
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.960]  a sick joke and only in america could you imagine the story of a one-eyed
[25:21.960 --> 25:25.480]  neurology intern with undiagnosed asperger's syndrome who ended up
[25:25.480 --> 25:28.840]  making a fortune by applying the principles of value investing to
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.120]  subprime mortgage lending greenspan says no one saw it coming
[25:32.120 --> 25:35.960]  well this man did he's not the only one that saw this coming
[25:35.960 --> 25:40.040]  that person made money off of it but if you are listening to alex jones in
[25:40.040 --> 25:43.720]  2003 he was telling you buy gold and silver and
[25:43.720 --> 25:48.360]  gold was under 300 dollars an ounce and now it sits around a thousand
[25:48.360 --> 25:52.040]  sometimes more almost made its way up to 1200 at one point
[25:52.040 --> 25:58.120]  tell me another investment that literally went up over 300 percent
[25:58.120 --> 26:03.240]  in less than 10 years there isn't one and this is because the dollar has been
[26:03.240 --> 26:07.480]  devalued it is no longer the world reserve currency and they've that
[26:07.480 --> 26:09.800]  they've now announced that to you over the last
[26:09.800 --> 26:14.440]  18 months with these g20 and g8 summits medvedev the person we just signed
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.640]  this treaty with actually had a model global currency coin
[26:19.640 --> 26:23.960]  he's like this is what we want one day we want a global currency
[26:23.960 --> 26:27.080]  and then the imf the international monetary fund
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.160]  absorbed our sec absorbed the federal reserve
[26:31.160 --> 26:36.440]  banking system that is in place and now they're printing well they're not
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.040]  printing them they're just administering them it's a digital currency it's not
[26:40.040 --> 26:43.720]  physical yet more than ever it is the new reserve currency it's
[26:43.720 --> 26:49.160]  called a special drawing rights unit under globalist
[26:49.160 --> 26:53.880]  control as they got the dollar yes everything is going down as they got
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.680]  the economy as they deindustrialize us as we no longer have factory work
[26:58.680 --> 27:01.880]  here as long as long as we don't produce anything don't worry everything's
[27:01.880 --> 27:03.880]  going to be okay that's what they're telling you
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.960]  and no one saw it coming as they deindustrialize the united states and
[27:07.960 --> 27:10.920]  dump the dollar no a lot of us saw us coming
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.680]  a lot of us warned our friends and our family that tough times were ahead and
[27:14.680 --> 27:19.000]  they're still ahead they're not done they're openly announcing
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  openly announcing they are about to raise taxes again
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.280]  and all that money you paid into social security gone
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.040]  all that money you paid into medicare gone
[27:30.040 --> 27:33.880]  those are entitlement programs which you are no longer
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.760]  entitled to and the banks last week came out openly and said you know what
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.240]  we're taking your pensions to earlier in the year

[27:50.280 --> 27:52.840]  and it just so happened he was getting together with a couple other my
[27:52.840 --> 27:56.120]  fraternity brothers so we all got together for some beers

[28:04.760 --> 28:09.480]  and one of them had the nerve to tell me that that's what capitalism does
[28:09.480 --> 28:13.320]  it's okay they're taking the pension funds and i looked at him
[28:13.320 --> 28:16.440]  and i said so if you worked as a teacher somewhere for 25 years and they
[28:16.440 --> 28:18.280]  didn't give you your pension you wouldn't be upset
[28:18.280 --> 28:22.680]  hey that's the way things are how brainwashed are you as you're slurping
[28:22.680 --> 28:26.200]  down that beer watching the fillies yankees game
[28:26.200 --> 28:31.960]  that you pay into a system for 20 or 30 years then you get nothing
[28:31.960 --> 28:36.680]  that's worse than slavery don't you feel duped don't you feel dirty that you

[33:27.000 --> 33:31.720]  going to get to the police state four trailer brand new out of the gates
[33:31.720 --> 33:35.640]  room police state four premiering a week after my film invisible empire a new
[33:35.640 --> 33:41.560]  world order to find on april 21st i believe i so it's really six
[33:41.560 --> 33:45.400]  days after my film my film comes out april 15th and i went down to
[33:45.400 --> 33:49.880]  the g20 this year let me tell you about some of my experiences
[33:49.880 --> 33:53.960]  down there first of all i was there as they locked the city
[33:53.960 --> 33:58.360]  down we got there very early and we went out at
[33:58.360 --> 34:02.840]  i think it was like 11 or 12 o'clock by one o'clock you really started to see
[34:02.840 --> 34:06.920]  them gating the entire place up by the next day they had brought in the
[34:06.920 --> 34:11.320]  national guard and many other military units from across the
[34:11.320 --> 34:14.680]  country as well as police units i couldn't believe
[34:14.680 --> 34:19.720]  what i was actually seeing so we called up the local military
[34:19.720 --> 34:23.320]  facility and said hey can we talk about this uh we'd like to get
[34:23.320 --> 34:27.400]  a comment they said yeah come on down so we came up to the gates and right away
[34:27.400 --> 34:31.560]  i knew we weren't going to get in there's huge gated facility armed guards
[34:31.560 --> 34:34.040]  and we asked to talk to their media spokesman
[34:34.040 --> 34:37.640]  sure we'll have somebody out for you just hang out over there on the side so
[34:37.640 --> 34:41.800]  five minutes goes by 10 minutes goes by 20 minutes goes by finally 25 minutes
[34:41.800 --> 34:45.080]  somebody comes out and i'm filming because i don't know how
[34:45.080 --> 34:48.920]  much footage i'm actually going to get and right away the guy's giving us
[34:48.920 --> 34:52.840]  problems off the bat and we're like look man we're just here to find out what's
[34:52.840 --> 34:56.120]  going on tomorrow at the g20 how many units
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.200]  you're having out there what your role is supposed to be uh what the orders are
[35:00.200 --> 35:04.840]  who put this out there and he's like no i'm not going to talk to you if you come
[35:04.840 --> 35:09.160]  back tomorrow maybe i'll talk to you we're like all right whatever
[35:09.160 --> 35:12.840]  so finally we turn around and leave we get followed out
[35:12.840 --> 35:16.520]  all the way up to the the next exit we were clearly followed it wasn't even
[35:16.520 --> 35:21.640]  close we get back to the hotel and we're lying around the hotel
[35:21.640 --> 35:25.880]  and i'm with uh jason douglas and rob do the two co-directors on this film with
[35:25.880 --> 35:29.560]  alice jones and all of a sudden douglas who put the car the
[35:29.560 --> 35:34.920]  rental car in his name gets a call and we probably would have gone back to the
[35:34.920 --> 35:37.240]  rental car agency because this person was like
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.800]  hey we have a problem with the car uh we really need to give you a new car that
[35:41.800 --> 35:45.880]  one has some problems with the brakes or they gave us some bogus excuse
[35:45.880 --> 35:51.080]  can you come down and bring it back and i guess lucky for us the city was
[35:51.080 --> 35:53.480]  already locked down if you were in certain areas of the city
[35:53.480 --> 35:56.680]  you couldn't get out you literally could not take the bridges out they
[35:56.680 --> 36:01.080]  wouldn't let you leave because of all these dignitaries that were coming in
[36:01.080 --> 36:04.200]  and douglas is like well we really love to come in that sounds like a great
[36:04.200 --> 36:07.960]  deal um but we can't do it because the city's on lockdown
[36:07.960 --> 36:10.680]  and we're pretty busy tomorrow so we're not sure we're even going to be able to
[36:10.680 --> 36:14.360]  get there tomorrow and the guy's like look i'm gonna level with you i'm not
[36:14.360 --> 36:18.600]  with that i'm actually a police officer you're now on an fbi
[36:18.600 --> 36:22.040]  terrorist we were just told by the military that you were staking out their
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.160]  facility and we were blown away we were actually
[36:25.160 --> 36:28.760]  pretty surprised that nobody came to our hotel room that night but i don't
[36:28.760 --> 36:31.960]  think they put two and two together because the hotel wasn't registered
[36:31.960 --> 36:35.880]  under jason douglas's name but that gives you an idea of what an out of
[36:35.880 --> 36:39.720]  control police state we truly do live in now you're not allowed to ask
[36:39.720 --> 36:42.760]  questions we no longer have posi comma totis in this
[36:42.760 --> 36:47.160]  country which is the separation of the military and police i went up to over a
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.560]  dozen military personnel old and young and asked them if they could
[36:51.560 --> 36:55.000]  tell me what posi comma totis was and not one
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.080]  not one of them these are the people that are supposed to be swearing
[36:59.080 --> 37:02.440]  uh their allegiance to the constitution and bill of rights against all enemies
[37:02.440 --> 37:06.600]  foreign and domestic and not one of them can tell me what posi comma totis and
[37:06.600 --> 37:10.280]  comma totises i'm featured in this film so without further ado we're going to go

[38:31.240 --> 38:35.880]  we covered in those documentary films has now become reality police state four
[38:35.880 --> 38:39.800]  is so important and is the most powerful of my police state films
[38:39.800 --> 38:43.400]  because it proves how a private corporate shadow government
[38:43.400 --> 38:46.840]  has taken over our country and it conclusively
[38:46.840 --> 38:50.040]  documents the fact that there is an archipelago
[38:50.040 --> 38:54.120]  of fema camps and emergency centers that have been built across the united
[38:54.120 --> 38:56.520]  states and that they're being expanded
[38:56.520 --> 39:00.200]  everyone needs to see this film the people have heard these camps have been
[39:00.200 --> 39:03.240]  built they've heard about the national emergency centers

[39:06.120 --> 39:08.520]  military needs to be used on the streets of america
[39:08.520 --> 39:12.520]  this puts all the pieces of the puzzle together and shows the people
[39:12.520 --> 39:16.120]  what's really being prepared and set up and how the government is planning
[39:16.120 --> 39:19.640]  to stage terror attacks to be blamed on domestic groups
[39:19.640 --> 39:23.160]  as a pretext to begin arresting and interring

[43:52.920 --> 43:57.480]  another uh... peace deal with uh... russia
[43:57.480 --> 44:01.240]  oh you're talking about how they're fighting for the the number one and two
[44:01.240 --> 44:04.840]  spot what if you can explain that more and and secondly
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.760]  um it was there an update from phil j bird on when this
[44:08.760 --> 44:11.640]  march in washington with the birth certificate
[44:11.640 --> 44:16.040]  was going to be and also about these are quite the chips
[44:16.040 --> 44:20.440]  on that reconciliation bill uh... if you can explain that a little bit more and
[44:20.440 --> 44:23.800]  how the our fraudulent government is going to start tracking us
[44:23.800 --> 44:27.240]  with the powers of the iraq also they're talking about taking our
[44:27.240 --> 44:30.200]  our tax returns if we don't pay if you don't pay
[44:30.200 --> 44:35.080]  for new uh... obama care well absolutely all right let's let's start at the
[44:35.080 --> 44:38.200]  beginning and talk about the number one and number two
[44:38.200 --> 44:42.040]  spot in the new world order you could see a real
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.200]  rift between russia and the united states in the georgian conflict that
[44:46.200 --> 44:48.520]  happened a little bit over a year ago remember
[44:48.520 --> 44:52.680]  western media started reporting georgia has been attacked
[44:52.680 --> 44:57.720]  by russia through south osetia then as the real information began to trickle in
[44:57.720 --> 45:01.480]  we found out that in fact georgia who had the
[45:01.480 --> 45:05.000]  third largest amount of troops in the middle east under
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.280]  the u n and they're not part of nato yet at that point
[45:08.280 --> 45:11.080]  okay they have the third largest amount of troops there
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.680]  they're running drills on the south osatian border
[45:14.680 --> 45:18.840]  with both israel and the united states and all the sudden
[45:18.840 --> 45:22.840]  they sneak attack south osetia literally slitting throats
[45:22.840 --> 45:28.440]  knifing people in the back at these bases and then russia feels threatened
[45:28.440 --> 45:31.880]  they started running some drills some counter drills across the way
[45:31.880 --> 45:36.040]  and then they're prepared when this happens so russia never really invaded
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.840]  south osetia they saved south osetians from the murder
[45:40.840 --> 45:44.360]  by georgians and united states sponsored troops
[45:44.360 --> 45:47.720]  but that's not what you saw in the mainstream media and why russia felt so
[45:47.720 --> 45:51.480]  threatened is that nato is really encompassing them and they see nato
[45:51.480 --> 45:54.920]  as an arm of the anglo-american establishment but they also realize
[45:54.920 --> 45:57.320]  that they have to work with the united states another
[45:57.320 --> 46:00.360]  rift that you can see as a financial one you got to remember that russia got
[46:00.360 --> 46:04.200]  involved with brazil indonesia and china under brick
[46:04.200 --> 46:07.720]  to promote their new currency see it's always about a move
[46:07.720 --> 46:11.880]  towards a global or regional currency but these guys want to be
[46:11.880 --> 46:15.240]  at the head of it now i'm not sure what's going on with phil berg
[46:15.240 --> 46:18.760]  and as far as your track trace and database comments it happens every day
[46:18.760 --> 46:22.840]  it's been happening for over a decade it may not be through rfid
[46:22.840 --> 46:26.680]  technology although that's part of it and we do go into our rfid technology
[46:26.680 --> 46:30.680]  and implantable human ships in the new movie invisible empire but what do we
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.680]  also go into is the case of hepting versus atnt you
[46:34.680 --> 46:38.440]  may not be familiar with this folks but you should be because if you think
[46:38.440 --> 46:41.800]  warrantless wiretaps are bad let me explain something to you
[46:41.800 --> 46:45.560]  every single email you put out every single phone call you make
[46:45.560 --> 46:49.400]  every imu type every website you visit
[46:49.400 --> 46:55.720]  is filtered is filtered into national security agency databases
[46:55.720 --> 47:00.680]  run by norris insight systems i'm sorry if those were big words but you need to
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.960]  look into it for yourself and when over 87 people came forward and
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.920]  filed separate lawsuits against people like atnt and all the other
[47:10.920 --> 47:14.360]  major telecommunication companies out there that were taking
[47:14.360 --> 47:18.520]  part in this mark climb being their main witness saying yes
[47:18.520 --> 47:22.040]  there is a secret room yes they are tracking tracing and database and
[47:22.040 --> 47:26.200]  analyzing everything you do it was thrown out of court it went to the
[47:26.200 --> 47:29.080]  supreme appeals court it was thrown out of that court as well and then
[47:29.080 --> 47:32.360]  eric holder remember this was happening under the bush administration
[47:32.360 --> 47:35.400]  and continues to happen of the under the barack obama administration
[47:35.400 --> 47:39.720]  there is no difference they're part of the same
[47:39.720 --> 47:43.080]  conglomerate the same establishment power
[47:43.080 --> 47:47.400]  eric holder said throw them out and you don't see keith oberman
[47:47.400 --> 47:51.480]  and the left talking about it anymore now that it's under obama let's go to our
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.960]  next caller let's go to ernie in california ernie you're online
[47:55.960 --> 48:00.760]  hey jason how are you hey uh one thing i got two things real quick uh
[48:00.760 --> 48:04.680]  first of all people need to read the 1944 britain
[48:04.680 --> 48:08.840]  woods conference and realize before world war two they already had this i m f
[48:08.840 --> 48:12.280]  world trade organization already thought of second thing is
[48:12.280 --> 48:15.720]  i'm going to a tea party in pleasant in california want to let everybody know
[48:15.720 --> 48:20.120]  everybody bring cameras and anybody who deserves anything follow them to their
[48:20.120 --> 48:23.400]  car find out who because i have a bad feeling
[48:23.400 --> 48:26.440]  that they're going to try to pull something that the tea party to make us
[48:26.440 --> 48:30.520]  look bad well i would also say this get a look at their shoes and their boots
[48:30.520 --> 48:33.640]  because back uh about two or three years ago
[48:33.640 --> 48:37.800]  when they were having a protest out in canada and of course there were a
[48:37.800 --> 48:41.080]  couple anarchists there and they had their faces covered
[48:41.080 --> 48:44.680]  and they were like let's throw rocks at the cops i'm going to throw this rock
[48:44.680 --> 48:47.560]  and then he throws the rock at the cops the cops take him down and lo and
[48:47.560 --> 48:51.000]  behold he's wearing the same boots as the police officer
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.200]  while the other protesters begged him not to be violent
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.800]  the agent provocateur who turned out to be a cop they had to admit it
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.480]  the next day he was the one causing violence and when i was down in the g
[49:01.480 --> 49:04.360]  20 in pittsburgh which is all covered in police state
[49:04.360 --> 49:07.320]  four the rise of fema i kept my cameras
[49:07.320 --> 49:11.320]  honed on these anarchists these people that were trying to throw paint on
[49:11.320 --> 49:14.200]  people were throwing bottles and cans at one another
[49:14.200 --> 49:18.040]  that's not how you take action look gondi
[49:18.040 --> 49:21.160]  and martin luther king jr had the right idea
[49:21.160 --> 49:26.840]  massive civil disobedience when an idea's time has come there is no
[49:26.840 --> 49:30.840]  stopping it but as martin luther king's uh jr said
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.240]  there does become a time when silence is betrayal and i believe we are well
[49:35.240 --> 49:38.680]  beyond that point so we need to have our voices heard we need to have our
[49:38.680 --> 49:41.960]  cameras honed on these situations we need to get
[49:41.960 --> 49:46.120]  out to these tea parties and talk about real issues hand out real films
[49:46.120 --> 49:49.240]  hand out my film fabled enemies to somebody that doesn't understand what
[49:49.240 --> 49:53.080]  9 11 truth is really about they only hear the mainstream talking points that
[49:53.080 --> 49:56.840]  are complete and total propaganda to try to marginalize us
[49:56.840 --> 49:59.720]  give them end game so that they can understand
[49:59.720 --> 50:03.960]  the program for depopulation not only in third and second world nations

[55:05.720 --> 55:14.120]  your story yes so to continue at the time that my it was my sister who was due to get a pension
[55:14.120 --> 55:20.120]  at the 25 year mark six months prior to that i'm also a little bit of background about the same
[55:20.120 --> 55:23.880]  time that she hired on a lot of other people hired on so they had a lot of people that were
[55:23.880 --> 55:29.400]  hired on at the same time so it's about the six months before she was to do to get that along
[55:29.400 --> 55:37.240]  with a lot of other her coworkers they g e sold the company to him to a subsidiary and now she
[55:37.240 --> 55:41.240]  will get less than one third before she would have gotten close to two thousand dollars now she
[55:41.240 --> 55:48.120]  will get six hundred dollars a month if she takes her pension okay and and so and now this is the
[55:48.120 --> 55:54.840]  other part of it uh in southern missouri and uh general electric they uh every time it came
[55:54.840 --> 56:01.880]  time around for them to vote for for the union they voted it down they voted it down they voted
[56:01.880 --> 56:07.240]  it down and that's the thanks that they get from general electric and and along that time was when
[56:07.240 --> 56:13.480]  jack welch was writing all of his books and getting all of his stupendous outrageous fortunes from
[56:13.480 --> 56:19.000]  you know being such a great leader of a company people well we have to listen we have to realize
[56:19.000 --> 56:25.400]  first of all mark that g e is one of the top military industrial complex companies out there
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.920]  they're the owners of nbc and they are a huge gatekeeper they don't care about the little
[56:30.920 --> 56:35.320]  little guy at all if anybody's seen michael moore's capitalism which i think is really
[56:35.320 --> 56:41.400]  wrongly named and wrongly directed it's really about globalism when they look at the internal
[56:41.400 --> 56:49.000]  city group documents that city group the bank they refer to us as peasants and that we are in a
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.920]  plutonomy and that their model is the rich continuing to get richer over time as the poor
[56:54.920 --> 56:59.400]  continue to get poorer with no end insight i thank you for the call we're going to go to
[56:59.400 --> 57:07.960]  myron in south dakota myron you're on the line yes jason yes sir uh you know i'm kind of disappointed
[57:07.960 --> 57:13.960]  i was hoping you guys would cover a big event that took place a couple weeks ago uh the commodity
[57:13.960 --> 57:20.120]  future trading commission i watched the whole five and a half hours there is mind blowing
[57:20.120 --> 57:23.960]  well give us a little a little wrap up in about a one minute before we go to break tell us okay
[57:23.960 --> 57:32.120]  uh bill murphy and adrian douglas were there from gata and it seems uh they were contacted by a
[57:32.120 --> 57:38.920]  whistleblower from uh in london a trader commodity trader named andrew mcguire andrew mcguire had
[57:38.920 --> 57:44.360]  been working with the commodity future trading tell him when when uh the jp morrigan and uh
[57:44.360 --> 57:49.400]  the hsbc were going to short the market and take the market market down even gave them the date
[57:49.400 --> 57:54.920]  the time they were going to do it and they wouldn't do anything about it well anyhow bill murphy
[57:54.920 --> 58:00.680]  related to this right at the committee hearing and it was just a mind boggler well any of the
[58:00.680 --> 58:05.560]  next day andrew mcguire and his wife were driving uh down the street to london were hit broadside
[58:05.560 --> 58:12.280]  by a hit and run driver and the uh uh gata had a number of interviews lined up to within the
[58:12.280 --> 58:17.800]  regular media and all of those were canceled the following morning well that does sound more than
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.760]  interesting and we also know that the only insider the insider trading they actually do go after is
[58:22.760 --> 58:28.840]  the little guy are these media events like diana uh or martha steward and others they don't go after
[58:28.840 --> 58:32.440]  the big dogs they don't want their corruption to be exposed appreciate the call we're gonna have

[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:48.200]  government we've become accustomed to the idea that every now and then something is going to
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:55.480]  happen and we just know from the beginning we're not going to get to the bottom of it learn how
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.600]  this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking money laundering
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.120]  staged terror attacks media propaganda intent americans are easily motivated by false flag

[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:23.640]  his latest article is ken the u.s triumph in a drug addicted war in afghanistan opium the cia and
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.760]  the carzai administration since we're going to break in about 90 seconds peter why did you write
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:35.160]  this article well it was actually you know i have a good friend al mccoy who wrote the definitive
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:41.960]  book about cia and drugs called the politics of heroin it's now in its third edition uh
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:48.840]  that he just published an article on tom despatch and i thought that he was underplaying the role of
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:57.880]  the cia in the spread of the global drug trafficking since world war two that in fact it's as you can
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:08.360]  learn from his book the the cia and a forgotten adjunct of it the opc of its policy coordination
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:16.920]  actually built up the drug trade in berma to create a local force to stop the chinese communists
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:23.160]  moving south into south east asia and the same continuous relationship between the cia and the
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:30.840]  drug trafficking so the what happened in afghanistan originally in the 80s and then again in 2001 the
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:37.640]  cia went to that country twice and helped build up the drug trafficking and that is so key to
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:44.040]  understanding in this article it explains that prior to 2001 the opium uh production out of
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:50.920]  afghanistan was about 185 tons how does it turn into 4600 tons so quickly we'll be back after this
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.160]  with peter dale scott it's the alex jones show prison planet dot tv info wars dot com

[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:17.880]  jones show i am jason bermus sitting in we are joined by peter dale scott who i sat down with
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.800]  last october and he was gracious enough to give me an hour and 40 minute interview for my film
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:29.880]  invisible empire and new world order defined and one of the things we did talk about was cia
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:35.800]  involvement in drug running in the past and even today in modern times but at the time this new
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:42.600]  york times article had not come out yet and uh you were actually alluding to this uh in our
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.600]  interview saying that there had been some russian journalists and sources out there that said that
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.840]  we were very much involved in in the opium trade in afghanistan and then we had this headline
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:59.160]  october 28 2009 brother of afghan leader said to be paid by the cia and this is of course
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:05.800]  a med wali carzai you go into this later in the article peter but how is it that we've set up an
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:12.840]  infrastructure that is openly using a drug lord who just happens to be our puppet dictator's brother
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:21.400]  as the lead opium dealer in the region how does this happen well twice over first time in 1979
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:31.160]  and again in 2001 after 9 11 the cia went into afghanistan it didn't have very many assets there
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:39.080]  to choose from and the asset it chose happened to be drug traffickers and uh its hands were not
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:45.080]  totally free in this matter because the first time which was the crucial decision in 1979
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:53.000]  it was trying to stay as remotely from operations as possible so it's applied a great deal of money
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:10:01.960]  to what we call the isi which is the pakistan intelligence service pakistan was uh actually
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:08.200]  frightened of afghan independence because there's an unresolved border issue between afghanistan
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:16.040]  and pakistan so pakistan gave the money or more than half of the money uh to its preferred client
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:24.760]  who had a base in pakistan but not in afghanistan and he became with the aid of the cia money as
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:31.560]  perhaps the world's largest heroin trafficker in the 1980s he not only was dealing in opium but he
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:42.360]  developed a heroin lab in isi territory in pakistan and if you go back to that period 1979
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.960]  the what we call the golden crescent wasn't a factor in the world drug traffic at all which
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:54.280]  is amazing when you consider that now something like 90 or 93 percent of the world's heroin is
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:02.760]  coming from afghanistan itself and uh it went up very quickly from like uh an insignificant amount
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:13.240]  to uh well 2007 was the peak year 8200 tons you mentioned that that was a huge build-up from 19
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:21.400]  from thousand 2001 when it was only 185 tons i think in all fairness we ought to compare the
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:32.200]  8000 figure with 2000 rather than 2001 because that 185 ton figure was a record low in the last
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:39.080]  two decades because the uh the taliban was desperate to get world recognition it was only
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:45.800]  recognized by three countries at that time and so it just made a point of using its own brutal
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:55.080]  methods to stamp out the drug trade in afghanistan 185 tons was from the most of that nearly all of
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:02.280]  it was from the area of pakistan of afghanistan that the taliban did not yet control and then in
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:12.360]  2001 we went back in so we we i say washington made a conscious decision to uh alliance itself
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:18.680]  with the northern alliance who were responsible for the drug still being grown in afghanistan they
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:28.120]  went in with the aid of drug trafficking and that has colored the nature of uh the relationship we
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.720]  have in that country ever since this is not the first time i mean something very like this happened
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:43.160]  in vietnam the america went into vietnam in the 1950s had no uh real allies there and uh installed
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:51.400]  a puppet really known in him and with very little uh popular base he relied on his brother this is
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:13:05.080]  just as i'm a uh holly carzai relies on his brother ahmed wali uh to deliver the vote organized the
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:13.240]  countryside um also be a cia asset which he would just stop you there peter because that's actually
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.280]  in the mainstream news just yesterday i was watching wolf blitzer and the cafferty report
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:25.720]  was coming on and they were discussing how not only does uh wali carzai deal this opium but he
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.520]  also rigs the elections for his brother they were laughing about it was like an inside joke to them
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.320]  they said oh i wonder if his brother is helping to rig the elections this isn't very funny to me
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.520]  well history repeated because first i guess because this is what we had in vietnam no didn't
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:48.680]  knew ran the drug trade was cia asset and faked an election for his brother in odin's yam
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:57.560]  you know yes it's painful that we say that we're doing this as a fight for democracy it's actually
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:03.640]  meaningless to bring uh democracy to a country like afghanistan it's not even really a state in
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:10.840]  our sense it's a collection of tribes and uh it's uh it it was it always had a certain amount
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:16.760]  of violence built into it but it was a much more benign state of affairs before we started meddling
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:24.600]  and particularly before we pumped all this money in uh behind the drug traffic because the drug
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.960]  traffickers are much more ruthless than the traditional tribal elders who have their own
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:37.480]  code of behavior and uh the idea that we can just go into a country and impose something on it
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:43.400]  and expect people to like it is ridiculous it's like the british red coats coming to america in
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:50.520]  the 1770s and expecting to get rid of these uh miscreants like george washington it wasn't going
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.960]  to happen and again instead of ending these wars like the obama administration had promised he's
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:02.120]  actually sent tens of thousands of new troops into afghanistan and the media propaganda that
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:08.680]  that's where the real fight has has really been thrust upon the people in the last 18 to 24 months
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.280]  we have to be in afghanistan we have to have more troops in afghanistan we're gonna have a troop
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.960]  shift into afghanistan what do you see that environment like in the next two years are we
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.200]  going to still just keep mounting troops and mounting troops or when we get to an election year
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.800]  will we start to pull them out a little more well i think obama faces a very tough decision in the
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:35.320]  future he might be a for all i know i can't read his mind he might be sincere in thinking that he's
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:41.480]  going to pull the troops out because certainly the most sensible thing for him to do given what he
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:47.000]  has done which is put you know we now have a hundred thousand troops there and also don't forget
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.480]  a hundred thousand mercenaries that black water still has contracts with the government now called
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:16:01.160]  the day but it's the old black water and there are other private terms that it's 200 000 troops
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:08.920]  and that's not enough by counter-insurgency doctrine to pacify the country it's not even
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:15.160]  enough to pacify the passion of the father half of it which is the basic source of the problem
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:21.800]  i think he may think and he may have been advised that he should pull out but i agree with andrew
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:28.760]  besavich that once you unleash the dogs of war uh it's not so easy to pull them back in and
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:36.200]  america is going to find itself in a position i will predict this that in 2011 which was the
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:42.680]  year where he said he would begin to start pulling the troops back out uh if the situation is going
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:49.560]  to be at least as messy as it is now and uh it's going to be a great deal of pressure on him
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.960]  both from inside the country and from the area of pakistan and afghanistan itself
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:05.480]  to stay in in fact the situation in pakistan may be worse for all i know because it's a very unstable
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:11.720]  country right now and you know you just mentioned that it would be like the redcoats coming into
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:17.640]  america what the united states has done in afghanistan i want to get your take on the video
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:26.440]  that was recently released this week of really soldiers being judge jury and executioner from
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:33.080]  the sky on not only reuters reporters but then when one of them seemed to survive they opened up on
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:39.080]  a van with two children in the front seat of the car when no weapons were in sight they kept saying
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.640]  do you see a weapon no i don't see a weapon is he going for a weapon is he going for a weapon
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:49.560]  engage and then they gun that van down of course this is going to create an insurgency of course
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.920]  this is going to create a dislike of the united states and his policies well i i'm glad that
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:00.920]  film got released and i hope that the people listening to this show will make a point of
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:09.880]  finding it on google because it is the lesson of what war is like particularly a war where as
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:17.080]  is the case here in both iraq and afghanistan the truth our truth fighting there have very very
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:23.000]  little uh exposure to the culture of the country i'm talking about the people on the ground now
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.080]  they're going in raiding homes they they can't talk to these people they rely on interpreters who
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:37.400]  are often not the most reliable people around and there's so many other things to see on the web
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:45.880]  there's a story not the story on the web about feluja we feluja was the city which uh america
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:54.120]  made a point of attacking heavily in 2004 and created a great number of the civilian casualties
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.840]  and there's an article now about because they use the pages iranium than the weaponry there and
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:08.040]  they also use uh the they use a lot of new weapons which probably by un standard very
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:15.960]  illegal weapons and what really what really horrifies me is uh i'd forgotten this but at
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:24.440]  the time that the new york times reported that we had bombed a civilian hospital and the reason
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:30.840]  that america bombed the hospital in feluja was because it was the source of what the times called
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:36.040]  rumors that there were large numbers of civilian casualties well there were large numbers of
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.400]  civilian casualties and these are not isolated incidents peter we have to point out that these
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:46.360]  are happening more and more and more and our military is shielding them from view if we
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.680]  didn't have wiki leaks this wouldn't even be out there it's the alex joneshow i'm jason
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:20:01.960]  bermas sitting in we back after this with peter dale scott we all know that the burki water
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:06.520]  purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration as an authorized burki dealer

[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.960]  just some of the books that peter dale scott has authored it's the alex joneshow i am jason
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:24.280]  bermas sitting in talking with peter and peter these aren't isolated incidents these are just
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:29.800]  the ones that are caught on film and sometimes sometimes leaked to the public and without an
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:36.120]  organization like wiki leaks that has been targeted by intelligence we wouldn't know about
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.880]  these things and one of the things that you said in the interview that i'm probably going to be
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:45.240]  paraphrasing right now that i did include in my film is with the continuity of government program
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:52.280]  with non-constitutional authorities in control we somehow have to mobilize a mass movement
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:58.680]  and we have to use the technology at our fingertips aka the internet and that's what wiki leaks and
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.240]  others have done can you speak to that yes well i think it's true i mean the big difference
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:10.920]  between this with these two wars we have now iraq and afghanistan and the vietnam war back in the
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:19.160]  sixties and seventies was that uh the press was compared to today relatively independent it wasn't
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:25.560]  totally independent but there were journalists who came back and sorry we're reporting the truth
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:32.920]  about vietnam even in the new york time and the tentagon has taken major steps to make sure that
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.920]  never happens again so now all the journalists are embedded and thank goodness we have the internet
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:47.240]  which is performing today the role which uh the journalists like david albergam and alvin brown
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:55.640]  uh performed back in the sixties so yes i i think it's as as citizens it's our duty if we are loyal
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:04.680]  to the country i say this is a canadian but i feel loyal to america the country uh it's a duty to
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:12.520]  inform ourselves about the realities in iraq and afghanistan wiki i just tested if you just
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:20.440]  type google for wiki leaks you get right away the video that jason was talking about a minute ago
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:30.600]  or if you type in william blum and feluja f a l l u j a h you will get this story that bill blum has
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:37.640]  just done about how now there are an appalling number of birth defects in feluja because of the
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:47.400]  uh really illegal munitions like depleted uranium that were used there so is a what we need are
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:55.640]  citizens informing themselves by going to the internet and uh i'm hopeful that in my book the
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:02.920]  road to nine eleven like it's filled with depressing facts but i'm not really a pessimist i'm an
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:08.840]  optimist about this country because there are decent people in it but i think that we have to
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:15.800]  appeal to the decency of americans with all strikes to say although americans disagree with each other
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:21.320]  all the time that's the flavor of life in this country that there should be also some things
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:28.520]  which we agree upon and bring us together we don't want a country that tortures we we don't
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:36.120]  want a government that invades foreign countries gratuitously well not exactly gratuitously but
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:43.720]  for hidden motives like oil and uh and uh with the false uh claims that there are weapons of mass
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:49.640]  destruction there let me let me just stop you just for a second peter because oil you know they used
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.960]  to say oh we're not there for the oil i literally on cnn yesterday saw a commercial pushing the new
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:02.200]  green economy where they said well if we don't do it and we know it's going to be hard it's a lot
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.640]  harder on our troops overseas and then they show a tank blowing up so now they're just out in the
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:13.160]  open saying yeah we're in afghanistan and iraq for their oil if we don't go to a green economy we're
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.400]  going to be in these wars forever they have nothing to do with terrorism or weapons of mass
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:23.800]  destruction that's the message i got yeah well i think the best proof that we went in for the
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:31.080]  oil is as i say in my book the road to nine eleven uh the before nine eleven in the very first month
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:38.840]  of the george w bush first administration uh cheney was set up in charge of a task force on
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:47.720]  energy and uh the they've been very even though it was a public body it they've not released any
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:55.640]  they've released almost no documents from that task force but they did release two after a bitter
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:02.280]  court fight and these were two maps of iraq which were all sliced up showing where the oil was
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:09.160]  well this is january i mean uh that we weren't we had no reason to be at war with iraq then
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:16.120]  but they were planning then how to divide up the oil and the first administrator who was sent there
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:24.840]  in 2003 was he had a sort of uh free enterprise notion that the american countries companies
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:30.680]  could come in right away and take over the oil fields which produced a lot of reaction in iraq
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:36.680]  obviously uh peter dale scott actually highlights massive amounts of this very damning evidence
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:42.120]  in his many books we're going to come back after the break and take your call specifically for

[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:55.800]  drug addicted war in afghanistan opium the cia and the carzai administration other institutions with a
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.760]  direct stake in the international drug traffic include major banks which make loans to countries
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:07.880]  like columbia and mexico knowing full well that drugs flow with uh uh drug flows will help underwrite
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:14.440]  the loans repayment a number of the biggest banks including city bank bank of new york and the bank
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:20.200]  of boston have been identified as money laundering conduits yet never have faced penalties serious
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:25.160]  enough to change their behavior in short united states involvement in the international drug
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:32.520]  traffic links the cia major financial interests and criminal interests in this country and abroad
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:38.680]  can you elaborate on that for us peter yes well um i think you said before the break that we might
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.440]  talk about the bank of credit and commerce international bcci absolutely at the very
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:52.440]  beginning of the the first american involvement in afghanistan well i mean the first uh in uh
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:59.800]  the military involvement was in 1980 all the american equipment and it was considerable that
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:07.880]  was shipped there was shipped uh through a bank account of bcci and the ship so something called
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:14.760]  gokal uh shipping which was uh the same people essentially and they were people involved in
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:23.560]  the drug traffic and the bcci was eventually closed down in 1990 because of drug trafficking
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:32.360]  or drug money laundering but it was a bank that the cia was uh i shouldn't say the cia the head
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:42.040]  of the cia the william kasey that regularly in uh washington and also in asia with the head of bcci
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:48.920]  i think it was no accident that we chose a drug money laundering bank because you once you
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:56.280]  you you know there's there's huge amounts of money involved in uh in drug trafficking and
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:02.280]  in money laundering and let me say this in my next in my film i actually show a news clip
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:08.520]  of i believe it's either nbc or cbs with them admitting that william kasey had come clean
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:14.520]  and said that the us did use bcci to fund some of its covert operations i mean this is out
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:21.800]  in the open mainstream media and cn internet cnn international reported that bin laden was also
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:27.400]  funded through bcci back in the day yes and my net i have another book coming out next poll
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:34.120]  which uh i'm quite sure about the title it'll either be the road to afghanistan or the war machine
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:40.120]  you can keep up with it just by googling for me peter dale scott and what you'll see right away
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:47.160]  is my website and the information will be there but i'm going to be pointing out i have a whole
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:53.560]  chapter in that book about how there have been another a number of banks that serve the purposes
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:37:02.600]  both of the cia and also of organized crime including major mob figures and uh the most notorious
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:09.720]  example of this is also with closed down after it was exposed was the castle bank and trust in the
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:17.480]  bahamas and i show that there are connections or the newton hand bank in australia which was
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:23.720]  a bank which financed the first major shipments of opium and heroin out of south east asia into
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:31.720]  australia back in the 70s and i show that there is a kind of continuity underlying all of these
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:39.400]  banks and they go back to a very strange figure paul heliwell who was a uh a major figure for the
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:49.400]  cia and opc and helped set up the support networks that uh were operatives in thailand and berma
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:56.280]  but he also was the council for a bank which uh mayer lancy used the longer drug funds coming
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:03.000]  out of south east asia and that underworld cia connection i think merits uh more attention than
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:11.320]  it gets it's very difficult to learn anything about paul heliwell uh but most uh anyway i have to go
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:18.440]  to my book to see what it's all about but that's a that's a factor in uh you know there are all
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:25.640]  kinds of people in the cia there's one corner of the cia with the corner which absorbs the old opc
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:34.840]  where all the drug trafficking business began um that has been a factor in our politics abroad
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:42.760]  and i suggest also perhaps in our politics at home as well well i would agree i think that this
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:49.480]  really goes to the very heart of the issue that we go into these nations they become even larger
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:56.360]  drug dealers than they were before it gets it comes back to us covert operations in the cia in cases
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:03.720]  like iran contra in cases like mina arkansas now in cases like afghanistan right out in the open
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:09.640]  and like you said they launder these money this money through these big banks but even with the bcci
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:16.040]  banking scandal and it going down in the 90s not many people were prosecuted and it just continues
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:22.200]  under these new banks how does that happen how does it go from one organization because obviously bcci
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:29.160]  was really set up to to do these money laundering operations not only with the cia but international
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:36.120]  intelligence agencies abroad so how is it that that gets shut down and now we have city bank
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.480]  involved now we have bank of boston involved how is that evolution take place well i think the
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:48.360]  involvement of city bank and bank of boston is a bit different they they took drug money the charge
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:57.400]  against bcci was that they were actually involved in making the drug deals and uh making the connections
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:04.680]  that were set up between the cia and people in afghanistan and became drug traffickers this is very
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:13.880]  extreme because before 1979 afghanistan was not really a player in the international uh heroin
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:21.320]  traffic at all hashish yes and there still is a market for afghan hashish but heroin was uh
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:29.880]  not produced locally opium was not produced in any great extent uh except for local consumption
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:35.800]  which was which was not huge and now of course it's 93 percent of the world so you you've got to
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:43.000]  say that the cia bears a large share of the responsibility for this and the we don't get
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.240]  anyone moving to end it and this is where i would bring in the city bank and bank of boston
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:58.120]  but uh why should they want to see the drug trade uh and back in 1982 for example uh the
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:05.960]  mexico was about to default on its uh dead payment to the bank and uh this would have
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:13.160]  meant technically because these were very major loans technically bank of america the city bank
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:21.080]  would have been technically bankrupt and uh so america reagan stepped in and lent our money
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:27.400]  your money my money tax money to mexico to continue with payments before they did that
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.560]  they had the cia do an estimate of how much of americans of mexico's foreign exchange
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:39.400]  earnings were coming from the drug trade and the cia produced this report which is actually
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:47.240]  reproduced in a book called underground empire saying that for columbia and mexico 75 percent of
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:54.840]  the foreign exchange earnings are earned from the drug trade well those are the earnings that
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:00.520]  mexico could then use to pay the interest payments on its loans the city bank so there
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:08.920]  there is no will in the financial uh superstructure of our country to end this drug trade which helps
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:15.720]  us in this extraordinary position of being the world's largest better uh and also pretending
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:21.560]  to be i don't know i don't think it may be true for much longer the world's largest power uh this
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:29.480]  is a a history of the decline of empire which we saw in the case of britain uh in my lifetime
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:36.120]  and in the cases of Spain and netherland before we're seeing really is a symbiotic relationship
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:42.280]  between these banks and global drug trafficking and only benefits them on every single level
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:47.880]  let's take some calls for peter dale scott let's go to jared in texas jared you're online
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:55.240]  uh yes hello yes uh yes i guess uh some of the only questions i could ask for him
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:02.120]  would be uh what would your comments be on his thoughts about secret societies and uh
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:07.800]  was he part of a secret society himself and another question i would have just to finish
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:13.160]  it up would be uh do you think that it can still be argued that some of the main reasons
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:17.480]  that he was assassinated was because he was going to get us out of vietnam he was going to abolish
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:22.280]  the federal reserve and he wanted to as he put it shattered the cia into a thousand pieces and of
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.320]  course you're talking about jfk let's get uh peter dale scott's take on jolly two questions
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:33.960]  there to take the jfk question first i can say with confidence and i think it's now historians
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:39.880]  are finally agreeing with me you know it took them a while that yes kennedy did have a plan
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:46.920]  that had been approved as a national security action memorandum to withdraw the bulk of us
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:56.120]  troops from vietnam by uh the end of 1965 and starting with a thousand troops by the end of 63
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:03.080]  and that plan was overruled almost immediately when kennedy was killed that doesn't prove that
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:09.720]  that's why kennedy was killed but it's certainly uh when you had not only this consequence but it
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:16.120]  was a suppressed consequence because we we didn't know the facts about this until much later uh i
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:24.360]  know that there's also the charge that he was going to end the federal reserve uh and that i i i'm
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:31.400]  still investigating it's worthy of investigation but i can't because i you know i have to get multiple
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:40.520]  sources for any claim i make and i i uh i see it on the web a great deal and i think that's worthy
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:48.280]  of investigation now coming to secret societies uh yes all the major universities particularly the
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:56.200]  old private ones have their secret societies that they're like the porcelain of harvard which had
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:01.560]  the other road develop and fact that was well couldn't get in they blackballed them
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:08.760]  that's how secret they were uh you have the skull and bones in uh at Yale which had both
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:16.680]  candidates in the 2004 election george w bush and also john carry uh i think that's the symptom of a
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:22.840]  larger phenomenon it's not really whether you were in a secret society or not but the extent to which
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:30.040]  what i call the overworld runs this country the people uh with elite backgrounds who go to elite
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:37.240]  universities and make friendships with other people there um i think that in the tia the early
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:43.800]  history of the early years of the tia i think secret society could play something of a role there
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:49.080]  but that's because of the high percentage of overworld people in tia and there was actually a
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.880]  hollywood movie that they put out where they kind of showed the evolution of skull and bones as a
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:59.480]  recruiting ground for these intelligence agencies now if we want to understand this country we need
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:05.720]  to inform ourselves about skull and bones too but you know people are always looking at when i think
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:11.160]  of all the secret societies that people have pointed to is really running the country and skull
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:17.480]  and bones or opus day or the nights of malta there's so many different candidates
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:22.440]  counseling for our relations it's not really a secret society but it's up there they're all
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:27.720]  aspects of the overworld and they overlap with each other exactly all right let's go to our next
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:37.480]  caller let's go to matt in ohio matt you're online yes sir hello um it seems uh you talked earlier
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:45.400]  about the united states foreign policy and how that often uh supports and mingles with uh drug
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:52.840]  growers um you've got you know our during vietnam we uh the cia interface with kunsan in the golden
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:47:02.520]  triangle um for heroin and opium obviously um the contras in um south america for cocaine and now
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:09.800]  again afghanistan for opium but there's been a number of allegations that not only is our foreign
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:17.880]  policy kind of you know coupled with these these uh traffickers but um members of our
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:23.880]  uh federal government particularly cia actually or even the military actually bring uh narcotics
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:31.640]  into the country and um uh sell them here or or basically use them to uh get funds for the arms
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:38.520]  trade um is your in your experience in your research are those allegations credible and where
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:44.040]  are the best forces well let me say this before peter answers you know i i do delve into this
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.920]  in invisible empire and a lot of times they'll use proxy nations for plausible deniability
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:54.840]  in other words during the iran contra affair what did they do well they had israel by the arms they
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:59.960]  put out the front money then the united states would take those arms fly them down to south america
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:05.320]  and then they would have their assets fly back usually not military personal personnel i know
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:10.520]  that i have a guy named mike tolliver and others talking about how they would fly the drugs into
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:16.760]  places like homestead air force base and we know barry seal and mina arkansas so they always try to
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:21.640]  use a front organization or something like that for plausible deniability and they always try to
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:28.040]  make the trail so murky by using other nations in these international intelligence crimes what's
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.320]  your opinion peter well i think again there's something to investigate here and i'm not going
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:40.520]  to give you an answer as i'm sure the question would like during the vietnam war we know now that
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:48.760]  drugs came back to this country and body bags of the cadavers of the victims of the vietnam war
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:55.160]  i think the horrible gruesome story but but it's true it wasn't very high level this was
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:06.680]  an offshoot of the fact that organized crime the map that had got into the u.s. army in vietnam
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:13.080]  and were in a position to set this up play drugs came back once into this country on a plane that
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:18.520]  was flying henry kissinger but henry kissinger didn't know this it wasn't kissinger being in the
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:27.800]  man it was the people who had corrupted the crew of the plane now right now russia and pakistan
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:35.640]  and afghanistan all have high level people charging that drugs are coming out of afghanistan on
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:42.040]  u.s. plane i don't know if it's true or not every single one of the sources i mentioned
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:48.600]  has a state you can't call them impartial or objective their people with a state in this
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:55.000]  matter but i would think that if this war goes on much longer we can predict something like this
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.600]  will happen i would think it would happen in the same way that happened before not because
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:06.040]  the people at the top have said hey this is a neat way to get money into the country
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:10.600]  but because you set up a large you have a lot of planes flying in and out
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:17.160]  and they're going to you're going to get corruption in case of columbia i predicted in 1990
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:23.400]  when uh the first president bush announced his hand being a mission to supposed to be a war on
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:29.560]  drugs down there i said i'll bet you will have more drugs coming into this country as a result
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:36.600]  and boy was i right within 10 years the acreage uh devoted to coca growing and columbia had
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:42.680]  tripled as a result of our war because you have all the planes going in and out and people having
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:48.360]  a chance to make a private fortune on this we'll be back after this is the alex jones show final

[01:54:52.920 --> 01:55:00.120]  you the floor what do you think is the most important issue today with this opium drug
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:07.720]  trafficking that obviously our central intelligence agency has some role in well first of all i think
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:17.240]  we need to get out of the truth that we're we're told now that opium is in afghanistan is controlled
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:24.200]  by the taliban yes they have a piece of it but a much big maybe five percent maybe ten percent
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:29.800]  but a much bigger share is people who are behind the carzai government
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:37.320]  i you know america has done a great deal to create this mess in afghanistan i don't want
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:45.880]  us just to walk away as we did in 1991 that left chaos as a result i want to end a military
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.760]  incursion that isn't working and replace it with civilian help to the right-minded
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:56:00.920]  civilian people there this is a different kind of anti-war message but i think it's one that is
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:08.200]  necessary and uh... if we don't uh... i predict that america has confined itself in a much worse
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:14.200]  war uh... to a year or two from now than it is even at the present time so i think it's very
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:23.240]  and peter of course is featured in my latest my greatest film invisible empire new world order
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:28.440]  to find you can pre-order it right now he discusses how he went to mcgill university
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:34.760]  with a big new brzezinski he discusses how both robert gates and brzezinski admitted and really
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:39.960]  bragged that they goaded the soviets into afghanistan they weren't in there previously he
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:46.920]  discusses the gulf of tonkin he discusses deep politics and of course c o g continuity of government
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:53.560]  shadow government rolls it's it's very big film i'm hoping you get it out there you make copies
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:58.840]  you hand it out to your friends and family to awaken them to this system of control it's no
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:05.480]  longer a constitutional republic in which we live and we really have to work hard to mobilize now
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:11.800]  as peter says in this documentary to find a voice hopefully through technology in which we can take
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:19.160]  this country back and i think that's so important to to not be morally degraded as a society to be
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:25.720]  a society when we see our troops acting in a manner of randomly killing reporters and civilians to
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:32.040]  stand up and say no that's enough something has to change peter yeah i'm sorry i didn't say more
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:37.640]  about continuity of government on this show because that is a big important aspect that
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.560]  is worth getting into and that's something else you can google for or particularly on my website
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:49.000]  absolutely and some of the best insight out there on the continuity of government
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.360]  program is through peter dale scott a lot of people still scoff at the idea that a shadow
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:00.200]  government could even exist they think it's something that's only in spy novels and james bond
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:05.400]  movies peter but it's very real indeed isn't it well we had a group of people planning for
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:11.960]  suspension of the constitution which was implemented on september the 11th some of those people weren't
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:18.440]  even in the government and the the miracle is that because the media has never really talked
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:25.000]  mainly about this most people don't know that these plans were implemented on september the 11th
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:31.080]  absolutely find out more at peter dale scott dot net alex jones is coming up after the break

[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:22.360]  the elites is coming up the next segment let's go ahead and take some more calls tony and canada
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:32.280]  you're on the air hello yes sir hey how you doing boss all right uh perfect um i just i
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:36.680]  was doing a lot of research over the past year because of all the information you guys have
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:41.880]  been providing of course everybody's thankful for that we do appreciate it uh but i haven't
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:47.240]  been hearing a lot of information about uh security companies like converse technology
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:54.520]  and the rent and nice systems as well as noise well they're they're a revolving door in homeland
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.840]  security and it's the same in europe where when somebody's in homeland security they give them
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.160]  the contracts and then five years later they move into that company as an executive
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:08.520]  well absolutely and one of the biggest issues that converse is the headquarters is in a
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:15.400]  business as well as all these other sub companies or umbrella companies like rent and and noise and
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:21.720]  all these other companies but they have contracts now with american telecom communication companies
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:26.360]  and now each and every single telephone across what's america's linked to is really
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:31.320]  intelligence through this system because it's all right i mean that's been for 10 years that's
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:37.560]  been for 10 years absolutely because then they can get around us laws because a foreign government
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:43.400]  is doing the spying and then giving it back to the nsa they claim it doesn't get around the law it
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:48.600]  just hides the criminality no exactly exactly and if you do research for enough release all the way
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:53.400]  back down to source fire which the major clients are american defense department the national security
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:58.040]  department and all these people think if um but they go online and they think that they're safe
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:03.560]  through the security companies but uh one of the major um companies that i found that was connected
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:09.000]  to these things is um verisign now verisign that deals with most of the majority of the
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:15.160]  credit card securities uh online and everybody trust this company but verisign it's it's
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:20.280]  directly linked to one of its major company uh partners there's noir systems which also deals
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:27.000]  with ibm neck it also deals with um penlink ltd which provides for every single stage of level
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:33.080]  of law and the government can raise up the tech companies they want to be preeminent by giving
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.000]  them the contracts great point tony mohammed in colorado you're on the air
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.680]  hey so i um i don't know if anybody mentioned this on the friday or sunday show but i just
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:50.600]  want to go see uh the new clash of titans movie yesterday and uh unlike the 80s show that's all
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:56.680]  about uh some dude that's sort of love-struck and going to fight things uh this one to me
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.640]  was really almost like an allegory for uh the current state of the u.s so in the in the movie
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:07.560]  you've got uh these titans that are defeated by their sons the the gods and the gods make uh
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:11.480]  people human beings to pray to them in order for them to kind of live forever
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:17.720]  and uh so the people become very distraught with the tyranny of the titans and and kind of rebel
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:22.600]  and so they release this kraken that's uh that's supposed to kind of um put the people back and
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.240]  check and happily through the movie i immediately thought you know it's kind of like the the u.s
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:33.880]  you've got uh yeah blotting is the kraken absolutely right release the kraken
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:42.760]  you got people who who fled from from england the tyranny in england you know and then and so
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:48.520]  these are represented by the gods and so the guys set up a government they they have for the people
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.400]  and and you're supposed to pay your taxes to the government and right now in the current
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:57.720]  state the government's becoming tyrannical and so people are just kind of taking a fan saying no
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.480]  no we're not we're not gonna really put up with this tyranny and so government's like
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:06.200]  release the kraken you know onto the people and so i happily through the movie i really
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.000]  just start to realize you know this is really almost about america and and about well george
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.800]  lucas said that episode three revenge of the sith is where the senator becomes the president then
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:21.400]  the the ruler by staging terror attacks and outside military attacks on himself and many of the
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.960]  terrorist armies he's running don't even know that they're not really going to win in the end
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:30.280]  uh and and lucas said no no i you know this is what our government really does do
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:35.880]  he's definitely a 9-11 truther uh so absolutely that's what's going on yeah so i think we're out
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:39.400]  there anybody um that that wants to you know take a moment or leave yourself with some stress was it
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:45.000]  a good movie overall overall it's pretty good movie and uh and it's just that message that algory
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.760]  is very overt so it didn't take a lot of digging to really realize that so it's it's worth checking
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:54.280]  out this thing well i don't watch a lot of films but i may have to go watch it so we do a review
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:05:01.400]  here plus i like escapism occasionally they helped to create a new world order we are part of a new
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:07.880]  world order a new world order based upon collective action invisible empire is a damning indictment
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:12.680]  of the globalists through their own words and documents the new world order really is a tool
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:18.200]  for addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their control the united

[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:34.440]  an oppressive world government i believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world

[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:37.080]  week article fdic wants pension funds to prop up failed banks and in fact this isn't the bloomberg
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:43.320]  this is the uh this is the uh raw story i want the bloomberg or business week i want to show people
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.480]  that one uh this is basically the same article i mean here's a link to the bloomberg news because
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:52.520]  i wanted to read the actual quotes where they're ordering with this color of law kind of the order
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:57.640]  the banks to take the bailout link link uh to invest public and private pension funds quote in
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:04.440]  failed banks uh kathryn austin fits what is all that about well we have seen the pension funds over
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:11.560]  the last 10 to 20 years come under significant pressure to invest in a variety of things which
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:17.080]  have left the pension funds in real trouble so we have the pension funds the pension fund the
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:23.640]  american pension funds were the key vehicle used to finance the the housing bubble and have gotten
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:30.040]  you know left holding the bag and so the it is incredibly important now like the pension funds
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:38.280]  have the legal protection and authority to finance you know what is the right thing to do and and if
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:43.960]  if there's one reform that needs to happen it's a real investigation of why why do the pension
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:51.080]  funds keep doing you know the scams and how do you stop that um because it's left you know we
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:56.200]  now have state and local governments and companies having to come up with a new big pension fund
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:02.600]  payments because there's been too much political interference i described you've heard me tell the
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:08.200]  story where the president of the largest pension fund in the country calper said to me in 1997 when
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:12.920]  i was trying to interest him in refinancing american communities he said it's too late you
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:16.600]  don't understand they've given up on the country they're moving all the money out starting in the
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:23.320]  fall you know and he and my question is you know well who's they and how can they order you as a
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:31.320]  pension fund board to just you know do things with your money and and the reality is if if if
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:36.760]  calper has had invested in the fundamental infrastructure and well-being of american
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:42.360]  communities and and the american infrastructure they would have lost a lot less money you know
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:47.320]  that you know instead of losing on the pump and up and we would have an infrastructure and a nation
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:53.560]  but this is predatory and again you were there at the top of the pyramid watching this happen trying
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:12:00.200]  to stop it on record right even at the time so to be clear we have the head nasa climatologist
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:05.800]  we have the u n we have all these world leaders bill gates saying they want to destroy industrial
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:11.320]  society so they get you in debt get your local governments pension funds police fire you name
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:16.520]  it to invest they move it all offshore right then the country implodes and then they come in with
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:20.760]  even more debt right and they come and they take over health care then they run your life go ahead
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:26.120]  right so then they say your pension funds have lost all this money now what's the fdic up to the
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:31.400]  last person who should be telling the pension funds what they should invest in is the fdic now
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:38.360]  i say that and alex what you need to know is uh you know the patterns appear that lots of small
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:43.880]  banks are being targeted in a way that's ending up providing subsidy to the people who pick them up
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:49.960]  in other words we have a double standard in enforcement by the banking regulators so the
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:54.840]  big banks get who've been doing all the improper things get bailed out and the small banks who've
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:13:00.360]  been well managed are getting targeted and and taken over in a way that subsidized the big banks
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.520]  so you have to be careful behind here you know that we don't see the fdic driving the small
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:13.240]  banks into pension funds in a way that is part of an economic warfare game and my fear is you know
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:17.240]  the next thing you know you see state and local government pension funds financing someone like
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:24.040]  sorus or the big hedge fund operators picking up these small banks for cheap absolutely so that's
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.360]  why i brought this article up first and i want you to spend some more time on this before we get
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:37.160]  into some other related issues because here they are in business week in bloomberg uh saying and and
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:42.520]  obama's people are now out there pushing this that oh we're going to just take your pension funds
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:47.720]  wholesale to protect them and then of course they'll invest those into derivatives again
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.280]  then they'll take a large portion of it down the road get people more dependent on government well
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:57.320]  we did take most of it but you know you know you've got to stick with us or you won't get any of it
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:04.760]  it's this scam artist question should capital be allocated according to one the preferences
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:10.920]  of the people who are either responsible own it or control it to according to economic performance
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:17.240]  i.e. you know what's the best investment or three should it be channeled according to government
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:24.600]  dictates to a few small investors that allow them to control and own everything well let me stop you
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:32.040]  again exactly it sounds good uh that uh in the banking bill the government is now officially
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:38.360]  in the banking business uh slipped into it was a student loan legislation uh where the government
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:44.280]  will now be the person loaning but really it'll be the government directing you to specific
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:50.120]  top three or four uh banks so this is a vertical integration and i want to be clear here for new
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:56.840]  listeners the government controls the regulators they can arrest or set up or shut down or sanction
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:02.280]  any pension fund manager that doesn't do what they're told and here they are in bloomberg openly
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:09.640]  telling the the federal government run by private banks at the top telling the pension fund
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:16.680]  controllers you will invest with us quote in failed banks so this is the government completely
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:23.480]  taking over society break down how serious it's the soviet union but here's what you've got
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:32.040]  let's say your neighbor alex is an insider and you are an outsider and and your your insider
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:36.440]  neighborhood plays ball with the government and the government says you know something you can
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:40.680]  finance your car for zero percent which is what hedge fund operators have been doing they've been
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:45.320]  on the carry trade they've been borrowing for zero to one percent and and your neighbor can
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:50.040]  finance his car with zero percent financing he can finance his mortgage with zero percent
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:55.240]  financing and we're going to provide financing to his we're going to provide equity financing
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:16:01.160]  to his business for two percent meantime you have to pay five percent for your car financing
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.720]  six percent for your mortgage financing and by the way you can't get equity for your business
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:10.760]  but you can borrow at the bank for twelve percent if you can get somebody to guarantee you okay now
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:16.440]  how long is it going to take before your neighbor has you know a much bigger car a much bigger house
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:23.960]  and has bought your business you know that went bankrupt and if you and we're talking about controlling
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:31.080]  through the back door by controlling the cost of capital and certain players get a very low or
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:36.040]  even free or negative cost of capital so i'm a bank every time i lose i'm a big bank every time i
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:43.160]  lose money you just replenish what i lost whereas the rest of us have real risk and and we have to
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:49.400]  pay a much higher cost of capital than we would if we could just you know if there was a real market
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:58.520]  and if you won't sell your business to them they put in the green economy which is run by government
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:04.200]  they will selectively force you to sell your business or they will shut you down well there's
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:09.640]  thousands of ways it happens but but there's a double standard in terms of regulatory enforcement
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:14.120]  so for example you know i used to have a broker dealer that was a small company
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:19.960]  and uh before i'd worked on wall street and if you look at the enforcement cost and time that we
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:26.200]  spent as a small business it was significantly greater um you know but but but there are double
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:32.920]  standards now let let me describe that behind this what one of the legitimate problems is
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:41.800]  um we have a real problem in that right now the financial markets have two goals you know the
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:46.680]  goal you're taught in business school is the goal of the financial markets is to allocate capital
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:52.760]  to the most efficient players and so you know some companies are efficient and and they make money
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:58.120]  and so they attract your you buy their stock as opposed to the big bank that has a derivative
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:03.800]  method goes bankrupt right so so one is the allocation of capital the other increasingly
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:08.600]  alex is geopolitical economic warfare you know we've gone from a planet where
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:16.360]  wars occur with with bombs to where wars occur with derivative bombs and and you're literally
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:23.640]  seeing a sort of a geopolitical competition between the chinese the russians and populations
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:29.720]  around the globe for resources through the capital markets and so the the national security goals
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:36.120]  of manipulating the futures market at the price of oil or the price of gold have have literally
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:42.840]  overtaken um you know the goal of using the markets for whatever and and part of what you're
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:48.120]  seeing with all the goal of the capital controls is is literally if you're the government you
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:53.960]  can't afford for people to be making a free market you need every you know you need the 20 mules to
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:59.160]  go in this direction because that's what you need to like manage the chinese and so you have this
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:04.760]  incredible desire for control including for a legitimate reason and let me tell you what the
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:10.280]  problem is you and i have talked many times about the red button problem which is everybody in america
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:19.880]  uh right now we are all the beneficiary of this this geopolitical effort so tomorrow if the geopolitics
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:26.120]  and america stop playing to win at geopolitics and we stop being the global leader and money
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:31.880]  laundering and we stopped you know stealing from people using derivatives what would happen is everybody's
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:37.480]  government subsidy check would stop and as of last month americans get more government checks
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:41.800]  we get more money from the government than we send to the government taxes yeah i saw that in
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:47.800]  the new york times stay there and again i've been interrupting a few times because it's so
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:53.640]  incredible to see them openly saying they're going to take over the pension funds we're gonna
[02:19:53.640 --> 02:20:04.280]  break down where this is going when we come back stay with us as the economy continues to decline

[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:17.000]  system wisdom being lost with time the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:21.880]  colluded with private business creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:27.000]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.240]  to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:35.640]  original value now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once

[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:11.400]  wanted to go back over the information she just laid on us and expand on it they get you dependent
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:16.040]  on government they take your pension funds your investment your tax money for the infrastructure
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:21.400]  they put it in offshore banks and derivatives that bankrupts people by design then they come back
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:25.880]  and say we need even more money and more taxes to prop all this up when you hear it's for the
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:32.040]  geopolitical purposes of the us in england europe that's the private banking arms they're feeding
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:38.680]  on us but they get us tied into their system where we can't live with it or without it and now it's
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:43.400]  coming towards the consolidation phase they're going to use phony environmentalism to bring in
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:49.960]  a form of neo serfdom or feudalism to control our lives and now they're showing their true hand
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:58.280]  and ordering the pension funds to give their money to the private banks and kathryn austin
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:07.160]  fitz is a short segment but please elaborate on the point that you were making oh now alex you
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:13.720]  got me i just finished making the point about the red button and and the extent to which
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:21.240]  we are financially dependent on global warfare so we're so we're implementing warfare globally
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:27.320]  whether with military warfare with covert opera operations warfare or increasingly now with
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:33.400]  this financial warfare and the reality as a system is most americans are the financial
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:38.680]  beneficiary of this sort of geopolitical warfare and the fact that our currency is very subsidized
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:44.600]  and the red button story is a story i tell where i ask an audience of people who will push the red
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:50.280]  button if it'll stop all hard narcotics traffic in their community tomorrow and out of an audience
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:57.240]  of 100 spiritually committed people to evolving our society spiritually 99 said they would not
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:01.160]  push the red button because they don't want their mutual funds to go down or the government checks
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:08.360]  to stop so we now have an entire society which is financially complicit in this warfare model
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:13.960]  and so the question for all of us is you know nobody wants the top guys to push the red button
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:20.360]  because they're afraid and as long as we're afraid to push the red button or to or to engage in a
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:24.440]  conversation about it you know okay how do we turn it green how do we make it financially
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:30.760]  attractive then what happens as we go along and and i can say it's day you know that they are
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:36.600]  doing this but the reality is alex that we are supporting them if you look at the implementation
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:42.680]  of all of the sort of police state things those things are being supported at the local level i
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:48.440]  mean i've watched all these things get implemented time after time after time and it's you know there's
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:53.880]  always a group of local people who are helping promote it it's frightening and so you know
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:27:02.760]  but they're doing it because it makes the money but to boil it down we're coming to the end the
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:08.440]  banks know they've pumped up the Ponzi scheme to such a level but they're now preparing to rob
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:13.240]  whatever wealth we've got left and you talked about how the elites for the last decade have
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:18.680]  been leaving the united states and now they're not coming to the end because if you look at the
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:24.840]  wealth that this planet can can heart you know create and harvest the amount of wealth that's
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:29.880]  been created and can be harvest to date is tiny compared to what you could do in the next 20 or
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:37.240]  30 years so so they've just you know this is far we're on a journey and and the wealth that can be
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:41.960]  created is far more than exist to date or have well Catherine you misunderstand and hold on you
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:47.720]  misunderstand what i'm saying okay they are artificially cutting the avenues of wealth off
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:53.240]  to independent groups and smaller organizations and vertically integrating it and saying they
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:59.160]  want to cut wealth generation off to people in the west i know they got us addicted in right in
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:04.760]  north america their attitude is listen if y'all just get up sit down shut up you know we put
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:09.240]  an implant on you and you live on six hundred dollars of government subsidy a month it'll make
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:14.040]  it much easier for us to manage the planet you've created a huge amount of wealth we just stole it
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:18.760]  all you're gonna be real unhappy about that so we just want you to sit in the corner and shut up

[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:31.480]  well the next thing is they go to a global economy and a global government in other words the people
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:36.680]  managing this in the united states don't see themselves as americans anymore they see themselves
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:43.560]  as globalists and and they're managing to a global operation and in fact if you look at where their
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:49.080]  big investments are their big investments are in space so in fact you know they're not necessarily
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:56.600]  even looking at at planet earth is as the hundred percent base of operations but but but they have
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:04.120]  fantastic new technology and and they have a global framework and and you know their attitude is

[02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:11.240]  kathryn austin fits is our guest we're talking about the most important subject there is the
[02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:19.560]  global government the elite their mindset how they control the planet where they're going
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:24.120]  again kathryn austin fits is a former assistant secretary of housing federal housing commissioner
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:35.000]  under bush one the website is salari.com excellent info up there okay i'm going to try to just sit
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.600]  back and give you the floor because i want you to give people the overview of who we're dealing with
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:43.800]  what their end game is what the next phase of their operations is going to be and how
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:49.240]  we stop them how we get out of this trap of being dependent on them you notice all they ever want to
[02:33:49.240 --> 02:33:54.520]  do is get us more dependent so that there's basically no way to get away from these people
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:34:01.640]  right well as to come you know that just a big series of about a thousand questions but let me
[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:06.120]  just start because i think i used to have a pastor in washington he used to say if we can
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:12.040]  face it god can fix it and and a lot of the solution is accelerate alex the day that everyone
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:18.840]  sits back and says you know these guys are as nuts as alex jones says they are because all this
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:24.280]  stuff about slavery and police state you know those are reasonable words that is where they're
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:30.280]  going and you know i say this is a former regulator a former assistant secretary of housing a former
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:35.960]  board member of a wall street firm a former board member of sally made a student loan finance
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:42.120]  organization and let me tell you how i came to that conclusion and in um you know my part of my
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:48.600]  background is doing portfolio strategy for big you know i was the fHA commissioner so doing
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:54.040]  portfolio strategy for 300 billion dollars of liabilities and then my company in washington
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:35:00.760]  the hamilton securities group built databases of all you know sort of community assets and real
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:06.600]  estate which is looking at the entire g&p and then when we compared it to certain things in
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:11.800]  the securities and global markets you're talking about the g&p of the planet so i'm used to dealing
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:18.760]  in very large numbers and and actuarial analysis so you know and actuarially analysis says well if
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:23.800]  you stop feeding people gmo food they're going to live longer that means insurance companies are
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:29.080]  going to have to pay out this much more you know etc etc etc so so you're used to dealing in very
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:36.120]  big numbers in the butterfly effect of of changes in policy with changes in life span so i i give
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:42.200]  that as a background and i wrote this in the article i wrote i wrote an essay about why i
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:48.680]  i was opposed to the swine flu vaccination and i literally when i saw the policies that were
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:56.120]  being implemented in connection with the rollout of the wto and the control of agribusiness worldwide
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:01.400]  um the rounding up of innocent people and in american communities and stuffed into prison
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:06.680]  in the private prison property you know i went through all the different trends from 96 to 98
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:12.360]  and i came to the conclusion sort of back of the envelope that the the only thing i could conclude
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:19.720]  was that is that the leadership as a policy was planning on very significant depopulation
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:26.200]  worldwide that was the only way i could explain you know the 20 policies i was seeing being
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:32.120]  implemented both here and globally with the wto particularly the control of the food supply and
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:38.440]  system with the with sort of what mensanto is doing in genetically modified food and i was very
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:43.160]  quiet about it at the time you know because i knew other people couldn't fathom what i was saying
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:52.680]  and i remember in 1998 or 99 uh very very savvy portfolio strategist from the financial community
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:57.160]  called me up and said can you have lunch with me i'm going to be in washington and we went to
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:01.800]  lunch at union station and he looked at me and he said you know he said i i know this is going
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:06.440]  to sound crazy but i've done the analysis and if you look at the changes in policies that are
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:10.920]  being rolled out over the last four years the only thing i can conclude is they're planning on
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:16.760]  significant depopulation and i said well that's what my analysis shows and we just kind of stared
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:24.920]  at each other and and if you look across the board at what is being done in terms of building databases
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:35.880]  on american citizens what is being done with rfi uh uh you know rfid or art is it rfid or rfdi
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:39.880]  well they've got a bunch of different ones but let me just stop you for a moment okay because you
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:45.720]  did it was this huge actuary analyst running hundreds of millions of dollars you saw it
[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:52.600]  like if somebody sees a guy pull up in a van and start casing a house and then check in the front
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:59.400]  door you think maybe they're about to try to rob us i have been at the guy's house as a fly on the
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:05.320]  wall and heard him talk about how he's going to rob and so separately and of course you know all
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:10.520]  this now it turns out for 50 years they've been planning this and building a world government
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:16.040]  as a means to an end and all of the tracking all of the surveillance all the police state all the
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:21.400]  mind control the conditioning is to be rolled out in phases and we're now coming into the endgame
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:28.200]  you're coming in to literally kill 80 of people how do we stop this and and again in the phases
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:33.320]  they shut the resources off so then you become dependent on government so it has you in its
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:39.400]  kill grid the drug the cancer viruses in the shots the mercury i mean it's all happening i'm sorry go
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:45.000]  ahead well the food is poisoning us the vaccines are poisoning us on and on and on here's here's
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:50.760]  the thing to understand theoretically there is a way to stop them there really is a way to stop
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:57.800]  them because uh and it's what the poet said we are we are many they are few and the reality is
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:04.680]  when when will you get a critical mass of people facing what's really going on and then when you
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:10.360]  hit that tipping point what can they do now step one is you know the key thing to understand what
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:16.520]  everybody has to do is we have to do what gives us energy so um you know what we all can't do is
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:20.680]  get in a bus and go to washington today you know there there are many ideas of what we can do that
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:25.800]  waste a huge amount of our time and effort that we don't have but step number one you can do and
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:31.160]  it's one that will give you a lot of energy if you sequence it right it get as far away from them as
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:37.240]  you you possibly can or the people who implement their wishes in your so get out of the big cities
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:41.960]  i say number one get to know your neighbors stop watching as much television get healthy
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:47.320]  purifier water but more importantly recognize them as the enemy don't just believe peter in
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:51.880]  austin fits don't just believe alex jones find out we're telling you the truth and this is life
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:56.200]  and death and then the ball game isn't going to matter so much and take all your energies
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:00.920]  and stop seeing kathryn austin fits as your champion i stopped seeing alex jones as your
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:07.240]  champion you know she's not jonah barker i'm not going to watch again you're on the uh you know
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:12.040]  it's really funny and when you withdraw from the all your ideas are great but but you want to get
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:17.800]  as financially not dependent on them as possible to get as far away as you can from government money
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:24.600]  or money that they control one of the things that uh that is just a profoundly important thing if
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:31.240]  everybody tomorrow in the country alex said you know any bank that's trading derivatives or got
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:35.400]  you know big or any of the big banks who got bailout money i'm getting as far away from as i can
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:41.720]  so if you pulled your money out of the um out of the big banks and went to a well managed
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:48.120]  local bank tomorrow it would have a profound and traumatic impact now you can say well all those
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:53.160]  banks channel money into wall street anyway if i'm the federal reserve and i have to negotiate
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:58.680]  with 25 000 bank presidents as opposed to 10 it's a very different picture it's a very different
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:05.880]  world okay so anything you can do is it's real funny i have a a member of my network who's uh
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:12.200]  jewish whose family was really hurt in the holocaust and he was asking me whether or not he should
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:16.920]  bank in a big bank and i said you know you're basically asking me whether you should you
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.960]  should put your money with him or money management or not now why are you asking me that question
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:29.000]  don't you know better but that's what we're doing we're financing if you look at any activist group
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:35.080]  who's opposed to any of the things they say they let's say the guys are posted gmo well if you
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:39.960]  look at where their money is they're all financing the creation of gmo's and the building of that
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:44.760]  infrastructure when you finance the u.s government you're financing genetically modified seed
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:50.920]  you're financing the implementation of that so so part of it is you know withdraw as much as you
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.360]  can your person your family your how you spend your time don't be financially dependent but
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:03.080]  stop financing the very things that are killing you and your family absolutely now
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:10.360]  now other solutions uh and i jumped in there when you said get as far away as you can for the money
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:16.200]  here's the next solution who are you supporting for sheriff this this in this uh local election
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:23.560]  okay if 3100 counties the sheriff there's dual sovereignty under the constitution
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:31.000]  so so your sheriff can literally tell the the federal government to get off you know your
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.200]  county property and know they may not enforce something that is outside the tenth amendment
[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:41.800]  okay so so we're coming into election the election cycle and the election cycle is always a time
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:46.440]  alex when you can be talking to your neighbors about all these issues and let me tell you something
[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:51.320]  the fact that the bailouts and healthcare passed without having any kind of popular
[02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:57.560]  sufficient popular support for a change of that extraordinary nature has got people worked up
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:02.440]  and they're ready to have a conversation so so number one you want to get into office the
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:08.360]  right kind of sheriff and you want your sheriff is your sheriff out there doing crime patrol
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:13.880]  or is your sheriff instead spending all of your tax money for closing on people on behalf of the
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:19.000]  big bank and trying to squeeze people and raise revenue we've always promoted patriots sheriffs
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  so we're on the same page right on that front thing is in your state local areas you have
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.440]  candidates who are who are proposing tenth amendment legislation so for example i to hope
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:36.120]  have the health freedom act we have lots of states trying to have past health freedom act
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:41.960]  we have lots of states um uh you know doing a variety of things on the tenth amendment there's
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:47.480]  a great tenth amendment center online so you want to find out where the state local representatives
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:53.800]  who are active on tenth amendment and you want to get hooked up and supporting them okay but the
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:59.080]  number one message here is get up don't just count on other people to do it now i want to get into
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:02.680]  some other issues have you talked about some more solutions here but i also want to talk about what
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:09.800]  their in game is studying these larger okay so can i mention one other thing go ahead stop giving
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:16.840]  them your data there's an edwin black have you ever had edwin black on edwin black wrote the
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:23.640]  book about ibm building the database and computer systems for the holocaust yes okay well any
[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:31.080]  any kind of police state or any kind of slavery depends seriously on having the infrastructure
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:37.640]  you need the database and and computer infrastructure you need to manage large population so it's
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:42.920]  just like if you're a farmer and you have livestock you need great data and great databases if you're
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:49.080]  going to manage the population ditto here and what we're watching in the health care bill in a
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:54.920]  variety of different legislations and policies and now with the census is the effort to build
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:45:02.040]  the definitive database infrastructure um that will allow them to define where you live who you
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:09.000]  live with connect up your health care databases connect up your tax information if they want to
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.200]  connect up all sorts of private commercial information they have about your spending habits
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:18.040]  use artist well that's what this bill does it says the irs looks at the health care you're
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:23.720]  getting you can take money out of your savings account medical savings account uh you were
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:27.800]  talking about how they're putting in new laws to track all your money or not let you get your money
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:31.640]  out of the country the elites already pulled their money out now they want to make sure the middle
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:36.680]  class has to stay here and basically be sucked dry right so what you want to do the first thing
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:41.800]  you want to do is you want to get your data out of the system stop giving them data okay and and
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:46.280]  there are lots of different ways you can do that and then the second thing you want to do is you
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:51.880]  want to get out of the money system as much as possible anyway so so anything you can do to
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:59.400]  protect to not make yourself a target you know we can we can put our money in a stock get a dividend
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:04.680]  and then go buy water from the water company but also if we live in a rural area we can just stop
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:09.320]  being in the middle and we can go out and build a well and then i don't need your stock and i
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:13.640]  don't need your dividend and that's why they're moving nationwide and worldwide to block people
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:18.760]  drilling their own wells well that's what so you want to you if you can you want to live in an area
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:22.760]  where you still have the power to do that okay we're running out of time and it's clear i've got
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:28.280]  to have you back up for a full hour just on solutions those are all great solutions i number
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:35.080]  one say wake people up they're ready to be woken up to the full horror but looking at their program
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:40.440]  and and being able to factor in all these different elements on a wide spectrum analysis
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:44.840]  what do you see as their game plan in the next six months to a year to two years
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:49.880]  out to five years how do you see them unrolling this global financial takeover and then we'll
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:55.960]  dovetail that with this war making economy that isn't just launching wars overseas naked body
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:02.600]  scanners surveillance face scanners cps dinecore out grabbing more children for no reason the
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:06.920]  texas case where they're taking people's kids now if their parents say don't trust the government
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:11.640]  i mean it's getting crazy right now it's well it's been crazy for a long time
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:15.720]  but it's going to become very crazy to most people and and i think what you need to do
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:22.920]  is first and foremost you need to know that that if you are awake and out to protect yourself
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:27.960]  they can't do this and so the question is what the step number one everybody has to do
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:34.280]  is turn off their tv and stop listening to their media and stay linked into media that's
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:39.320]  telling you the truth that step number one because the first way they control you alexis with your
[02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:45.720]  mind so the first step is get your mind clean don't let them control your mind well i mean how
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:54.440]  can a cop take a family's child and put on the cps form they taught their children not to trust
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:59.480]  the government i mean that's right out of 1984 and these cops feel good while they're doing this i
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:06.680]  mean these are tyrants i've seen this in my own situation when i was targeted every team we had
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:12.120]  18 audits and investigations at the hamilton securities group and when it when each one started
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:17.160]  the people coming into audit investigate thought we were you know just bad horrible people and
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:22.280]  then we'd work with them and before it was over they'd be on our side against the government
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:27.640]  but but initially they they are taught to believe that you're bad people and and the problem is
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:33.400]  most people get defensive and don't work through it we were trained in spiritual warfare so we saw
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:39.480]  it as our job to bring them across to the light and usually did and so um you know they really
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:45.640]  don't know and it's hard alex for you to fathom that the system is that ugly or that evil they
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:52.040]  really don't know many of them so we got it we got to turn them around when you saw our article
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:58.040]  last friday cops and cps seized child from parents for mistrusting government i was aware of this but
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:02.200]  you sent me a lot of stuff that i actually wasn't aware of uh that and we're gonna be showing people
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:08.920]  some document cam shots right now uh with uh dinecore heavily involved globally it's been
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:14.440]  congressional hearings in in white slavery child kidnapping rings they now have a new name uh but
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:20.200]  csc dinecore in the economics into csc and then they got spun off and went public so they're back
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:27.000]  to their old name okay so but but i mean i have all the mainstream news articles this is literally
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:32.280]  a legion of doom and that's all part of their military operation and grabbing kids is very lucrative
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:37.320]  well the the scariest story in the world and one that's hard for most people get into is the role
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:44.840]  of pedophilia and pedophilia is a very old story alex it's been used for years you know as a both
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:51.240]  of uh you know a personnel benefit if you will and a form of entrapment once you get a file you
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.640]  know once you get dirty pictures of somebody engaged in pedophilia a politician or business
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:00.520]  leader you own them for life it's one of the most economic ways to control there is i hate to say it
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:05.400]  but that's the reality if you look at the history of narcotics trafficking and mortgage fraud in
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:10.760]  this country it's intimately linked with with pedophilia and sex slavery you know i just hate
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:15.880]  to say it that's the way it is and i got on to dinecore in the 90s because you had a couple of
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:22.680]  whistleblowers um when dinecore was a government contract they you had their project managers
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:28.200]  literally engaged in owning you know buying and owning children and using them for sex and and
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:33.320]  and working with the local mafias who were who were tracking it and yet the state department
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:36.920]  where dinecore is the biggest contract was forgiving all of us anyway this is all on the
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:42.280]  public record and then dinecore started to pop up in child protective services contracts around the
[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:47.640]  country and we were in a stay there stay there i'm gonna have to have you back for a full hour
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:52.040]  soon on this subject because i actually got death threats when i first heard of covering this about
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:59.400]  eight years ago when we learned about dinecore uh just modern slave traffickers fact four million

[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:24.840]  dot tv viewers i was just showing mainstream news articles i have congressional hearings
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:29.240]  were dying core they say well you kidnapped tens of thousands of children for sex slaves
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:33.240]  and then they asked rumsfeld why are they allowed to do this and he just said they just are
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:40.120]  and again the magnitude of the evil and dying core i'd know some of this but she sent me a
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:45.560]  link to news articles and government purchase orders where they're involved all over warehousing
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:50.680]  the kids once they're taken so now it's not enough to grab iraqi kids or serve kids now
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:57.000]  they're grabbing our kids katharine finish your story okay so so i'm uh the way i got onto this
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:03.560]  was i was in washington and i i had come on to dying core because of their role in the war on
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:10.760]  drugs and um i'll i'll tell you two stories the first was a group of peasant women from south
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:16.360]  america came up to to give a presentation to congressman and they gave a presentation in
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:23.160]  washington on how um they were being moved off their land private people were picking up their
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:27.480]  land for cheap and then the government was building housing and you know this whole war
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:32.600]  on gay drugs game and so i kept asking them questions and finally they got very suspicious
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:36.920]  and said how come you know so much about how the money works in our country and i said well
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:42.040]  i was the assistant secretary of housing and apparently it works the same way in your country
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:48.120]  that works at ours so afterwards i did a little research and discovered the same contractor in
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:55.160]  enforcement at hud in this country was the lead contractor in latin america in the war on drugs
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:01.080]  it was dying core so i started to get in and look at dying core and on and on and on and that's when
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:07.480]  the story of the sex slave trafficking came out and it was unbelievable because insight magazine
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:13.160]  alec wrote a great story about sex slave trafficking the allegations in connection with the dying core
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:21.560]  litigation those magazines cover story were dropped on every senator in every congressman's
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:27.160]  uh desk and the next week both the navy and the state department gave huge new contracts to dying
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:33.720]  core you know so it didn't seem to matter it was quite amazing anyway so so fast forward i i ended
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:40.360]  up writing a series of stories about dying core and illuminating what was going on because in fact
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:47.240]  the chairman of the finance committee at enron um was a private investor who was the chairman
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:52.040]  a lead investor for many years in dying cores and the linkages between dying core and some of
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:59.640]  what was going on with the funny money was pretty scary so um when our litigation was very hot and
[02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:04.680]  heavy i and of course dying core was a big contractor at the department of justice and
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:10.600]  was said by the inslaw people to be one of the managers of the promise software anyway so we're
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:15.880]  in the middle of the litigation and i have a person one of the people working for me helping me do
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:23.480]  the litigation support work which was very time-consuming came to me and said you know um uh somebody
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:30.120]  from child protective services showed up at my house and uh she she's an old you know she's a
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:34.520]  single mom we got a minute and a half left so finish up on this and so she said i'm sure it's
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:40.920]  a mistake and i said no no no this is dangerous we need to research find out if dying core is is
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:46.280]  the contractor for child protective services sure enough they were and we literally had to get her
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:53.000]  to move to another state and this is a child molestation army so well but but what what you need
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:58.200]  to but so last last week when i saw what was going on texas i said you want to check and see
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:03.400]  whether dying core is behind you know is in the mix because the idea of going after people's
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:11.480]  children just because they disagree with government policy this is a real risk what you wanted to make
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:17.560]  yes i just wanted to thank you alex you sent two of your incredible producers down to my house
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:22.280]  um during the snowstorm they came all the way out of mecca's in a snowstorm i never thought
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:27.320]  they'd make it we spent a day filming they were so intelligent they were so professional they were
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:34.600]  so capable i said wow you know alex jones is going to a whole new level what a team i was very
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:43.160]  you're a sweetheart kathryn awson fits god bless you but thank you for listening to gcm be sure to

[02:58:53.160 --> 02:58:59.480]  the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really says that the state is god

[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:28.120]  there's too many people in northern mexico and southern california that's what caused the earthquake
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:41.320]  or at least that's what that particular congressman hank johnson from georgia must believe he thinks
[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:46.920]  islands are floating and are buoyant like a beach ball and that if too many people get on the edge
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:51.800]  of an island it'll make it tumble over into the ocean like a sailboat that's the type of
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:57.640]  mindset we're dealing with with the dumb down general public and even some members of congress
[03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:05.960]  who will allow al gore and others to tell them fables fairy tales children's stories to scare
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:14.280]  them into submission it's a very childlike public that we have in many sectors of our society and
[03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:21.080]  it's up to us the adults to reach out to these people and to educate them we don't have time
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:30.520]  to screw around anymore it is monday the fifth day of april 2010 we're going to be live here for
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:36.520]  the next four hours congressman ron paul will be joining us coming up in the next hour
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:47.000]  via cell phone on the road so i would remind my producers now get that cell phone number when he
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:53.800]  does call us like last time was it sure to cut out also kathryn austin fits will be joining us to talk
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:02:03.080]  about what's happening in the economy and what the parasite elite the ruling class are setting up so
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:11.400]  that's always extremely informative with kathryn austin fits we worked at the highest levels of
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:20.040]  the federal government we are going to have open phones also in the first second third and fourth
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:30.120]  hour today on any issue you wish to discuss we've seen the un and dany glover say that the earthquakes
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:37.240]  in haiti and the earthquake in chili were caused by carbon dioxide that plants breathe
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:42.360]  it's part of our atmosphere i'm looking for them to say that the earthquake in southern california
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:49.480]  the 7.2 magnitude earthquake at least 20 million people felt the quake according to seismologists
[03:02:50.440 --> 03:03:02.040]  and i've also seen other newscast in previous earthquakes in southern california being blamed
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:10.600]  on global warming i mean this is just the height of conscious lying and deception i won't be surprised
[03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:15.880]  that they don't start telling people that science is settled and that islands do float on top of
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:23.640]  the water and are going to capsize so we'll be breaking that down today i also want to play
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:29.320]  a audio clip the video is up on prisonplanet.com an article by steve wantson illinois congressman
[03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:34.840]  i don't worry about the constitution they brought up the fact that the health bill is unconstitutional
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:40.760]  to him and he didn't deny that uh he said i don't care and i don't worry about the constitution
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:50.680]  i guess like george bush said it's just a gd piece of paper what one could eat no fat and one
[03:03:50.680 --> 03:04:01.080]  could eat no lean and so between the two they lick the platter clean a nursery rhyme republicans hate
[03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:05.560]  one side of the bill of rights and constitution and shred it as fast as they can the democrats hate
[03:04:05.560 --> 03:04:12.280]  the other side of it and between the two they lick the platter clean but it's even worse than that
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:16.840]  the republicans always rail against democratic policies so they get power then they keep it
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:22.520]  the democrats always rail against what the republicans put into place and then they keep it
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:26.040]  for themselves as well
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:35.640]  okay i'm gonna run down the news on the other side of this quick break and greenpeace

[03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:46.520]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it is monday the fifth day of april 2010 until the bottom of
[03:08:46.520 --> 03:08:52.200]  the hour we have congressman ron paul with us and we appreciate him coming on congressman good to
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:58.920]  have you here there is so much going on i've got a lot of important questions i want to ask
[03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:03.960]  you but out of the gates uh what is most important on your plate that you want to warn the american
[03:09:03.960 --> 03:09:11.560]  people about today oh there are too many things i don't know which one's the worst you know the
[03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:17.160]  finances they're so bad and they're getting much worse you know the way they're spending the money
[03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:22.200]  running up the debt i think that the financial crisis is getting so much closer interest rates
[03:09:22.200 --> 03:09:30.440]  are going up i think that's a major major problem we face but seeing about it i don't think you
[03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:36.040]  believe that he's achieved great things you know by flooding the money that's marketed
[03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:42.440]  saving the country from the depression taking care of his friends and the people who lost their jobs
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:48.520]  don't have a voice so he thinks he's had a great victory but the second thing is what's going on
[03:09:48.520 --> 03:09:53.960]  over the middle east that's getting much worse the uh the iraqi situation is worse it proves now
[03:09:53.960 --> 03:09:58.520]  that they won't remove any troops at all and of course we're going to be up to a hundred thousand
[03:09:58.520 --> 03:10:07.000]  troops in afghanistan and car side car side is now uh you know feeling very bold and critical of the
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:13.480]  united states so uh when that happens you know i just wonder what we'll handle that because you
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:19.800]  know at times when when our good friends uh start to act on their own we usually get rid of them or
[03:10:19.800 --> 03:10:24.920]  you know desert them or go on their own you know so i think that thing is a whole mess and can
[03:10:24.920 --> 03:10:31.160]  really blow up in our face well let's get into the economy then first uh i've seen the different
[03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:39.880]  job charts uh showing that this is the worst recession since uh the late 1940s and meanwhile
[03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:45.400]  uh i have a business week article from two weeks ago where the federal regulators are
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:52.440]  pressuring public and private uh pension funds to be invested quote in failed uh banks we have
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:11:00.040]  geitner uh in the news with china talking about uh not buying as many dollars we have open discussion
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:10.440]  by moody's and other top rating services of uh the u.s losing their triple a rating uh the economic
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:19.320]  situation appears to be spiraling downwards i don't think there's any doubt about that um
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:24.440]  but uh there's still a lot of people with their head in the sand and i don't know whether they're
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:29.240]  lying to themselves but some of them really believe that things have turned around they look at the
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:35.400]  other side of the story and they say you know more jobs are being uh crowned and that uh you know
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:43.560]  staying under 10 percent and there's gdp is going up and uh they either try to fool the people or
[03:11:43.560 --> 03:11:49.720]  they fool themselves but uh ultimately though the market rules the market will dictate and uh
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:56.120]  they everybody will catch on but i think where the disconnect is is that the government is putting
[03:11:56.120 --> 03:12:01.400]  a positive spin on it but uh you know the people that you talk to and the people in the tea party
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:06.280]  movement they know better you know that's why there's the dog on upset and i they're not buying
[03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:13.400]  into this this is a completely different year than we've had it i guess many many years well the ap
[03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:20.600]  reported last week that half of the so-called new jobs uh are government jobs and census jobs
[03:12:20.600 --> 03:12:27.720]  uh and we know that the unemployment numbers really above 20 percent so even with cooked numbers
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:33.880]  they're claiming that we've gotten a small amount of job increases yeah and in this last report there
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:39.880]  was a lot of uh part-time jobs too they weren't real jobs there was part-time jobs the government
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:47.400]  jobs and uh it's um i don't i don't think there's that much uh good news in that report at all
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:54.680]  congressman ron paul let's talk about the health care bill how it was passed what it really does the
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:13:00.680]  best ways you think the states can counter this i think we shouldn't just have lawsuits and and
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:09.080]  trust the federal courts uh state level nullification uh specifically on the health care uh uh bill
[03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:14.040]  you talked about obama being in bold and now he wants his carbon tax to try to pass that in the
[03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:22.920]  senate uh declaring co2 a toxic waste uh let's talk about uh health care legislation because
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:28.840]  we've seen obama say look it's been a few weeks since this past the birds are singing the sun is
[03:13:28.840 --> 03:13:34.680]  shining but he knows that this thing doesn't get phased in uh but until next year and the three
[03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:42.600]  years after that so that's a very deceptive game he's playing uh of perception and you know what
[03:13:42.600 --> 03:13:48.280]  he'll probably do is by that time whoever's in charge if he's there or whoever they'll say oh
[03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:55.160]  maybe we didn't do quite enough uh maybe maybe what we really need is a single payer system so
[03:13:55.160 --> 03:14:02.200]  failure to them is just another opportunity and uh if it's been the next year or the next six months
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:07.160]  the people only hear good news and they don't see what it's going to really cost uh you know he may
[03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:14.120]  get away with it for for a year um without it coming down hard on them but ultimately though
[03:14:14.120 --> 03:14:20.600]  it's a it's a it's an illusion to think that they can do what they claim and not cost any money and
[03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:28.040]  improve health care uh that that's a hard sell well you're a medical doctor yourself not just a
[03:14:28.040 --> 03:14:34.600]  congressman uh and and of course you're also um someone who's researched how the economy really
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:39.080]  works specifically uh for people that have questions about the health care legislation
[03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:45.400]  that's now law a what is in it that concerns you most b what do you think the most effective
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:55.000]  constitutional strategy is to defeat this well the process that if the people were awake enough
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:58.600]  and there were enough of us it would be just to change the congress change the president of appeal
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:05.640]  on that stuff i mean that that's the smoothest way to do it the part that bothers me the most of
[03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:10.840]  course the process that you talk about i mean how they pulled it off and you know we passed the rule
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:16.280]  and the rule passed the senate version and then they go to reconciliation that was horrible but
[03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:23.720]  i think philosophically the worst part was that they moved away from any opening for a private
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:27.720]  option you know they talk about a public option but what about a private option why don't
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:33.080]  why don't individuals have the right to get out fortunately some people you know opt out of the
[03:15:33.080 --> 03:15:38.680]  public school system and they have private schooling and homeschooling and uh why don't we
[03:15:38.680 --> 03:15:44.680]  have that in medicine let let them off now and that's the hsa approach but they minimize those
[03:15:44.680 --> 03:15:50.120]  it's much more difficult and if and if you opt out just say i don't want it i'll take care of
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:55.640]  myself i'll handle everything i don't want to be a board of the state you have to pay a fine you
[03:15:55.640 --> 03:16:03.880]  know pay your nine thousand dollars and that that to me was a big big move in the wrong direction
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:10.440]  and i if instead of thinking the day after like his path oh let's reveal the whole thing well
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:15.960]  yeah that'd be great if you you could but maybe if we would narrow it down and i want to introduce
[03:16:15.960 --> 03:16:24.280]  legislation to this just narrow it down to legalize a private option to get out take care of yourself
[03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:30.600]  and that might be less confusing than uh going through two thousand pages and explaining
[03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:36.040]  you know what is good what is bad what we're going to keep can you really get rid of everything
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:42.600]  you know that that whole thing so but uh i would like to see the day where we just have a change
[03:16:42.600 --> 03:16:47.080]  over in congress and we wouldn't be have to fighting these things over and over i mean they
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:54.760]  pass this stuff and then the people now are becoming more informed and they get upset so there's a
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:17:03.880]  lot of frustration out there turning into anger how do you what do you see as the best strategy
[03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:09.080]  to defeat this though at the state level i mean can't the states nullify this because it does
[03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:16.840]  force the states to pay for a large part of the federal mandate and so we have attorney generals
[03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:23.240]  now suing but i don't think that's enough i don't i don't i'm all for that if people want to do it
[03:17:23.240 --> 03:17:28.600]  but uh they're behind the eight ball there it is not going to be accomplished it's sort of like
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:33.880]  you know they take our highway funds and then they come and say well you get your highway funds from
[03:17:33.880 --> 03:17:37.640]  the federal government we're going to spend set your speed limit you everybody has to buy 55
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:43.560]  miles an hour you know that's what they did for 20 years uh and they say no we're not going to do
[03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:47.880]  that we're going to fight it we don't want that for a while all right we'll just keep your highway
[03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:53.400]  funds and that's what they'll do on medicare you know i mean what are you going to do repeal every
[03:17:53.400 --> 03:17:59.800]  state participation in Medicaid and this system and then they they they'll make the problems worse
[03:17:59.800 --> 03:18:06.360]  there are unfunded mandates they're going to have more unfunded mandates if they just you know try to
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:13.480]  ignore the law uh so i think it's if states want to do it and i think it's uh good that they're
[03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:19.240]  talking about it and they pass these resolutions that represents you know some good pr on how
[03:18:19.240 --> 03:18:25.160]  upset the people are but i don't think that is the solution the ultimate solution for all this is
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:31.240]  people having a better understanding and a better trust in the way the market works and the way
[03:18:31.240 --> 03:18:36.600]  freedom works and you don't need the government in any state taking care of us from cradle to grave
[03:18:36.600 --> 03:18:43.640]  if that isn't repealed that that attitude uh thinking around on the edges of the legislation
[03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:49.800]  won't do the trick congressman um you've talked about the fact that what's really going to end
[03:18:49.800 --> 03:18:57.000]  this is the country uh collapsing financially can you speak to that and then also as a medical
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:03.800]  doctor uh my dad's a physician and everyone knows that federal money comes in for abortion
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:09.480]  and then and then these hospitals and clinics just use money that they would have used for
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:14.360]  something else for the abortion and use the other federal money to pay for the other program so it's
[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:21.320]  a shell game yeah and that whole thing in that process which was very annoying when they couldn't
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:27.400]  agree on the abortion language so uh obama it was easy for him all right if you guys won't write a law
[03:19:27.400 --> 03:19:32.520]  i'll write a law i'll write my own law all right i'll send up an executive order and i will state
[03:19:32.520 --> 03:19:39.000]  the height of that now they argued back and forth some of the conservatives said oh well that won't
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:45.160]  count that isn't uh the executive order isn't the law of the land um i don't think that was the right
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:51.080]  argument because it is the law of the land the reason it isn't effective is what you hear that
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:58.040]  is that uh the height amendment i don't think ever did that much uh you have to strike all the funds
[03:19:58.040 --> 03:20:03.960]  to all these uh pregnancy centers that are doing abortion and they say well the height of them says
[03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:09.560]  you can't use any funds for abortion oh yeah but you can use them for birth control pills so
[03:20:10.280 --> 03:20:14.600]  they just shift them the money's all fungible and when the money gets shifted over they go
[03:20:14.600 --> 03:20:22.920]  ahead and do the abortion so that was that was all a con game but it emphasized the process
[03:20:22.920 --> 03:20:28.600]  on how that whole thing was being passed but this bill in addition to what i said earlier
[03:20:29.800 --> 03:20:39.880]  has put a lot more obstacles between the doctor and the patient we've always in recent years we've
[03:20:39.880 --> 03:20:46.360]  had insurance companies and hmo companies and drug companies but now we're going to have a lot of
[03:20:46.360 --> 03:20:52.920]  bureaucrats making decisions about how to practice health care and uh that that of course it'll
[03:20:52.920 --> 03:20:58.840]  cost a lot more money but the money's going to go to paying bureaucrats and paying extra people to
[03:20:58.840 --> 03:21:04.760]  push papers around so this is uh uh it's going to be costly and the care is going to go down and
[03:21:04.760 --> 03:21:10.920]  it's just a lot more people and they admit that with this a comparative care that now the bureaucrats
[03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:15.640]  will decide and they're actually in the news today saying look you won't get knee surgery you'll get a
[03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:26.680]  cortisone or steroid uh shot and oh well uh you'll get prozac uh will just basically
[03:21:27.400 --> 03:21:33.800]  drug you and so they cut Medicare and Medicaid they raise taxes and then they restrict benefits
[03:21:33.800 --> 03:21:41.240]  this is exactly what uh europe has done and uh you know Dennis Cassinus before he flip flopped
[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:45.400]  and others said this was nothing but a boondoggle for the insurance companies and i've looked at the
[03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:52.680]  lobbying numbers 90 plus percent of the big health care uh hmo insurance companies drug companies
[03:21:53.480 --> 03:21:57.480]  90 plus percent of the lobbying money went for this bill so isn't that a
[03:21:57.480 --> 03:22:04.920]  thing isn't this a red herring when they say oh the right wingers just don't want poor people to
[03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:10.520]  get care i mean really all this is is government coming in teamed teamed up with corporations
[03:22:10.520 --> 03:22:16.280]  uh to basically lower the standard of care but make more money i i i think that's absolutely
[03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:23.240]  right uh we we don't have the classical socialized medicine we're not on the verge of having that
[03:22:23.240 --> 03:22:28.520]  i don't even think obama was pushing it he was pushing for corporate medicine you know he was
[03:22:28.520 --> 03:22:34.040]  not to destroy the uh uh insurance companies they might have complained a bit to get their best
[03:22:34.040 --> 03:22:38.760]  deal but they're pretty happy right now you know they have a lot more customers that bill will be
[03:22:38.760 --> 03:22:44.920]  paid and and and they'll they'll do quite fine but we have we have the corporations get involved
[03:22:44.920 --> 03:22:49.640]  and you know we talked a lot about the military industrial complex there's a military i mean
[03:22:49.640 --> 03:22:55.720]  a medical industrial complex too you know the all the all the big corporations and government
[03:22:55.720 --> 03:23:02.840]  and they do spend a lot of money you know on lobbying so uh there's some big bucks made and if
[03:23:02.840 --> 03:23:08.200]  if we've conditioned somehow or another our country has been conditioned to believe that
[03:23:08.200 --> 03:23:13.960]  medicine is different you deliver medicine and the world does it better the government has to do
[03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:19.000]  with everybody has a right to medical care so therefore the government has to give you this
[03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:26.040]  right take care of it and we're not even close uh to change in that attitude as a matter of fact
[03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:32.840]  when i say that on tv it sort of shocks people what you're saying people i don't have a white
[03:23:32.840 --> 03:23:37.960]  to medical care of course not you ever write your life ever write your liberty you had a right to
[03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:42.200]  your your labor you could take care of your medical care well congressman i mean you you've been a
[03:23:42.200 --> 03:23:48.600]  medical doctor for 40 years i mean you know better than anybody uh that government involvement in
[03:23:48.600 --> 03:23:54.200]  health care in the last 40 years is what's added all these layers of costs and allow big uh corporate
[03:23:54.200 --> 03:23:59.560]  medical care to institutionalize things and get into people's bank accounts and so now it's only
[03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:08.520]  going to get worse that's right and um the companies will make a lot of money on it and the patient
[03:24:09.080 --> 03:24:16.360]  ultimately will become very unhappy and uh of course the doctors are more unhappy than ever before
[03:24:16.360 --> 03:24:20.600]  and who knows what will happen there of course there were threats that a lot of doctors would
[03:24:20.600 --> 03:24:25.000]  quit i'm not sure that's going to happen because they don't have a whole lot of options you know
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:31.160]  but they've been trained a long time to to practice medicine i mean they're going to have to find
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:38.120]  something else so uh they'll probably uh moan and groan and put up with one more layer of government
[03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:43.000]  that congressman shifting gears into some other subjects i don't know if you've seen this video
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:48.840]  yet but representative hank johnson said he didn't want us to be able to move more troops to guam
[03:24:48.840 --> 03:24:55.000]  because he was afraid that the floating island would capsize and and he was serious representative
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:25:01.560]  phil hare of illinois is on video last friday saying he quote doesn't worry about the constitution
[03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:07.080]  because you know health care is a right uh and and and so i mean as you've said many times it's not
[03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:11.960]  just some evil force in washington we know the globalist play into that we've also got a lot
[03:25:11.960 --> 03:25:18.280]  of other congressmen and government people that really are unfortunately is dumb as a box of rocks
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:22.680]  can you comment to people thinking that islands float and and that the constitution isn't important
[03:25:25.160 --> 03:25:32.920]  i can't i can't i didn't hear it but you say he sounded like he was serious yes that's pretty
[03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:43.160]  even pretty bizarre but um i think even there once was not going to a republican president that said
[03:25:43.160 --> 03:25:46.360]  something um rather careless about his conviction that we're supposed to follow the constitution
[03:25:46.360 --> 03:25:53.080]  i mean it i guess what it made us in shock is to actually say it we know they either are totally
[03:25:53.080 --> 03:25:57.880]  ignorant don't understand the constitution or they don't have any respect and they don't care about
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:04.680]  following but for them to say that oh we don't have to do that we don't want to do that we don't
[03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:12.760]  need to do that i think it's still shocking for somebody to actually say that it is um we've only
[03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:17.560]  got about three four minutes left with congressman ron paul today i wanted to bring up your son in
[03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:23.800]  kentucky uh rand paul in many polls ten points ahead the democrat and republican challengers
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:28.600]  showing that this anti-incumbency and this hunger for constitutionalist type candidate
[03:26:28.600 --> 03:26:34.040]  runs across party lines and the the republican party has in politico and other publications said
[03:26:34.600 --> 03:26:40.200]  they are gunning uh for your son who is a true conservative and and libertarian and of course
[03:26:40.200 --> 03:26:46.040]  as you know two weeks ago the federal uh the state election commission there ruled that trai
[03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:54.040]  grason can run the election commission uh and can oversee his own election uh no other state that
[03:26:54.040 --> 03:26:58.360]  i've seen has ever allowed this type of conflict of interest uh can you speak to that as a new
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:04.600]  level of corruption and and any concern uh that you have uh for the election coming up in kentucky
[03:27:04.600 --> 03:27:09.400]  well i i'm very concerned about it i'm shocked that they allowed that to happen but you think
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:15.480]  politically uh they ran a campaign to get the mileage out of that and get get the people on
[03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:19.880]  their side but that might not change the outcome of election a close election doesn't take a whole
[03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:27.400]  lot of work and effort to uh to change things so um i i think it's i've urged to make sure they have
[03:27:27.400 --> 03:27:34.760]  the poll watchers and different programs do everything conceivable uh to uh to you know to
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:41.400]  try to protect themselves but you know to me it's uh but we we we probably all have these perfect
[03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:46.280]  elections united states you know we go cross overseas and start wars to think about it run
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:52.840]  put on this election so uh i guess i i guess we better have faith in our system well i mean
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:57.720]  there's no doubt that he is the chief election official running the election and the kentucky
[03:27:57.720 --> 03:28:03.640]  executive branch ethics commission said that was fine i mean this is a felony in uh in most states
[03:28:03.640 --> 03:28:08.760]  people have to recuse themselves i mean on its face he's got all these employees that know
[03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:13.320]  that they're going to end up being in a senatorial office so even if he doesn't want to cheat
[03:28:13.320 --> 03:28:17.640]  i mean there's no doubt you're going to end up having uh county officials and others that have
[03:28:17.640 --> 03:28:22.520]  been promised jobs uh that are going to steal votes if it looks like their candidate's going to lose
[03:28:22.520 --> 03:28:27.720]  and your son's 10 points ahead and so if he doesn't win ladies and gentlemen something is rotten in
[03:28:27.720 --> 03:28:34.760]  the state of venmark i want to tell you that you think you think if they were honest about what
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:39.960]  was going on they wouldn't want to even be close to it you know uh because if they figure they're
[03:28:39.960 --> 03:28:44.600]  going to win and uh they pulled off and win legitimately nobody's going to believe it anyway
[03:28:44.600 --> 03:28:49.160]  but you would you would think they would be you know the great people would be the ones that would
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:55.080]  want to be uh away from it so that they wouldn't have that controversy amazing folks can find
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:29:00.280]  out more at the campaign for liberty dot com congressman ron paul's our guest the last 45
[03:29:00.280 --> 03:29:05.320]  seconds uh the democrats are really starting to talk about censoring the internet censoring talk
[03:29:05.320 --> 03:29:10.120]  radio if they'll violate the constitution on all these other fronts why not there are you
[03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:15.080]  concerned about restrictions on free speech cyber security oh yeah oh yeah i think you know i think
[03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:21.480]  the other day when we had a cyber security vote i don't know that was anybody else but uh anything
[03:29:21.480 --> 03:29:27.480]  touching the internet or communications i will not vote for and they're always wanting to do that
[03:29:27.480 --> 03:29:32.440]  no i think this i think some of the talk i've heard about this but we need more government
[03:29:33.320 --> 03:29:38.920]  management of the media to get a better balance uh pretty scary stuff so uh
[03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:44.120]  congressman congressman we're going to break i know you've got to go but i'm gonna tell you

[03:34:25.240 --> 03:34:30.840]  it wrong but uh that just happens when you're dealing with people's um schedulers and we've
[03:34:30.840 --> 03:34:36.040]  got schedulers and there's time zones and there's traveling going on but jessie ventura on a host
[03:34:36.040 --> 03:34:42.680]  of issues he kicks off a new week-long speaking tour tomorrow on this radio show

[03:35:03.800 --> 03:35:08.840]  before us uh to cover the news and take your phone calls and that's good because there's a lot of
[03:35:08.840 --> 03:35:15.560]  important things we need to go over dr paul craig roberts is on with us on wednesday he said goodbye
[03:35:15.560 --> 03:35:21.480]  truth is fallen and taken liberty with it but he's doing a few radio and tv interviews before he says
[03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:28.840]  cyanara and retires from the fight against the new world order at least for now you know when i
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:35.480]  talked to him a week and a half ago when he first put out this uh basic re resignation from the fight
[03:35:35.480 --> 03:35:41.960]  you know he just said at least for the time being he he's done with a big column twice a week and uh
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:49.720]  hey he's been fighting this stuff for many years and it's not up to any of us to do it all ourselves
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:55.000]  it's just up to each and every one of us to do what we can and to try to inform and wake up and
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:36:07.080]  warn as many people uh as we possibly can okay i want to get into the environmental movement who
[03:36:07.080 --> 03:36:16.760]  they really are and what their in game is and the fact that in cooked polls upwards of 55 percent
[03:36:16.760 --> 03:36:20.920]  of people believe they're a group of criminal fraudsters who just want to tax and control our
[03:36:20.920 --> 03:36:31.240]  lives uh every environmental show every wildlife show on cable tv every textbook everything i've
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:41.960]  ever seen the last 30 years every textbook i had in public school every show about wales or dolphins
[03:36:41.960 --> 03:36:51.400]  or giraffes or monkeys or apes or dinosaurs it just doesn't matter is all a brainwashing event
[03:36:51.400 --> 03:36:55.800]  to teach humans that we're bad we're evil and the government's going to restrict your lifestyle
[03:36:55.800 --> 03:37:02.600]  for your own good not to enslave you but for your own good and so if you look at polls from
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:10.440]  say five years ago 60 plus percent bought into the propaganda because it was culturally and morally
[03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:16.680]  the thing to do if you were a caring person we've seen a flip-flop of that number now the majority
[03:37:16.680 --> 03:37:23.720]  and that's in mainstream usa today cnn cooked polls where they go to their constituents people
[03:37:24.600 --> 03:37:29.560]  demographics that they know are going to give them a pro environmentalist takeover slant
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:41.560]  they go to them and 55 upwards of 60 percent depending on the poll show that uh some other
[03:37:41.560 --> 03:37:46.280]  focus groups and studies i've seen the last few months since climate gate broke back in
[03:37:46.280 --> 03:37:53.000]  november last year show that upwards of 80 plus percent know it's a fraud and when you get big
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:59.320]  environmental congressmen like hank johnson in a global warming rant talking about islands
[03:37:59.320 --> 03:38:05.240]  capsizing tumping over and even does the hand gesture he says the island will flip over there's
[03:38:05.240 --> 03:38:11.320]  too many people on it uh it's going to go to 90 percent very quickly because this is really a
[03:38:11.320 --> 03:38:16.120]  peer pressure type thing and as as people learn it's okay to come out and talk about global
[03:38:16.120 --> 03:38:21.160]  warming being a fraud the whole thing falls apart it's like gondy said first they ignore you then
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:30.680]  they laugh at you then they attack you then you win and we've now entered the attack phase and so
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:36.040]  we've seen green peace we've seen the founder of the gaya movement we've seen the un uh we've seen
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:42.520]  them all say okay it doesn't matter if you don't want a green global government a green world order
[03:38:42.520 --> 03:38:47.880]  that's what the un called it in fact guys i forgot to print it for this piece i'm about to do uh it
[03:38:47.880 --> 03:38:52.600]  was a watson article about a month ago it was actually in the un document the headline is
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:39:00.120]  un calls for green world order that's their quote and it is just to to say it's hellish
[03:39:00.120 --> 03:39:07.880]  what is a word a word is only a word hellish authoritarian control is real and is indescribable
[03:39:07.880 --> 03:39:14.360]  until you've been through it and just my investigations into corruption and oppression
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:20.760]  have scarred me fundamentally and i've grown up in a great country in a great state with great parents
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:25.960]  and uh i did see government drug dealing in high school i did see corruption
[03:39:29.560 --> 03:39:34.680]  i was attacked by by illegal aliens i mean i have experienced the fruits of the new world order
[03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:39.320]  but i've also experienced all the good things in our world that the government likes to take credit
[03:39:39.320 --> 03:39:45.640]  for no the world is a great place despite what they're doing and obama knows this is why he says
[03:39:45.640 --> 03:39:51.800]  oh the birds are still tweeting the you know it's still a beautiful day there's flowers there's trees
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:57.480]  there's the sky how many times have i made that point over the years they know it's a beautiful
[03:39:57.480 --> 03:40:01.640]  wonderful world it's a blessing to be in it they know there's all this good in the world
[03:40:01.640 --> 03:40:05.720]  and they always take credit for all the good and then they know you don't recognize the evil because
[03:40:05.720 --> 03:40:10.680]  it's masquerading is good and they know that there's this whole backdrop but
[03:40:13.960 --> 03:40:18.040]  yeah here's the headline leaked you and documents real plan for green world order
[03:40:18.760 --> 03:40:24.760]  by 2012 so they're now shifting gears and they've announced what this shift means
[03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:32.360]  and so i want to break this down in detail because greenpeace is now saying we know where you live
[03:40:32.360 --> 03:40:36.680]  we're coming after you we're going to get violent and all these big environmental groups have always
[03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:46.120]  had auxiliary secret uh it's like shin fein in ireland then has a secret violent arm but now
[03:40:46.120 --> 03:40:49.880]  they're coming out in the open with their malice brigades that work for the banks
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:58.600]  so we're going to break all this down today and tie it into the media demonizing gun owners
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:04.200]  conservatives setting up the poor hitari militia clearly a hundred percent innocent now and set up
[03:41:04.760 --> 03:41:10.200]  but i wanted to dovetail that first segue uh with the corbett report he does a great job
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:15.480]  now this video is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but i i broke down in a
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:21.160]  ten minute interview what the cashless society is and then that ties into the environmental
[03:41:21.160 --> 03:41:25.880]  takeover so let's go ahead and play uh part of this uh ten minute piece and then i will uh go to
[03:41:25.880 --> 03:41:31.080]  break and come back and get into the fact that we're intellectually and politically beating
[03:41:31.720 --> 03:41:37.960]  the blood thirsty greens who are a bunch of murderous control freaks on record they've done
[03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:42.840]  psychological studies of them uh and uh how they're going to now get even more violent
[03:41:43.880 --> 03:41:47.480]  they don't care if you know they're a fraud they've got the guns they've got the government
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:52.120]  they're coming but first let's break down the cashless society control grid here it is hello
[03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:56.760]  this is james corbett of corbett report dot com and welcoming you back to economics 101
[03:41:56.760 --> 03:42:02.280]  and today i'm honored to be joined on the line by alex jones the radio talk show host documentary
[03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:08.760]  filmmaker economic analyst political commentator and general mastermind behind info wars dot com
[03:42:08.760 --> 03:42:12.680]  and prison planet dot tv alex jones thank you for joining me today on the program
[03:42:14.520 --> 03:42:19.000]  quite an introduction thanks for having me i love your important work you're doing excellent
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:24.440]  well uh today i'd like to talk specifically about the the moves towards the cashless society
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:29.400]  that we've been seeing coming from every angle lately uh we've seen this in numerous moves such
[03:42:29.400 --> 03:42:34.520]  as uh peter aliff the head of visa europe having said that he wanted to see a cashless society by
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:40.040]  2012 we've seen the national irish bank moving towards cashless banking uh we've seen even
[03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:46.040]  trivial examples of uh children's games being changed to use cashless forms of payment we've
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:51.000]  seen this coming from so many angles that it seems to be a coordinated agenda so what's your take on
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:56.120]  what this agenda is and why it's so important for the economic elite to bring in a cashless society
[03:42:58.520 --> 03:43:04.760]  well it's neo feudalism it's serfdom you have the private banking cartels that control the issuance
[03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:11.640]  of currency and credit worldwide openly announcing the formation of a global constitution between
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:19.160]  the g20 banks openly setting up world government and bypassing the nation states and the people
[03:43:19.160 --> 03:43:24.280]  that live in those republics and supposed democracies and so what's happening is you
[03:43:24.280 --> 03:43:33.640]  have the artificial fiat parasite economy waging war against the real main street economy or the
[03:43:34.360 --> 03:43:39.720]  agrarian or manufacturing economy and everything they do in their own documents is meant to
[03:43:39.720 --> 03:43:45.720]  uh make us dependent on government and to be able to track and trace everything we're doing
[03:43:45.720 --> 03:43:50.920]  to be able to turn our national ID cards off to be able to stop us from buying and selling
[03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:57.640]  and engaging in commerce everything that the world government pushes for is globally controlling
[03:43:58.280 --> 03:44:04.120]  taxes and regulations so that you can't have what they call tax havens because we're gonna have a
[03:44:04.120 --> 03:44:09.240]  80 percent taxes in france uh that will make people move away from france to say the us
[03:44:09.240 --> 03:44:14.360]  where we have roughly 50 percent taxation so all of these collectivist planners
[03:44:15.720 --> 03:44:21.080]  who run this system talk about how important it is that everything we do be transparent to them
[03:44:21.080 --> 03:44:26.840]  and that we have no privacy so they can micromanage and track every facet of our lives and so
[03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:34.840]  every major technological rollout that we see is about making us completely dependent on the system
[03:44:34.840 --> 03:44:40.120]  and getting us into a system of over taxation regulation so that all your smaller businesses
[03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:46.920]  and corporations and family owned institutions are phased out and only the fortune 100 control the
[03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:52.360]  world and then they will also continue warring with each other to consolidate the power and so
[03:44:52.360 --> 03:45:00.600]  that's what all of this is about they admit that that's what this is about and but that's only a
[03:45:00.600 --> 03:45:07.400]  means to an end the end is what i cover in my film end game once they have the planetary
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:13.640]  casual society surveillance grid that the pentagon is designed in place with a license plate reading
[03:45:13.640 --> 03:45:19.560]  cameras the face scanning cameras where everyone is buying and selling according to rfid where all
[03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:26.200]  products have rfid in it they can track the real world just like google can track cyberspace
[03:45:26.200 --> 03:45:35.640]  and it actually allows them to predict human activity along the mass or group dynamics right
[03:45:35.640 --> 03:45:41.720]  down to individual choices you're going to make with upwards of a 99 percentile accuracy rate so
[03:45:41.720 --> 03:45:48.040]  it's also about imitating god they want to control the weather they openly say this they want to
[03:45:48.040 --> 03:45:55.320]  control reproduction they want to be able to control all of the agrarian farming and ranching
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:46:01.800]  that's going on they want to be able to have omnipresence type surveillance so this is literally
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:09.320]  a crystal ball of control where they know what really makes us tick by tracking our purchases
[03:46:09.320 --> 03:46:14.680]  the choices we make what we watch on television where we surf on the internet the laptops watching
[03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:23.720]  the school children even when they're at home this is tools in the hands of these people that
[03:46:23.720 --> 03:46:31.000]  tyrants like hitler and stalin and mal could only dream of or probably couldn't even uh dream of
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:37.240]  and that's why i have the website prisonplanet.com because in the elite's own statements they say
[03:46:37.240 --> 03:46:44.760]  they're creating a giant worldwide prison and the final equation world government is only the
[03:46:44.760 --> 03:46:50.360]  beginning once they have it in place they will then stop just beta testing cancer viruses and
[03:46:50.360 --> 03:46:56.280]  vaccines and sodium fluoride other poisons in the water and all the major GMO crops in every study
[03:46:56.280 --> 03:47:03.080]  sterilizing the rodents and other lab animals that it's tested on they will then accelerate
[03:47:03.080 --> 03:47:09.800]  from soft kill to hard kill and kill at least 80 of the world's population well that's right this
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:16.200]  agenda is so vast it's almost mind-boggling and and as vast as it is it's also that ambitious
[03:47:16.200 --> 03:47:20.440]  so so what do you see as a time frame for implementation of this cashless society
[03:47:23.160 --> 03:47:29.960]  i've seen statistics have already over 90 of purchases in europe are digital cashless uh
[03:47:29.960 --> 03:47:36.040]  upwards of 90 in asia in japan in south korea in uh the major cities of china
[03:47:38.440 --> 03:47:44.200]  it's uh close to that in the united states and they're running psas on television worldwide
[03:47:44.200 --> 03:47:51.480]  demonizing cash as if it's dirty and bad because once the cashless grid is in place then the bankers
[03:47:51.480 --> 03:47:56.600]  can completely abandon any connection to reality and instead of having fractional reserve banking
[03:47:57.160 --> 03:48:03.480]  for every dollar or every yen or yawn or euro that the banks have they can loan out 10 dollars
[03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:11.720]  of money that doesn't exist now they can take that derivatives model of unlimited uh digital money
[03:48:11.720 --> 03:48:16.680]  and uh really expand their monopoly of power over currency and credit and take over the whole
[03:48:16.680 --> 03:48:24.760]  planet so we're basically already there they're just beta testing final pieces of it and by 2015
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:30.600]  unless people resist uh we will be locked into a cashless society control grid similar to the
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:36.680]  no fly list i saw governor rich seven years ago the new head of homeland security when it was first
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:42.200]  funded as a cabinet position say that if you're not in good favor with the government your national
[03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:47.400]  ID card will be turned off you won't be able to work so the no fly will be a no work you won't be
[03:48:47.400 --> 03:48:53.400]  able to own a gun there's no judge no jury no due process you're just put on these lists uh and
[03:48:53.400 --> 03:48:58.280]  they can put whatever disinformation they want in these databases uh and so we're basically there
[03:48:58.280 --> 03:49:05.720]  it just gets worse and worse as we go further downhill uh into uh what can only be described as
[03:49:05.720 --> 03:49:13.560]  a uh antichrist type system i mean even if you're not a christian you should be able to look at this
[03:49:13.560 --> 03:49:19.960]  and see how it's been set up to be an authoritarian controlling model where you will neither buy nor
[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:25.720]  sell without this without this mark and it's interesting to note that the the the unified
[03:49:25.720 --> 03:49:32.680]  treaties on global standardization for ids have a thumb print a hand print and a face print all
[03:49:32.680 --> 03:49:39.320]  all rolled into one on the id let he with understanding reckon the number of the beast

[03:54:43.080 --> 03:54:56.760]  call in on any issues they wish you'd discuss 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 there's also been
[03:54:56.760 --> 03:55:01.160]  some important new developments only further confirming what we already knew that the five
[03:55:01.160 --> 03:55:06.840]  state militia raids were provocateur in stage to create the perception that there are all these
[03:55:06.840 --> 03:55:11.640]  right-wing terrorists out there so when the government stages more terror attacks they
[03:55:11.640 --> 03:55:18.680]  can be blamed on the american people we're going to be going over that also we're hearing about
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:24.040]  some of the people that obama wants to nominate for the two supreme court vacancies that are set to
[03:55:25.400 --> 03:55:32.600]  be developed in the next year with ruth beter ginsburg and of course just as stevens we're
[03:55:32.600 --> 03:55:38.280]  going to get into open discussion of the u.s losing its triple a rating bond and what that
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:44.600]  will mean to our society also obama says beck limbaugh fuel troublesome political climate this
[03:55:44.600 --> 03:55:54.760]  is out of ap of course he did that cbs interview last week we're going to talk about that today
[03:55:56.760 --> 03:56:05.080]  as well and get into several other stacks of important news that i haven't even begun to
[03:56:05.080 --> 03:56:12.600]  mention yet more on the government takeover of health care as well but as i start the second
[03:56:12.600 --> 03:56:19.560]  hour i will in two segments break down the environmental cult that is taking over and
[03:56:19.560 --> 03:56:27.480]  running our society also i just want to encourage listeners and fellow info warriors out there
[03:56:28.200 --> 03:56:33.640]  to not be depressed by everything that's happening this just proves that those of us that were
[03:56:33.640 --> 03:56:37.800]  concerned who studied history those of us that had studied the elites that are in control of our
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:45.080]  society have been correct and so this evil was already there it was already quietly taking over
[03:56:45.080 --> 03:56:52.840]  now it's more in the open because we're very late in the game but the time for denial is over
[03:56:53.400 --> 03:56:58.600]  and everyone i talk to is seeing people wake up who laughed at them when they warned them about
[03:56:58.600 --> 03:57:05.320]  world government years ago and so i just want to encourage listeners out there to continue
[03:57:05.320 --> 03:57:10.680]  to spread the word that's the number one thing is that people be aware of the type of enemy we
[03:57:10.680 --> 03:57:17.080]  face knowing is half the battle to use a cheesy gi joe line but that actually goes back to world
[03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:21.880]  war two when they said knowing you know who your enemy is and where they are is half the battle the
[03:57:21.880 --> 03:57:27.880]  rest is initiative well a lot of people are ready to be awakened but they're not awakened yet and
[03:57:27.880 --> 03:57:33.320]  so it is so vital to wake people up and whether you tell folks about the free apple iphone or
