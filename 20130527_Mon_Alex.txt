[00:00.000 --> 00:11.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.880 --> 00:19.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.560 --> 00:35.000]  Alex Jones
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.320]  well I'll tell you I love it when we get somebody like this around I feel like I
[00:39.320 --> 00:43.240]  know him so good as I've interviewed him probably 20 30 times over the years and
[00:43.240 --> 00:49.040]  I played so many clips of him on the air and I also like to watch his church
[00:49.040 --> 00:54.040]  services from Montana used to be in Florida he gave a really good one that I
[00:54.040 --> 00:59.240]  saw a couple weeks ago talking about the connection from the past to now which
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.360]  really resonated with me but he went through the Bible verses of everything
[01:03.360 --> 01:08.600]  our ancestors did against tyranny is for naught if we don't continue it it's like
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.280]  electricity and you think about your grandmother her grandmother your
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.400]  grandfather going back they all love that person took care of them and then
[01:17.400 --> 01:20.920]  the next person was born and it's like electricity there's a genetic line but
[01:20.920 --> 01:25.720]  also a training everything spiritual right back the people 50 generations
[01:25.720 --> 01:32.400]  ago a hundred generations ago and it's just amazing but I'm already going off
[01:32.400 --> 01:37.160]  into his sermon on that perhaps tonight on the nightly news we can get into some
[01:37.160 --> 01:41.480]  of the bigger issues here that but you've got a new book out he's put two
[01:41.480 --> 01:45.880]  books out with his son is constitutional lawyer Timothy Baldwin pastor Chuck
[01:45.880 --> 01:49.560]  Baldwin's here there's a little short five-minute segment some stations don't
[01:49.560 --> 01:53.400]  carry it so we'll really come back in a moment but the new one is to keep or not
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.000]  to keep why Christians should not give up their guns a biblical perspective and
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.560]  even if you're not a Christian 77% of this country says they're a Christian
[02:01.560 --> 02:06.880]  and they Billy Graham and his son you know turn your guns in oh please you
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.600]  know IRS harass us they are government minions more and more and you know Chuck
[02:12.600 --> 02:15.000]  knows all these people he's been those big national councils with them and the
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.140]  rest of it we're going to talk about how we take the churches back in America
[02:19.140 --> 02:22.500]  today I want to get into that I want to get into the scandals what else do you
[02:22.500 --> 02:27.200]  want to get in today Chuck Alex first of all just it's great to be with you it's
[02:27.200 --> 02:30.200]  good to have you here my friends good to see the studio good to see your staff
[02:30.200 --> 02:36.040]  good to see what you're doing here from Austin see me stomping around see you
[02:36.040 --> 02:39.840]  behind the camera it's terrific to be here thank you very much and and all
[02:39.840 --> 02:43.680]  these issues you're talking about are the issues that all of us are addressing
[02:43.680 --> 02:47.240]  in our own venues and you know we've been in Montana now for about three
[02:47.240 --> 02:52.680]  years and loving it just you know love what God is doing for us there and the
[02:52.680 --> 02:55.920]  Flathead Valley of Montana got a brand new church up there called Liberty
[02:55.920 --> 03:01.360]  Fellowship Alex it's a non 501c3 Church and that's exciting to me because we
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.360]  don't have to work about any of that and we've got hundreds of people that are
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.780]  coming and attending and excited and our our Liberty Fellowship video messages
[03:10.780 --> 03:14.600]  are online thousands of people are watching we got hundreds and hundreds of
[03:14.600 --> 03:18.400]  people that are watching us live every Sunday afternoon as we live stream the
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.800]  broadcast across America a lot of people have are fed up they can't find the
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.640]  church that they can attend there's no Patriot pastor in the pulpit so they
[03:27.640 --> 03:33.320]  watch us every Sunday afternoon at 2 30 mountain time and their home or the
[03:33.320 --> 03:37.520]  living room they have community centers have a VFW post whatever it may be they
[03:37.520 --> 03:42.760]  gather around the TV and you're teaching the old real Christianity not not the
[03:42.760 --> 03:46.440]  new thing and you were telling me I was on the phone that you know people that
[03:46.440 --> 03:49.400]  aren't even Christians coming now yeah because that's what originally attracted
[03:49.400 --> 03:51.960]  people was the message of Liberty where there is the Spirit of the Lord there
[03:51.960 --> 03:55.040]  is Liberty right and a lot of people that come and then they don't know the
[03:55.040 --> 03:58.320]  Lord after coming for a little while and they hear the message of truth and the
[03:58.320 --> 04:01.680]  message of Liberty from the scripture that's not being preached usually they
[04:01.680 --> 04:04.920]  wind up accepting the Lord and becoming a Christian so that you know that's
[04:04.920 --> 04:07.360]  really exciting but you're not beating people over the head with it no we just
[04:07.360 --> 04:10.120]  it's all these Pharisee preachers that turn everybody away just preach the
[04:10.120 --> 04:14.720]  truth and and you know all truth comes from Christ he is the way the truth in
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.700]  life all truth comes from Christ and that means all truth ultimately leads to
[04:18.700 --> 04:22.280]  Christ so when you preach the truth and that includes the truth of Liberty and
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.800]  freedom and constitutional government and the principles that God has
[04:25.800 --> 04:29.400]  inculcated in his word relative to freedom when you preach that it's going
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.680]  to ultimately lead back to Christ I mean you can't help but absolutely Chuck
[04:33.680 --> 04:37.360]  Baldwin's our guest we're gonna get into the IRS scandals Ben Ghazi get his take
[04:37.360 --> 04:42.600]  on the brutal beheading by a Muslim extremist after they ran a British
[04:42.600 --> 04:46.440]  trooper over and people are saying that's a false flag I don't think it is
[04:46.440 --> 04:52.320]  this is some morons but the West has been radicalizing Islam for the clash of
[04:52.320 --> 04:55.660]  civilizations and they can take our liberties we're gonna break that down as

[08:10.560 --> 08:15.080]  you're listening to Alex Jones
[08:25.080 --> 08:28.920]  well pastor Chuck Baldwin is our guest syndicated talk show host best-selling
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.160]  author very popular presidential nominee and candidate for the Constitution Party
[08:33.160 --> 08:36.760]  actually a lot of national attention listed in the Mayak Homeland Security
[08:36.760 --> 08:42.280]  Report as an evil extremist along with Ron Paul and others do not dare dare
[08:42.280 --> 08:45.720]  listen to what he has to say it's so horrible and of course you know the
[08:45.720 --> 08:50.040]  thing worse is a returning veteran or a libertarian or constitutionalist or in
[08:50.040 --> 08:53.000]  Colorado they're openly the state police have admitted the feds are asking him
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.160]  are you prepared to confiscate Christians guns that was in the Denver
[08:56.160 --> 09:02.080]  Post and even Fox News reports that oh they now list evangelicals and Catholics
[09:02.080 --> 09:08.880]  next to al-qaeda in the army training manuals so I guess they also badmouth
[09:08.880 --> 09:12.000]  towards Washington so you're in you're in you're in good company I'm not that's
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.240]  not satire folks now we just had legendary satirist Mike Judge of King of
[09:16.240 --> 09:20.160]  the Hill and so much more and that big exclusive interview but this is not
[09:20.160 --> 09:26.040]  satire and by the way we're carrying both of his powerful books these really
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.280]  could change the face of this country which is starting to happen Romans 13
[09:30.280 --> 09:34.360]  the true meaning of submission this was Hitler's favorite verse to say you know
[09:34.360 --> 09:37.920]  render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars do what the government says when
[09:37.920 --> 09:41.440]  it's actually the opposite of what the Bible says it's full of it's got to be
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.360]  50 or something Bible verses in here great book history but the new one is to
[09:46.360 --> 09:50.860]  keep or not to keep why Christians should not give up their guns by
[09:50.860 --> 09:55.240]  Timothy Baldwin who is a constitutional lawyer his and of course his dad a
[09:55.240 --> 10:01.240]  pastor Charles Oh Chuck Baldwin and you know he's on with us right now for the
[10:01.240 --> 10:04.160]  rest of the hour he's gonna be on on whatever he wants to cover on the
[10:04.160 --> 10:07.760]  nightly news tonight the real reasons he's here is to be interviewed or Obama
[10:07.760 --> 10:11.680]  deception too and of course he was kind enough to come here I guess it didn't
[10:11.680 --> 10:14.600]  get relayed when I said set him up for Obama deception to that that was why he
[10:14.600 --> 10:19.280]  was here but now now he knows that's why he's here so much going on you know a
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.640]  lot of stuff goes into making the sausage around here folks you don't want
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.520]  to see it happen but before we get into all of this and both these books are
[10:25.520 --> 10:29.280]  available at info war store comm and purchasing there also supports the work
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.520]  we're doing in this whole operation we've built before we get into that
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.920]  coming out saying yeah we'll kill US citizens with drones no judge no jury
[10:37.920 --> 10:43.080]  and now they executed one of the Patsy's who supposedly knew the Patsy bombers at
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.560]  the Boston thing just we don't know how I really have we just shot him in the
[10:46.560 --> 10:50.080]  head of his house and I'm afraid they'll come shoot me in the head and say I
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.480]  resisted or something I mean this is what authoritarian systems tend to do
[10:54.480 --> 11:00.360]  we've got really a clash happening an awakening is happening how big you know
[11:00.360 --> 11:03.600]  it is questionable that it appears to be giant from what I've seen but while the
[11:03.600 --> 11:08.620]  evil is also on the offense I wanted to ask Chuck Baldwin pastor Chuck Baldwin
[11:08.620 --> 11:14.600]  his take on the state of the world in general and this tectonic historic
[11:14.600 --> 11:19.040]  battle that's taking place but first off great to have you here my friend what do
[11:19.040 --> 11:25.840]  you think of the studios now that you've had a tour fantastic it's great it's
[11:25.840 --> 11:28.680]  great to meet the staff you got some wonderful people working around you
[11:28.680 --> 11:33.120]  you've got some great facilities building a brand new studio it's it's
[11:33.120 --> 11:37.920]  awesome I mean if what people see on the camera is just a small portion of what
[11:37.920 --> 11:41.280]  it takes to run this show and Alex you to be commended you're doing a great
[11:41.280 --> 11:44.400]  job you got millions of people out there they love you and praying for you I mean
[11:44.400 --> 11:47.000]  I just wanted to get so many people obviously want to come see the office
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.640]  but then we'd have fans outside the door so it's kind of a private facility it's
[11:50.640 --> 11:54.680]  just that we are trying to go to the next level and so I appreciate your good
[11:54.680 --> 11:59.920]  report like you said in your in your sermon you gave you know he has given a
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.880]  good report okay where would you like to begin here today I've thrown out a lot
[12:03.880 --> 12:08.060]  of stuff I tell you what I'd like to begin with the book because I really
[12:08.060 --> 12:12.920]  believe that this book to keep or not to keep why Christians should not give up
[12:12.920 --> 12:17.400]  their guns could revolutionize the churches of America and literally could
[12:17.400 --> 12:20.960]  change the course of the country you know when we went through this last
[12:20.960 --> 12:26.440]  debacle with Feinstein and Obama trying to cram this gun control legislation
[12:26.440 --> 12:30.920]  down our throats it would have happened except for millions of people freedom
[12:30.920 --> 12:35.580]  loving god-fearing people rose up and said no you're not taking my
[12:35.580 --> 12:39.080]  semi-automatic rifles we are not going to tolerate any more gun control and
[12:39.080 --> 12:44.120]  they rose up with such a voice that it didn't even pass the US Senate Democrat
[12:44.120 --> 12:49.480]  controlled US Senate so we want a temporary victory but the thing that we
[12:49.480 --> 12:55.040]  noticed Alex was that the pastors of the churches were absolutely silent they
[12:55.040 --> 13:00.200]  were not even engaged whatsoever they took no stand in fact some of them just
[13:00.200 --> 13:03.600]  said well we should do whatever the government says and so we recognize that
[13:03.600 --> 13:07.920]  as we my son Tim and I that there wasn't anything out there in book form
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.000]  addressing this subject and so we set out to do that and we we really put our
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.600]  hearts and our minds in this we put together we've got hundreds and hundreds
[13:17.600 --> 13:20.920]  and hundreds of Bible verses you know it's been a lot of books written on the
[13:20.920 --> 13:24.640]  Second Amendment from a constitutional point of view or historical point of
[13:24.640 --> 13:29.320]  view Alex is not a book out there anywhere that I know the book came in a
[13:29.320 --> 13:33.240]  couple weeks ago I could not put it down and the issue is even if you're not a
[13:33.240 --> 13:37.520]  Christian out there or religious folks they have captures of the World Council
[13:37.520 --> 13:42.120]  of Churches and ecumenicalism and all of it the churches major Methodist churches
[13:42.120 --> 13:46.440]  are taking the crosses out from San Francisco to Austin Texas they're
[13:46.440 --> 13:50.600]  sending in change agents who are really globalist operatives the Southern
[13:50.600 --> 13:53.880]  Baptist Convention is saying okay there's no Second Amendment major
[13:53.880 --> 13:57.240]  Catholic publications are coming out saying time to repeal that's the
[13:57.240 --> 14:01.720]  headline Second Amendment explain how the country was founded pastor is also a
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.240]  historian and versus what they've done now I mean the globalists knew they had
[14:07.240 --> 14:11.600]  to get the churches and folks you need to know that if you're in one of these
[14:11.600 --> 14:15.240]  501c3s worshiping the government you might as well move to North Korea and
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.440]  worship Kim Jong-un yeah the history of our country is is really the history of
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.820]  the church there would have been no Bunker Hill there would have been no
[14:24.820 --> 14:28.400]  Lexington Green there have been no Concord Bridge no Declaration of
[14:28.400 --> 14:31.920]  Independence there would have been no United States of America had it not been
[14:31.920 --> 14:37.800]  for the pastors of colonial America that the British crown called the black
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.720]  regiment they were they called them that because the long black robes they wore
[14:41.720 --> 14:45.160]  in the pulpit but these were men like Jonas Clark pastor the Church of
[14:45.160 --> 14:50.400]  Lexington for example that taught their congregants what the biblical principles
[14:50.400 --> 14:53.680]  were relative to freedom and liberty the Second Amendment the preservation of
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.040]  life the protection of life etc so when the British troops ascended upon
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.200]  Lexington talk to those folks out there talk to the preachers there they are
[15:03.200 --> 15:07.680]  I'm pointing at the camera tell them when they when they ascended on
[15:07.680 --> 15:16.880]  Lexington in April 1970 75 it was it was the minutemen of that that time that
[15:16.880 --> 15:22.040]  they called in history now we're really nothing more than the congregation of
[15:22.040 --> 15:26.400]  the Church of Lexington pastored by Jonas Clark these men have been taught
[15:26.400 --> 15:31.760]  the principles of liberty of freedom of self-defense etc they knew where the
[15:31.760 --> 15:35.400]  line was drawn they knew that we only have one sovereign and that's not
[15:35.400 --> 15:41.240]  government it's God it's the Lord Jesus Christ and that any authority human
[15:41.240 --> 15:47.600]  authority that tramples the rights of others that abridges the parameters and
[15:47.600 --> 15:51.800]  jurisdiction that God is granted to it in Scripture they become tyrannical and
[15:51.800 --> 15:56.040]  they must be resisted because there's only one King and that's and that's not
[15:56.040 --> 16:00.120]  King George or it's not the president it's the Lord Jesus Christ so the
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.720]  congregants at the Church of Lexington understood this and when the British
[16:03.720 --> 16:09.040]  troops came 800 of them there was about 70 75 men from the Church of Lexington
[16:09.040 --> 16:13.360]  that stood on Lexington green right outside the church where they worshipped
[16:13.360 --> 16:18.960]  every Sunday with their muskets in hand and they formed a line of defense the
[16:18.960 --> 16:23.360]  British saw them open fire eight men were immediately killed they returned
[16:23.360 --> 16:26.880]  fire in self-defense and that was the shot fired heard around the world and
[16:26.880 --> 16:31.480]  the war for independence began they went to Concord they amassed the defense of
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.440]  the bridge they drove off the British and and everything became history at
[16:35.440 --> 16:39.920]  that point the point is that never would have happened had it not been for the
[16:39.920 --> 16:44.440]  pastors of colonial America and that's the difference that Tim and I saw Alex
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.280]  whenever we were looking at this latest gun grab attempt by oh I've been to 20
[16:49.280 --> 16:53.320]  churches in town or more yet I don't care Baptist whatever it is it's a bunch
[16:53.320 --> 16:56.840]  of government worship and and what did you think when when when Billy Graham's
[16:56.840 --> 17:00.520]  organization and his son came out against the Second Amendment I mean this
[17:00.520 --> 17:04.560]  is unbelievable well yeah well you know what I thought because I you read my
[17:04.560 --> 17:09.120]  column but yeah Franklin Graham you know and and lamb Richard land of course you
[17:09.120 --> 17:12.560]  need to understand a richer land from the Southern Baptist Convention is a
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.240]  member of the CFR probably most of your audience very enlightened audience that's
[17:17.240 --> 17:20.360]  a group sworn to destroy the United States he's a member of that so that
[17:20.360 --> 17:23.640]  didn't surprise me but I really was disappointed when Franklin Graham came
[17:23.640 --> 17:28.760]  out and endorsed portions of the Obama gun grab I think it shows a couple
[17:28.760 --> 17:32.520]  things I think it shows how thirsty these these guys are to receive the
[17:32.520 --> 17:35.960]  approbation of government I think secondly it's just like the kiss of
[17:35.960 --> 17:40.880]  death who whenever the media attacks me I go more more yeah they don't get it
[17:40.880 --> 17:44.040]  they're out of bullets I realize that but let me tell you what I came out of
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.520]  the religious right Alex I was with the moral majority back in the 80s Jerry
[17:47.520 --> 17:51.320]  Falwell was my mentor I travel with him on his personal jet I've been to all the
[17:51.320 --> 17:55.240]  big conferences as you said I I've met these guys I've talked with these guys I
[17:55.240 --> 18:01.880]  know what's going on there is a desire among so many of them to be accepted by
[18:01.880 --> 18:06.800]  the power elite no it's like status and people get off on it like it fulfills
[18:06.800 --> 18:09.560]  them like they're not fulfilled well they're hanging around with some
[18:09.560 --> 18:12.600]  billionaire well there's a lot of perks that go along with it too this is not
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.440]  you know when you sit at the king's table there are perks and they want
[18:17.440 --> 18:20.880]  those perks but but regardless of that I think there's another with Franklin I
[18:20.880 --> 18:24.280]  think it was also maybe a little bit of ignorance I don't know some of these
[18:24.280 --> 18:28.240]  guys I think are disconnected from reality first of all most of them have
[18:28.240 --> 18:31.880]  never studied the Constitution I'm telling you most of them have never
[18:31.880 --> 18:36.360]  studied the Constitution they've never read our history they have a very
[18:36.360 --> 18:42.000]  myopic view of Christianity they've been taught in a paradigm that's that's very
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.880]  limited in scope and I think that a lot of that lack of education and
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.600]  information it comes out whenever they start supporting some of these things
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.120]  and they really don't know what they're supporting so whether it's one or the
[18:53.120 --> 18:57.040]  other the matter the fact is that I took Franklin to task on this publicly
[18:57.040 --> 19:04.000]  several times that we cannot allow these Christian leaders who do not know the
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.680]  Constitution to form the opinion of the churches and Christians in America and
[19:08.680 --> 19:11.640]  that's why we wrote this book it's the Bible that does it that's exactly right
[19:11.640 --> 19:15.080]  if you want to start a new religion called government worship go do it write
[19:15.080 --> 19:19.280]  your new book and try to get your converts but don't say the Bible says
[19:19.280 --> 19:21.960]  we're supposed to worship government I mean according to this Romans 13
[19:21.960 --> 19:25.480]  interpretation Germans should have submitted to Hitler and I guess they did
[19:25.480 --> 19:29.560]  yeah and 20 million of them died exactly and and according to the to the modern
[19:29.560 --> 19:34.640]  interpretation of the subject at hand is Christians have no right to defend their
[19:34.640 --> 19:38.120]  second amendment rights they should turn over their weapons should the government
[19:38.120 --> 19:41.840]  require them to do so and stand around while somebody saws a guy's head off the
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.880]  video and angle one of these guys killing this guy with yeah everybody
[19:45.880 --> 19:49.320]  just stands around even talks to him and everybody's so liberal they're kind of
[19:49.320 --> 19:54.220]  like yeah maybe murdering him he's good I mean he was white and so I mean the
[19:54.220 --> 19:57.600]  answer is set up a wood chipper all white people were fed into it ladies and

[24:26.040 --> 24:30.200]  Chuck Baldwin's our guest this is a short segment long segment coming up
[24:30.200 --> 24:37.200]  Chuck I was talking to you during the break and you're the same way you want
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.720]  to work all the time fighting this because being oppressed having tyranny
[24:41.720 --> 24:51.320]  come in and taking over your life is so fundamentally upsetting and then you see
[24:51.320 --> 24:55.600]  other people just happy to sell out to it and I think that's a spirit that's in
[24:55.600 --> 25:02.480]  people but continuing getting into the book meant to be given to preachers that
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.080]  goes over the hundreds of Bible verses about being armed what does the Bible
[25:07.080 --> 25:13.120]  say about self-defense versus what these government-run churches say yeah and and
[25:13.120 --> 25:16.440]  not just the pastors but also the Christians that are in the pews they
[25:16.440 --> 25:21.880]  need to be enlightened every bit as much yeah the the very first chapter of the
[25:21.880 --> 25:28.200]  Bible when you get into the work of creation God gave man two basic commands
[25:28.200 --> 25:32.680]  he told him first of all to be fruitful multiply replenish the earth that's a
[25:32.680 --> 25:37.480]  command appropriation all right and then then right after that he said if any man
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.480]  shed man's blood by man shall his blood be shed so right away you have the duty
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.400]  and responsibility to provide life and then secondly to protect life the
[25:48.400 --> 25:54.960]  protection of life is just as important as the as the ability to provide life so
[25:54.960 --> 26:00.240]  God gave to both both of those responsibilities to man it is it is
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.520]  ludicrous that God would would say to the human family to procreate have
[26:05.520 --> 26:10.760]  children have a family have a home and then not give them the responsibility
[26:10.760 --> 26:15.360]  and the duty to protect and provide for that family in the New Testament the
[26:15.360 --> 26:20.240]  scripture says if a man provide not for his own he is worse than infidel he's
[26:20.240 --> 26:25.620]  denied the faith okay so provision of course going to work having a job may
[26:25.620 --> 26:30.640]  making an income providing food and clothing and nourishment and and and
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.120]  housing and so forth but also protection protecting our families from the
[26:36.120 --> 26:39.040]  criminal element of society look at England where a guy's getting his head
[26:39.040 --> 26:44.920]  sawed off for like 15 minutes and 30 people stand around taking photos not
[26:44.920 --> 26:50.880]  even having empathy but the basics of civilization is defending your family
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.160]  the whole Bible is examples of people defending themselves and God's saying
[26:55.160 --> 26:58.880]  who will stand up for you know for me against the wicked ones if you were to
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.720]  take out the stories of the Bible where you find an example of one of God's men
[27:04.720 --> 27:10.280]  resisting evil of evil authority and sometimes with arms I mean look Jeff to
[27:10.280 --> 27:15.800]  Samson Gideon take a take all the judges and look look at the life look at Abram
[27:15.800 --> 27:18.840]  Abram would look at David the Philistines said that was their land he
[27:18.840 --> 27:23.260]  should have knelt to them yes Jesus should have done what they said in the
[27:23.260 --> 27:26.520]  Garden of Eden for example the verse that they often use when Jesus told
[27:26.520 --> 27:30.200]  Simon Peter to put up a sword they that live by the sword die by the sword
[27:30.200 --> 27:33.560]  that's the verse that they always bother all these verses are covered in this
[27:33.560 --> 27:39.640]  book we go all the verses that they use to to justify passing it'll always say
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.280]  right before or right after what it actually means so we use all that for
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.160]  example Jesus said right before that passage he told the disciples if they
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.680]  didn't have a sword to sell their clothes and go buy one okay
[27:52.680 --> 27:58.600]  Jesus commanded them to buy a sword a Roman sword now understand to Alex that
[27:58.600 --> 28:04.360]  the Roman sword was a military instrument that the Jewish people were
[28:04.360 --> 28:08.040]  not allowed to carry under Roman law he was saying get illegal weapons he was
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.120]  saying get an illegal weapon a military-style weapon the best most
[28:12.120 --> 28:15.720]  deadliest short sword out there that's right the most effective efficient
[28:15.720 --> 28:20.000]  self-defense tool in the world at that time and he and he actually told him
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.400]  commanded him to go buy one even though the Roman law said you couldn't have one
[28:23.400 --> 28:28.880]  so that this shoot that's just Jesus I mean he's that's the son of God you know
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.280]  it's we're talking about a complete misunderstanding when Jesus sold Simon
[28:33.280 --> 28:37.880]  Peter to put up sword notice he did not tell him to give up his sword okay
[28:37.880 --> 28:41.560]  again an illegal weapon he's already carrying it with him there were two
[28:41.560 --> 28:45.800]  swords among the eleven apostles as you know it was time for Christ to make the
[28:45.800 --> 28:49.600]  sacrifice so that wasn't the time to fight exactly right it wasn't the time
[28:49.600 --> 28:54.320]  to fight Jesus came to die to give his life a ransom for the sins of mankind he
[28:54.320 --> 28:58.640]  made that very clear the disciples didn't understand that Jesus did he was
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.980]  telling Simon put up your sword it's not time to use it I have come to give my
[29:02.980 --> 29:07.520]  life I've come to be arrested I've come to be crucified but that's why he was
[29:07.520 --> 29:10.920]  just crying in the in the garden but notice that he also Alex whenever the
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.080]  soldiers came why didn't they arrest Simon Peter when he cut off the ear I
[29:15.080 --> 29:17.480]  mean that would have been attempted murder if you were gonna make a legal
[29:17.480 --> 29:20.560]  charge out of that that would have been attempted murder price one of them to go
[29:20.560 --> 29:24.200]  on and be witnesses right but why didn't they arrest Simon why didn't they arrest
[29:24.200 --> 29:28.080]  the disciples why didn't they disarm him why did Simon Peter to leave with his
[29:28.080 --> 29:31.800]  sword because Christ is a miracle and because Christ had knocked the soldiers
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.480]  on their can with the power of his voice and he protected the disciples and their
[29:36.480 --> 29:40.720]  ability to keep their arms so the witnesses can be there exactly
[29:40.720 --> 29:43.640]  absolutely we'll be right back and most people read the Bible they don't get out
[29:43.640 --> 29:46.800]  deep it is I mean there's no literature like it because it's not literature
[29:46.800 --> 29:50.400]  they're right back with pastor Chuck Baldwin stay with us we're on the march
[29:50.400 --> 30:01.320]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network with health

[35:25.600 --> 35:31.560]  we buy at wholesale you need to get this book to every pastor you know and every
[35:31.560 --> 35:35.080]  youth pastor and everybody going to seminary I don't care whether they're
[35:35.080 --> 35:40.960]  Catholic Protestant Mormon Easter bunnies but whatever they are this is
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.480]  the Bible and 77% some numbers they say 80% identify as Christian I can get
[35:46.480 --> 35:50.260]  pastor Baldwin to give me his numbers they claim to be Christian I'm not up
[35:50.260 --> 35:55.360]  here on some high horse I just know that they have taken over our big churches
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.960]  and they I mean I've go to them my wife still goes to big churches in town and
[35:59.960 --> 36:03.120]  the overall will be good stuff it's still a bunch of government worship at
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.560]  the end of it and their argument is well we're gonna save souls and everything
[36:07.560 --> 36:11.400]  goes to hell at least we'll have the soul saved people are gonna be deceived
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.320]  by all this evil if they don't know the big picture this government is pure evil
[36:16.320 --> 36:21.840]  at the top they're aborting babies you know after they're born they're wanting
[36:21.840 --> 36:27.520]  to kill them up to age 3 now the Journal of Pediatrics publishes papers on that
[36:27.520 --> 36:32.720]  these are not liberals and the so-called conservatives are just the placeholders
[36:32.720 --> 36:36.560]  for them so we think we have an opposition to all of this and I like
[36:36.560 --> 36:40.680]  Senator Cruz coming out saying our big problem is the Republican Party we can
[36:40.680 --> 36:45.440]  beat the Democrats our big part our big problem is the establishment people like
[36:45.440 --> 36:51.680]  Senator Graham and others Lindsey Graham our problem are people like Franklin
[36:51.680 --> 36:56.120]  Graham I mean it is incredible all the government arms of the teeth and does
[36:56.120 --> 37:00.040]  all this saying we shouldn't be armed so this book to keep or not to keep why
[37:00.040 --> 37:05.160]  Christians should not give up their guns I mean unbelievable I mean why do we
[37:05.160 --> 37:08.320]  supposedly have a military to find other evil governments well if governments are
[37:08.320 --> 37:12.840]  all ordained by God then how is that the case no if you become evil God will turn
[37:12.840 --> 37:17.520]  your society over and let the evil take over am I correct in saying that pastor
[37:17.520 --> 37:22.240]  Baldwin exactly correct Alex and let's not forget that the very the very fact
[37:22.240 --> 37:26.840]  that when you have a military or police that most Christians and most
[37:26.840 --> 37:31.880]  conservatives would recognize the right to enforce the law and and to defend the
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.560]  community or the nation as the case may be that all of that derives its
[37:36.560 --> 37:43.360]  legitimacy from we the people okay they have the right to defend the country and
[37:43.360 --> 37:49.720]  to defend the community with force because we as individuals created in the
[37:49.720 --> 37:54.600]  image of God have the right to protect our lives we created a government duly
[37:54.600 --> 37:58.120]  constituted amongst men to secure our liberties right and they are our
[37:58.120 --> 38:02.280]  servants that we have created a professional force but the now that
[38:02.280 --> 38:06.200]  professional force does not become our king the point though is that Christians
[38:06.200 --> 38:10.200]  need to realize and that if they really believe that the military and police
[38:10.200 --> 38:14.400]  have the right to bear arms and to protect society and protect the nation
[38:14.400 --> 38:18.840]  they only have that right because they got it from us it is an individual
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.920]  god-given right first we got it from God and it became a collective right as we
[38:23.920 --> 38:30.480]  the people ceded to them that authority but it stems and grows from we the
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.400]  people it's an individual right given to us by God if we don't have a right to
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.520]  defend ourselves individually then the military does not have a right to defend
[38:39.520 --> 38:43.520]  the country collectively or the police does not have the right to defend the
[38:43.520 --> 38:47.760]  community collectively they only have that right collectively because we have
[38:47.760 --> 38:51.560]  the right individually as it was given to us by God and that's a disconnect the
[38:51.560 --> 38:56.760]  Christians just don't seem to understand well you're you're empowering evil when
[38:56.760 --> 39:01.560]  you say good people can't have weapons because they will follow that law and
[39:01.560 --> 39:05.920]  you've just empowered evil well not only that I think it's it's it's shows a
[39:05.920 --> 39:09.680]  utter ignorance on the behalf of the pastors and the Christians of the country
[39:09.680 --> 39:14.000]  who haven't studied the principles of natural law as given to us by God the
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.240]  the seminaries haven't taught at the Bible College I mean look I've been
[39:17.240 --> 39:21.360]  through all that you know I grew up in that I mean how did you wake up then
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.240]  when was that you know it's a long process I mean we all met mature at
[39:26.240 --> 39:30.120]  different rates and different levels but I guess it was probably 1994 when
[39:30.120 --> 39:34.600]  Clinton first got elected I started my radio show he was like to 92 I started
[39:34.600 --> 39:39.360]  my show in 94 I started scouring the the news and started you know getting
[39:39.360 --> 39:42.360]  involved so I listening to you and I started hearing a lot of the other
[39:42.360 --> 39:45.400]  things that were going on in the country doing my own research through my own
[39:45.400 --> 39:48.360]  study because you don't learn this in school I had to go into the Bible
[39:48.360 --> 39:52.000]  searching for myself I had to do a lot of self-study and as it began to grow
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.320]  and I began to learn I realized how much I didn't know and I began to develop an
[39:56.320 --> 40:00.640]  appreciation for where we are as a people in terms of where we were in our
[40:00.640 --> 40:04.600]  history well it's certainly advanced now I learned a lot watching your your sermons
[40:04.600 --> 40:08.200]  and I mean I sit there you get to watch them when they first happen live I watch
[40:08.200 --> 40:12.560]  them a day or two after my wife watches them and people go to Chuck Baldwin live
[40:12.560 --> 40:17.000]  calm but but also find them on YouTube right yeah we put all of our sermons up
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.320]  on YouTube now almost the same day we we have a technical crew that puts them up
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.560]  easier either on Sunday night or very early on Monday morning so usually by
[40:25.560 --> 40:28.520]  Monday morning they're already up on YouTube I want it you know tonight I
[40:28.520 --> 40:31.640]  think I'm gonna because I mean it's my nature I get excited tell people and
[40:31.640 --> 40:35.160]  then I run off you know what the mouth with a bunch of points which is good but
[40:35.160 --> 40:40.520]  also bad I want to I think one of the other crews doing the news segment I was
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.640]  going to an interview with you tonight on TV I think what I should do is just
[40:43.640 --> 40:47.640]  introduce you and maybe you can preach a sermon tonight on info Wars Nightly
[40:47.640 --> 40:54.200]  News you want to do that Wow I'll bring a lectern in there everyone
[40:54.200 --> 40:57.680]  Alex I'm your servant whatever you want me to do I don't want to worry out
[40:57.680 --> 41:00.400]  because but you said you're here to work you want to work I mean we're gonna do
[41:00.400 --> 41:03.440]  this radio show we're gonna do the interview for Obama deception and then
[41:03.440 --> 41:06.400]  you can give an hour-long sermon if you want yeah whatever you want me to do but
[41:06.400 --> 41:12.160]  I what I want your audience to know is the importance of this book and how it
[41:12.160 --> 41:17.000]  can change the course of the church look in the first 48 to 72 hours after the
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.800]  book was released a sizable percentage of the orders that we got Alex were from
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.360]  pastors that's encouraging that's encouraging that what they're saying is
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.080]  look we know in our heart that we have the right to keep and bear arms we know
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.680]  in our heart we have the right to defend ourselves we know in our heart that it's
[41:33.680 --> 41:37.760]  wrong for the government to tell us to surrender our semiautomatic rifles but
[41:37.760 --> 41:41.760]  where in the scripture do we find that they've never been taught and so that's
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.600]  why this book is so important it shows them in the scripture where the Bible
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.760]  gives them the authority under natural law and revealed but a lot of these
[41:50.760 --> 41:53.520]  preachers are so government control the problems of the Bible is of the devil
[41:53.520 --> 41:57.360]  well the preachers that are government control they're gonna say Obama is Jesus
[41:57.360 --> 42:00.720]  but those those people I don't know if there's any hope for them the only hope
[42:00.720 --> 42:03.960]  for that is if you're in a church like that you need to get out well I'll tell
[42:03.960 --> 42:06.120]  you we've discovered Bill and Melinda Gates are funding a lot of these
[42:06.120 --> 42:11.760]  churches and you know he's a big collectivist and and and you Genesis and
[42:11.760 --> 42:16.400]  they send in now from the central churches the Methodist and others they
[42:16.400 --> 42:21.400]  send in change agents that are not even their atheist but they're up there
[42:21.400 --> 42:26.160]  running the whole thing and I'm sure you know about this phenomenon where they're
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.880]  actually just cold-blooded operatives they're incrementally trying to keep the
[42:30.880 --> 42:35.000]  church there to be basically a Soviet army but by increments they're they're
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.240]  basically re-educating people well even the ones that aren't even your typical
[42:38.240 --> 42:41.640]  501c no but I'm telling you there are a lot of them that are operative oh I
[42:41.640 --> 42:45.000]  believe that no I'm not I don't I don't have any doubt about that and we all
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.980]  know about the pastor was called your response to your response team the theme
[42:49.980 --> 42:53.480]  has been doing I've got a lot of pastors that are giving me first-hand testimony
[42:53.480 --> 42:57.400]  about that Oh tell us about that tell us about that or or don't forget tonight
[42:57.400 --> 43:00.400]  because we got the documents and later people didn't believe me and it was on
[43:00.400 --> 43:03.560]  the news right they go Oh turn your guns in it's over Lord oh yeah absolutely
[43:03.560 --> 43:07.200]  during an emergency you turn the guns in no that's that's all that's written I
[43:07.200 --> 43:09.840]  mean they've got that in their training no but I want to hear what the preachers
[43:09.840 --> 43:12.900]  you briefly the preachers you know what did they say sure I'll be glad to and
[43:12.900 --> 43:16.320]  that's chilling yeah but the point is is that even the ones that are just your
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.480]  typical 501c3 pastor they really have been buffaloed into thinking that that
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.880]  somehow another that because they're 501c3 they can't say this they can't say
[43:25.880 --> 43:29.360]  that they can't get involved in politics they can't take a stand it's an
[43:29.360 --> 43:34.720]  intimidation factor and and as a result they are afraid to broach all its
[43:34.720 --> 43:38.160]  political correctness I mean I was at Martin Springs this weekend and there
[43:38.160 --> 43:41.080]  was a Hispanic guy and two white guys swimming around and their girlfriends
[43:41.080 --> 43:45.720]  were up on the bank and one of them goes let's get Chinese food we leave here and
[43:45.720 --> 43:48.200]  the two white guys said of the Hispanic is just the white guys that are so
[43:48.200 --> 43:51.600]  politically you know correct they go don't you can't say Chinese and they
[43:51.600 --> 43:56.280]  weren't joking and now people think everything is like racist or something
[43:56.280 --> 44:00.200]  and it's the same thing once you get yourself in that box the box only gets
[44:00.200 --> 44:04.120]  smaller to where you're afraid to talk about anything yeah and that's where
[44:04.120 --> 44:07.640]  these guys are they really are afraid to talk about it and a lot of them have
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.040]  never studied it they've never been taught it they don't know the first
[44:11.040 --> 44:14.160]  thing about the principles of natural law they don't know the first thing
[44:14.160 --> 44:17.260]  about the principles of freedom and liberty everything that the founding
[44:17.260 --> 44:21.680]  fathers understood from from a historical and a spiritual perspective
[44:21.680 --> 44:25.440]  even the ones that were not Christians they understood the biblical principles
[44:25.440 --> 44:28.480]  of liberal that's why that's what's missing today that's what this book
[44:28.480 --> 44:33.720]  helps to resolve this book Alex I believe if enough Christians and
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.640]  pastors would read it it would revolutionize the church and if it
[44:37.640 --> 44:40.640]  revolutionizes the church it could change the course of the country and
[44:40.640 --> 44:45.000]  that's up to the listeners to get the book at info war store calm and to go
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.820]  hand deliver it and then a month later say did you read that and if the pastor
[44:48.820 --> 44:52.320]  hasn't done that I'm not a big guy to breaking up churches but these aren't
[44:52.320 --> 44:56.880]  even churches how do people make an issue hand out flyers call for a church
[44:56.880 --> 45:01.400]  meeting about it I mean how do you make these churches stop being a new world
[45:01.400 --> 45:05.360]  order mouthpiece well the first of all if you are a freedom lover and you're
[45:05.360 --> 45:11.560]  attending one of these silent sheepish 501c leave it just get out vote with
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.160]  your feet you know they continue to give their ties and offerings they continue
[45:15.160 --> 45:18.280]  to support do you tell people I'm also I'm leaving because of this yeah
[45:18.280 --> 45:22.840]  absolutely they need to know they need to know that they are not being the
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.960]  shepherd to their flock that God would have them to be and as a result the
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.200]  sheep are not going to stay with that Shepherd they need to understand it as
[45:30.200 --> 45:33.720]  long as they have the crowds and the money in the buildings and the
[45:33.720 --> 45:37.960]  notoriety what is the motivation they have to make any difference in what
[45:37.960 --> 45:41.160]  they're doing they're not gonna change anything but if enough people out there
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.400]  in the congregation said look it's so late in the day preacher our country is
[45:45.400 --> 45:48.920]  going to hell in a handbasket we're about to lose our freedoms your kids and
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.440]  mine are gonna grow up in tyranny if we you and me if we don't do something
[45:53.440 --> 45:57.320]  about it now and if you're not gonna take a stand for my kids and for my
[45:57.320 --> 46:01.000]  grandkids and for the freedom of this country according to the scriptures that
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.440]  God has given you as a watchman on the wall that I'm gonna go find a shepherd
[46:04.440 --> 46:08.520]  who will and if enough people did that I think at least the passage would say
[46:08.520 --> 46:13.400]  wait well wait a minute just something here I'm missing it's incredible I want
[46:13.400 --> 46:17.680]  you to go over some of the verses that you've got in the book to keep her not
[46:17.680 --> 46:20.920]  to keep why Christians should not give up their guns are written with your
[46:20.920 --> 46:25.840]  constitutional lawyer sign Timothy Baldwin again Chuck Baldwin the pastor
[46:25.840 --> 46:29.680]  is here with us I mean this is really the fight folks let's I mean there's
[46:29.680 --> 46:33.360]  hundreds of them in there but let's get into some of these scriptures and then
[46:33.360 --> 46:36.120]  some of the scriptures they use to go after the guns okay well let's let's go
[46:36.120 --> 46:41.840]  to page 72 and 73 we touched on it just briefly before in the last segment I
[46:41.840 --> 46:45.720]  mean if you live by the sword you'll die by the sword what Jesus said in the
[46:45.720 --> 46:50.240]  Garden of Eden and they take that to mean well if you use the sword in any
[46:50.240 --> 46:56.160]  way then you're wrong you're sinful you shouldn't do it and that's why that's
[46:56.160 --> 46:59.320]  what Jesus said to Simon Peter in the garden when actually the opposite is
[46:59.320 --> 47:02.320]  true well then how do you send the military off of the sword it's just
[47:02.320 --> 47:05.240]  totally hypocritical what Jesus was saying though he was saying well if you
[47:05.240 --> 47:08.920]  live by the sword you die by the sword Alex what he was saying was that the
[47:08.920 --> 47:14.160]  tyrants they live by the sword a law offensively that's right they live by
[47:14.160 --> 47:20.600]  the sword by inflicting harm upon others through brutal and we have the sword for
[47:20.600 --> 47:24.880]  defense as a result they will die by the sword and that verse is repeated in
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.100]  Revelation chapter 13 in verse 10 and it says the same thing again and he's
[47:29.100 --> 47:33.080]  talking about that is not that was not a warning to Simon Peter to that was a
[47:33.080 --> 47:37.860]  promise to Simon Peter he was saying to Simon look it's not time for you to use
[47:37.860 --> 47:41.400]  saying vengeance is mine that's right it's not time for you to use the sword
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.800]  now because I came to die and give my life a ransom for the souls of men you
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.100]  put up your sword but they that live by the sword these tyrants that enforce
[47:50.100 --> 47:53.940]  their will by the by the edge of the sword they are going to because next he
[47:53.940 --> 47:57.840]  says go and buy a Roman sword no he said that before that he said before that go
[47:57.840 --> 48:01.000]  buy a sword and there were already two of the disciples that were carrying
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.240]  swords Simon Peter was the other one I think probably Matthew was the second
[48:04.240 --> 48:07.520]  one Jesus told the rest of them and by the way if they caught you with a sword
[48:07.520 --> 48:11.560]  they would crucify well it was against the law it was against Roman law flow so
[48:11.560 --> 48:17.040]  he said break unconstitutional assault weapon bans exactly but that's Jesus we
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.440]  should we should listen to the preacher not him yeah Jesus did I mean that's
[48:21.440 --> 48:25.520]  something that most people's most pastor just have never thought about up to
[48:25.520 --> 48:29.120]  your honest out there ask your pastor do you realize when Jesus told his
[48:29.120 --> 48:34.160]  disciples to buy a sword he was talking about the Roman sword the most efficient
[48:34.160 --> 48:39.000]  effective defense self-defense tool in the world is a military style weapon he
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.760]  was telling them to purchase a weapon that the Roman government had forbade
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.280]  the Jewish people from owning and possessing he was requiring them that
[48:48.280 --> 48:52.960]  they break human law in order to fill that God's law now that is something
[48:52.960 --> 48:56.040]  that most pastors have never even thought about and it's by we know it's
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.240]  the same sword because in the Greek language the same word is used when
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.040]  Jesus said the sword as as it was in Romans 13 when he talked about the
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.240]  government they they bear not the sword in vain he's talking about the
[49:08.240 --> 49:11.740]  government and Romans 13 well plus he's saying render unto Caesar that's which
[49:11.740 --> 49:15.880]  is Caesar whose faces on it it's the government's currency so of course they
[49:15.880 --> 49:20.400]  control it he's saying it's like you know using Federal Reserve notes my
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.280]  point is is that it's the same word the same word for sword that he used when he
[49:25.280 --> 49:28.720]  told the disciples to go but Daniel she's the same word Daniel should have
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.680]  done what he was told about going to lion's den the other people shouldn't
[49:31.680 --> 49:34.360]  have gone in the fiery furnace they should don't they were told according to
[49:34.360 --> 49:37.800]  these preachers yeah I mean take all this John the Baptist should've done
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.960]  what Herod said all of this take all of the stories out of the Bible where you
[49:41.960 --> 49:48.880]  have an example of a God's one of God's people resisting evil authority
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.840]  resisting the law and you're going to take out a sizable portion of the Bible
[49:53.840 --> 49:59.320]  in fact I would in a general way I would say find me a major Bible character that
[49:59.320 --> 50:03.160]  did not resist I think because I've read the whole Bible quite a bit not as much
[50:03.160 --> 50:08.360]  as you I'd say 70% of the Bible I mean Moses should have done what Pharaoh said
[50:08.360 --> 50:15.160]  he resisted he was a bad person Moses when he according to Hebrews he chose to
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.120]  suffer affliction with the people of God rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin
[50:20.120 --> 50:25.040]  for a season is steaming the riches of Christ other approach of Christ excuse
[50:25.040 --> 50:30.320]  me greater riches when did he do that he did that when he killed the Egyptian
[50:30.320 --> 50:35.040]  taskmaster who was murdering the Jewish slave protected someone he protect he
[50:35.040 --> 50:39.320]  should have helped the the taskmaster kill the old man if if the rest of the
[50:39.320 --> 50:44.120]  Hebrews would have understood what Moses was doing they would have joined him at
[50:44.120 --> 50:48.040]  that point and they would have saved themselves from 40 years of tyranny but
[50:48.040 --> 50:52.280]  because they wouldn't follow Moses then they had to go through 40 more years of
[50:52.280 --> 50:57.480]  tyranny unbelievable you heard it Moses was evil he defended an old person you're
[50:57.480 --> 51:00.640]  not supposed to do that you're supposed to let the government kill them it's
[51:00.640 --> 51:05.120]  time for a home security quiz what effective home security device is
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.720]  smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home

[54:24.520 --> 54:35.400]  we have a clip coming up here in a moment we have that queued up Obama
[54:35.400 --> 54:39.480]  just like three minutes ago during the break this was live he's up there
[54:39.480 --> 54:42.240]  talking about how great it is to have drones killing u.s. citizens without due
[54:42.240 --> 54:45.920]  process and how liberal that is and I was gonna get five more peace prizes
[54:45.920 --> 54:50.360]  for it and you know he's got his disinfo trolls out there saying that all sorts
[54:50.360 --> 54:56.240]  of baloney about us and probably a code pink lady the way they sound gets up
[54:56.240 --> 54:58.700]  there and says you know there's people on a hunger strike oh yeah they're
[54:58.700 --> 55:03.240]  dying and it's mainly innocent people at Gitmo it's just a torture base meanwhile
[55:03.240 --> 55:08.600]  the globalists run the real al-qaeda on record in Libya and Syria and then use
[55:08.600 --> 55:14.960]  the extremists they wind up to as a pretext to take our liberties and of
[55:14.960 --> 55:19.280]  course this is now becoming mainstream news thank God and people are like going
[55:19.280 --> 55:22.600]  wait a minute you bring in the radicals then they kill people then you take our
[55:22.600 --> 55:27.200]  rights and then you're funding their commanders yeah there's the people doing
[55:27.200 --> 55:32.800]  it are extremists but the point is is that they're being wound up but here is
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.760]  Obama being heckled and this went on for a while here it is
[55:38.760 --> 55:51.840]  so let me finish man so today so today once again today strike these desperate
[55:51.840 --> 55:55.760]  people I'm about to dress it man but you got you gotta let me speak I'm about to
[55:55.760 --> 56:03.800]  dress it let me address it why don't you let me address it man why don't you sit
[56:03.800 --> 56:20.400]  down and I will tell you today you should let me finish my sentence look at
[56:20.400 --> 56:25.120]  that arrogance today said he wouldn't do bailouts but he did Congress to lift the
[56:25.120 --> 56:34.680]  restrictions on detainee transfers from Gitmo I have asked the Department of
[56:34.680 --> 56:39.000]  Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.760]  commissions I'm appointed your envoy at the State Department that's enough shut
[56:44.760 --> 56:47.880]  it down we're gonna go into overdrive and let the pastor finish but but folks
[56:47.880 --> 56:52.040]  the reason we played this is they make it act like it's conservative to have
[56:52.040 --> 56:56.000]  people secretly held the no-do process and tortured for years even when it's
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  found they're innocent and then release the really bad guys to go out from there
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.600]  and commit attacks as their promise of getting out that's happened that's a
[57:04.600 --> 57:08.600]  mind control base on record the CIA has a mind control facility that's like
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.080]  frontline PBS well you're chomping at the bit here
[57:12.080 --> 57:15.400]  pass we're gonna get gets your take on it but yeah but you caught it that's why
[57:15.400 --> 57:18.520]  I love pastor truck balding smart there's so people that really get stuff
[57:18.520 --> 57:23.440]  and I'm not you know bragging or also being patronizing it's true that folks
[57:23.440 --> 57:25.960]  they're setting the precedent to set up which they've already built some of them
[57:25.960 --> 57:29.920]  giant domestic prisons with no due process here for citizens as well
[57:29.920 --> 57:35.280]  instead of Cuba and it's like oh we demand you close Gitmo you bet I'll move
[57:35.280 --> 57:42.120]  people here and secretly hold them no pastor I saw you like get that you know
[57:42.120 --> 57:46.280]  we all know about these FEMA cabs have been popping up all over the country we
[57:46.280 --> 57:50.400]  know about the Department of Homeland Security the show people buying you know
[57:50.400 --> 57:54.400]  all kinds of how many billion rounds of hollow-point ammunition billion rounds
[57:54.400 --> 58:01.520]  200 you know thousands of tanks and weapons and this is all for the
[58:01.520 --> 58:05.660]  problem of homeland security this is supposed to be domestic enforcement so
[58:05.660 --> 58:08.840]  who they plan on using all that against I mean and then he's talking about
[58:08.840 --> 58:13.440]  building a facility like Gitmo in the United States of America I mean oh boy

[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.280]  tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories u.s. moves closer to military intervention
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.960]  in Syria that's Kurt Nemo's article they're already doing military
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.200]  intervention with proxies they mean overt military bombing and you know
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.240]  after they do their deal with Russia they're like kind of stage an event
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.840]  blame their own assets let the Russians clean out the CIA zone people you give
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:26.360]  us Syria we'll get our people out of Dagestan I mean this is just amazing it's
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.560]  like it's like Hitler and Stalin dividing Poland or something that's how
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.200]  government works I agree with C Bell Edmonds breakdown on that a few days ago
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.840]  mother of bombing suspects as it's all lies that's all up at info wars calm
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.000]  multiple polls Americans are more afraid of government than the terrorists that's
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.640]  right but the government has electronic voting in now so guess it doesn't matter
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.640]  what you want unless you enforce the Constitution and that's just some of
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.000]  what's going to be coming up William F Jasper is going to be joining us but
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.480]  putting bookends on this day of the night we're talking about the Southern
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.480]  Poverty Law Center that Harper's wrote about in 2007 and they got their tax
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:10.080]  returns 501c3 189.7 million dollars a lot of it government funding
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.960]  approximately 60% of their total expenses were spent on program services
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:20.200]  they live like kings in 2009 that's the latest numbers and they still every
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.080]  professional I know me and my dad's a dentist every lawyer he knows gets
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.800]  mailed the magazine which I'm always in or almost every time I've seen it it's a
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:35.640]  quarterly magazine where they put toothless clan members run by feds next
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.920]  to mainline Christian groups some of the biggest in the country I mean they just
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.880]  say hey we shouldn't teach five-year-olds how to masturbate and
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.720]  they're like these people are evil and then the guy goes in and shoots them and
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.960]  it's like so what we're liberal I mean it's just it's just over the top and
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.480]  again they're here for an authoritarian takeover I'm not just saying that David
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.040]  Knight the final comments on that before I come back and talk to Jasper I think
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.200]  what you said earlier Alex's is the key you got to ask yourself not only why
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.000]  would the army attack mainstream organizations like the Family Research
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.840]  Council and the American Family Association but why is the army doing
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.880]  this why it's kind of like when you saw the Waco and when that was unfolding we
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.640]  were told that they had to do that to protect the children and that there were
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.880]  child abuse charges it's like that's not the jurisdiction of the federal ATF to
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.000]  come in arrested him in town every day they wanted the big fight
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.440]  off the domestic purge they hate gun owning Christians so they picked a weird
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.920]  group to set the precedent right these people these people just don't want
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.900]  power they hate us it's the same sort of thing here you got to ask yourself why
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.920]  is the army weighing in on this why is the army telling people that the Family
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.800]  Research Council and the American Family Association are hateful groups that
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.560]  they're hate groups and they don't share army values why is by the way they're
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.500]  incredibly milk toast they're incredibly milk doesn't mean look the army document
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:02.340]  three weeks ago Fox News says evangelicals would by the way are
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:07.920]  worshipping the the southern barbie law center and all Catholics are extremists
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.640]  next to al-qaeda I mean where where are the where are the Catholic groups up in
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.920]  arms about this right that's a big group to say all the Catholics period yeah
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.180]  absolutely so I guess that's the thing that along with and we've seen this
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.960]  happening over and over again we've seen army manuals where they're war gaming in
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.080]  South Carolina against the Tea Party we see the myac report that was broken by
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:36.160]  infowars back in 2009 we see this narrative coming over and over again and
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.480]  you have to ask yourself you know not only do we have a standing army now
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.080]  permanent professional standing army which is against article one section a
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.640]  of the Constitution but now they are definitely turning their sights on the
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.280]  American people that's right they're demonizing us saying we're the bad guys
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.960]  and then we say hey what are the armored vehicles and and and and machine guns
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.200]  and checkpoints and bullets for they go that's a conspiracy theory don't run we

[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.920]  all right coming up at the bottom of the hour we'll have more breaking news from
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:34.960]  in fall Wars calm another top liberty-minded sites around the world
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.000]  right now though but for the balance of the hour we are joined by William F at
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.880]  Jasper he is the senior editor at the new American magazine the new American
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:52.280]  calm and of course he also is their main correspondent to the United Nations he
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.680]  travels all over the world and of course I followed his work earnestly when I
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.480]  discovered it about 1993 94 95 the John Birch society films that were air on
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.840]  local access TV helped expand my awakening I kind of grew up around
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.440]  history and things so just knew what they were saying was true because it was
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.760]  verifiable in the even by the time I was 20 years old hundreds of history books I
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.480]  read and the first time I met William F Jasper personally I had him on as a
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:29.600]  guest a few times was at Operation urban warrior where the military was openly
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.040]  training with role players to confiscate guns in California and I was there
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.840]  shooting video of the of the of the Navy vessel Coronado dumping out thousands of
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.240]  Marines and troops from five nations and I'd go into the extreme come in with the
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.640]  press and they would they would sit there and train and say would you get
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.120]  the guns and ammo in the helmet well I got it in San Francisco and then they'd
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.960]  have a Colonel Jones run-up say Jones can't film that get out of here they go
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.280]  but sir you said he could be here so and then Colonel Hart would run up on video
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.680]  and get very upset so they did not want people seeing what is in police take
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:09.080]  2000 so the first time I met Jasper them now the John Birch Society I want to get
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.360]  him on today just do a brief history of it I'm not a member of it never been
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.080]  part of it just because you know I've read the material I guess I'm kind of a
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.400]  to use the communist term but in a joking way a fellow traveler I grew up
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.240]  with my dad having their publications and Bobby Vaughn a John Birch Society
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.160]  member in Dallas coming over when I was a kid you know not hear him around the
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.280]  coffee table drinking coffee talking about the new world order the fellow
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.480]  reserve the plan to destroy the family the plan of the mega banks to create
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.200]  world communism that they're exempt from basically everything we see today and I
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.280]  want to get him on about an article he wrote last week that we linked to on in
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.640]  fallwars.com dealing with the EU bragging that oh yes we're taking over
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.480]  an authoritarian way they've also done that the Financial Times of London bragged
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.960]  in an article called and now for world government where they said yes we've
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.640]  been secretive yes we're authoritarian yes we're taking over and yes there's
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.520]  nothing you can do so they've gone from denying all of this to saying okay
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.680]  you're discredited because you don't want world government it's kind of like
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.360]  a year ago when they'd only bought a billion bullets now it's over two
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.440]  billion there are no billion bullets there are no armored vehicles there are
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.400]  no manuals training to take on the American people and veterans and gun
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.040]  owners now they're like of course there are manuals to take you on and of course
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.640]  we have two billion bullets but they're not to kill you that was the new thing
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.160]  in Congress last week we played clips on the Sunday show so if you've ever noticed
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.520]  when you watch MSNBC or CNN when somebody talks about freedom or somebody
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.920]  talks about sovereignty or somebody talks about NAFTA and GATT admitted
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:42.480]  things or the trans Texas corridor they'll go Ron Paul is insane that NAFTA
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.400]  Highway doesn't exist even though Texans see it being built and saw the
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.240]  billboards they're playing to your ignorance but you'll always see them
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.480]  who they're really scared of saying oh that sounds like something from the John
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.400]  Birch Society and then they'll laugh and that's an appeal to a motion for
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.200]  ignorant people watching to go well when I hear the word John Birch I better
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.560]  laugh the truth is the John Birch Society if you watch the things that
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.240]  mr. Welsh said back in the 50s when it was founded when you watch the things
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.640]  they put in a little blue book that I read when I was about 18 all of it has
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.800]  come true not because they were pressing it they had good Patriots in the
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.600]  military in the FBI in the Congress who were in the hearings where this was all
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.400]  being announced they tried to get this all done in the 50s and 60s when they
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.000]  thought the public would totally trust the government after World War two
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.800]  people did trust the government leave it to Beaver this was all announced getting
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.840]  rid of our military creating a UN military via NATO so I want to give him
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.480]  the floor down for the rest of the hour to as best I can is this stuff really
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.800]  gets me excited William F Jasper to kind of this little five-minute segment left
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.760]  talk about the John Birch Society talk about how right they've been and why
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.200]  they've been so demonized and it almost put them on the defensive for a while
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.260]  now I've had their director and studio kind of admit that need to get off the
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:00.080]  defense get on the offense so what when when traitors sit there and attack you
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.040]  and say you're a liar they're the liars and that's a sign you and and and now
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.560]  people don't believe the lies anymore and then get into what the EU is forming
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.640]  into what the New World Order is from its deep research because this is you
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.920]  know the head honcho over there at their publication and just really does
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.080]  amazing research and has been at all these major UN events are sent as sub
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.800]  correspondence to it and then how things are going after we talk about the
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.120]  history of JBS that talk about the current state of world government and
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.880]  then how it's going for them where he sees things going William F Jasper of
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.880]  the a new american.com we salute you and we're honored to have you my friend well
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.840]  thank you Alex pleasure being here with you you the setup you gave me here I'll
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:46.640]  just walk right into that probably a lot of your listeners are familiar at least
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.280]  to some degree with the John Birch Society the John Birch Society publishes
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.980]  the New American magazine of which I am the senior editor and UN correspondent
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:14:04.340]  and kind of chief cook and bottle washer the my my entry into this is probably
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:12.000]  similar to a lot of members of the John Birch Society at least of my generation
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.640]  I graduated from college in 1975 but while I was in college my last couple of
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.520]  years my parents had become members of the John Birch Society and when I found
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:30.240]  out about that I was shocked I was dismayed I was completely perplexed how
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.880]  could this happen because I knew nothing about the John Birch Society except that
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:41.560]  somewhere in my deep subconscious I had this image of the John Birch Society as
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:49.200]  being a very evil fascist organization racist organization somehow connected
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.560]  with the Ku Klux Klan or something like that and I found out that a lot of my
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:00.320]  other friends on campus colleagues had pretty much the same impression and so I
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.200]  thought well I had better educate my parents they're good people they
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.480]  certainly aren't fascists they were both World War two the veterans fought
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.160]  against the Nazis over in Germany and France that's where my mother's an army
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:17.800]  nurse my dad 82nd Airborne paratrooper good patriotic people my job is the
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.840]  college-educated son to educate them and so I started discussing this with them
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.880]  they gave me a whole stack of literature at that time that the John Birch Society
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.560]  magazine was American opinion the monthly magazine the weekly magazine
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.280]  was to review the news that gave me a stack of those so you thought you were
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.320]  going to straighten them up with all your Rockefeller Foundation funded
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.840]  college schooling and they actually straightened you up right I mean they
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:50.440]  gave me a whole stack of books by Ludo von Mises and Henry Hazlitt and and
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.120]  Frederick Hayek and and I started reading all those and I've been
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.480]  studying economics I thought my gosh how come I've never been exposed to this
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:03.000]  these are top-notch world level economists free market economists and
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.400]  why haven't I been exposed to this then so I began doing a lot of research it
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:14.320]  was very hard for me to overcome the biases that I had built into me already
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.520]  but I spent a lot of time at the university library checking the
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.320]  footnotes making sure that things weren't being quoted out of context and
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:31.920]  I found myself being reluctantly reeducated and I thought gee a lot of
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:37.400]  this makes sense they're calling for a constitutional government they're
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.600]  calling for getting back to constitutional government for their
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.080]  calling for America that's right that's right didn't they are but they're not
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:52.000]  only opposed to communism and socialism fascism Nazism any of the collectivist
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.360]  ideological movements and parties and wasn't John Birch society's big evil
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:00.880]  opposing the Vietnam War rightly oh that's so fascist right and they were
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:06.920]  opposed to the John Birch study opposed it not for the same reason that the SDS
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.480]  and the leftists were opposed I mean those are those people were calling for
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:15.640]  a Viet Cong victory the John Birch society said no it's wrong for us to be
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.800]  over there supporting or rather pretending to fight communism there
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.840]  while we were allowing Castro to build a dictatorship right here at our doorstep
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.360]  they rightly understood that it was a galleon dialectic with the globalist
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.080]  playing both sides of it talk about the name John Birch society for people that
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.520]  don't know the story well John Birch I was a Baptist missionary just
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:45.480]  preceding World War two over in China and long story short he had had learned
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.040]  Chinese and that various Chinese dialects he could identify very well
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.200]  with the Chinese people there when World War two broke out and the Japanese
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.840]  invaded China all of the foreign missionaries left except for him he
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.960]  stayed behind disguised himself as Chinese traveled all over China when we
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:11.400]  entered into the war he began and Jimmy Doolittle began doing his flights over
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:17.040]  China bombing the Japanese thing American pilots were being shot down or
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.880]  were being forced to abandon their planes and he developed a network to
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.360]  have lent amongst the Chinese there to build landing strips and to have
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:34.360]  smuggling operations to get the American pilots back out of China so that they
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:41.320]  could fly again and so he was a hero all over China the Japanese were after him
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:48.480]  trying to get trying to capture him he was highly decorated he was very brave
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:54.320]  incredible man credible story Robert Welch wrote the book about him the life
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.400]  of John Birch which is available but after at the end of the war he was given
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.280]  one last Commission he was a missionary but he was commissioned as a captain in
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:14.040]  that in the US Army because of his intelligence capabilities there and he
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:19.600]  was given one last mission which was to go up northern China to escort out the
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:25.000]  Japanese army so that they wouldn't be after the armistice so they wouldn't be
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.760]  molested and he was stopped by Chinese communists stop right there we've got to
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.880]  go to break I want to come back and finish that story so you understand
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.240]  where the John Birch society came from when these enemies of Liberty just
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.080]  demonize them and say lies about them with no proof understand why because
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.520]  they know it's a real organization trying to defend this Republic and
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:49.000]  without them folks Ron Paul and myself we would not have known all this info
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.920]  I'm telling they were the launchpad for the entire giant resistance today and
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.280]  everybody should be a part of the John Birch society or at least get their
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.320]  materials because of the best you're gonna find anywhere we'll be right back

[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.480]  into there to fight the Japanese and then of course at the end of the war it
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:29.160]  was the John Birch Society that first said in the 50s that now have been put
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.740]  in power by our government that was declassified about a decade ago I was
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:36.520]  watching Discovery Channel was a History Channel they had the old CIA section
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.840]  chief admitted and then I went and looked it up there'd been an
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.040]  announcement in the news that all the government thought Mao would be a
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.520]  stabilizing effect the greatest mass murder in history but we'll talk about
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.040]  what happened to old John Birch when he tried to actually help the Chinese
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:53.960]  people he loved so much against tyranny okay so he's helped defeat the Japanese
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:58.240]  against the millions the Japanese killed incredible war crimes there that dwarf
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.000]  what happened to the u.s. or even the Koreans for that matter the Japanese
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.400]  viciously attacked I'm not demonizing Japanese now that's just Imperial Japan
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.360]  were like the Nazis now expanding go ahead and finish it with what happened
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.080]  William F Jasper editor-in-chief over there senior editor over there at the
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:22.000]  New American magazine Oh captain John Birch was sent to escort out Japanese
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.920]  Army out of northern China and on his way there he was stopped by Chinese
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:37.800]  communist troops and was murdered by them and that's not surprising because
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:44.040]  that's what communists do but remember this is the end of World War two and
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:52.320]  Americans for the triumphant victors could be very bad news to kill an
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:58.080]  American hero I mean John Birch should have received numerous additional
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.480]  citations to which he did receive him probably would have gotten Medal of
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:08.480]  Honor thanks to that nature except for this murder was covered up why was it
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:14.000]  covered up our State Department which was being run by communists at that time
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  wasn't also tortured terrified since then wasn't he also tortured yes he was
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.800]  he was tortured bayoneted and and murdered and this wouldn't fly very well
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:32.640]  though what's with our State Department and our government Roosevelt and Truman
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.600]  administrations trying to convince the American people that the Chinese
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:44.120]  communists under Mao Zedong and today were our our allies going to be the
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:50.400]  people that we should be turning China over to which is what what we did they
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.480]  they began demonizing Chiang Kai-shek and the nationalist government building
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.440]  up Mao Zedong and so they had to keep this hidden and Robert Welch who is the
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:08.000]  founder of the John Birch Society who had reached it was he was still in his
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.800]  manufacturing was a had a big candy making company you've had the sugar
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.920]  daddy or sugar babies or when he's guy that invented those and he had poured
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:24.320]  all of his money into alerting the American people about the dangers of
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.720]  socialism and big government here at home and of communism abroad now for
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:35.120]  younger generations today who don't even know who Stalin or Mao or Fidel Castro
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:45.200]  is or were and have no idea about the climate in the 1940s 50s and 60s the
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.480]  70s when communism was taking over one country after another that might be hard
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.400]  to have it but Americans at that time understood that there was something
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:59.120]  really bad world is this world revolution going on where totalitarian
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.640]  ism was being fastened on one country after another millions of people were
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:09.760]  being slaughtered and tortured and in prison so Robert Welch was founded an
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:15.200]  organization he named it after John Birch because he saw that Captain John
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.280]  Birch was an exemplary American who embodied everything that this country
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:27.120]  was great about this country and had been as he said was the first victim of
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.080]  World War three after World War two the big war for the world communist
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:38.160]  totalitarianism was underway and John Birch was the first victim and so by the
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.920]  way the globalist as you know decades later now call that World War three and
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.800]  so again just so much that John Birch envisioned has actually become even
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:52.400]  mainline nomenclature in the technocracy yeah one of the things that Robert
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:58.720]  Welch recognized and this is the reason why he and the John Birch Society were
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:05.320]  so demonized by the same mainstream media the MSM controlled corporate media
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:11.600]  is that he was exposing the larger picture and that is that communism it
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.520]  wasn't succeeding and all these millions of deaths were not just the result of
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.800]  the communists being so powerful and cunning and and adept at taking over
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:29.720]  they had indisputable absolutely necessary help in the highest positions
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.240]  of power in some of the free world countries particularly stay there I want
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.960]  to finish up with that and then leap forward to the the grandchildren and
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.840]  and sons of them went and daughters of these globalists what they're doing

[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:37.760]  to thank all of those a.m. and f.m. affiliates out there for carrying the

[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:49.600]  like General Electric funding MSNBC we are 100 percent funded we're not funded
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.120]  by the Koch brothers funding the kind of fake right-wing either which we were
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:58.840]  because I'd take money and fund Liberty period there's no strings of tax here
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.800]  bring it give it to me but I'm being sarcastic the point here is we're funded

[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.480]  or if you're a business to become a sponsor that's how we fund this

[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.800]  as a dialectic to build a police state here and then get into the current EU
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.200]  stuff you've been breaking and their own admissions and then where you see us
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.600]  going where you think the battle is because I really respect your your
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.560]  perspective as somebody who's been in this battle for 30 years William F
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:39:03.400]  Jasper actually it's almost 40 years now Wow 37 so well we were talking at the
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:12.760]  end there huge huge momentous shift in in the whole planet following World War
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:19.720]  two with communism taking over much of Europe much of Asia including all of
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:26.160]  China and then that was that was happening at the same time that the
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:31.480]  United Nations was being founded the incipient world government that was
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:37.560]  founded in 1945 now you and I were brought up in in schools I believe until
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.920]  I went away to college actually while I was in college and I became familiar
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.680]  with the John Birch society that the United Nations was this glorious
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:51.000]  wonderful great big brotherhood of man that was founded at the end of World War
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.080]  two because the people of the world decided we couldn't have more anymore
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:01.440]  because the atomic bomb we had to find a way of getting getting past all our
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.000]  differences so we'd all join hands and think who buy on we joined together at
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.400]  the United Nations and we'd all live in peace harmony brotherhood at least that
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:16.240]  was the aspiration or we are so we were told nothing of the kind as I began
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:22.280]  looking in into the first first big disillusionment for me was Gio Griffin's
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:26.200]  book the fearful master a second look at the United Nations you've had add on
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:32.560]  your program I'm sure but that just began a big transformation for me and
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.440]  understanding that really right from the very beginning we had two major forces
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:43.960]  working together hand-in-hand to use to build this United Nations into a world
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:49.040]  government which would be tyrannical and the two hands that were joined together
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.200]  were first of all the communists Stalin's agent the since he was the main
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.360]  guy involved from the Soviet Union and putting together the Charter of the
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:04.120]  United Nations the guy on our side supposedly was Alger Hiss Alger Hiss of
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:10.260]  course was a Soviet agent himself but he was also an agent for a member of the
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:16.560]  Council on Foreign Relations he was in fact the protege of one of the founders
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:21.200]  of the Council on Foreign Relations John Foster Dulles former Secretary of State
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.400]  and so so we had the Council on Foreign Relations and the comments working
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:32.960]  together to to put this organization into place which would eventually assume
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.320]  global legislative executive and judicial powers it would be empowered
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.680]  with the police force and an army and that is under process right now but we
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.360]  saw right at the very beginning not only Alger Hiss but Harry Dexter White other
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.680]  another Soviet agent maybe he was there at the founding conference he became
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:56.120]  head of the International Monetary Fund and then he was followed by Virginia's
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.440]  Frank Koh another CFR member common member of the Communist Party who
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:07.280]  finally left and went to live in China the International Monetary Fund is still
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.600]  with us as is the United Nations and in fact the International Monetary Fund
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.680]  this is one of the areas I've been writing extensively on for the last
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.760]  several years is the big push by the Council on Foreign Relations and their
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.920]  other adjuncts around the world to transform the International Monetary
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:26.760]  Fund into a Federal Reserve of the world to give it all of the powers that we now
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:32.280]  have have the Federal Reserve to control monetary and fiscal policy of the world
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.160]  and you wrote that something like 25 years ago a correct me if I'm wrong and
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:43.400]  now it's mainstream news but we're still kooks if we talk about it I mean it's
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:47.200]  just amazing what is it like for you I've got to ask this to now see
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.280]  everything that that that that welts talked about 50 years ago actually come
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:56.680]  true exactly as he said I mean what incredible intelligence JBS had back
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:05.120]  then I mean I don't think the same frustration I know but for those that
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:11.800]  been trying to inform the American people about this all along only to be
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:18.000]  chastised as kooks any fear mongers etc I mean many other people though are
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.200]  beginning to see through that because the Tea Party and every other
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.720]  conservative organization religious organization if you're opposed to any of
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.600]  the agenda and it's sweeping across the agenda is to completely transform the
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:40.120]  United States to destroy all morality destroy our economy to force us in into
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.840]  interdependence to destroy our national sovereignty and that's being stripped
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.680]  away from us right now as we see more and more of these United Nations
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:53.080]  treaties the law of the sea the what they're trying to push through with the
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:44:00.040]  global arms treaty with all of the global environmental treaties and
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:07.640]  agreements I was at the Earth Summit in 1992 and saw and reported on all of the
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.440]  things of agenda 21 the biodiversity treaty and the global warming back then
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:22.840]  and so it's it's frustrating to be years or decades ahead of where most
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:32.800]  people see the the danger on the horizon one of the other areas that we wrote
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:37.520]  about extensively and I covered extensively over the years and now it's
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.760]  becoming quite apparent is the European Union our correspondent Hilaire
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:47.520]  Duberrier had been writing about that for 50 years since the beginning of what
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:51.680]  was then the European coal and steel community and he had written about all
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:55.520]  of the people who were the socialists and one-worlders behind it right from
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:01.840]  the start and he was kind of a lone voice at that time he was a very close
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:10.720]  colleague of mine I regarded him as one of my teachers and got very close to him
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:17.440]  and Hilaire Duberrier really wrote the whole book on the history of the
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:22.120]  European what we now know as the European Union and this is very
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:27.280]  important because the European Union destroy has destroyed the national
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:32.120]  sovereignty of its member states through deception through bribery through
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.520]  coercion but all the while when it was being proposed in every step along the
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.400]  way as it as it gained new powers legislative executive and judicial
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:49.080]  powers the the designers the architects of its war over and over again publicly
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.000]  this is not going to compromise our national sovereignty this is not going
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.440]  to not in any way going to overrule we're not going to have a central
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:03.800]  bureaucracy that's going to ruin home rule local rule now as you pointed out
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.320]  early now they come out well of course we have to do that we can't have a
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:12.320]  federal state without without giving up national sovereignty and now what
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:18.360]  they're trying to promote that with the on a new level with this transatlantic
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:24.120]  trade and investment partnership with the United States which is now President
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:28.400]  Obama has asked for fast-track authority to push through Congress and so that's
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:33.000]  going to be one of the that is one of the battles right before us now because
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:40.480]  if they can push that through then again we have no recourse will follow down the
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:49.080]  same road the nations of Europe have gone and having transnational courts
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:55.440]  transnational legislatures Parliament control every aspect of our lives there
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.200]  will be no recourse is that people of Europe are fighting William doesn't it
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:05.680]  come down to this doesn't it come down to the fact that big mega wealthy love
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.920]  monopolies as they openly talk about because then there's no competition and
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.320]  and they just basically buy off the government's and then shut down their
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.960]  competition and then on top of it they're basically eugenicists who think
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:20.360]  there's too many people show you know why not cut the resources off I mean
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:23.760]  what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole if they get their world government what
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:30.640]  are they going to set up well I I think we can have his as Patrick Henry said
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:36.000]  I have no lamp to guide by my path except for the light of history and we
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:43.240]  know that absolute power corrupts absolutely and we've seen that in every
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:52.000]  communist Nazi fascist dictatorship of any kind and the fact that these folks
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:59.440]  who are promoting this now happen to be so-called respectable bankers and
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:06.280]  presidents and secretaries of state and whatnot once they have total power they
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:11.240]  are human beings that flows automatically and when we know that
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:18.480]  their actual history these people are certifiable megalomaniacs they want to
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:23.160]  have total power and no one who has total power and wants total power will
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:28.560]  use it beneficently I agree more and more we see an endgame the billions of
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.800]  bullets the armored vehicles the army manual saying you know that mainline
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:37.280]  Christian groups are bad I mean this is what you'd expect a weatherman to do if
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:41.880]  they were president do you agree with me that things are now moving in Mach speed
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.080]  because they're behind on their timetable as Brzezinski has said or
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:49.000]  where do you see the world right now very clear that they have missed quite a
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:56.440]  number of very important date lines along the way in terms of putting
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:01.520]  through for instance the free trade area the Americas in terms of getting the
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:08.240]  declaration of interdependence all of these things which we've published
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:12.800]  numerous times where the carbon tax four years ago when that got leaked I mean
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:19.440]  we're having victories when we engage them absolutely and so there is seeming
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:26.680]  it's frenetic activity going on but you know if you go back to one of the signal
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:32.960]  manifestos of the one worlders the insiders in this regard we've quoted a
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:38.920]  lot I'm sure you have as well 1974 foreign affairs Richard and Gardner CFR
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:44.600]  trilateralist Columbia University professor emeritus international law
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:50.040]  level I mean he's served on a number of he wrote about he wrote a article called
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.200]  the hard road to world order and it's one of the most important ones there's
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.760]  many others like but yeah one of the phrases that he used in there is he said
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:04.280]  as this happens as we begin forming this world government through regional
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:10.480]  arrangements on environment on the economy on the security etc it will look
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.080]  like a booming buzzing confusion in other words there's going to be all this
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.120]  activity it's be hard to for people to keep their eyes on it but out of this
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:25.320]  confusion they have a plan it's going to create this new world order in which
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:29.840]  through all these regional arrangements the national sovereignties are destroyed
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:37.720]  and and the first the world order as it was of nation states is disaggregated
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:42.800]  and then it is brought back together in this new aggregation of a new world
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:49.600]  order that's right new sub sub 10 region breakdowns 10 FEMA regions 10 global
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.600]  regions three mega regions within that and this is all right so this is
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:59.720]  happening on multiple levels and that's I was at the day let's stay there so we
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:03.880]  gotta go to break I want to come great news pure water lovers big Berkey

[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:29.960]  supposed redhead guy that nobody could find for a week who reportedly said it
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:34.480]  was all Alex Jones's fault that the guys basically did what they did and then no
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.680]  one could say who actually talked to him in the Associated Press and Kurt Nemo put an
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:43.560]  article out today at mforwards.com saying nobody can find him and saying
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.520]  you know this looks like a perfect cutout to make this up and demonize the
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:51.760]  internet well sure enough the Daily Mail did find him in Rhode Island I want to
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:55.360]  send to Imbadandi over there to interview him and so this just confirms Kurt's
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.280]  article that it's basically just made up because he says it's made up and he
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.480]  didn't say those things when you get that added to Kurt's article Misha the
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:08.560]  radicalizer story hits a speed bomb the emerging narrative on the Boston bombing
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:13.920]  and the role allegedly played by the now deceased Tamerlan hinges on a shadowy
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.680]  figure the government calls Misha it said the red-bearded Muslim lives in
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.840]  the Boston area but could not be located by authorities or the corporate media
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:24.960]  well now he's been found Daily Mail drugs report.com right-hand side we need
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:29.640]  to add that to this article and it just adds to what Kurt was saying so there
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:34.680]  you go that story's been on drugs since this morning okay going back to our
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:42.200]  guests in this little segment the next and Gerald Cilente is coming in William
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:45.600]  F Jasper of the New American magazine again whether she were getting into
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:50.280]  being at these globalist meetings and how they operate go ahead one of the
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:57.120]  very important ones where we see this convergence going on this is a very
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:01.160]  important term that I'm sure many of your listeners are familiar with but
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:04.800]  they should be more and more familiar with this convergence where this was a
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:09.520]  plan after World War two is first to build up the communist countries where
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.200]  the Hegelian dialectic where they would be a credible force against the free
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:21.360]  world and then to have a well we can't have this constant threat of nuclear war
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:25.440]  we're gonna have to have some kind of convergence where we'll all come
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:31.640]  together well we couldn't do that with communism being what Lenin called war
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:37.120]  communism antagonistic so we had to have peace communism and so that's what
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:42.040]  happened over the last 20 years supposedly communism has collapsed now
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:47.800]  we can merge converge peacefully with the communist countries with China Russia
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.800]  etc and I was at one of these I've been at a number of the big convergence
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:57.240]  conferences one of the big venues for this is Gorbachev's state of the world
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:02.520]  forum which I've been at virtually all of them the big one of the big ones was
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.160]  in San Francisco in 1995 the anniversary of 50th anniversary of the founding of
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:11.080]  the United Nations in San Francisco Gorbachev was there had Ted Turner
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:16.160]  there's a big new Brzezinski all of the big names from around the world there
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:21.000]  and speaking Brzezinski made his speech which I reported on from there and we
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.160]  recorded it that's where he made his famous statement that we cannot leap
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:32.640]  into world government in one step it has to occur through gradual step-by-step
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:39.220]  regional developments and this of course is a restatement of what a number of
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:43.360]  other key one world New World Order architects have stated which we've
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:47.520]  reported on which is that we have to have these regional arrangements which
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:54.880]  destroy the national sovereignty by linking country to country and region to
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.040]  region and that's where we what we see happening through many of the different
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:07.600]  economic security military operations because they recognize that most
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.680]  Americans particularly by the other people in other countries as well would
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:17.480]  be opposed to actually building at the United Nations into to one globalized
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:21.640]  central government so they had to do it piecemeal and so that's what we see
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:27.640]  happening here with the trade agreements with environmental agreements with now
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:32.000]  the security agreements and this is what we see the authority to unelected
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.560]  corporate boards who can even exempt themselves from taxes and give
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:41.440]  themselves government contracts and too big to fill money it is incredible you

[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:43.720]  briefly before you finish your points there's only a five-minute segment how
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:46.480]  do people subscribe to the New American magazine because even if you think you
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:49.480]  know everything about this you will learn a lot there every month and it's
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:55.720]  meticulously researched and at the same time people can then pay it forward
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:00.960]  hand it off to other people I mean that's I cannot understand you know
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:06.840]  overstate anything I say is an understatement of the entire movement
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:11.600]  against the globalist the original battle prospectus breakdown on their
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:17.800]  plan is from mr. Welsh and you over the last 37 years and others mr. McManus I
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:22.760]  mean it's such a small group too and absolutely demonized and but knowing
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:28.320]  you're right and they're probably 10 to 15 years behind their own documents so
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.040]  god bless you I mean I just I salute everybody that that's been fighting the
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.880]  globalist Jim Tucker American Free Press just died he helped fight him as well
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:41.560]  but where do you see the future going so we get into nuts and bolts we'll
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:44.440]  have you back very soon know why it's every few years if you'll come back

[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:52.080]  Skype and a good microphone but mr. Jasper how do they subscribe and where
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:57.920]  do you see this battle going in the future okay great is the new American
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:06.400]  calm we have both the magazine which you mentioned it's actually bi-weekly and so
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:12.040]  25 issues here we take a break one one week so at 25 issues it's $39 for the
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:18.120]  print or you get 49 for $49 you get the print and you can get it via email and
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:23.240]  PDF form as well and there's a lot of exclusive stuff in the print magazine
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:28.000]  we're we're while many of the major print magazines have folded or gone
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.280]  under in major newspapers we're still holding in there doing the actual hard
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:38.440]  copy print magazine please don't stop because people really pay attention to
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:44.560]  hard copy people really pay attention I have to stress also the online edition
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:53.120]  we have 10 to 15 new articles a day that are going to be appearing in the in the
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:57.600]  print magazine so there's some material that we include in both but there's
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.120]  exclusive material online and in print so it's a now I see you guys linked up
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:09.040]  on the drugs report the new world orders gotta hate that this is one of the
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:12.960]  encouraging things Alex and that is that as it gets later and later in the game
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:20.400]  as the lines begin to be drawn here and people see hey wait a second we're
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:27.040]  losing freedom every step of the way here let's let's find out about it more
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:30.320]  and more people are waking up the big question is are we gonna wake up enough
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:35.640]  people in enough time and get them going getting us all shooting in the right
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:41.440]  direction figuratively of course but I think we're gonna win if everybody takes
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:46.520]  action well I mean I mean I really see us more and more gaining ground one of
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:52.240]  the things you mentioned is that there's so much happening there they're speeding
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.600]  up this whole thing on a lot of different levels and that is true and I
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:00.080]  see part of it as desperation they are in fact we've published a number of
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.280]  things showing that many of the people that are pushing this in Congress but
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:07.600]  also in the think tanks with places like the Council on Foreign Relations one
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.000]  nothing they are saying amongst themselves hey we can't let the the
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.200]  crazy people out there know what's going on we can't let the American people know
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:23.920]  they'll all go berserk over this and so at areas at venues like the World
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:29.400]  Economic Forum and other high globalist meeting places like this they are
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:34.160]  acknowledging that hey we've got to step things up here we've got to be more
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:39.920]  deceptive we've got a undermine opposition within and that's what
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:43.240]  they're doing and it's only backfiring William F Jasper thanks for spending an
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.960]  hour with us I look forward to having you and other folks that you recommend

[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:02.720]  town is basically rotting back into the hills once a vibrant place but it's

[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:52.840]  joining us and the helm the calm is now yours captain well thank you so much it's
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:57.400]  a real honor for me to be here today Alex and what I like to do during this
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:03.200]  segment is really what we do every day on trends in the news it's part of the
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:07.520]  subscription to the trends journal and their nightly broadcasts of course
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.280]  they're not as long as the one I'm going to do now but they average anywhere
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:19.080]  between 15 to 20 minutes so let's start off with today's trends in the news and
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:25.280]  the first one one of the ones you just mentioned is that White House
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:31.320]  correspondence dinner you know I was just listening to William Jasper of New
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:38.960]  American magazine and say and you Alex saying that yes we can change this it
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:45.560]  can be changed we don't have to go down this course and if you don't believe me
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:54.240]  look at the White House correspondence dinner and how lame it is and you think
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:11:01.320]  you're in a high school assembly just listen to some of this stuff I
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:07.220]  recognize that this job can take a toll on you I understand second term need a
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:12.680]  burst of new energy try some new things and then my team and I talked about it
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.080]  we're willing to try anything so we borrowed one of the Michelle's tricks
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:32.160]  that's enough that's enough then you hear Conan O'Brien you listen to the
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:39.920]  prostitutes clap on cue it's disgusting and what's more disgusting is how
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:45.160]  anybody could look up to this stuff and you look at all the media that came out
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:52.680]  Obama hit him with a one-two punch Oh Conan was fabulous the guys are reading
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:58.960]  like this from their notes and all the prostitutes laugh they should be it's a
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:05.760]  disgraceful spectacle of human beings acting at the lowest level so you take
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:11.120]  this information and this is what you're fighting this is what you're up against
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:15.880]  you're up against nothing you've heard me say this before I'll say it again
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:21.880]  all these politicians are are the same people you couldn't stand in high school
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:26.360]  in college that wanted to be class president and head of the student
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:32.480]  council the suck-ups to brown noses the glad Anders the overly ambitious and the
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:38.520]  insincere and who are the prostitutes the same clowns that were the journalists
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:43.120]  that ran the school newspapers it's like they're talking to the principal of the
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:47.440]  school or the or the president of the college when they interview the
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:53.680]  president so when I listen to mr. Jasper when I listen to Alex Jones the future
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:59.680]  is ours unless you think you're there better than you are so to me it's very
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:06.720]  hopeful you look at these clown acts amateur hour for what it is let's move
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:14.640]  on gold well gold prices are up a little bit today and they're up about 12% since
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:19.280]  when they bottomed out a few weeks ago yeah and I've said this before for those
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:26.080]  of you who haven't heard it before my first buy of gold was in 1978 at 170
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.160]  hundred eighty seven dollars and fifty cents an ounce I also bought gold on
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:40.200]  January 20th 1980 at the high during the day at 875 it closed at 850 I remember
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.520]  what it felt like back then when the market was diving very different
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:50.920]  sentiment now back then there was no Russia back then there was no China
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:56.200]  Russia was a Soviet Union everything east of Berlin was locked behind the
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:03.240]  Iron Curtain the only thing people knew back then about China was now India they
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:08.800]  do nothing about India it's a global world now you're seeing the people
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:16.560]  rushing in to buy gold as the prices are dropping because everyone knows that you
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:22.840]  cannot keep juicing the economy by printing more money so look at the news
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:28.520]  today oh on May 2nd they're gonna need over there in the European Central Bank
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:34.760]  and they're gonna be lowering interest rates that's the word coming out from
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:42.560]  the experts and then you look what's going on why is the market even going up
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:47.240]  a little bit today read the information they'll tell you
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:54.240]  why is Bloomberg there's just a positive tone to the market in part because
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:01.280]  recent lack luck lackluster economic trends have reinforced investors belief
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:07.560]  that the Federal Reserve will continue to press on the gas pedal and that's
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:14.880]  from Chad Morgan Landa and his firm they they oversee a hundred and thirty
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:20.720]  billion dollars gas on the pedal you know what kind of language that is I
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:25.960]  can't say this on this show but the first letter is B and the second letter
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:32.880]  is S in saying the two words because that's what that is gas to the pedal no
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:39.600]  it's pumping more worthless money into the economy and devaluing the currency
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:48.000]  and it's going on globally and that's why I believe in gold let's look at some
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.640]  of the headlines this is from the New York Times the self-proclaimed paper a
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:59.000]  record of which I like to call it the toilet paper of record considering the
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.560]  wonderful job they've done to take us to war for fake reasons and to keep propping
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:10.720]  up the lies and keeping the propaganda going this is a great one
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:18.280]  Karzai's office gets bags full of cash from the CIA a decade of paying for
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:24.560]  Afghan influence can you imagine that don't have a job the one you have stinks
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:30.280]  can't pay your mortgage don't have any rent money can't make ends meet don't
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:38.520]  worry about it it's all outlined here we call it ghost money said Kali Roman who
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:46.920]  served as mr. cars eyes chief of staff from 2002 to 2005 it came in secret and
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:54.240]  left in secret all told tens of millions of dollars and it goes on and on and on
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:17:02.400]  how this scam the CIA's money it's your money hey cities are rotting Alex is
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:07.480]  talking about our rundown Little Rock looks don't worry about it we got to
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:11.400]  send the money over there to the criminal group so that they could wash
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:18.200]  it and keep the wars going you read the quotes in this paper it is astounding
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:25.280]  the things they say yeah CIA's money goes to paying off warlords nothing like
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:31.080]  a warlord oh they're wonderful you need a good warlord your community and
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:36.920]  politicians many of whom have ties to the drug trade then in some cases the
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:42.480]  Taliban yeah one of go back to the correspondence dinner look who's running
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:46.920]  this country look who's making these decisions if you're right and do
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:53.200]  anything like this so stupid and our jobs we would be fired but it's okay
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:58.960]  when the government does it the headlines here are astounding the cash
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:04.960]  does not appear to be subject to oversight and restrictions no hey it's
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:11.560]  their money the CIA's money where they get it they got it from you this is
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:17.000]  where your tax dollars are going no more foreign intervention everything they do
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:23.960]  there it's a loser and you can't see a bigger loser then right over here on the
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:32.560]  front page of the toilet paper of record so that's where it's all going that's
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:38.240]  where it's heading and it doesn't look very good yeah these quotes are
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:43.960]  brilliant huh much of it also goes to keeping all warlords in line check this
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:51.520]  line out this is from an old warlord mr. Dostrom I asked for a year upfront cash
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:59.720]  so I could build my dream house he was quoted as saying in a 2009 interview in
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:07.960]  Time magazine that's right he gets his hundred thousand dollars upfront piles
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:13.800]  it up so he could build a home of his choice so this is what we do on trends
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:18.400]  in the news because as we're talking about foreign affairs here's another
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:27.040]  wonderful little story Republicans warn of inaction on Syria oh yeah that guy
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:37.360]  again that little chicken hawk you know Lindsey Graham yeah calling for more war

[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:29.800]  talking about Syria when we went into the break don't worry about it the New
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:35.640]  York Times just reported hey them Islamists are taken over there in Syria
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:42.120]  that's okay they're everywhere and you know who built the Islamist group don't
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:50.120]  you that was Jimmy Carter yeah you remember the proxy war that the United
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:56.640]  States started giving money to people like Osama bin Laden and all the rest of
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:02.720]  them to fight the Russians when they were going into Afghanistan to stop the
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:10.240]  Russians yeah those Islamists so now they want more money they want more
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:17.680]  intervention people like Lindsey Graham calling for more action in Syria because
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:25.000]  it appears they're all suffering from attention deficit disorder classes
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:35.120]  clashes carry worries of a new civil war in Iraq that's right a new civil war in
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:43.320]  Iraq that's the word coming out right hey why believe me look at the papers
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:51.320]  Oh 11 dead in another car bomb in Iraq wonderful yeah but listen to what
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:58.240]  happened over when President Bush announced the opening of his new library
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:05.200]  you know President Obama said that he's drawing a red line that Syria can't
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:12.460]  cross I wonder if he got the crayon from Bush to draw that red line what a
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:17.480]  wheeze I love these land the language that they use we're taking this off the
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:21.700]  table that's the other that's the other lovely one they use we're taking it all
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:27.160]  off the table and we're drawing a red line Islamist rebels create dilemma on
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:35.040]  Syria policy nowhere in rebel-controlled Syria is there a secular fighting for us
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:43.160]  to speak of and this is from the toilet paper of record so following going back
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:50.400]  to how they keep screwing up and getting more opportunities to do so
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:57.800]  call row if you remember him that was Bush's frontman back man sideman and
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:07.240]  man behind the scenes yeah the porky pig of politics Karl Rove yeah Karl Rove on
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:15.380]  Bush legacy he got the big things right I do believe that the Iraq War was the
[02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:23.080]  right thing to do and the world is a safer place for having Saddam Hussein
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:30.240]  gone don't you all feel happy don't you feel safe having a nice day who cares
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:37.160]  about Saddam Hussein what a big lie and how come these guys aren't brought up on
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:44.560]  war criminal charges to see who knew what when regarding WMDs of weapons and
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:49.840]  mass destruction so Bush was interviewed by all of the
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:56.520]  prostitutes on all of the channels from the mainstream media and they all sucked
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:04.240]  up and all Bush kept saying and all the mouthpieces are saying is let's let
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:11.080]  history decide oh yeah let history decide of Bush messed up or not why let
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:16.400]  history decide let's decide now with the facts I'll tell you why they want
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:24.080]  history to decide here keeps going here he goes the porky pig of politics Karl
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:31.680]  Rove the greats you know you can't touch George Washington Abraham Lincoln FDR
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:38.600]  the greats but yeah I put George Bush up there says Rove who refers to a recent
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:47.840]  ABC Washington Post poll that found 40% approve of Bush as evidence that he will
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:54.520]  continue to be remembered more keenly as time goes by he'll be continued he'll be
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:29:00.000]  remembered more keenly as time goes by because everybody will forget what a
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:06.560]  screw-up he was he didn't even show up on inauguration day that's right that's
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:11.760]  how much the people hated him they pulled him they pulled up those Chaney
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:17.240]  it didn't show up they booed Bush when he showed up with Obama that they never
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:22.680]  booed a president a leaving president before Mussolini could have got elected
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:30.440]  after having eight years of Bush and guess what we got him fascism the merger
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:36.040]  of state and corporate powers and we're gonna look at more of that when we come
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:41.840]  back with trends in the news and we're gonna see why China is gonna outbeat the
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:47.080]  United States as we keep going down but there are other ways to go up and we'll

[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:46.560]  American I believe in the Constitution I believe in the Declaration of
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:52.320]  Independence and I believe in the principles upon which this country was
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:59.040]  founded and when you see little cartoon characters like the Clintons and the
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:07.200]  bushes and the Obama's doing their cheap routines and put them in a category with
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:15.840]  Madison's and Jefferson's and Washington's who warned us not to become
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:24.240]  engaged in foreign entanglements who are these little weasels like Lindsey Graham
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:33.720]  and McCain insane McCain and by the way he's not a war hero no he crashes his
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:38.240]  plane a couple of times couldn't land on the aircraft carrier and if his old man

[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:48.000]  was flying over bombing innocent Vietnamese and they shot down his plane
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.200]  that does not make you a hero and these are the people that keep yelling for
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:37:00.240]  more more bring home the troops bring home the money we build America this is

[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:58.560]  should bury it but they're gonna prop it up because it's easy when you have a
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:04.840]  centralized currency a centralized bank to steal your money it makes it a lot
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:11.840]  easier than doing a lot of smaller deals and a guy yesterday went berserk in
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:18.520]  Italy mayhem greets Italy's quote grand coalition grand coalition of mobsters
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:27.040]  yeah this is the guy Luigi Preti 46th unemployed and apparently driven to

[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:58.760]  what we're seeing more and more of let's move on to some other news here what do
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:05.520]  we got here in the Wall Street Journal more about those Boston bombers there's
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:12.680]  a big visit big story talk about the 19 year old is being treated for gunshot
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:20.040]  wounds in his throat head and legs that he received during confrontations with
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:27.080]  police days after the April 15th bombing I'd be hitting the BS button on that one
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:33.000]  you know why you remember the story this story was in the Washington Post the
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.960]  story was all over the media that's right there was a confrontation you
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:41.800]  heard the word there was a confrontation they found them in the boat remember the
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:47.000]  guy goes outside having a smoke sees the top on his boats miss not not put on
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:51.560]  right see some blood stains there's the kid lying there wounded and what are the
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:58.840]  cops do you remember the first story they exchanged gunfire yeah yeah that's
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:03.720]  right they had what 9,000 troops there they could have you know they could have
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:07.480]  led the in the Battle of the Bulge they had enough equipment and men and
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:13.800]  armaments so no the gun battle never happened it was a lie just like the
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:19.360]  other lie or misinformation excuse me misinformation about how they also robbed
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:23.920]  the 7-eleven that they never robbed so why would anybody believe anything but
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:27.640]  here's the way they wrote it again this is from the new from the Wall Street
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:34.080]  Journal received during confrontations with police no they shot into the boat
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:39.920]  the kid was lying there could they say come out your hands up whatever happened
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:53.360]  to that one what else do we have Iceland Iceland votes out pro-european leadership
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:44:02.960]  yay yay yay little Iceland tiny little Iceland they didn't pay back the bankers
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:08.440]  they're having a tough time over there but they're not robbing the people of
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:17.800]  their money to give it to the banking operations a little bit closer to home
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:22.760]  because again you know I was listening to the opening of the show with mr.
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:27.880]  Jasper and how things have to change and of course when Alex Jones show he always
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.080]  talks about you know stopping the corruption and and bringing the bringing
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:40.560]  the nation back to the people here's a little story in Sunday's New York Times
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:49.600]  many openings that state agency goes to ties goes to those with ties to Governor
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:55.520]  Cuomo I'm only mentioning this because it's the same thing everywhere if you
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:02.120]  read about the the guy they just arrested in Bosnia the guy in France
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:07.880]  that was supposed to be cracking down on tax evaders you know that minister and
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:12.840]  then they found out he had a couple of million dollars in a Swiss account it's
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:20.720]  the same thing everywhere and nothing is going to change nothing until the
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:30.040]  morality changes and the fish rots from the head up so we we learn by our
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:37.720]  leaders we learn by those in power and the power is corrupt from the top down
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:43.840]  here New York State's economic development agency economic development
[02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:48.320]  agencies by the way I got my master's degree in public administration they're
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:54.440]  a waste of money all they do is they give benefits to the very rich hey I'm
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:57.760]  gonna tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna open up I'm gonna build a hotel
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:04.320]  and you're you're dying town over here I want a ten million dollar tax break I
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:08.840]  want loan guarantees and some infrastructure repairs and they do it
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:16.080]  which they should never do but anyway a new New York State economic
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:20.400]  development he created a new position last unit new position we're paying
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:26.520]  taxes like crazy and they're creating a new position and they found a candidate
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:31.240]  to fill it a young man named Willard Younger yeah young Willard Younger who
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:36.400]  had just graduated from Colgate University with a degree now check it
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:41.360]  out if you want a degree in worthlessness this guy couldn't do
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:46.920]  better but I have one better actually and you'll hear that one so a degree in
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:52.640]  classics and religion now you know what a degree in classic it's classics and
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:59.080]  religion gets you it gets you a job with the economic development agency a
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:10.600]  special projects assistant at a salary of $45,000 a year now wouldn't you
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:20.040]  think if they put an ad out for projects associate at a salary of $45,000 a year
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:26.800]  they could have actually gotten somebody qualified with experience or could it be
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:33.720]  I mean being you know they're several million people in in New York his father
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:41.160]  Steven P younger is a lawyer and power broker in legal circles who was a member
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:48.840]  of one of Governor Andrew M Cuomo's transitions team and he's also donated
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:56.040]  $45,000 yeah to mr. Cuomo's campaign over the years oh I'm nice
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:01.720]  Oh donated campaign you know these are called in real language now now they're
[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:06.040]  not campaign donations they're called bribes and payoffs and you saw the
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:11.120]  payoff that's why I'm a believer in direct democracy the whole system is
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:15.880]  rigged and if you're not in it you don't get anything from it this story actually
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:21.520]  gets a lot better you know it's one one stupid thing after another and and and
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:27.440]  and the jobs that these guys get there's this other guy mr. mollis he was hired
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:36.600]  at $75,000 a year as a as a strategic planner associate he graduated with a
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:47.040]  degree in a SS y r i o l o g y a seriology the study of ancient
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:55.360]  Mesopotamia yeah yeah his ties his father and his father's real estate firm
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:03.400]  have donated a total of $75,000 to the Cuomo campaign so I guess they broke
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:10.320]  even on that one huh 75 into the campaign 75 a year into his son's pocket
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:19.280]  the whole game is rigged all over the world so the stock markets going up a
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:26.520]  little bit today how come well as I said earlier good news good news the feds
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:32.720]  gonna keep its foot on the pedal that's right pumping more money that's boosting
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:39.960]  the market now this is important interest rates as we know are at
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:47.240]  historic lows so the other reason that the markets going up spending home sales
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:50:01.520]  increased 1.5% after a revised 1% decline the prior month it was 0.4% when
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:11.520]  it came out with this number now remember 1.5% this is after dumping
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:17.800]  trillions of dollars into the economy this is after keeping interest rates at
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:26.640]  record lows and this is after the FHA are giving out loans with people only
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:37.240]  putting down 5% so you can see even with all of this juice going in it's not

[02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:24.400]  we do every Monday through Friday as part of your subscription to the trends
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:28.720]  journal now I said I was going to give some positive elements say a little bit
[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:33.080]  more about China China is going to do better than the United States I don't
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:37.360]  believe China is going to go to war they're building their internal economy
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:42.440]  they have 1.2 billion people there and they have a lot of business to do with
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:47.000]  each other and that's where they're going to go in the future and that's the
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:52.440]  way America should go that's the way Italy should go you know my saying think
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:58.440]  for yourself that's the way I see it I want my money staying in my country I
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:03.240]  don't want it going anywhere anywhere in foreign aid anywhere in foreign products
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:08.880]  I want to buy I want to buy shoes from me from it from America I want to buy my
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:15.760]  shirts made in America and I want to buy all my product local and boy do we have
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:21.040]  great local product up here in colonial Kingston in the heart of the Hudson
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:26.840]  Valley I just had some cup of cola that they made over here locally that was as
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:32.920]  good as I've had in Italy the way we bring this back is we do business with
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:38.440]  each other just like the Chinese are going to do and hey if it's good enough
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:44.320]  for the Chinese why shouldn't it be good enough for us maybe you want to buy that
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:51.360]  next shirt from another sweatshop that blows up burns down or is destroyed in
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:57.440]  Bangladesh that just killed 400 people so you could go shopping at a large
[02:55:57.440 --> 02:56:05.400]  self-storage unit that they call Walmart a target buy local and number one again
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:12.400]  think for yourself only mutt what I'm saying break the chains if you're gonna
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:19.800]  go out for a cup of coffee break the chains go local break the chains we
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:27.080]  have become corporate slaves unless of course you go to Colgate and your old
[02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:32.240]  man gives Cuomo money or whatever other state you live in then you get a good
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:40.240]  job with your degree in worthlessness so those are some positive elements the
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:47.200]  future doesn't have to be the way it's going we create the future again go back
