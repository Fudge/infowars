[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  The message that this conveys is that unless things change, unless the arms race is reversed,
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000]  we're heading toward this midnight from which there can be no relief.
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  The Doomsday Clock has been set to 90 seconds to midnight.
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  The closest it has ever been to global annihilation of the planet.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  Members of the Science and Security Board move the hands of the Doomsday Clock forward.
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.000]  Largely, though not exclusively, because of the mounting dangers in the war in Ukraine.
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  We move the clock forward the closest it has ever been to midnight.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  It is now 90 seconds to midnight.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  Hundreds of thank you are not hundreds of talents.
[00:48.000 --> 00:57.000]  All of us can use thousands of wars in discussions, but I cannot put wars instead of guns that are needed against Russian artillery.
[00:57.000 --> 01:05.000]  It is in your power to guarantee such artillery and any aircraft that will cross terror.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  It is in your power to make the victory.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  So may your decisions hit accurately.
[01:13.000 --> 01:22.000]  Germany to provide Poland approval this week to send thousands of heavy battle tanks into Ukraine.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  We will also deliver battle tanks to Ukraine, Leopard 2 tanks.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  That is the result of a very close and intense discussions with our partners, with our allies.
[01:38.000 --> 01:45.000]  Our aim is to deliver two tank battalions together with our allies.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  There are many countries that want to join in.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  We will coordinate it and include these countries.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  We will train Ukrainian crews here.
[01:54.000 --> 02:04.000]  We will make logistics available, replenishment, and we will also allow partner countries to deliver these tanks.
[02:04.000 --> 02:16.000]  There are many citizens in this country that are worried because of this decision and the dimensions that this type of arm brings about.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  Please trust us, trust the government.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  We are fighting a war against Russia and not against each other. Thank you.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  American lawmakers urge U.S. to ship Abrams frontline battle tanks to Ukraine.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  Reuters reports breaking.
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  The Biden administration is leaning toward sending a significant number of Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine.
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  And the announcement of deliveries could start this week, U.S. officials says.
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.000]  Today I am announcing that the United States will be sending 31 Abram tanks to Ukraine, the equivalent of one Ukrainian battalion.
[02:52.000 --> 03:02.000]  Secretary Austin has recommended this step because it will enhance the Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  The Abrams tanks are the most capable tanks in the world.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  They are also extremely complex to operate and maintain.
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  So we are also giving Ukraine the parts and equipment necessary to effectively sustain these tanks on the battlefield.
[03:16.000 --> 03:39.000]  Got a shocking video of scores of F-16s spinning around in the air in Denmark in an attack exercise on the Russians.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  Soiling for nuclear war. And George Soros has crawled out from under his rock or climbed up out of hell.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  Stories up on infowars.com.
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  George Soros urged use of Eastern European soldiers to reduce the risk of body bags for NATO countries in a New World Order article.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  They say New World Order.
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.000]  I'm afraid to ask, but what nuclear options does Russia have?
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  Well, Russia has a lot of nuclear options and so does NATO.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  And I don't think that either side would deliberately initiate the use of nuclear weapons.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  But the concern is that when you have a war, things get out of control sometimes.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  And there are many different ways in which this conflict could spiral into a broader war between NATO and Russia.
[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  And both sides have military doctrine that allows them to use nuclear weapons in the event that they are losing a conventional battle.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  And so there's a real potential here for this to take place.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  Mr. Gerald Salente always say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  That's what the globalist five years ago at the EU said.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  They said, if you try to get rid of the EU or try to get rid of the New World Order, we'll just have a major war.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  That's how they hold us hostage.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Well, I have fantastic stuff.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  Diet force? Diet force is amazing.
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  Like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[05:20.000 --> 05:28.000]  Man, if you're struggling to get chip shaped for the ladies, diet force is the go.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  You have to get the diet force and have two a day and just keep active.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  Infowarsstore.com, X7 diet force.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  Infowarsstore.com, baby.

[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  Diet force.

[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  I can guarantee you that.
[05:44.000 --> 05:45.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  God bless Australia.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  We'll be right back, folks.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  Infowarsstore.com, diet force.
[05:50.000 --> 06:19.000]  Get it now.
[06:20.000 --> 06:34.000]  The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  Don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  That's called World War III.
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  Okay.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  Well, that's Biden just a few months after the conflict started.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  We're coming up on a year now.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  And now he's reversed all that.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  And it's called World War III.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  In fact, that's such an important clip.
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  Let's just go ahead and play that clip one more time.
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  Don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  That's called World War III.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  Okay.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.000]  You know what?
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  Let's just play that clip three more times in a row.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand.
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  Don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say.
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.000]  That's called World War III.
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  Okay.
[07:55.000 --> 08:01.000]  The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  Don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  That's called World War III.
[08:13.000 --> 08:14.000]  Okay.
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  Don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  That's called World War III.
[08:32.000 --> 08:33.000]  Okay.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  I've never played a clip four times in a row, five times in a year, but I think I should
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  just play that for four hours today because every actuary, every historic war game, every
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  analysis shows this leads to total thermal nuclear war.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  And we're following up the ladder of escalation.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  So people ask me, how are you handling all your problems and all the attacks on you and
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.000]  your family and crew?
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  Well, it's not enjoyable to be attacked by the deep state, but we got to fight these
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  crazy people.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  We got to politically stop them, culturally stop them, economically stop them because
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  it's insane.
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  It's even Henry Kissinger and the Pope in the last six, seven months have been against
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.000]  this war.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  Now they're for it, or Henry Kissinger is.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  It's madness, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  We opened the phones up yesterday, had a lot of incredible callers on the subject of World
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  War II and their ramifications of it and how we can stop it.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  I'm going to do it again.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  I'm going to open the phones up again, and we're just going to take three, four hours
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  of phone calls.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  I had some guests scheduled.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  We canceled them.
[09:37.000 --> 09:46.000]  Also, I was sent this yesterday and the guy looked so young that I found it hard to believe.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  And so my producers did a deep dive.
[09:50.000 --> 09:51.000]  Other folks have done a deep dive.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  A lot of phone calls last night and this morning from very well-known talk show host asking
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  me, is it real?
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  And yes, it's as real as it gets.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  It's as real as a heart attack.
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  Project Veritas got a senior executive at Pfizer and he's very young right out of Yale
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  just a few years ago with a medical background, bragging how they souped up and create new
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  coronaviruses so they can roll out new vaccines for them, new mRNAs.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  Now, I don't need this guy to tell me that.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  That's in the Fauci emails.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  That was done at Wuhan years before they released the virus.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  They already had the quote mRNA sequences ready.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  That's all come out in the emails.
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  It's all come out in Congress.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  It came out years ago.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.000]  Got almost no attention.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  Now it's getting a lot of attention.
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  But here's this guy laughing and giggling about how it's a cash cow and how it's a business
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.000]  forever for these people.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  Just smoking gun.
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  And they pulled his bio off the Pfizer website.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  He's the head of mRNA technology worldwide.
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  I know that Dr. Malone and Steve Kirsch and others were on the line with that big group
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  meeting they had on Twitter last night with 17,000 listeners at one time.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  That's good for Twitter.
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  But the point is they had all these big wigs last night concurring this guy's real.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  And I got calls saying, is this real?
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  And I said, I don't know.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  Let me look.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  That guy's saying it's true from what we know they did already.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  But people don't care about documents.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  They love a person admitting it.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  And I get it.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  We're visual creatures.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  It's like a Perry Mason moment.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  And I've watched the whole undercover video of this guy.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  There's a nine minute boil down in FullWars.com.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  And it just makes you sick at your stomach.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  And when I confirmed this was real this morning, and we have really confirmed it.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  I've got all the evidence right here.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  It's all background, everything.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  I mean, I literally got nauseous and went in the bathroom and threw up my breakfast.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  And I'm not the type of guy that threw up before football games.
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  The type of guy that threw up before I would go meet the bully after school.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  I mean, I've got pretty good nerves.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  But just watching them brag that they did it killed all these people.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  They think it's funny.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  And they're going to keep doing it.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  And they're going to cause World War III.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  Because we let them.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  And I guess our whole Justice Department, our government, our academia and our whole system is just bad.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  I guess God just turns us over to a spirit of evil and is going to let us all nuke ourselves.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  And I guess that's better than slowly cutting the children's genitals off and aborting the hundreds of millions of babies and all the rest of it.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  So I guess we're just cutting to the chase here.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  But I don't think the children deserve this.
[12:36.000 --> 12:44.000]  We don't deserve this.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  It just makes me sick.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  It makes me physically want to throw up right now.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  Because it's so stupid to let these people keep doing this.
[12:56.000 --> 13:07.000]  Our collective passiveness and our collective Stockholm syndrome has just turned the world over to a bunch of mad scientists and crazy bureaucrats and crazy academics and media people.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  And they are running the world over the edge of the cliff.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  Then I've got video.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  And once I watched one, I noticed there were a bunch of others being posted to the Twitter feed.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  And I was watching this last night this morning.
[13:19.000 --> 13:29.000]  And it's just unbelievable how they've got kindergarten students.
[13:29.000 --> 13:40.000]  And they're sitting there with a black doll, anatomical doll of like a two-year-old black toddler boy.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And they're telling them, is this a boy? Is this a girl?
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  Or could it be a boy or a girl?
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  And teaching them how to have gender dysphoria.
[13:46.000 --> 13:55.000]  And a kindergartner, until you're in at least the fourth grade, you can't even make cogent thoughts and differentiate fiction from nonfiction.
[13:55.000 --> 14:04.000]  And so this is real child abuse by these alien leftists who all look like they're not even human.
[14:04.000 --> 14:14.000]  And they send their priest out from this death religion of transhumanism to absolutely screw up our children and create these designations for them when they're in kindergarten or first grade.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  If they get confused because the teacher confuses them, they put them in a government file and fast track them for sterilization.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  And we just sit here and we just take it.
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  And I got stacks of articles in the UK and the US of men brutally raping women in prison because they say that they're women.
[14:31.000 --> 14:38.000]  And convicted rapists identify as women while they're being convicted so they can be put in prison and rape more women.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  And the government says, that's okay, we're going to keep that going.
[14:41.000 --> 14:49.000]  And you ask, why are they doing this? Because they're murdering common sense in front of everybody's eyes.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  So I'll be completely honest with you.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  I know a lot of people tune out of the reality because it's hard to deal with.
[14:56.000 --> 15:06.000]  And I'm quite frankly reached the point where I took off a week a few weeks ago and wrote a bunch of notes about the future of the world and where the globals are going next.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  And the information I wrote over 30 pages of it is so horrible.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  I was looking at it again last night and I've been putting into the word processors about 40 pages long now.
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  And it just, it seems horrific to even come on air and tell you what's going to happen next.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  I think you've already got a good idea, you know what I mean to tell you most of you.
[15:26.000 --> 15:34.000]  But this is just ridiculous that this is going to destroy everybody, but we're still just like a runaway train going over the edge of a cliff.
[15:34.000 --> 15:42.000]  At some point soon, I'm going to just do a commercial free podcast deal for like an hour and just go over these notes and show some documents and do that.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  Because it's just you need to know.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but again, I don't think you need me to tell you.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  We are under satanic control and we are collapsing as a species.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  There may be still time to turn it around with God's help. Stay with us.
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  And Info Wars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical momento.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  So you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena,
[16:34.000 --> 16:41.000]  we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD, 300%,
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain.
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  Info Wars secret weapon is finally here.
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.000]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  And it also keeps Info Wars on the air.
[17:11.000 --> 17:18.000]  And I almost forgot you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a listener,
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  You're not going to find at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  You're not going to find two-market 95% of humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[17:51.000 --> 18:19.000]  Info Wars MD now available exclusively at infowarstore.com, a true 360 win.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  Only your commitment to get info wars on the air will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  They're coming for you and your family. They're coming for me. They're coming for the children.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  They're already given to the pregnant women.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[18:41.000 --> 18:47.000]  80% increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us. Let's do it together.
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  And the fight starts at infowars.com and the fight continues with your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  Now take action now.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.000]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors,
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  These products work great for women as well.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD. It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  We got it discounted for 40% off infowars.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  Read all about it. Be very safe with it.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Don't do it during the day.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  1776 testosterone boost. Totally incredible.
[19:45.000 --> 19:52.000]  Go read about them. Learn more about them at infowarsstore.com in the InfoWars Platinum section.
[19:52.000 --> 20:16.000]  And you get 40% off on these already bestselling products under the new name InfoWars Platinum.
[20:16.000 --> 20:23.000]  Humanity can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  You can run on for a long time.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  Alright, I'm going to say something right now and then I'm going to get into the war news.
[20:29.000 --> 20:35.000]  I'm going to get into the incredible gain of function Pfizer admissions.
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  That you know won't do anything at least for now.
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  Everybody should know that they're literally assaulting us with bio weapons and poison shots.
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  And laughing about it.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  But here's my frustration. I love the audience. I'm very thankful to all of you.
[20:52.000 --> 21:00.000]  But I'm very frustrated that this broadcast has been totally vindicated in spades.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  And we're getting a lot of support and we're getting a lot of people saying Alex Jones was right.
[21:04.000 --> 21:15.000]  But there should be more of that support because what we're covering can turn the tide against this evil and save countless lives.
[21:15.000 --> 21:21.000]  And yes, what we cover here, our worldview, our understanding is being adopted by everybody else right now.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  But we need to stay on air to be able to cover what's coming next.
[21:25.000 --> 21:33.000]  And continue to trailblaze because I'm still not seeing the level of understanding of the New World Order from even some of our top brains.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  Tucker is getting it. He's very smart.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  Rogan knows it all, but is careful about what he does.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  Bannon gets it. He's very smart.
[21:42.000 --> 21:52.000]  And there's others that get it, but they just, most of the people I'm not going to name, only get certain dimensions of this thing.
[21:52.000 --> 21:58.000]  Whereas I get the full spectrum, we have the guests, we have the callers, I immerse myself in this.
[21:58.000 --> 22:09.000]  And I'm very frustrated that my understanding of this is the most accurate understanding in the world of the New World Order outside of their operations, outside of their top people.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  I've had them try to hire me and tell me, you understand us, you understand the philosophy, you should join us.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  I've named names on that. This is very real.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  And we know how to beat these people.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  And so we're very important.
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  I'm not important. You're not important, but our mission is important.
[22:26.000 --> 22:40.000]  And collectively, what we've done is win over and over again and been number one when it comes to exposing the New World Order out of all these other wonderful organizations that we support and that we promote.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  And so that's why I'm asking you to keep me in the game.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  And it's very frustrating in this fight.
[22:46.000 --> 22:53.000]  And I'm not complaining. It's just the way it is that I have to spend five, six hours a day trying to get money to run this operation.
[22:53.000 --> 23:00.000]  And I have to pollute the show, even though they're great sponsors and things with too many ads to sit there and try to stay on air.
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.000]  And so when I really reach out to you, you come through, you buy more great products that already enrich your life, that are amazing.
[23:06.000 --> 23:24.000]  And so I'm not talking to the people that support us and buy products occasionally or once a month or every six months at m4s.com. I'm talking to the people that have been listening for years that know we're 95% accurate,
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  that know we're really trying to tell the truth, that know we have over the horizon view of things.
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  The Who song I can see for miles and miles and miles and so can my guests, so can my callers. Callers are incredibly smart.
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  I'm not patty on the head. You blow me away. You give me insight because we're really focused on this year.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  We're not covering this topic or that topic or jumping around.
[23:44.000 --> 23:51.000]  We're looking at the real controllers of the world and the history of the world and the future of the world and the future together.
[23:51.000 --> 24:00.000]  And that's why we're dead on. That's why I can tell you the Russians are going to invade in February in October of 2021.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  It's how I'm able to do this because I am immersed in this show.
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  It's simple. Less than 1% of our listeners and viewers ever buy product.
[24:10.000 --> 24:17.000]  If just 1% of you more would just make the decision to go to m4 store and get our bone broth formula,
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  that is the best bone broth formula out there to so much for your immune system, your joints, your bones, your blood,
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  your marrow that produces your white blood cells, everything.
[24:26.000 --> 24:33.000]  It's been sold out for several years. It's finally back with an updated formula even stronger with the turmeric and the chaga mushroom
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  and this concentrated bone broth from chickens and everything.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  You need that. It's amazing. Young people should be taken, especially people that are in sports,
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  but everybody above 40 should be taken. It's amazing.
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  Everybody knows grandma's chicken soup is great for you. Well, this is concentrated on that.
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  And so I'm just asking you to make the decision to do that because if we just had 1% of you more and it's starting to happen,
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  that message is cutting through to people. People are getting it.
[25:00.000 --> 25:09.000]  If just 1% more of you will simply go to m4store.com and get your vitamin D3 with us or get your vitamin B12 with us
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  or get your nitric oxide boosting systems that are so good for your heart and cardiovascular for us or your CBD oil.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  We've got a top rated national brand that let us private label it. We sell it for half of what they sell it in stores.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  It's a great deal. You heard Mike Adams talk about it. He reviews products for a living.
[25:25.000 --> 25:33.000]  So we got great products you need at m4store.com like 1776 testosterone boost and pain MD that are already top sellers in the country.
[25:33.000 --> 25:42.000]  We were able to private label them at a lower price. It's all there. So just make the decision to keep the organizations on the air,
[25:42.000 --> 25:50.000]  find the globalists. In fact, if half a percent of you started buying product, we would have no problems and could cut way back how much I plug.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  If 2% did, we could hire 30, 40 more people, have reporters be covering everything.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  We don't have the money to go to Bilderberg. We don't have the money to go to Davos.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  We don't have the money now. We used to see our reporters everywhere back in the time we had enough funds.
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  So help keep us on air. Help us expand. Hell, let's not just stay on air. Let's not just tread water. Let's go next level.
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  Go now. Take action. Make the decision to fund the tip of the spear. And I salute you and thank you.
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  And I think those that have been steadfast supporters, but I challenge the listeners that are great people and pray for the show and spread the word
[26:24.000 --> 26:34.000]  to go get products you already need at infowarstore.com and know that you stood up against the enemy and for the unborn and for the innocent at critical time
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.000]  and that you got products that supercharge your body's health, your immune system, and so much more.
[26:40.000 --> 26:52.000]  Go now to infowarstore.com. Also, 1776coin.com, we're almost a year behind in the projects that I was telling you
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  that your funding would help support. And we ended up doing four coins, and then that's it for the coins.
[26:58.000 --> 27:06.000]  We got like 700 or so of the coins left, the Teddy Roosevelt Manurena coin. It's got a markup on it because it's a donation.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  But you get a momento that's worth 30-something bucks, but for $100, so we have that extra money to operate.
[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  I was already weeks ago, then I launched a new project I'm doing that we've been working on for a long time.
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  And I've just been so busy with everything else we haven't, so next week I will launch a new project, and I'll just tell you what it is.
[27:25.000 --> 27:33.000]  It's going to be a commercial-free podcast three days a week, special guest so much more, and it's separate from info wars, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:33.000 --> 27:45.000]  And I also have offers on the table to be with five offers, and three of them are really good, but there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes,
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  so I've not accepted any of those offers because it's a lot of money for me.
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.000]  But I don't, at the end of the day, care about that. I care about things that are for free speech systems in this crew because I'm loyal to them.
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.000]  Now some of these deals are big enough that I may be able to go and let them shut all this down and just have a whole new platform with the same crew.
[28:03.000 --> 28:10.000]  It's just they want us to move to another city. So there's a lot of mechanics to all of this going on, and a lot of things going on behind the scenes.
[28:10.000 --> 28:21.000]  But I'm telling you, I believe we should keep this infrastructure and this operation we have now set up, and all I need is a quarter million dollars more a month to be able to do that easily.
[28:21.000 --> 28:29.000]  And that sounds like a lot, but when you look at how Buzzfeed spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and all these other companies are going bankrupt, the left is out of gas.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  The globalists have spent hundreds of billions of dollars fighting us. Our millions can counter them, and we can win.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  So support your local talk radio. Support your local talk shows to tell the truth.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  But this broadcast needs your support. So just make the commitment.
[28:42.000 --> 28:52.000]  But everybody got the 1776 coins and 776 coin dot com. You're going to get a free membership to the new podcast and a bunch of new stuff we're about to do.
[28:52.000 --> 29:08.000]  So if you want to be part of that, I would suggest now you go to 1776 coin dot com and get the final coins.
[29:22.000 --> 29:36.000]  I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Manly Arena coin, exclusively at 1776 coin dot com.
[29:36.000 --> 29:47.000]  And you can get $30 off this historic pure silver coin with promo code 1776 at 1776 coin dot com. No more of these will be made.
[29:47.000 --> 29:55.000]  If you want the coin, it's exclusively available right now for limited time at 1776 coin dot com $30 off.
[29:55.000 --> 30:21.000]  Use promo code 1776. Thank you for your support.

[30:34.000 --> 31:00.000]  I thank you all for your support. Please commit now to go to info or store dot com, get great products and make donations. I think of your support now take action. The globalist are counting on you, not taking action.
[31:00.000 --> 31:08.000]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing info wars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[31:08.000 --> 31:18.000]  Because they know we're pro human. They know we're telling the truth. They know we've got their number. They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[31:18.000 --> 31:45.000]  And God gave us through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body, stamina, libido, energy and immune systems. And we came out many years ago with real red pill plus that has all the documented compounds like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[31:45.000 --> 32:04.000]  This is the answer to the new world order's tyranny. This is real red pill plus sold out for two years, 50% off at info wars store dot com. Get the red pill plus exclusively info wars store dot com info wars is winning info wars is reaching more people than ever.
[32:04.000 --> 32:16.000]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago, mainstream media told you, but it's not true. They told you, we were going to be shut down. They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars. None of that's true. It's all being appealed.
[32:16.000 --> 32:25.000]  They want you to think info wars is dead. But if you simply stand up and support info wars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[32:25.000 --> 32:36.000]  But if they can convince you to leave and shut down, they're going to win. Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family. Go to info wars store dot com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t shirts, you name it.

[33:18.000 --> 33:24.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[33:24.000 --> 33:42.000]  Project Veritas is about to join us live on air RC Maxwell. They've broken hundreds of major stories, thousands over the years, but this one is sickening.
[33:42.000 --> 34:01.000]  A major Pfizer executive admitting that they are basically creating gain of function viruses. We released in the public for control and for massive quote cash cow profits. That is coming up. Here's a few minutes of the top story right now on Twitter.
[34:01.000 --> 34:16.000]  So many other places. Tens of millions of people watching it. It's it's the huge buzz everywhere. Here's a few minutes directed evolution. Pfizer R&D exec says COVID-19 created in Wuhan is cash cow for company breaking project Veritas Pfizer.
[34:16.000 --> 34:28.000]  Exploring mutating COVID-19 virus via directed evolution. That's gain of function on steroids to continue profiting from vaccines. Here's a few minutes of it and we'll go to RC Maxwell.
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  Pfizer ultimately is thinking about mutating COVID.
[34:32.000 --> 34:42.000]  Well, that's not what we say to the public. No, don't tell anyone the story. We're exploring like not, you know, the virus keeps mutating. Yeah.
[34:42.000 --> 34:57.000]  Well, one of the things we're exploring is like, why don't we just mutate ourselves so we can pre-emptively develop new vaccines, right? So we have to do that. If we're going to do that, though, there's a risk of like, as you could imagine, no one wants to be having a former company mutating viruses.
[34:57.000 --> 35:03.000]  We're like very controlled to make sure that this virus that you mutate doesn't create something like, you know, those everywhere. So I'm crazy.
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.000]  It's the way that the virus started in Wuhan, to be honest. Like, it makes no sense that these viruses pop out of nowhere. Yeah, I know.
[35:10.000 --> 35:19.000]  Meet Jordan Tristan Walker, a director of research and development strategic operations and mRNA scientific planning at Pfizer.
[35:19.000 --> 35:28.000]  It sounds like gain of function to me. I don't know. It's a little bit different. I think it's different. It's like, here's, it's definitely not gain of function.
[35:28.000 --> 35:34.000]  It sounds like it is. I mean, it's okay. No, no, no, no, no. You know, directed evolution is very different.
[35:34.000 --> 35:43.000]  You're not supposed to do gain of function research with the viruses. Like, yeah, but you do like these, like, selected direction mutations to try to see if you can make more coding.
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  Yeah. So there, there is research on that. I don't know how that's going to work, but not be any more outbreaks.
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  The gentleman.
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.000]  It's real folks. People didn't think it was real yesterday. I've tracked it down. Of course, Veritas has done their vetting.
[35:59.000 --> 36:09.000]  The guy is the director of worldwide R&D strategic operations, mRNA scientific planning out of Yale graduated years ago.
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  And it's all here. It's all true. And it gets even worse from there.
[36:13.000 --> 36:20.000]  Taking viruses, accelerating them into the future, making a more virulent mutating them is gain of function.
[36:20.000 --> 36:26.000]  The very definition of it. And we're joined by RC Maxwell spokesperson for project Veritas.
[36:26.000 --> 36:34.000]  Wow. This is just over the top. I don't blame people thinking this couldn't be real because when you watch the whole video, the admissions are just insane.
[36:34.000 --> 36:44.000]  What is your takeaway right now? And I'm imagining that there at your Veritas headquarters, this has got to be probably the biggest story you guys have ever broken.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  I mean, this is sickening.
[36:46.000 --> 36:53.000]  Absolutely, Alex. This is already our most viewed video on Twitter. Thanks for Elon for letting us back on the platform.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  I know that you're still waiting to get free speech there, Alex.
[36:57.000 --> 37:06.000]  Most viewed video on Twitter, this story is flying because of the damning admissions by someone who is a director, specifically working in mRNA science.
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  This person is two levels removed from Albert Borla, who is the CEO of Pfizer.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  And this video is shocking, mostly because of the carelessness in which this individual is talking.
[37:17.000 --> 37:28.000]  So I can understand how people could imagine the video is fake. This person is clearly a schmuck and he's speaking about the most sinister things, clearly with no concern about regulatory oversight.
[37:28.000 --> 37:41.000]  We have reached out to Pfizer. We asked them for comment. They acknowledged being who they were. They acknowledged that this, I spoke with the supervisor of Mr. Walker, who you see here in the video.
[37:41.000 --> 37:52.000]  She hung up on me and they have not obviously responded to our request for comment. We asked them if they were concerned about the repercussions from this, clearly they do not care.
[37:52.000 --> 38:02.000]  Clearly we recovered, uncovered earlier in the year, last year actually, that the reviewers are actually people who used to work at the drug companies themselves and it's all a racket.
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.000]  So clearly this is something that legacy media should be investigating, but they're not.
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.000]  And the video goes on, obviously, for folks that are listening. I mean, describe more of what you guys discovered.
[38:16.000 --> 38:30.000]  You also have the comments about how this is a cash cow, the ability to have a virus and to be able to mutate it and develop a vaccine and require yearly shots, a cash cow for the company.
[38:30.000 --> 38:41.000]  This is definitely shocking. I can tell you that Pfizer is currently working on controlling the narrative on this. They may not have responded to our request for comment, but they're already censoring comments on Instagram.
[38:41.000 --> 38:51.000]  They're censoring comments even on ads on TikTok. Comments have been turned off. So Pfizer is definitely very aware of this. They're doing all they can to go into damage control.
[38:51.000 --> 38:59.000]  I'm sure the legacy media will also be doing damage control on this, attacking us and coming with their illegitimate fact checks.
[38:59.000 --> 39:12.000]  You can see the proof in the pudding and I can tell you we have more footage. I'm coming out later today. You will perhaps see the most shocking interaction James O'Keefe has ever had with someone that he's tried to interview.
[39:12.000 --> 39:28.000]  This whole circumstance is shocking and the implications are sinister. Not only did we have a failure upon regulatory agencies to investigate what's going on with what these pharmaceutical companies are doing with free reign to mutate virus.
[39:28.000 --> 39:39.000]  But you also have just a lack of critical thinking amongst all of Americans and anytime you did see critical thinking, people were castigated and called conspiracy theorists.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  Well, now you can see that they were not.
[39:41.000 --> 39:50.000]  And the circle is complete here. I mean, easy open and shut convictions. Again, the function is illegal. They admit it. He says it's for money, but they're going to make money off of this.
[39:50.000 --> 40:01.000]  And then we have all the Fauci emails and documents from stuff with Peter Dazik and the Wuhan Institute. And they're all talking about it there.
[40:01.000 --> 40:10.000]  Correct. Right. Don't forget, Alex, we also had the DARPA documents that Anthony Fauci actually said the words Project Veritas on Capitol Hill.
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.000]  He was definitely prepped to answer a question about Project Veritas because we uncovered that EcoHealth Alliance and members of DARPA, they raised flags over this.
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.000]  And they said, you cannot do this. We have not only ethical concerns about this, but we have containment concerns and safety concerns.
[40:27.000 --> 40:36.000]  This was hidden in a top secret share drive, the same share drive where they held all the Abu Ghraib files and videos.
[40:36.000 --> 40:45.000]  They hid that in a share drive. This has been a problem in the government. Certain documents being overclassified so we can't get to the truth of this.
[40:45.000 --> 40:55.000]  I just went to Capitol Hill. You have members of the Senate and members of Congress admitting that this is a problem and almost kind of acting like they don't know what to do to solve the problem.
[40:55.000 --> 41:06.000]  My next point is what is Congress going to do? What are we going to do? Because you have the tipping point already reached. You have all the scientists coming out being vindicated. You have them admitting the vaccines don't work. You have them admitting the virus is manmade.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  And then now you add this at this time. I mean, this is explosive.
[41:10.000 --> 41:18.000]  This is explosive. I can imagine there are going to be inquiries. I can tell you that I've already had conversations with members of Congress, members of the Senate.
[41:18.000 --> 41:29.000]  I'm not touching this closely, but it seems like the only accountability that exists are the little hidden camera videos that James O'Keefe puts out there because outside of this, what would we have?
[41:29.000 --> 41:41.000]  Well, that's right. All we had was the emails and some whistleblowers like Dr. Huff, which was huge, but people go, OK, you got a document, you got a whistleblower. This is the head executive over that department admitting they're doing it, which shows the cabler attitude.
[41:41.000 --> 41:48.000]  And you said, I mean, they're playing with Promethean deathfire here like it's no big deal.
[41:48.000 --> 42:03.000]  Absolutely. And if this person will admit this kind of on this, you know, with this person that they necessarily don't know very well, it kind of shows you the cavalier attitude in which these pharmaceutical companies can operate.
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  Bingo. It shows the arrogance and the feeling of being untouchable.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  Because there is no accountability. The only people who are holding them accountable, they call tinfoilists.
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.000]  Myself, Alex Jones, you've done a lot specifically on this topic. We know that. And you get attacked and belittled.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  So this is a huge racket. It's only a matter of time until the American public wakes up.
[42:25.000 --> 42:31.000]  The only thing we can do at Project Veritas is offer you the accountability of knowledge. And that's what we're doing here.
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  And thank you for covering this. Obviously, it's very important subject. Absolutely. I know you're extremely busy. I want to talk to you in the break.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  You've got to leave us. I understand if not, I'd like to come back and play a little bit more of the clip and ask you a few more questions.
[42:40.000 --> 42:49.000]  But you're saying right now, R.C. Maxwell at Project Veritas, R.C. Maxwell, G.O.P. on Twitter, American voice pack dot org, but you're right there.
[42:49.000 --> 42:55.000]  Obviously at Project Veritas, when we come back or during the break, I'll get the answer. I want to hear about what's about to drop next.
[42:55.000 --> 43:02.000]  The next shooting drop, the next balloon to go up. Stay with us.
[43:02.000 --> 43:11.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[43:11.000 --> 43:20.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[43:20.000 --> 43:28.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[43:41.000 --> 43:50.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our fighting problems will be over. Please take action now.
[44:00.000 --> 44:16.000]  I want you to remember two words. InfoWars Platinum. In the history of InfoWars supplements, and they're amazing, this is hands down the most powerful game changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[44:16.000 --> 44:24.000]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high end supplements.
[44:24.000 --> 44:36.000]  And the owner is a listener and a supporter. So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores, over 20% off what they're sold online under the InfoWars Platinum brand name.
[44:36.000 --> 44:48.000]  These are incredible. PainMD, HGH MaxBoost, and of course 1776, testosterone boost. Read about them at InfoWarsStore.com, learn about them and then try them out for yourself.
[44:48.000 --> 44:57.000]  And I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome. It will empower your life, make your life more amazing, and it will keep us on the air a 360 win.
[44:57.000 --> 45:19.000]  InfoWars Platinum, now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[45:27.000 --> 45:35.000]  So many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[45:35.000 --> 45:49.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL. Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[45:49.000 --> 45:59.000]  If you want to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support their store, go support InfoWars. Leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[46:19.000 --> 46:31.000]  InfoWars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them, but we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system and your family as well.
[46:31.000 --> 46:48.000]  You can also make straight donations at InfoWarsStore.com, clicking on the big red banner, a one-time or recurring, but I'm asking you to take action. We're nonviolent, but every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally nonviolently politically punching the new world order in the nose,
[46:48.000 --> 47:00.000]  punching their lies in the nose. We are going to defeat the new world order. We're going over the top, but right now is the critical juncture, so please go to InfoWarsStore.com and donate now.
[47:00.000 --> 47:20.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:20.000 --> 47:30.000]  This is the third into the fourth hour today on the World War III implications in Ukraine, but this bio-weapon operation ties right into that, so we'll also be taking calls on this subject.
[47:30.000 --> 47:38.000]  RC Maxwell, the few minutes you've got left, I know you've got a lot of interviews to do to get this out there. I hadn't talked to you. I didn't know it was your biggest story ever. I said, this looks like your biggest story ever.
[47:38.000 --> 47:50.000]  You're confirming it is. Congratulations on trying to save humanity. As Senator Paul said in the last six hearings with Fauci, this endangers the whole world. These people need to be charged, and I believe they will be charged. They are psychotic mad scientists.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  Another big shoes about to drop. Give us the inside baseball.
[47:54.000 --> 48:04.000]  Well, look, the inside baseball is this. I can report here on InfoWars for the first time that when we did encounter Mr. Walker for an interview, police were involved.
[48:04.000 --> 48:15.000]  That's how accelerated things got. You have to understand, Alex, the folks at Judicial Watch filed a four-year request to find out if the FBI have been having communications with Pfizer about us.
[48:15.000 --> 48:30.000]  The FBI are supposed to be going after people who engage in child pornography. They should be going after human traffickers, people bringing fentanyl into our country, but it turns out the FBI does have communications with Pfizer about us because we investigate them.
[48:30.000 --> 48:41.000]  So when we encountered Mr. Walker, we did expect things to escalate. We did not expect them to escalate to where it went. That video will be coming out today. It will be coming out in about an hour or so.
[48:41.000 --> 48:55.000]  You can see that on Project Veritas's channels. I will make sure to send that over to you, Alex. You're not going to want to miss it. Police were involved and definitely the most tense interaction James O'Keeffe has ever had with one of these bad guys.
[48:55.000 --> 49:05.000]  You guys have been raided over nothing. You've been stalked. You've been harassed. They're spying on you and it's come out giving intel to people that you're targeting to expose because you're so effective.
[49:05.000 --> 49:15.000]  So they've got active measures to protect just like the harassed Dr. Huff at his home. They've got active measures trying to stop you guys and you're saying that's coming out in the next hour.
[49:15.000 --> 49:27.000]  Yes, we've already released that the FBI has files on us and communications with Pfizer. We can't find out what that is because they're claiming it's an active investigation which may lead to a criminal proceeding.
[49:27.000 --> 49:40.000]  So we don't know what that is, but I can tell you that the interaction that we're going to publish today with this awful person who discussed in a callous manner mutating the virus.
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.000]  The cops were eventually called because the interaction escalated to a level of physical violence.
[49:46.000 --> 49:57.000]  Wow. And this is the director of their major operations. Unbelievably powerful RC Maxwell. God bless and God speed. You guys don't deserve to be put in prison.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  You deserve a Pulitzer Prize and a medal and please give Mr. O'Keeffe my best.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  We'll do Alex. Thanks.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  Wow. Okay. If you just joined us and other people tuning in every second.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  When this came out yesterday, people thought it wasn't real.
[50:12.000 --> 50:19.000]  And then we went and looked on the Pfizer website and he's on the website as their director of mRNA operations worldwide.
[50:19.000 --> 50:27.000]  And it's real. Plus, as soon as I saw it, I knew they've been doing gain of function. It's come out in the documents.
[50:27.000 --> 50:39.000]  But to be in a bar in a restaurant, running your mouth. And then I don't know what's about to break. He couldn't tell me till it breaks the next hour, but it deals with the FBI basically shadowing them.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  And trying to stop them in live time, getting to people and getting information out.
[50:44.000 --> 50:51.000]  So they're having to follow around the operatives of Pfizer and Moderna.
[50:51.000 --> 50:58.000]  And basically protect them so that we can't expose them because they're so mentally ill in my view.
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  They're so sick and they think what they're doing is funny.
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  And that's what disgusts me about this is I have four children.
[51:06.000 --> 51:11.000]  My father almost died from COVID. Rob do almost died. It's real.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  And the damn shots have killed a bunch of people I know.
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.000]  And we just can't sit here and take these type of attacks anymore.
[51:19.000 --> 51:25.000]  You know, I saw Tucker Carlson's report last night.
[51:25.000 --> 51:31.000]  15 minutes long. It's on m4s.com where he goes into the last three years of Jeffrey Epstein being murdered.
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  He was listening to Maxwell saying he was murdered.
[51:34.000 --> 51:40.000]  And then he does a whole piece showing bar as Attorney General saying there was no one there. We have camera footage.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  You know, the cameras were turned off and the coroner said that he hung himself.
[51:44.000 --> 51:47.000]  No, the coroner said it looked like he had his neck broken. He had three broken bones.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  Everything they say is a lie.
[51:50.000 --> 51:56.000]  And that's what people have to understand is that you don't understand the level of their lies until you've been a prominent person fighting them.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  And believe me, that's not like some bonus.
[51:58.000 --> 52:06.000]  They make up stories about me that are huge, complex stories that none of it's true with fake witnesses.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  And they're doing it to everybody.
[52:08.000 --> 52:15.000]  And I make that point out to just lay out the fact that these people are beyond insane.
[52:15.000 --> 52:23.000]  Who at the Justice Department would want private companies creating bio weapons and mutating viruses that's illegal,
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  and then you protect the people that are doing it when the bastards release it on us.
[52:27.000 --> 52:35.000]  It's like where is your common sense? Where is your decency? Where is your own self-preservation instincts?
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  And I don't want to make the FBI the Justice Department our enemy.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  I want to take back our federal government.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  I believe in the federalist system, which means the separation of powers.
[52:44.000 --> 52:55.000]  But the biggest enemies of common sense and civilization and life on earth are these big crazy corporations and the insider trading politicians
[52:55.000 --> 53:03.000]  and the Praetorian Guard federal government that protects these people, not from violence,
[53:03.000 --> 53:09.000]  but from the spotlight of truth and investigation and scrutiny.
[53:09.000 --> 53:15.000]  And so the whole video is just insane. It's UninformedWars.com. We post it under the live show feed.
[53:15.000 --> 53:21.000]  And people couldn't believe it because it's just total admissions of criminal activity.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  And redefining things. Oh, if we mutate and make viruses stronger, that's not going to function.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  That's just our cash cow. In fact, I mentioned the cash cow clip. Here is the cash cow clip.
[53:30.000 --> 53:39.000]  What's the size of doing that? So probably what they want to do is to try to figure out, to some extent, try to figure out, like, you know, there's all these new strains of variants that just pop up.
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  Why don't we try to catch them before they pop up in nature and we can develop a vaccine for black people before, like, new variants.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  So that's why they're thinking, like, if you do it in control of the lab, then we can say, oh, this is a new epitope.
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.000]  And so then if they come out later on, like, in the public, they're going to have a vaccine kind of working on it.
[53:53.000 --> 54:05.000]  Oh, my God. That's perfect. Like, isn't that the best business model, though? Like, just control nature before nature even happens itself, right?
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  Yeah, yeah. If it works.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  What do you mean if it works?
[54:08.000 --> 54:15.000]  Because, like, sometimes we just need to change this to pop up, right, without preparing for it, like with Delta or Omicron and things like that.
[54:15.000 --> 54:22.000]  So, I don't know. I mean, either way, it's going to be a cash cow. COVID is probably going to be a cash cow for us for a while going forward.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  Yeah, I obviously like that.
[54:25.000 --> 54:36.000]  Well, I think the whole, you know, I think the whole, like, research of the viruses and mutating it, like, would be the ultimate, like, cash cow.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  Yeah, it would be perfect.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  Now, you would think that...
[54:39.000 --> 54:48.000]  So, this guy's compartmentalized. He's like, oh, it's part of our business model. We create the viruses that they're obviously releasing.
[54:48.000 --> 54:54.000]  These things are hundreds of thousands of millions of years in the future of evolution, the way they've accelerated them. They admit that.
[54:54.000 --> 55:04.000]  So then, magically, strains they already produced before they released it in 2019, this is all on record, were way out in the future,
[55:04.000 --> 55:13.000]  millions of different mutations later that they produced in pigs and monkeys and rats in China and other facilities, totally illegal.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  And then it magically gets released and they have their cash cow because, see, you can't produce all this, these chimeric viruses,
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  and then not have it released because then you can't have the cash cow because everybody's getting sick, everybody's scared,
[55:24.000 --> 55:31.000]  and then you take a shot that makes you even sicker so you have less immune system when they release the next virus.
[55:31.000 --> 55:39.000]  So it's the ultimate business model to depopulate people, to take their rights, to set up a castle society, social credit score, vaccine passport,
[55:39.000 --> 55:46.000]  universal basic income, total surveillance grid, get all the money, get all the power while you maim and kill people.
[55:46.000 --> 55:53.000]  The perfect, insane, psychotic business model.
[55:53.000 --> 56:04.000]  Then I got all the other vaccine news. Another NFL player, 25 dies. They're respecting a child.
[56:04.000 --> 56:15.000]  Ex-Lions and Chargers linebacker Jesse Limoneer dies. 25 aged and confirms he and his girlfriend were expecting a child.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  All right, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to start the next hour. I'm going to give the number out.
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.000]  I'm going to hit the big Russian news that's over the top. Joe Biden admitting that tanks to Ukraine will cause World War 3
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  and then doing it. We actually have the video. We just tuned in. I'm not joking.
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.000]  This is beyond satire, folks. This is, this is reality. Truth and stranger to fiction.
[56:35.000 --> 56:41.000]  Hey, we're not releasing viruses or selling you mRNA vaccines that make you grow a spike protein in your body that destroys your DNA
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  and your heart, your lungs, your brain and everything else.

[57:55.000 --> 58:04.000]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalist and having incredibly successful results.
[58:04.000 --> 58:10.000]  So I thank you for your pass for support. Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.

[59:17.000 --> 59:32.000]  Thank you so much for being here today.
[59:32.000 --> 59:48.000]  This one is particularly the strongest one we have. So John and out sold out for more than five months is now back available at infowarstore.com.
[59:48.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  Tonight, a Fauci event in New York has been peacefully protested and stormed by folks exposing the mass murder. So much breaking news. I'll give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  We're going ahead in situation that the controllers of the planet are pushing us into for a global crisis that gives them total control while they depopulate us at the same time. They don't have the same values as us. They have a different plan.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  It's totally evil. We're going to be exposing it all. Now I played this clip once yesterday, but I'll play it again because it's so important. It's a great recent report on a CIA funded startup saying they're going to bring back extinct animals and all the rest of this.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  They admit they want to be the original animal. It'll be a whole new animal and creation they make. And God knows what viruses and things they're going to be carrying. It's a lot of concerns, but this is mad scientist world. Here's the report.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  We'll give the number out. Go to your calls.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  The fossil bio sciences is using CRISPR gene editing technology to resurrect animals that have gone extinct. They are starting next year with a woolly mammoth and are making plans for the Tasmanian Tiger.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  The plan is to release 100 woolly mammoths inside a park in Siberia. This is officially being done under the guise of climate change. They claim that by adding megafauna back into the Arctic tundra, it will offset carbon emissions.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  The company has already raised over 12 million euros, which includes funding from the CIA. The CIA's venture capital firm in QTEL is a stakeholder of colossal bio sciences.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Euro news points out that the plan seems counterproductive, seeing as how over 30% of trees worldwide are currently going extinct and points out its potential dangers of introducing ancient unknown pathogens into our modern world.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  But when you look into the company's co-founder George Church, it becomes clear that it's really all about pushing the agenda of human cloning and transhumanism.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Harvard scientist George Church received donations from 2005 to 2007 from Jeffrey Epstein, the infamous pedophile transhumanist who was planning on establishing a baby farm at his new Mexico ranch to seed the earth with his DNA.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  In 2019, Church awkwardly apologized for his association with Jeffrey Epstein on 60 Minutes.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  It was one of these things where you first learn about it and it's not, it's just like when you first hear about it, it doesn't sound like it's something serious.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  And it's only recently that we've found out that it was something serious or that we become aware how serious it was.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  The professional connection between Jeffrey Epstein and George Church was their common desire to clone humans, which is something that Church is most passionate about.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  His work has been focused primarily on creating superior humans and wants to bring Neanderthal man back from extinction and give them their own culture and political force.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  He is also passionate about creating customized living creatures out of DNA to serve mankind as we see fit.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  When asked if he believed in God, Church responded that he respects all people's faith, but his faith is in science and that the true understanding of nature is only available to the scientists.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  This psychopathy that has infected man with an obsession to play God has attracted many atheists into the field of genetic engineering, but not everyone in this field wants to play God.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  Dr. Bruce Lipton was a pioneer in the research of cloned human stem cells.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  His research revealed that the environment and our perception of the environment is what controls our genetic activity.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  This is known as epigenetics and as a result of his research, he stopped being an atheist and found faith in God.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  This and the nature of his research has alienated him from today's scientific community, which seeks to destroy nature and control it.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  But you can still find his work and I recommend that you do.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsTour.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsTour.com.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  If just one percent more of you took action and went to InfowarsTour.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  So yesterday, I opened the phones up and every caller was powerful. Some were over the top, amazing.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  Concerning the escalation in the nuclear war in Russia with the heavy battle tanks being sent by Germany, right after that, Biden announces 30-plus Abrams tanks at the beginning of, they say, of hundreds.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Heavy weapons, now they're talking about F-16s.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  Russia says they're now officially at war with us. This is so incredibly dangerous when you understand the threat ladder escalation and we're going right up it towards nuclear war.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  So I want to give the number out on this topic to hear from veterans, but regular citizens, people all over the world, particularly Europeans, I'd like to hear from you about what you think of this continued war that they've,
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  like the camel's nose under the tent flap, gotten the world into it, and why would they want a nuclear war? Why would they want to ask like this? Because the old monetary system's coming to an end.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  They want to depopulate. They believe they can survive this attack, survive this war if it happens, and then emerge with their transhumanist system.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  The toll-free number to join us on this issue, and bioweapons and gain of function, all the project Veritas News coming out of you just joined us to recap with a high-level Pfizer executive, the head of their World mRNA project,
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  saying, yeah, we create the deadly viruses and then we give you the solution, our so-called vaccine. It's our cash cow, so we can talk about that issue, but those are the two issues we're talking about.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  They're both intertwined. The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789. Alex will take long-time callers, first-time callers agree, disagree, but we're on those two topics, 877-789-2539.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  In the next hour, more Project Veritas Part 2 news breaking. We'll have that here for you right when it breaks, and we'll cover it as well.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  All right, let's hit to World War III news. I played last hour, but you can't play this too much. This is Joe Biden.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  According to Joe Biden, World War III starts with a shipment of offensive equipment like tanks to Ukraine, and that was said just six months ago.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  But now we need to have it, he says. It's a great thing. Here's Biden's last year assuring us that we wouldn't send tanks to Ukraine because that means World War III.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  And that was in March of last year, so I guess 11 months ago, 10 months ago. Here it is.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  The idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say. That's called World War III. Okay?
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  Yeah. So here's the headlines. Ukraine predicts attacks on major Russian cities. The Ukrainian government says they're going to begin accelerating already major strikes going on, including against Moscow.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  So they're pushing Moscow to escalate, to push the West and NATO to escalate, and we have the tail wagging the dog here, extremely dangerous.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  They said they're going to hit the, quote, pampered and lazy people of Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Ukraine will now push for F-16s, fighter jets, government advisor says. The Hill reports, I'm sure they'll get them.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  Ukraine under new missile barrage as Russia warns West about tank pledges.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  Denmark calls for mandatory military service for women.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  This tank promises show direct and growing Western involvement in Ukraine. As Biden seeks to avoid wider war delivery of M1 Abrams tanks, Ukraine escalates the conflict.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  And it goes on and on about coups against Putin and what they want to do.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Your tax dollars at work, Ukrainian officials blew 100 billion US uniparty dollars on sports cars, mansions, luxury vacations, etc.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  The stories they're getting in trouble now is they want more of the money to go to the war, not just laundered back to the globalist.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  German Foreign Minister said the quiet part out loud two days ago that Germany is at war with Russia.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  This is the first time in World War II. Here's a really chilling headline.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  U.S. to increase artillery ammunition production by 500% for Ukraine.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  The Pentagon's playing to boost its production of artillery ammunition by 500% over the next two years.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  Oh, it's a long war, isn't it? As the U.S. is depleting its military stockpiles by sending millions of shells to Ukraine, the New York Times reported yesterday.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  So there you go. Since Russia launched its invasion in Ukraine, the U.S. has pledged to send Ukraine over a million 155-millimeter artillery shells before the U.S. Army began efforts to increase production.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  It's production of 4,400, 14,400 155-millimeter shells a month. But under the new plans, the number will reach 90,000 each month.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  And it goes on and on and on. And what are a lot of the new shells going in used by the tanks?
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  They are depleted uranium that causes massive burden effects in the children of the troops and wherever it's used in those people's families, not to mention causing massive health problems for the troops.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  So this is a real war crime. And Russia says that if they pick up any D.U. and if any D.U. rounds are being used by any of the U.S. or other tanks,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  and it's Western doctrine to use D.U. in a war with the Russians in a tank war, that that will be considered nuclear war and they'll go ahead and consider the use of nuclear weapons.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  So there you are. You want to be depopulated? Well, just get ready because it's on, ladies and gentlemen, it is on.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Donald Trump, to his credit, said first the tanks come, then the nukes. President Trump calls for end of crazy war with Russia.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  There is now one world leader who's calling for peace. So this makes me like Trump more. That is President Donald Trump.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  President Trump posted this on Truth Social this morning. On Wednesday, Germany and the U.S. announced they're sending tanks to Ukraine to fight Russia.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  World War III update. Only one global leader is calling for an end to it.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  And then we have Trump's statement here in the article where he points out this is so incredibly destructive.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  First come the tanks, then come the nukes. Get this crazy war ended now. So easy to do.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  All they got to do is let the Russians have that small zone in the east, which is almost 100 percent Russian.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  That will end the war, but they don't want to give them that or the security guarantee that Russia has been asking for forever that Ukraine will not join NATO.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  They always said that was a Russian conspiracy theory. Totally insane. Now NATO says they want Ukraine to join.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  Kamala Harris says they want them to join. And Henry Kissinger says they want them to join.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  So the red line has been passed and if you think you can win a nuclear war, nobody wins.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  The only way to win is not to play the game to quote the 1980s movie War Games.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  So Tim, Michael, Bart, Matt, Chris, Carlos, Robert, everybody else, your calls are coming up on the other side of this break to cover the Armageddon signal,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  the Armageddon scenario, the Armageddon climate of just, oh, bio weapons, oh, gain a function, produce from everywhere.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  Oh, release them. Make money on them. Ah, cash cow advisor. Oh, hey, ship fentanyl in. Hey, open the borders up. Hey, attack the family.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  Hey, sterilize kids. Hey, have the federal government fund studies that white paint is racist because the color white is racist.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  You know, the color white is not a color. It's reflection of all color. It's totally insane and it's getting worse by the minute.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  And as soon as you hear me hang up on a caller, you'll be able to call in at 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 and no matter how good the calls are,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  I'm going to try to give you all about a minute and a half so we can get a lot of your calls today because they are thought provoking.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  They are amazing, many of them. And I just want to get to as many of you as possible on the other side.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  But whatever you do, realize that fighting tyranny is not a spectator sport. It is a participation sport.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And you don't realize the power you have simply taking a band out video or infowars.com link and sitting on your email or text,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  which are not completely censored yet, or using URLs that get around the censors and send you to a page that has a video feed of the show,
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  like conspiracyfact.info. Everybody should write down and put it to your phone or desktop, conspiracyfact.info,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  and send it to friends, family, strangers, neighbors, your whole email list and say,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  if you want to know why Alex Jones is so banned, if you want to know what he's really talking about,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  if you want to know why they want him shut down and want to silence all of us,
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  find out the truth. They don't want you to hear it. Stop Armageddon by sharing the link, conspiracyfact.info.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  And in a month or so or a week or so when they ban that URL, we'll have a new one.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  We've got hundreds ready, but we don't have you ready to take action. It's you.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  It's like a fever vendetta when the inspector says, why did you go public before?
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  Because I never had a police inspector ready to hear the truth. I needed you, inspector. I needed you.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  I need you. You need me. Share the link, conspiracyfact.info now and break the matrix.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  Break the back of the sensors.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  Now, that was a three coin series, the founding member coin. The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt

[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  The coin is a collector's item momento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast.

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow Info Warriors here in the United States and around the world.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  We are so excited to announce InfowarsMD.

[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in minds,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  And it's the same PSYOP today. Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  Because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away,
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  if you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Infowars and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  If you decide to go to InfowarsStore.com against supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  we will stay on the air indefinitely. It is all in your hands.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  If you support, stand up against the globalists, go to InfowarsStore.com right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show. We have several big guests lined up today that I cancelled.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  And I was confused because I thought we had Liam McAdoo in studio tomorrow and Robert Barnes.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  But we have Liam McAdoo in studio next hour and we have Robert Barnes right now.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  But he's happy to get into World War III, the game of function news with the Pfizer bombshell and take your calls.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  So to all the callers we have on the list, this will be the callers we get to, no extra.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  Tim and Michael and Bart and Matt and Scott, Carlos, Robert, Jim, Yitzy and others.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  We will get to those calls and Simon. But Robert Barnes joining us.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  What an insane time, Barnes. Your great constitutional lawyer had a big success with the Amish Farmer just a few weeks ago.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  You're also with Robert Kennedy Jr., Suing Pfizer for covering up secret trials they did.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  But now I know you've seen the Project Veritas bombshell that they admit is a senior mRNA.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  The head of their worldwide project admitting they're weaponizing it, they're using it to have new variants so they can make more money.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  I mean, this is just insane. And then you've got all the World War III news.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  What is this penchant or this lust, it seems, by the establishment, by the media, by Hollywood to end the world?
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  How would you describe this climate we're in?
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  I mean, it's having extraordinary. I mean, I think you look at what's happening in Ukraine and something really unusual is clearly taking place as an example.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  The same is the case with Pfizer. They keep getting outed.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Like when Brooke Jackson, the biggest whistleblower case, well, I'm representing her with Werner Mendenhall on behalf of the U.S. government against Pfizer,
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  on behalf of the people of America against Pfizer.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  Pfizer has been screaming all the way through not to allow any discovery and begging the judge.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  Don't allow any discovery. Please don't allow any discovery. Please just dismiss this case.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  They got the government to basically go along with Pfizer's request, which is just outrageous.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  And the judges so far gone along with it. And now we're seeing some of the reasons why.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  We're seeing that, in fact, if the discovery had been turned over, if the court had authorized it, as I think the court should have authorized it,
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  that we would already have this information that Pfizer, that now Project Veritas is outing, that, in fact, that they are in the business of what Francis Boyle has been documenting here on Infowars now for a better part of a decade,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  which is that there is a bio weapons research activity going on with Big Pharma, which includes developing and designing the diseases and the cures for these diseases.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  We talked about this at the very beginning of the pandemic.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  We told people, look at V for Vendetta. It's the script for what we're actually witnessing in live time.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  And what's V for Vendetta's script? They design and develop the disease in order to have already have the cure so that they can seize power and make profits and get rich.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  And that's what appears more and more. There's evidence of between Pfizer, between Fauci, between Wuhan, between Peter Desai, between all of these characters.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  We're seeing more evidence that they were doing gain of function research, directed evolution research, the goal being design the disease when you already have built in your intended cure.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  And then the missing part is then release the disease. I mean, look, they bought out the governments of the world. They got secret immunity deals.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  But I don't think that's going to protect them from public outrage. Fauci just got massively stormed and protested in New York.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  It's up on infowars.com. NYC protesters crass Fauci event call for a rust of murder over lockdowns and jabs.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  So they've really got to be on the defense right now.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  No doubt about that. And remember, some countries rejected Pfizer's immunity deal and is allowing court cases to go forward like India.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  India's court system is allowing cases to go forward concerning Bill Gates, concerning Pfizer, concerning issues with the various issues related to COVID, because they refuse to give immunity to Pfizer.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  And consequently, the Pfizer fact, you know, India was protected from the Pfizer problems because the Pfizer vaccine was not distributed there.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  So I think we have to continue to do that. But as to your other point as to what's happening in the world and what we should look for is the danger of what's happening next.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  I'm very concerned with what's happening in Ukraine.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  So you look at what happened, the World Economic Forum meets and they put out the Lithuanians and the Poles are there and they're talking about select activity vis-a-vis Ukraine.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  Then a few days later, the CIA director flies in person to Ukraine.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  A few days later, half of the Ukrainian hierarchy is being taken out.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  They're either being dismissed, killed, assassinated. They're fleeing the country. They're under investigation. They're being told they're under investigation.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Yeah, I mean, you've got like half the government on a helicopter. It gets blown up.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  Exactly. That's the Interior Secretary, which people may not know.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  That's basically the equivalent of their national, that's the Assoff Division people. That's their internal security operation.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  That's who got taken out. And then you have on top of that, now they're talking about moving tanks into Poland.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  And it looks like those tanks aren't necessarily intended for Ukraine. Those tanks may be for the Poles because people forget the Poles and the Lithuanians.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  We've talked about it. Used to dominate Western Ukraine for centuries if you go all the way back.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  So what's happening is the puppets are being removed and NATO is officially going to war, killing the Ukrainian leadership and now officially at war.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  Exactly. And then you compound it with the genetic, I mean, with what appears to be a form of genocide by going after and transcarpathia.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  There's a bunch of Hungarians. Hungary, of course, has opposed escalation of this conflict.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  Ukraine is going in there and dragging all the able-bodied men that are of Hungarian ancestry out of there, throwing them into the front lines to be killed constantly.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  Why? Because it appears they would be a resistance group if the Poles or NATO were to go into Western Ukraine and try to partition and take over Western Ukraine.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  The Hungarians and transcarpathia would want nothing to do with it.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  And so it appears they're deliberately just killing all of the able-bodied military age men of Hungarian ancestry.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  They're saying the preparation is being made to split Ukraine like Hitler and Stalin split Poland during World War II.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  Exactly. And that's a perfect analogy, Alex, because that's the great danger.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  What happened when they went in there and decided to start splitting up Europe?
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  Well, has it led to broader conflict, bigger war?
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  And you've been saying, what are they going to do since they're losing on the Pfizer front? They're losing on the vaccine mandate front.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  They're losing on the weaponization of the U.S. government front. Everybody's being outed.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  They're losing on the classified document theory they had against Trump.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  How are they going to be able to rebound?
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  Well, start World War III, in fact, and they appear to be putting the groundwork in to escalate this conflict from a Russia-Ukrainian conflict to an entire world conflict.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  And they're putting the things in motion to achieve that. And they're doing it on a rapid path.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  And it all started with all those folks meeting together at Davos.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  Is that a coincidence that as soon as Davos happens, all these things go into motion.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  CIA director over to Ukraine, all the assassinations and takeout of Ukrainian leadership.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Then there's these all genocidal effort against Hungarians and Transgarpatia.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  And then there's all of a sudden they're tending tanks to Poland.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  They're supposedly going to go to Ukraine, but it looks like they're going to go to Poland.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  The Poles are the only ones who know how to operate a lot of these tanks.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  And so it appears that this is designed for NATO and the Poles and the Lithuanians to recreate their own Polish-Lithuanian empire, partition and split up Ukraine.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  And that's how you get to World War III is you get Russian NATO right at each other's throat.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  Is there any way to avert this?
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  We just have to continue to out it.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  So credit to Marjorie Taylor Greene, credit to Thomas Massey saying we need to audit credit to Rand Paul.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  We need to audit the Ukrainian funds right now because there's a lot of black budget money, a lot of exposure, a lot of what the real corruption is.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  That that's good.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  We've got to push back also in the court of public opinion.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  We should not be escalating this conflict.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  We should not be getting deeper involved.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  We should not be sending more arms.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  We should not be encouraging the partition.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  Let's not recreate World War I and World War II all over again.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Let's learn from history so we don't repeat it.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  I couldn't say it better myself.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  In fact, I couldn't say it that well.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  Robert Barnes, I was on your show with Viva Freyja last night.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  It's amazing.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  That's linked up on infowars.com.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  People want to share that.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  We talked about a lot of really in-depth important subjects.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  We're going to come back with Robert Barnes.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  He's going to take your phone calls on this subject straight ahead.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  And then Leigh-Anne McAdoo in studio.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  I'm so excited.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Coming up.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  And infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  And you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series,
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now

[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain.

[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000]  Well, I just want to say about Dietforce.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  Dietforce is amazing. I'm 45 and I have bits.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  And Dietforce has helped me move those bits like under my pecs, my belly.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  I'm just taking Dietforce two tablets a day.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  Man, if you're struggling to get chip shapes for the ladies,
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  Man, Dietforce is the go. You have to get the Dietforce and have two a day and just keep that.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, X7 Dietforce.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  Now on sale, we're cutting that call into an ad. I can guarantee you that.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant. God bless Australia.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  We'll be right back, folks. Don't go anywhere. InfoWarsStore.com, Dietforce. Get it now.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the leaks.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  If we're so stupid, we let them kill us. We deserve it.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  And I looked and behold, a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  Now the translation is, I looked and behold, a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  and hell followed with him. The Book of Revelation.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  Very serious times to be alive, folks. They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives. This is our fight.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  And I'm proud of humanity. The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  Well, here we are with Robert Barnes. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  Again, I was on with him and a straight co-host. We have a fry last night, an amazing interview.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  That's at Infowars.com right now.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Barnes, we have a normalcy bias. I have it, you have it, we all have it.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  But if you're a historian, that's why I really like you.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  This is a great lawyer. A few people that I know have such a wide spectrum of knowledge of history.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  You teach me a lot of stuff and I've taught you a few things, but I don't think the average person,
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  I think they get it, but I don't think we'll really understand that they're coming to an end of an old system.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  They always have a war for the new system, but we have nuclear weapons.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  So all their different think tanks bemoaned since the 50s that we can't have the old system of wars to control our populations.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  But now we see the think tank saying, well, actually nuclear war is feasible and livable and we'll have a limited war.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  But every metric, every study, every war game shows limited nuclear war 90 plus percent of the time leads to full global end of the world crap.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  These people are truly psychotics. I want to go to phone calls, but just what's your take on that statement?
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  I mean, yeah, exactly. History is the key here, Alex, as you reminded people, not only Operation Northwoods and the rest,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  the generals back in the late 50s, early 60s were convinced that nuclear war would work, that the U.S. would win a nuclear war.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  We're back to that. We got some people at the top of the military, top of the State Department, top of the CIA,
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  who are convinced that the U.S. can win a nuclear conflict.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  And that's the reason why, as you've talked to his daughter, Dr. Strangelove,
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  the reason why that film was done is because he was deeply concerned about how many people in the military hierarchy had convinced themselves to wage nuclear war.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  One of the reasons they killed Kennedy is because President Kennedy was completely opposed to this insanity.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  He made sure to decelerate the pressure rather than accelerate it during the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban conflict and the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  They wanted to back out of that, not push forward, and they were enraged at him.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  And so let's be clear, here's the problem. This is mainline news, folks. This is a historical fact.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  The neocons with people like Donald Rumsfeld was the aide to L.L. Emmitser in 61 when Kennedy fired him in Curtis LeMay
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  because they had a secret nuke attack to launch attacks on Russia first without telling the president using what they called Plan R in the movie,
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  another plan in reality, and Kennedy fired them, but they put their minions into the system of the neocons today that are now about to have the plan they wanted 50, 60 years ago.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  I mean, this is beyond insane.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  And put it together with something else that you've been covering, which is the extraordinary degree to which the globalist elite have been obsessively building personal bunker homes all around the world.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  And the question is, well, why in the world would you build something underground? You know, it's like a Graham Hancock story.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  Do you think we're back to sort of experiencing comets from the sky and going to wipe out civilization?
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  The only reason you would be spending the amount of money the global elite is spending on underground bunker homes is if you think nuclear conflict is a real possibility and you don't want to be the victim of it.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  You're willing to let everybody else be the victim of it, but you don't want to be the victim of it.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  Then you combine that with another fact. Why would the global elite not be uncomfortable with nuclear conflict?
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  Well, you look at Bill Gates. What's his number one obsession?
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  What's George Soros number one obsession?
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  When they did that meeting in 2009, they got out of that Rockefeller University with Nelson Rockefeller and Bill Gates and George Soros and Oprah Winfrey and Michael Bloomberg.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  What was the obsession overpopulation in their view?
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  They wanted to dramatically shrink the population.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  Well, that's right. The global elite meeting secret has cussed overpopulation with David Rockefeller and the rest of them. Absolutely.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Let's go to the calls. Thanks for holding.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  Tim, in Seattle, you're on the air with Robert Barnes. Go ahead.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  Hey, wow. This is an interesting call.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Robert Barnes, Alex Jones, you guys are heroes in my mind.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  You guys are literally the only ones using God's energy, the truth, to try to set humanity free.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  I think the Satanists know that nuclear war is probably their best option if they're on a war with God, because they believe that the Gamma Burst is the only energy capable of obliterating the soul.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  So with that being said, are we willing?
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  I mean, I feel like a hostage. I feel like I'm huddled up in a corner waiting for the... I don't know.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  I mean, is there a possible way? Is there a cultural revolution?
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  Can we just show up with signs peacefully and avert global...
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  I agree. Everybody should be protesting against the end of the world against nuclear war right now.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  And you have a bunch of sick freaks that control things that are flirting with death. They get off on it.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  I mean, Barnes, you want to comment on what the caller asked?
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Yeah. I mean, well, it's why McGregor has been so aggressive on this.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Colonel McGregor, who was one of the top Trump aides, who's been outing this all along.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  He was out there yesterday saying, look, there's no way that ultimately Ukraine can win this war on the battlefield over time,
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  given Russian advantage.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  And his great concern is Zelensky and others connected to Ukraine have talked about using dirty bombs.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  Russia yesterday was saying there better be no uranium being shipped to Ukraine.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  They'll consider that a nuclear level threat.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  And his concern is that this will escalate.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  He goes, this is how we got into World War I.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  This is how World War II started, starting to partition countries, starting to divvy up Europe,
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  starting to get into using ancestral ethnic dispute between a small part of the world and escalate it to a global conflict.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  Absolutely.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  And then once it happens, it's out of control. Thank you, Tim.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  Michael in FEMA Region 10, you're on the air with Robert Barnes. Go ahead.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Hey, guys. Yeah, history. I appreciate you guys' perspective on that.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  I was a U.S. Army tanker for 10 years, and then I was commissioned as a U.S. Army Jag officer.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  I worked in national security stuff for another 20 until I retired, so it took over 30 total.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  Before I get into that, I just want to tell people, alpha-powered DNA force, vitamin D3, vaso-beat, survival shield.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  I'm looking at my Alexa Pure Breeze, and I use your toothpaste. I love that stuff.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  Thank you.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  No fluoride in it. And I also hit the donate button. Okay?
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Thank you.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  Yeah, absolutely. Here's what I, I was an Army tanker back in 1983, in Europe.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  We got the first M1s in 1982. We had depleted uranium rounds, Sabo rounds,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  and we trained all the time for a nuclear attack.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  There's a, there's a drill that tankers go through, so this has been contemplated for a long time.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  Go back to 1962. JFK's president, they have what's called the Cuban Missile Crisis, correct?
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  Right? We nearly went to war over that. Why?
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Because Cuba is on our borders. It's 45 minutes away from Florida.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  The whole United States on the Eastern Seaboard was subject to a nuclear attack.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  We were prepared to go to nuclear war over that.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  We are now in reverse. Russia lost over 10 million people in World War II.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  Okay? They're paranoid. I know the Russian enemy. I studied them thoroughly.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  They will push that button rather than lose.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  And we have people in our government who are basically demonic.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  Biden, Pelosi, the rest of them, these are not good people, okay?
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  And so if you look at Ephesians, okay, put on the armor of God, that's how we win.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  And then go fight. There's different ways of fighting, but we can all fight.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  Legal battles, Second Amendment battles, right?
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  In the courts, they're going on all over the country, all right?
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  Justice Thomas is our friend in the court.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  So there's ways to fight that. Do not give up. Do not sit on your couch. Do not zone out.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  You got to fight, okay?
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Powerful call, brother. I totally agree. The Russians lost. Some estimates are 20 million.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  They are extremely paranoid, and they will launch nuclear weapons. And this is insane.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  Yeah. I mean, Putin has said so repeatedly.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  And I think it's because he's increasingly nervous that people in the West,
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  we've seen these reports that say, hey, yeah, we can start a nuclear war because Russia won't respond.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  That is insane. Russia guaranteed will respond.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  And this is very dangerous what they're doing. And I think they're doing so deliberately.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  I think they're doing so recklessly because the pandemic policies failed,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  and now they're turning to their other means of population control, nuclear war.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  That's right. They want to be the heroes they started war. Matt, thank you so much for your call.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  Powerful caller. All right. More calls straight ahead with Robert Barnes Barnes.

[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.

[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, you know they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  We're actually winning the info war. And when you realize that Band-Aid video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts,
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  whose information is beyond incredible. Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them right now telling the truth at Band-Aid video.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aid video, but you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect,
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers. You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it. When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  There's no broadcast like it on earth. It's the Alex Jones show. A lot bigger than little old me. It's all the great guests.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  The calls, the analysis, our crew, our reporters, it is recognized by the enemy as the number one threat to the new world order.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  That doesn't say how powerful we are. It says how weak they are. They have to bring the world to the edge of nuclear war to try to keep control of us.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, great historian, writing shotgun with us, Lee Ann McDonough, coming in next hour.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  Robert Barnes is taking your questions and comments and giving you this amazing analysis. Let's go right back to the calls.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  The order received. Bart in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Yes, sir. The Biden regime desperately wants the United States to get nuked. Why? I think the beach state is going to use a nuclear attack to put us into martial law and cancel the 2024 election.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  What do you think, Robert and Alex?
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  No, I think Barnes said it earlier. They're overturning the chess board. They've said over and over again, you try to go, I remember a few years ago, E.U. had said, if you try to leave the E.U., we'll just have a war.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  No doubt. I mean, especially what happened, the sequence of events that we described in Ukraine that people can find, people like the Duran and others have been covering in a range of topics is just deeply concerning, deeply, deeply concerning.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  And quantify that. You know, if you go to the Russian borders with weapons as the tanker and jagged guy was saying earlier, you put troops on the U.S. border, you get a war.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  I mean, exactly. You put troops on Chinese border, you get a war. And so it's default. Go start with five of the Russians. You'll get one.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  You're pointing it out last night, Alex. They tend to always stick to the same script. They don't really deviate that much. This is the World War I and World War II script all over again.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  This is how that escalated into a global conflict. The various countries decided to start petitioning Europe in their own preferred way and put adversaries right next to each other.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  And that's what they're doing. I mean, people, in fact, the mainstream media has downplayed the sequence of events of Davos.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  CIA goes to Kiev. Suddenly half of the Ukrainian government is being taken out, is being removed, is either being dismissed, charged with crimes or flat out killed and assassinated in a helicopter crash.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  They still haven't explained. This is very disturbing. And now they go from not sending tanks to let's send tanks to Poland right on the border.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  And all of a sudden, Poland or Romania are you are talking about putting troops in and likely going in across the border?
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  Well, it's funny you bring that up. I talked to some of my sources on the sleep at that in special operations six months ago, who were overseas.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  They're back. They're one of them's back now. They said, listen, look for Poland to take half of Ukraine. That's the real plan. And I said that at the time.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  And now we're seeing it.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  Absolutely. And for those who don't know their history, Polish Lithuanian Empire dominated most of Western Ukraine for the better part of four to five centuries.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  Now, by the way, it was part of what precipitated aspects of World War Two because the ultra nationalist of the Banderites of Bandera under Western Ukraine waged a war of terrorism against the Poles in Western Ukraine and in Poland.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  That's why they aligned with the Nazis against Poland, lined with the Nazis against the West.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  Right. And the globalists have been using those same splits to manipulate the whole thing again.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  Absolutely. Exactly. It's the same script. They said, hey, let's take the old script. If we can't use a pandemic to purge the population, if we can't use the pandemic to control the world, if we can't use the pandemic to disband elections and democracy.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  What's option two? Nuclear war, massive conflict.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Wow. Total insanity. Bart, go ahead.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  Yes, sir. I just want to say I saw an escape from New York when I was about nine years old. I've always thought it was prophecy, not a movie.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  I agree with you. Any way to stop nuclear war, Bart?
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  Pray.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  I love you, brother. I love you. Appreciate you. I do love our listeners. I love everybody, man. We're in this together.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  Everybody that hates tyranny, I love you. We're brothers and sisters. Let's talk to Matt in Ohio. Matt, you're on the air.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  Oh, hey, I just wanted to say how inspiring you guys are. I love you guys. I love all the information. I love the free associations who come together.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  It's just so awesome and inspiring. And kind of going to your point, Alex and Robert, I know you guys are both fans of music and popular culture and so on.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  You guys are the leaders in popular culture now.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  But yeah, you know, it's like, where are the musicians, of course, as you both know from the history books, you know, late 1960s, a lot of anti-war music.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  Even during the Iraq war, there was a lot of anti-war music. For whatever it's worth, I'm not sitting on my laurels.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  I've got a music project called Mad 45. Folks can check out the two No More Bombs. It's on YouTube.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  I'm under Mad 45 TV, and I just released a track called What Happened to Change.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  I'm going to look it up, Mad 45. Hey, I'm mad at Trump about the shots, but at least Trump said this is insane in the war, World War III.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Not sustainable. Thanks for the call. Your take on Trump, he's really doing the right thing, Barnes, right now.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  He's the only major leader calling to end this war.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  Absolutely. And from the very beginning, you know, and now to his credit, J.D. Vance is now in the United States Senate.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  The first thing he does is say we need to audit the Ukrainian funds, because what he understands, what Marjorie Taylor Green understands,
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  is that's where the deep state's corruption would be exposed and would undermine this effort to escalate the conflict in Ukraine.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  But definitely credit to President Trump repeatedly saying this is insanity. We should stop it now.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  Let me go over there and negotiate it, and this would end, because Trump knows exactly what is happening, much as President Kennedy did before he was assassinated.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  That's right. Let's go to another caller here. Let's get Scott and Nova Scotia cannabis tank. He has World War III predictions.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  Give us your view, please.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Yes, I do. A little short breath. I'll try to be quick.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  Scott Spuddle, the People's Party of Canada here in Nova Scotia, the only party that's opposing this insane war.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  He's also a moderator for your old InfaWars website, almost died of COVID, February 2020.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  Lost two loved ones to the shot, and from the family of our last Commonwealth soldier killed in World War I.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  It's been warned about this war since the summer, as everybody...
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  Give me a little bit of a favor. Back off your telephone.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  Okay. That better?
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  That's better. Go ahead.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  Okay. From the People's Party of Canada here in Nova Scotia, almost died of COVID, lost two loved ones to the shot.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  I'm from the family of last Commonwealth soldier killed in World War I, and I've been warning about this war since the summer, as everybody else was up in arms.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  Yes, sir. So give us your predictions.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  I predict this is just going to escalate continually. Russia is not going to back down. They're not going to stop.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  And I think to stop this, we need to focus on the atrocities committed in 2014.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  There's a great report from CNN 2014 where they're actually on the ground in the city of Donetsk reporting on the constant rocket attacks with the sublime
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  reading that 2,500 people have been killed. If you look at the Middle Eastern wars, people...
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  Sure. So the West backed an attack on Russian-held areas, Russian populations to precipitate this.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  And if you follow the Russian model or the historical signature, they always lose up front and then mobilize and win in the end.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  And the point is the Russians are now mobilizing, so no matter how high-tech the weapons are, it's just going to escalate and escalate and escalate.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  I appreciate your call. Barnes, what do you predicting happens unless the so-called leadership finds Jesus and backs down?
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  I mean, the irony is we are all dependent upon Putin being the reasonable one in all of this, because Putin's self-restraint is the only thing that is stopping this from escalating to nuclear conflict.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  And so that's not necessarily the best position for the whole world to be dependent upon is Putin and Russia to be the restrained ones in this situation.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  But I think everybody, like his point about reminding everybody about 2014, the Maidan coup, people can follow Patrick Lancaster.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  He's been a reporter on the ground in the Donbass region all the way since then, detailing all the atrocities to remind people of what's going on.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  Don't buy into the government narrative, the Romney narrative, the Western narrative, the Davos narrative.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  Continue to push back in the Court of Public Opinion.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  Again, the Twitter file has revealed how important everybody's voice is.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  Just as everybody keeping Info Wars on the air by going to Info Wars store, continue to just bob...
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  It's the easiest way to support the freest media network in the world.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  You buy something that makes you healthier and wealthier and wiser in the process.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  It's the easiest protocol, easiest method. You don't have to even be all that active.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  You just got to say, here's something that I like. I guarantee you there's something there that you like.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  And I like it. I get it at a good price. It makes me physically and biologically healthier and freer from the big pharma, big medicine, big agriculture complex.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  And by doing so, continue to get that information out, continue to keep this network on the air, continue to make sure to share the links and the information.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  Because that's what's pushing back.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  We were successful, extraordinarily successful, pushing back on their pandemic policies.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  That's right. We were going to do five more minutes you got to go.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  Then Liam McIntyre is coming in. We'll take a few more calls.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  But pulling back from this, I don't want to go harass or attack the globalists who are doing this because that feeds into their thinking of being a victim.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  But they do feel insulated from nuclear war and their policies.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  What are peaceful ways with 45 seconds left or a minute left to have the establishment kind of have a reality check
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  and not be delusional here because they're openly got us into a proxy war, now an open war with Russia.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  They're luring us into this war. We're now in it. How do we get them to really come back down to ground?
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  Continued popular protest, continued efforts in the court of public opinion can't be understated, overrated.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  And this is across the globe. It needs to happen in Europe. It needs to happen in Latin America.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  It needs to happen globally. And that's what needs to continue to happen.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  That's the only thing that's going to restrain them.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  That's the only thing that's going to restrict them. That's the only thing that's going to scare them.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  Look at, just as they are brushing off their script from old to start a new war,
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  look at our script of what we did at the Info Wars audience at stopping their insane pandemic policies,
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  at stopping the lockdowns, at stopping the mandate.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  That's right. The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was helpful.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  Let's back in two minutes a few final calls from Robert Marnes and Liam McAdoo in the studio. Stay with us.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four coin series,

[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.000]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line in Force MD.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are,
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  we're selling it to you. These are high end. These are the very best.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000]  You know, our body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing. Well, guess what?
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  We now have Turmeric 95. That's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  CBD oil of the highest quality, up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality full spectrum CBD.

[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  That's the equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  Just understand, don't kid yourself no matter what you all say. That's called World War 3. Okay?
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  Barnes, your take on that.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  No doubt. I mean, I think Trump was following you yesterday because it was after you went on your rant about World War 3 that we saw him put out his most aggressive statement yet.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  He came out, you know, put out his truth statement that said, after this come the nukes in the war now.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  And so great. I mean, that's where for all of Trump's vices and vulnerabilities, his great strength remains his instincts on foreign policy.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  No dumb wars, first present to keep us out of dumb wars since at least Carter, you could arguably, since Kennedy,
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  and the first one to actually care about real trade policies to put American workers back to work since anybody arguably in the modern era, since before World War 2.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  And so again, so I think he's following what you're doing and leading and what the audience is doing by continuing to share the information.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  That's why they hate info wars. It's not me, it's the audience, all the guests, it's his family, but it does have an effect on Trump. That's a good thing.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  Robert in Thailand, you're on there with Robert Barnes. Go ahead.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  Alex, bless you and thank you. And Robert, on behalf of Marvel fans worldwide, thank you for saving Blade. You saved Blade. You're the man who saved Blade. Thank you so much.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  I wanted to say that although I am Robert from Thailand, I'm probably going to be Robert from Argentina pretty soon because it doesn't look really good with this situation.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  My dad worked for the Department of Energy and he told me that 10,000 years is how long the land is going to be useless if these things go off.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  All the elements are converted into radioactive elements also in the ground and everywhere.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  So this Neil deGrasse Tyson story that's going around saying, oh yeah, you know, we have nukes that don't spread radiation now.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  This is completely insane, completely, totally insane.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  Well, plus if you use neutron bombs, still you have 400 plus reactors that melt down, worse than Chernobyl and worse than Fukushima.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  So we cannot have a nuclear war. I know it's extreme, I know it's radical, it's racist, but we cannot survive a major nuclear war. Go ahead.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's absolutely suicidal. You know, and he told me about some of these things. They have one that's like a, it has a whole bunch of little hockey pucks in it. They're like hockey pucks looking things.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  And each one of them is a nuclear bomb and it just spews these hockey pucks all over the place, this missile. And this was like decades and decades ago that they had this thing.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  Imagine the stuff they have now. It's just really, it needs to stop. We have to stop.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  You have to stop. Make sure you call your phones breaking up. Robert Barnes, I mean, Lee and McAdoo's going to come in. I'm going to continue with calls while she's on.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  I want to be talking about World War III. We're going to air a video that came out like two weeks before the election in 2016.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  They got 10,000,000 views. Darren McBreen and Lee and McAdoo put together dealing with the scenario of Hillary saying, I will attack Russia.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  I will launch the nukes. Those insane statements. That's basically where we're back to. One minute closing comment.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  We've got to continue to fight. So always remember that. Remember the power that you have. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled is convincing people he did not exist.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  The greatest trick the system has ever pulled is convincing you that you cannot resist. There are all kinds of ways to resist.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  Whether it's supporting Info Wars at infowarstore.com to keep this information on the air, to make sure people know, to keep broadcasting the truth, to be the Paul Revere of the modern era,
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  warning us of the disaster coming if we don't act now, to constructive, productive, everyday ways that all of you can participate.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  The FBI wasn't spending days at a time looking at even small accounts. Even small accounts don't matter. Every voice matters.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  Don't let them fool you. Don't let them trick you. Continue to resist. Remember the pandemic.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  Our organized efforts led here by the Info Wars audience is what stopped those lockdowns in their track from becoming a permanent reality of our existence.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  It's what pushed back against the vaccines, pushed back against the mandates.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  And we can do it again. We have to. The future of our species is on the line. Robert Barnes, talk to you soon. Thank you.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  Absolutely. Glad to be here, Alex.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  This hour of anti-nuclear war heresy brought to you by Ultimate Bone Broth, Mac and Stock, 25% off, infowarstore.com. We in McAdoo, straight ahead.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsore.com.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWarsore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  The idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand. Don't kid yourself no matter what you all say. That's called World War III.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the President gives the order, it must be followed. There's about 4 minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  As President, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  We came, we saw, we died. With her, you'll end up in World War III. I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the President, we will attack Iran.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  Of course not, because she's...
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  Really loud noise.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:54.000]  Alright, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties. We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com front-line report.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  Alright, it was a little over six years ago that Leigh Ann, McGrane put together that piece she just saw.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  She's back with us, former Infowars reporter, a great journalism graduate from the University of Texas.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  And she's here with us. We have been through quite the saga. It's got to be eight, nine years plus I've known her.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  And she's here with us in studio to talk about all the big issues, all the craziness.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  Well, Trump got in. We didn't have the war. Now the Democrats are back in. They're pushing for the war.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  Republicans are involved in it. All the vaccine news is coming out being confirmed.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  How crazy is it, Leigh Ann, to have been here many, many years ago when we were still kind of underground?
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  And now it's almost passé. I mean, Elon Musk says, what conspiracy theory has it turned out to be true?
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  Right, exactly. It's not a theory if it's actually a fact. It's then a conspiracy.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  So I think we were kind of in the thick of it. And you've been for quite some time where, you know,
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  it was a bad word to be called a conspiracy theorist. And now everything we've been saying is all coming true
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  and mainstream and people can see it with their own eyes.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  And even the people who were so strong on getting their 15th COVID booster were finally starting to come around.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  Now that they're admitting they're not even effective.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  You're not just a politically smart lady, gut level, spiritually you're smart.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  What does your instincts tell you about the danger level of where we are?
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  Are we going to have full blown nuclear war? We're already in a war with Russia.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  What is Big Pharma going to do? Is their own executives get caught on tape bragging?
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  Yeah, we made the viruses. We released them. We're using it for control.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  I mean, it just seems like they're exposing themselves, but they think they're protected.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  Right. Well, I sort of straddle, you know, looking at things from a more spiritual place.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  And so recognizing that this is absolutely foretold and we are living in these crazy times and it is going to get crazier.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  I do believe it really is, but it's by design. It's all been foretold.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  And we have to have faith and we have to, you know, remain kind of holy people who have faith and trust.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  And, you know, we have been enlightened.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  There's a reason why we have received, you know, wisdom and are able to kind of share this with other people.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Right. So there's a reason why we have to kind of hold steadfast in our knowing, our faith, our truth and hope.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  I mean, hope is the one thing that will shine in the darkness.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  But I do think it is going to get a lot darker, you know, which is why we're kind of being asked to step up even more to like be in a place of light.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  And the truth, bringing the truth and the wisdom to people because it's really trying to be stolen from us,
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  occulted in such an incredible way, like mass psychosis because of all the disinformation that's out there.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  So more than ever, people need the truth and hope.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  I mean, I agree with you. The establishment knows that their phase is coming to an end and we're ending in a new cycle
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  and they're trying to pre-position for control in the future because they're scared and they're endangering everything out of their fear of losing control.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  And there's got to be some way, but we see the whistleblowers, we see the exposes, we see everything they do turning to crap,
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  but they just double down so we're in that paradox right now.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  Right. And it's like, eventually all of the truth is going to come out, everyone's going to be exposed.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  You know, they'll soon begin eating their own and eventually there's nowhere for anyone to hide.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  Right now they're just sort of shining a light on this person or that person.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  You know, who's in opposition that they can take out?
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  What company can we expose so that they'll fall and crumble and take people's confidence out of crypto and things like that?
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  So right now it's just they're dismantling and only allowing the truth to shine on the certain companies that are opposition.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  But eventually it's like, who's left?
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  Okay, well now we have to start taking out people who are even seen as our allies.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  Eventually, you know, there's kind of like a double-sided sword here with technology.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  How it's all rolling out is eventually it's just you can't hide.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  The truth is going to be easily hacked into, if anything, you're going to be exposed.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  I agree with you.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  What's your political view on this war accelerating into open war with Russia right now?
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  I mean, it's just incredible to watch and it's incredible to...
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  In fact, I try not to watch it because it just hurts me and it energetically, it like hurts my body.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  Because we know what's going on and we see it and it's like, oh boy, the omnibus, it's out of control.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  You know, this is terrible.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  It's, you know, 15,000 pages and six feet tall and it's great.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  We shouldn't vote on this and then they do.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  And it's like, oh, why? Why is spending out of control?
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  Gee, I wonder, should we send more bombs and missiles and all the new technology we get to use now in the war in Ukraine?
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  It's like, people are oblivious and so many people signed on and they change their social media to the blue and yellow flag.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  And they're like, yeah, we support it. You should go in and send...
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  That's another thing. Since when do you get the left to...
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  How do they get the left to fully pledge themselves to be the war party?
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  And it does not have to go through Congress for a vote because all the people are like, yeah, do it, bomb them.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  You know, it's just like, that's how they get things...
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  Sean Penn's like, let's have a nuclear war. What's wrong with that?
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  It's like, how dare you Nazis being in nuclear war? How dare you racist?
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  Right. You don't want to bomb people, you know, it's just...
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  And then just the insane debt here and like the massive homeless population that's everywhere now.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  I mean, it's starting to even trickle down into where I'm from, my neighborhood, you know, where it's...
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  It is, you know, pretty Republican there and they don't...
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  There aren't a lot of like programs like that, but people are trying to kind of make it more like it...
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  It is an Austin where it's like all left people sitting making the rules and then they just...
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  They want to be so helpful by letting them do whatever they want, sleep on the streets, but that's not helping people get ahead in life.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  It's not helping them find a home or, you know, by just allowing them, you know, giving them needles and drugs and free access.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  It's normalizing the collapse.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  It's normalizing it. And so I think a lot of people are starting to see that there's a, you know, a bit of a sickness and a mass psychosis.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  And so those of us who aren't hypnotized in this like mass hypnosis of it all,
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  we really do have to turn things off at a certain point and get back into our hearts with our discernment
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  because we all do kind of contain that spirit within us, that Holy Spirit, if you want, that will...
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  It has the answers, you know, and so a lot of people just can't even hear that voice anymore because we're so bombarded with noise and...
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  Well, you just said it. That's the AI's plan is to cut us off from our spirit. Our instincts are common sense.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  Absolutely. And it can't. I just don't think it'll win.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  But, you know, I think even when people do start flugging in the brain chips and stuff, there is going to be a time of...
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  Well, I want to ask you a laundry list of questions. What do you think Elon Musk? What do you think of all the Twitter files?
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  What do you think of what's happening with the poison shots? All that and more.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  And we're going to get you a headset too, an earpiece, because Leanne McAdoo's here.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  We're going to take some calls as well. And she promises while she's visiting Texas in the next month to come back again.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  And she's a hypnotist too. She's going to hypnotize me.

[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in MIs, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  And it's the same PSYOP today. MFullWar is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  and because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down MFullWars and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done. If you decide to go to MFullWarStore.com
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.

[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones's MFullWars and our audience
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support.
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance. Buy products.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  Donate to the cause. Share the links. Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:23.000]  You know, it feels good to have Leanne McAdoo, one of the original OGs here in MFullWars,
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  popping and visiting us today. She's in Texas for the next few weeks. Hope she comes back again.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  But Leanne, I could ask you a million questions. We've got some calls coming up.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  But what else are you focused on? I mean, are you optimistic about the future?
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  They did the lockdowns. They did the poison shots. That's all coming out everywhere.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000]  I mean, are you optimistic?
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  Oh, gosh. Well, yes and no. I choose to have an optimistic point of view on things.
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  And I sort of like a shift in perspective of like being prepared versus, you know,
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  surviving kind of mentality where it's like, okay, there's food shortages or this is happening.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.000]  Well, let's grow a garden. Let's get some chickens. You know, the price of eggs are out of control.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  Well, guess what? We already got some chickens and started, we're prepared.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  We're not, we don't have this mentality of like, you know, I'm going to die and everything's going to hell,
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000]  even though it might be. But I feel like it's a...
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  You're saying don't be a victim.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  Exactly.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  Taking this as a challenge.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  Be prepared. And there's nothing to worry about when you've already got your well dug out in your yard
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000]  and you're good. And I know some people, that's not possible for them.
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  So I don't want to sound like a, you know, I'm saying impossible things.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  Not everybody's got a shotgun or rifle in a four-wheel drive like Leanne McAdams.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  Property and a water well, you know, I get it. But in whatever way that you can be prepared,
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  even if it's just, you know, making sure you have extra dry goods.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  So when the store runs out of everything, you're prepared.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  Stop feeling like you're secure because you're not being a victim. You're an overcomer.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  Yeah. And also just know that we are living in times that have been foretold.
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:59.000]  There is, you know, people are talking about the Pluto return and stuff.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  You know, we haven't seen it since 1776. I mean, this is...
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  Explain that. It's true.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.000]  And even people don't believe in this. The elites are obsessed with astrology and astronomy.
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  Astrology is absolutely 100% controlling things behind the scenes. Astrophiology.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  Hitler ran the whole war off that.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  Absolutely. And so, but they, of course, took it away from the masses
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  because they did not want us to understand or have access.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:26.000]  They wanted to only control the energies that are, you know, in the air.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  And so this is kind of a time where chaos happens.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  And it is the breaking down of the old world. It's shifting from Pisces into Aquarius,
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  which is just, you know, where we're moving in location to the sky.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  But it's energetically, it's like one, the old world is dying.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000]  And then there's the new world order. And so the old world...
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  And that's why they call it the new world order because they're really the old world order.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.000]  It truly is a new world that we are moving into on the horizon.
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  And so it's kind of like, okay, well, everyone's, you know,
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  maybe shifting away from religion or whatever.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:05.000]  How can we destroy that mindset, but then move people into a new God?
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000]  And so what's the new God going to be? Is it going to be AI?
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  Are they going to fake an alien invasion and everyone thinks they're God?
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  Or is the government going to finally get its wish and be God?
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000]  You know, people are begging.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  So it's the establishment trying to possess itself on top.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  Always. That's their prepared. They know the shift is coming.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000]  They know there's this big energetic thing.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:31.000]  Very similar to when 2020 was coming around and it was like 50 year anniversary of like, you know,
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000]  the 60s and all the riots and all the things going on.
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000]  It's like, that was why I moved away from Austin because I knew I was like,
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  I don't want to be here when that energy percolates because...
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  That's what you told me when you love. People said, why Lee Ann Lee?
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000]  You said I can't enter the energy here.
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000]  And I meant to cover the CNN articles also in like science journal,
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  but they've confirmed that the center core of the earth has stopped spinning.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  And I meant to cover that like the core of the earth stopped spinning.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  I looked that up and that that means a pole shifts imminent.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:02.000]  Right. And this is just natural. It happens, you know,
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  but we just so happen to be alive at this really intense time.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  And what's that going to do with the satellites and all the rest of it are aligned?
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  There it is. Earth's core has stopped and maybe reversing direction, study says.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  And whether that's true or not, they know that they've been recording over 100 years,
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  the magnetic field and the poles of the earth have moved thousands of miles.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  Right. Of course, which is why...
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  That's speeding up. Solar flares and like electromagnetic.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  So the earth might change course and suddenly the U.S. is in Antarctica or...
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  It'll shift about, I think, 15 degrees is what they say.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  And that's why the pole star isn't exactly lined up with the North Pole anymore
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  or, you know, the pyramid. Things aren't just off just a bit
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  because we move, you know, when the poles shift.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  But the ancients do the line stuff up with that.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  Absolutely. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's...
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  I'm not saying, oh, it's no big deal, you know, cataclysm.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  I mean, but can we do anything about it?
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  But we know these cataclysm have come. Right.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  Everything Plato wrote was nonfiction and they found like 95% of it's been confirmed.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  Like cities, he said we're here and they didn't believe they'd find them there.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  He said like thousands of years before, Atlantis blew up the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  They had an energy source that was free. It blew up.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  The earth basically shifted where it was at.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  And Alex, that's the kind of stuff that has really captured my attention.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  I've always been super into that stuff.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  Of course, you know, you kind of come and go with the things that you're intrigued with,
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  but I'm really, I'm getting back into more of the occulted information that's out there,
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  that we are hidden history and things that...
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  And explain what occulted means. It's not the occult. Occult means hidden.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  Hidden.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  What's hidden? Occulted means hidden.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  Right. It just, occulted means that it's hidden.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  You know, like the moon is occulted when it's a new moon.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  It's just, it's hidden in darkness kind of.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  And so it's just information that you don't have access to unless you know the password.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  You know what to say. You make it to the next level.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  Or, you know, it used to be when we would surf the web,
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  you could go down all sorts of rabbit holes.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  But now, because Google and, you know, they kind of own that highway,
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  they don't allow you to access those certain off-roads.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  And so you can't even gain access to a lot of those rabbit holes, if you will, on that information.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  Unless you know where to look, how to look, what, you know, words to use.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  And, you know, that's why I thought it was really interesting when Matt Drudge came to the studio years ago
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  and told us all to get out of these internet ghettos.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  Because that's what they...
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  He said, they've told me I've met, he'd met with Clarence Thomas.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  And Clarence told him, well, it's five, six years it's all over.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  He'd been told they're getting rid of free speech.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  You saw the deputy head of the EU, unelected last week, say at Davos,
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  they were about to ban American speech, and they had US Congressmen on the stage agreeing.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  Yeah.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  Did you see that clip where they go, yeah, we're about...
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  It's dangerous.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  It's crazy.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  Yeah, we can't let people be free thinkers.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  And of course, you know, going with, again, the occulted knowledge, but it's on words,
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  and the meaning of words, and even government, you know, which is like, steer the mind.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  So that's what they believe their job is, to sort of steer the minds of their subjects.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  But they're not steering us in a good way.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  Why would a true elite want to dump people down?
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  If they're such elites, they should try to empower us.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  Well, then we would realize that we're sovereign beings, and we don't need dweebs controlling
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  us and telling us what to do.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  The most sickest, disgusting, slovenly people coming out as like our health patrol, you
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  know, and you're like, I would never take a single shred of advice from you.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  You look like you're dead.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  What is it about the health officials around the world?
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  They look like dead zombies.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  Yeah.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  They don't, you know, they're like, I've gotten 57 vaccines and nothing happened to
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  me, you know, and you're just like, okay.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  They could barely walk or talk.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  Yeah.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000]  And they're like drooling in their brains.
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  And, you know, it's just, they're very unhealthy people.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  And they pass out on TV routinely like, I'm brave.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  I'm getting the shot.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  It's fine.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  You know, just like pass out on camera.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  But then it's like the cognitive dissonance.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  It's like, oh no, she just didn't have enough to eat.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  That's why she passed out.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  It couldn't have been that vaccine.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  But the insurance actuaries show mass death.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  Oh, you know, I spoke.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  Yeah, there's a health minister.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  We're not being mean, but come on folks.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  It's just, you know, you will know them by their fruits, right?
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  And it's just, if anyone has just like a shred of discernment, you kind of go, huh, you
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  know, maybe I'm not going to eat the same exact thing.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  What you're suggesting is you look kind of ill, you know.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  Incredible.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  I don't know that one up at the top left-hand corner.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  I'm going to date her.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  That's the job of the huts wife.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  Yeah.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  She's, she likes Belgium waffles and chocolate.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  Well, I'm not perfect by God.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  I look a lot better.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  That woman, the woman in the lower right-hand corner could star in the next zombie movie.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  Yeah.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  Praise.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  All right.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  We'll get into so much more.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  I can do amazing.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  All right.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:30:13.000]  All right.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  All right.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:31:05.000]  All right.
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:31.000]  All right.
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:58.000]  All right.
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.000]  of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan and they've
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:27.000]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  other names.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:34.000]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000]  These things are incredible.
[02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.000]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare
[02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000]  provider, those are so powerful, get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:25.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  From the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  Well, the great Leanne McAdams, whether she's going to be popping on the war room today
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  as well and she's going to come back and see us very, very soon.
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  Leanne, it's so great to have you here.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  I want to take calls on this whole situation with Biden saying, you send taxes World War
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  III, now he's sending, sending tax, but before we go to calls, other big issues that are
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  coming up.
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  You know, I just, I wanted to come today as well and just kind of show people what it's
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  like coming from a free state where we haven't been masked up for years.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  Florida.
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  Yeah, and people are actually like standing up against all the tyranny and to just, you
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  know, see how powerful a governor can be who can stand up against, you know, federal government
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  and just say that's not right.
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  The only thing that sort of frightens me is that of course there's been a mass exodus
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  of people from New York and California and stuff moving to Texas and Florida.
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  So it'll be interesting to see where things go from there.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  But yeah, I just, I think it's very interesting that I had spoken with someone years ago who
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  was very involved with like the medical community.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  He creates medical devices and stuff.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  And so he had kind of a back door information on the COVID vaccine and he was always very
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  outspoken against it and he sort of told me it'll be about 10 years.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  Like you're going to totally stop hearing about COVID and then maybe 10 years it might
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  come back around where people start admitting that it was, that there were some issues and
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  they knew about it all along.
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  But I think it's really wonderful that it's coming out now, like much sooner.
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  Oh, the global submit they're in panic and this is hurting them.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  Yeah.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  And so there's still people where it's fresh in their minds that their father died or their
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  mother died or their sister died or their kids, their young kids.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  And that was the other thing he told me is that within that 10 years what they're going
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  to try and do is normalize and they'll put it in people's brains of like, oh, dementia
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  and Alzheimer's.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  Little kids have heart attacks now.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  It's normal.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  Very young people are getting Alzheimer's now.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  It's sort of strange.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  Oh, heart attacks, who, you know, perfectly healthy 18 year olds having heart attacks.
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  This is, and then they actually did have an article about it and they tried to name it
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  something new, like if it's just this random new thing that's come about.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  And so how evil, how evil could, do you have to be, to be a reporter or a journalist or
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  a news editor that's like, we're going to run with that angle, you know, tell the story
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  this way.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  We need to protect everyone who was kind of involved in this.
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  Well, that's why they did it was to see who they could corrupt and who will go along with
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  the next big attack.
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  Right.
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  And that's really the key.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  Carlos in Canada, you're on the air with Leanne McAdoo on the All in Show and Show.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  Carlos, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  Thank you, Leanne.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  Just basically my analysis is straightforward.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  If you look at a map of Ukraine, you find that at the stage that we're at right now,
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  there's a fork on the road.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  We can go World War Three in which case, well, there's nothing to say the next war, as Einstein
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  said, will begin with sticks and stones.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  Or we can look at the Russian, Russian solution.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  The Russian solution began was triggered in November 2021 when Zelensky threatened to go
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000]  nuclear in its arsenal in Ukraine.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  At that point, three months later, this special military operation was launched.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  What we have now is a situation where if you look at the map of Ukraine from the north
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  Kharkiv area to the south of Odessa, there's a river that runs from the north to the south.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  It's called the Denver River.
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  The left bank of it, which is the eastern side of it, to the Russian border.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  It's essentially Russian population, a pro-Russia desire.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  The north, the Kharkiv area, has said they want to have a referendum to join Russia.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  All the way to Odessa, the people will go in favor of Russia.
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  We know Putin wants a little bit of Ukraine that's almost completely Russian and been
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  part of Russia forever until Lenin gave it over to the Ukrainians and he wants to
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  guarantee that they will not join NATO, which Henry Kissinger now says they want to do.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  So the fork on the road, we're going towards nuclear war.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  The fork on the road is that people don't understand.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  First of all, once Russia has the buffer zone with the river, you have to cross tanks
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000]  across the river.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  It's going to be a little hard if there are no bridges and if there's no fly zone over
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  that area and there's no electricity or whatever, or people, it's going to be the buffer zone
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  that Russia will want to have.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  I think that's the Russian solution.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  They don't want to take over 40 million Ukrainians that are not friendly, okay?
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  So it's not going to happen.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  So as far as I'm concerned, the Russian solution ends because once that happens,
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  people can pound sand because they're going to have to go to the next level, which is
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  to trigger some sort of assault on Russia.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  And that's why the entire NATO force in those towns in that area have been trying to keep
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  the Russians from taking those areas.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  Who would you say is winning the war right now?
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  Robert Barnes did it perfectly well.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  He didn't quite say it, but the moment that Solidar has fallen, that triggered a reaction
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  in the West.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  As soon as Bakhmut falls, they just came over.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  It's bye-bye because at that stage, the service roads and the supply lines and all that are
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  all gone.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  And that means that the eastern part of the Lenape River is Russian territory, which is
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  what at the point I'm making.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000]  So that's the Russian solution.
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  I don't think the West can get all those tanks and troops in place by the time the Russians
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  complete those operations.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  So my end point is this, people must understand you warriors in the sofas sitting there thinking
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  it's a video game.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  It isn't.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  Think about something that President Putin has not said to you.
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  Nuclear policy of Russia is yes to use nuclear power only at the last moment when the security
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  of Russia is going to be gone.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  But the second point which people must understand is that all the nuclear targets will be fired
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  simultaneously.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  There only were one pressing a one button.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  It's simultaneous.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  Total commitment.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  That is all.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  That's the end of it.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  Thank you for the call.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  Leanne, that's where we're at.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  We're trying to, why would they push Russia into this?
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  Well, the thing that I, it just reminds me is when we were reporting on it back in 2015
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  when they had the coup in Ukraine.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  And gosh, I can't, the name's escaping me right now, but she was caught on the hot mic
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  talking about how they needed to work with the neo-Nazis in Ukraine.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  Victoria Nuland.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  Victoria Nuland to like take out their president and put in the US appointed comedian Zelensky,
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  right?
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  And so imagine if Hillary Clinton had gotten elected, that was their plan all along, pushing
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  all of this mass chaos.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.800]  And Obama, his like message leaving the presidency was essentially telling America, we're not
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:46.080]  going to be a superpower anymore, that we're never going to have jobs again, everyone just
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:47.320]  needs to get used to this.
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:49.840]  This is the end, it's all going south.
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:53.040]  And that was the messaging that they were kind of leaving us with to where if Hillary
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:57.160]  Clinton would have gotten in, all of this would have been fast forwarded.
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:01.400]  And so then of course, Trump came in, he was able to stall everything, prove that in fact
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:05.640]  we could regain jobs and pull everything back to the US and take some of the power away
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:10.640]  from China and, you know, sound the warning bell on everything that was happening with
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:15.040]  giving them all of our power and control, you know, just because it's cheaper to do
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:19.200]  business there, but you know, this was, this was all planned.
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:25.480]  This was all in the works, this whole, the whole starting the war with Russia and Ukraine.
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:31.240]  Like there's a reason why Joe Biden's son, while the, in the middle of the coup is happening
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:39.680]  in 2015, Hunter and then a few other people, I don't want to say Nancy Pelosi and care
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:44.960]  no, it's her family, it's like they all all of a sudden, Mitt Romney's son, yeah, experts
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:46.480]  in oil and gas.
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:48.200]  And so now they're over in Ukraine.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:49.200]  What?
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:50.200]  Huh?
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:51.200]  I'm sorry.
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:52.200]  How did that happen?
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  But of course, they started the fight with Russia.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:57.320]  And I wish, I wish Putin wouldn't have invaded because I guess they moved trips against the
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:01.240]  Russian border, but then they wouldn't have any claims this war, but it doesn't matter.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.240]  Russia's committed now.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:06.240]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you're constantly saying, don't worry, we're not going to move closer
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:09.560]  to you and we're not going to set up bases all around your border.
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:10.560]  We won't do it.
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:18.440]  But in fact, we actually are, you know, it's like who's lying, you know, and watch who's
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:22.640]  lying, who's provoking, who's prodding and then going, oh, gosh, I don't know why he
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:23.640]  got so upset.
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:25.720]  Now I got to send some tanks over there.
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:28.240]  Now we just have to start World War three.
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:32.280]  It's like when someone's, I'm not touching you and they're, you know, they're just poking
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:33.280]  at you.
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:34.280]  Well, that's my next question.
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:38.040]  We come back and take more calls is you have Biden 10 months ago saying we can't send armored
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:40.640]  vehicles, we can't send tanks, that's World War three.
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:42.640]  And now he's like, we're sending tanks.
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:46.120]  What change with Biden and Henry Kissinger in the last few months, where there's suddenly
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.440]  war, war, war, let's get it going.

[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:19.200]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind, that was something so crazy
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.200]  about me.
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.920]  My old good friends info wars reporter many years ago back with us in the war room at
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:28.360]  three p.m. central the fourth hour is coming up with a great guest house.
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:31.360]  I want to jam in some more calls before we go to these calls Leigh Ann what else is
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:33.360]  on your radar?
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:38.880]  Well you just asked me before the break about Twitter and social media and everything which
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:44.440]  I have completely tapped out of for the time being I feel like it's really evil.
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:45.440]  So your Twitter is dormant.
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:46.440]  Yeah.
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:50.240]  Well maybe you'll tell folks conspiracy fact on info that you're going to go live on air
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:53.160]  with Owen and that's a link they don't censor.
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:56.840]  Yeah and you know what honestly I don't even know people can see my tweets anymore after
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:47:59.440]  they took you off and banned everyone.
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:04.600]  They also stopped my account but I think I had already gone to Florida then so they couldn't
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:09.040]  really tell if I was still working here and they so they stopped me from being able to
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:13.680]  they took a hundred thousand followers away and they've on all my accounts even though
[02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:19.600]  I get new followers it never shows it just stays right there and so I don't know if people
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:24.880]  can see my tweets like I and for me I'm just like I don't want any part of that I'm not
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:25.880]  going to.
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:30.200]  And I agree with it but it's a paradox even though they're censoring I get it still whoever
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:32.040]  you can reach use it because they hate it.
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:37.920]  Yes and I agree and I will but I just I feel like energetically maybe you should file with
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:40.880]  Elon and say hey take the shadow bin off.
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:41.880]  Yeah.
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:42.880]  What is your view of Elon.
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:48.520]  Apparently Elon is setting up base in Sarasota so I you know I might see him who knows he's
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:53.480]  like opening up a Tesla thing and you know down the street apparently he has a big huge
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:49:00.360]  house on the island where my mom lives so you know he funny everybody's moving there.
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:02.640]  I know and it I love it weird.
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:07.160]  I love it but I also like I go down there and hang out with a certain talk show hosts
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:10.320]  that are well known on Fox News he lives right around there.
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:14.320]  Just please please if you do come and visit please don't litter please take your trash
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:19.320]  off the beach my god I don't know how people can go to such gorgeous nature and then leave
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:20.320]  their trash.
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:23.320]  I think the West Coast of Florida is way better than the East Coast.
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.320]  Absolutely.
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:28.440]  It is and I hate it that people have finally figured that out I liked it better when they
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:34.080]  thought everyone was just like crazy meth heads that like eat people you know member of zombie
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:35.080]  virus.
[02:49:35.080 --> 02:49:36.840]  No I get more love than anywhere in Florida.
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:38.600]  Oh I turn CS to K.
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:43.680]  I feel so safe you know you you can actually ride around with a Trump sticker on your car
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:48.560]  and no one's going to bash your windows and you know it's it's a beautiful beautiful place
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:54.280]  a lot of conscious people but it's also you know it's always been kind of a place where
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:50:01.080]  very powerful people you know it has ties to 9 11 I mean that's where George W. Bush was
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:07.280]  on 9 11 reading his little book upside down to the kids so you know it's a it's it's one
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:11.840]  of those places a little goat story where it's magical and it's also you know there's
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:17.120]  also some other things some other energy going on there let's go to I don't want to say this
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:23.440]  name wrong how do you read Obadiah Obadiah in Vegas you're on the air Leigh Ann Magnum
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:28.160]  yes I first of all I want to get clear that this is my own theory but I haven't caught
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:35.120]  COVID-19 but I stay up on my iron I think that COVID-19 is not a respiratory illness
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:40.560]  I think it's targeting people's iron deficiency because most people are deficient in iron
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:45.480]  which is responsible for transport and all the minerals throughout the body and oxygen
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:55.200]  via the blood so it would mimic a respiratory illness and the two to two uh herbals that
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:51:02.440]  I take on a daily basis are in that Dr. McCullis that Vanderwaters or whatever he did he said
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:07.600]  his best selling supplement that was helping helping people the most there's iris moss
[02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:13.600]  and dandelion and both of those are super high in iron phosphate but I wanted to also
[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:20.440]  say that they're in March 18th of 2014 and the times of Israel they had a they had a
[02:51:20.440 --> 02:51:26.960]  article that says leaked report Israel acknowledges Jews in fact kzars secret plan for reverse
[02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:35.920]  migration to Ukraine and until the the buckle happened with the rest of Ukraine nonsense
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:42.120]  the editor's note wasn't pinned up there until then so for eight years it wasn't there
[02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:48.920]  well for those who don't know Stalin had a plan to relocate Jews to a homeland of Siberia
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:54.240]  they also looked at Ukraine but they decided on Israel at the end of World War two so that
[02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:58.240]  that's mainline history what you're talking about but what's what what what's the point
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:04.680]  of that well do you think that that's possibly why that what's going on I mean Zelensky
[02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:12.480]  says that he wants Ukraine to be bigger Israel and in September 18th of 2012 Henry Kissinger
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:17.320]  said that there would be in 10 years there would be no more Israel I don't know what
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:22.560]  to look at it thanks for the call let's talk to Simon in Florida the great free state where
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:28.440]  Lee Ann hails from go ahead Simon hey thanks for taking my call up yet I wanted to talk
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:35.880]  to you about the the this article in MIT article from 2013 controlling genes with light the
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:41.840]  basics of the article read down through it it says that they figured out how to cause
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:48.800]  a protein to release MRNA they could turn off any of your genes just by using light now
[02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:55.360]  we know you know LEDs are used everywhere your TV your phone your computer street lights
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:53:00.320]  and what's also concerning about that is the recumbent DNA that's in there because you
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:05.800]  know Revelation nine six talks about how man will pray to die and death will flee from
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:11.240]  them we see a lot of predictive programming with zombie TV shows and movies I just wanted
[02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:15.400]  to see what you thought about that I mean I know that they 15 years ago said they were
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:19.720]  practicing with LED lights that could interface your computers you don't even know that it's
[02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:23.640]  happening so yeah lights a huge thing so we get up in the morning we go to sleep at night
[02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:30.600]  even if you're a blacked out room you know you wake up on the sun comes up right all
[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:35.160]  sorts of laser technologies and things that we can't even see the visible you know the
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:39.440]  light spectrum we only see just a small part of the light spectrum but there's all of these
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:47.600]  different layers of it that are you know devices microwaves and lasers and weaponry and things
[02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:50.560]  we don't even know so we don't even know what's out there there was actually just a study
[02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:56.880]  that they were healing brain cancers using sound frequency so now there's you know they
[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:02.080]  can get in there with a laser and like do a super high-pitched noise and so on the one
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:06.440]  hand you can look at it like it's scary because they are actually learning about a lot of
[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:11.560]  technology but on the other there is this potential for really wonderful things to happen
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:14.960]  well I agree that's what they want total control now they want to keep the good stuff for themselves
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:24.400]  yeah now we unlock the secrets universe anything else Simon yeah the graphing so the graphing
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:28.880]  in the vaccines now it's known you can look up there's plenty articles to talk about how
[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:35.600]  it's going to be the next new semiconductor and it's going to be controlled by get this
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:41.240]  not 5g 6g the 6g freak no I've seen the articles and you got people to take the Pfizer Moderna
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:46.840]  shots literally picks up the magnets all that's really going on so that it's all a giant medical
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:50.360]  experiment we're all getting pigs did you see Benjamin yet young I know you're dialed
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:54.560]  out I admire the thing you kind of dialed out of it but he said a month ago on Jordan
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:59.640]  Peterson he said oh yeah Israel's all getting pigs now we just gonna test drugs on him yeah
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:04.600]  well that's why they were so excited about having such a mass amount of people who were
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:10.200]  going to take this test vaccine because it gave them you know a larger kind of a case
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:16.160]  study and we everyone that signed up for it my sister had to sign like a 40 page document
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:20.960]  saying that she knew that this was an experimental and if anything happens nobody could be sued
[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:27.240]  and you know she's a nurse and she you know she oversees a lot of nurses and so she kind
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:31.360]  of took one for the team so to speak because she can't very well be like well it's it's
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:36.240]  safe and effective you guys take it not me anything happened to her no thank god but
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:40.640]  she didn't get any of the boosters we know the secret above 87 degrees it goes bad it's
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:44.080]  a lot of the good nurses they don't just give people a sailing shot of something been arrested
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:47.960]  for that is our metals they just go oh we're gonna leave it out here for a couple days
[02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:51.880]  and let it get up to above 80 degrees well and I also think I you know don't quote me
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:55.720]  on this but my sister she went to school with one of the places where they were actually
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:56:00.960]  working on a vaccine and they had been working and it's not the the one with the MRNA so
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:07.240]  she got the different version and it was through a facility that she actually had you know
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:10.800]  she knew the people are different absolutely I'm not saying vaccines and real technology
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.640]  either yeah I came out of the news like 20 years ago that the powerful elite get quote

[03:00:08.160 --> 03:00:13.760]  the great Paul Joseph Watson from her Britannic Majesties England will be taking over in T
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:18.640]  minus six minutes we'll be back in an hour with the war room with the great Owen shroyer
[03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:24.560]  right now we're jamming in a few final calls Matt Colorado you're on the air yeah I would
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:28.440]  in honor to be on your show Alex I want to thank you for all you've done you woke me
[03:00:28.440 --> 03:00:34.680]  up I've been listening to your show for 10 years long supporter of the store donations
[03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:39.280]  but but I'm not calling for that I'm calling to talk about World War three and the fact
[03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:44.480]  that they're actually not trying to start World War three they're trying to destroy God's
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:49.000]  people because because they've been caught red handed with their hands in the cookie
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:55.920]  jar in our food our medicine everything every institution's corrupted so they know we woke
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:02.320]  up and the sleeping giant awoke and they're so scared of honesty and truth and rather
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:07.760]  than apologizing and doing what's right they're gonna keep they're gonna continue to push
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:12.840]  this agenda because they have no other choice no I agree when their agenda fails they take
[03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:17.280]  you to war Lee anyone comment on that yeah and they're absolutely psychopathic but the
[03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:24.520]  thing is is imagine how afraid and aware they must be of the power of humanity that they
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:29.640]  would go to such limits or ends like the whole covert thing and basically shutting down the
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:34.800]  entire planet like that was the measure they had to take in order to stop the forward motion
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:39.880]  of we the people who were finally waking up and regaining our power and it really is inside
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:44.520]  all of us like but that's that's where it's at is like regaining our sense of our own
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:49.600]  strength and power and once we turn that on and there's no turning back and they want
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:53.720]  us to feel disempowered but it's the opposite right Matt appreciate your love brother we
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:59.480]  love you too anything else just that I didn't take the vaccine my family didn't take the
[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:04.840]  vaccine I wanted to just discuss that real quick the bioluminescent oxidative enzyme
[03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:10.040]  called luciferase the fact of the matter is we didn't all do the buffalo jump with them
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:15.440]  that was a beta test with their it was the first shot fired so they've already committed
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:21.040]  to what they're going to do now it's just up to us to repent get close to God keep listening
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:26.640]  to Alex Jones and info wars support the store I'm telling you I've got your water filter

[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:37.440]  crew and thank you for taking my call thank you Matt amazing we love you too Jim and
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:53.640]  Arizona you're on the air are we are we on World War three still yes we're live on
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:03:01.200]  there right now oh no if we're still on World War three discussion on that yes good I was
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:06.760]  a foreign observer for a heavy mortar put in I was in West Germany with the first armored
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:15.400]  division back in 1975 1978 and it was discovered that a staff sergeant at a division level
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:21.680]  military intelligence was selling our battle plans to the Russians this is our 1977 and
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:27.720]  needle went nuts our tanks and the battalions were given a full combat loads and our mortar
[03:03:27.720 --> 03:03:32.760]  platoon was taken offline for two months and we were trained by the combat engineers
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:39.120]  in that security and deployment of the sadams and madams small and medium atomic demolition
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:44.920]  and on a military grid map a grid square is a thousand meters by a thousand meters and
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:49.440]  a saddam would take out two and a half grid squares and a maddam would take out five grid
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:55.200]  squares the key word is atomic not nuclear they were considered part of our conventional
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:04:02.280]  armament at the time and I'm sure we probably still have them in the arsenal now it seems
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:08.720]  like what we did at the time I think the Russians are much more likely to go with chemical warfare
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:15.320]  before they did anything you know Paul Watson's about to take over but but can we get your
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:18.960]  name and number can you come back on this is really interesting about technical weapons
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:22.400]  on the show tomorrow we'll say call you 1130 because I really want to hear what you have
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:27.240]  to say okay get his name and number I want to get him on because he doesn't talk about
[03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:30.400]  this is going to be a whole tactical nuke war chemical war the whole thing's going down
[03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:34.800]  real quick thank you so much Paul Joseph Watson takes over Lee and Macadoo great to have you

[03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:02.720]  is winning info wars is reaching more people than ever we were supposed to be off the air
[03:05:02.720 --> 03:05:07.520]  months and months and months ago mainstream media told you but it's not true they told
[03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:11.360]  you we were gonna be shut down they told you we owed a billion and a half dollars none
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:16.040]  of that's true it's all being appealed they want you to think info wars is dead but if
[03:05:16.040 --> 03:05:20.920]  you simply stand up and support info wars we've got years and years of appeals and we will
[03:05:20.920 --> 03:05:25.240]  not be taken off the air but if they convince you that we've been shut down they're gonna
[03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:30.560]  win don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family go to info wars.com and get incredible

[03:05:45.760 --> 03:05:51.000]  us off the air is you the viewers and listeners the majority of you have not been sigh up

[03:05:55.560 --> 03:06:16.560]  keep us on the air.
[03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:33.680]  We are live it is the summit news hour and we've got a ton of news stories to cover over
[03:06:33.680 --> 03:06:38.640]  the course of the next 60 minutes including what's happened in the aftermath of that big
[03:06:38.640 --> 03:06:45.040]  Pfizer revelation where you had one of the research executives at Pfizer caught on video
[03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:50.560]  under cover sting project veritas cackling demonically about how they're mutating the
[03:06:50.560 --> 03:06:56.320]  virus to create the necessity for more vaccines of course the FDA coming out yesterday and
[03:06:56.320 --> 03:07:03.080]  indicating that they will create the necessity at least maybe even the mandate if they get
[03:07:03.080 --> 03:07:09.800]  the right kind of variant out there for annual autumn boosters for the American population
[03:07:09.800 --> 03:07:15.840]  and well who's going to create those boosters mainly Pfizer and they're creating new viruses
[03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:20.920]  apparently new mutations to create grease the skids for that necessity so we'll get
[03:07:20.920 --> 03:07:27.400]  into that because it seems like certain news outlets have started to delete their reporting
[03:07:27.400 --> 03:07:33.040]  perhaps getting word from Pfizer itself as we shall see first though I want to go to
[03:07:33.040 --> 03:07:37.920]  this video because it kind of explains the story and then there's been numerous updates
[03:07:37.920 --> 03:07:44.560]  to this story after which I'm going to get into basically in Scotland a man was convicted
[03:07:44.560 --> 03:07:53.520]  a man a biological male with a Mike Tyson tattoo on his face who later identified as transgender
[03:07:53.520 --> 03:08:00.240]  of course nothing says feminine more than getting a Mike Tyson tattoo on your face conveniently
[03:08:00.240 --> 03:08:06.600]  for him he identified as transgender when he was on trial for raping to women and this
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:11.680]  video gets into it big backlash to this today which I'm going to get into first like explain
[03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:17.200]  the controversy though which is our first video today it's called you'll barely believe
[03:08:17.200 --> 03:08:28.920]  this let's roll it me Adam Graham Mr Graham was convicted of raping to women in 2016 and
[03:08:28.920 --> 03:08:33.240]  2019 one of his victims said quote I told him to stop and he did not he kept going that's
[03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:37.000]  when I close my eyes and let him do what he wanted to do now imagine just for a second
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:43.280]  the authorities decided to send this convicted male rapist to a female prison full of women
[03:08:43.280 --> 03:08:47.760]  total insanity right I'd be like sending a convicted nonce to do a motivational talk
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:51.120]  at a primary school well you don't have to imagine it because it's actually happening
[03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:57.920]  all thanks to trans mania you see Mr Graham now identifies as Isla Bryson and so is in
[03:08:57.920 --> 03:09:02.840]  the eyes of the legal system now a woman according to Bryson and let's not disrespect
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:07.360]  the pronouns of a convicted criminal as they banned this video she she said she felt she
[03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:12.840]  was transgender since the age of four but just by coincidence only decided to identify
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:18.920]  as a woman after being caught violently raping to women with her penis despite this the authorities
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:22.840]  in their infinite wisdom of ensuring that the alphabet people don't get offended still
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:28.600]  decided to send Isla to HMP quantum veil a women's prison in Stirling this all happened
[03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:33.040]  in Scotland where the government just tried to pass a bill enabling children as young
[03:09:33.040 --> 03:09:37.520]  as 15 to begin the process of legally changing their gender under the law they would only
[03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:42.240]  have to live as their new gender for six months and then can legally apply to have it changed
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:48.160]  on their 16th birthday trans mania several years ago I came out as pansexual and a trans
[03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:59.000]  man it gets better my mom convinced me not to share my transition with my child and I
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  didn't I kept it quiet because they were young a few years ago he came out as a trans boy
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:11.440]  wow who could have seen that coming the bill was so deranged even the cucked conservative
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:15.600]  government in Westminster blocked it although Nicholas Sturgeon is bound to have the overturned
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:20.760]  in court but it gets worse a few rational people remaining in the Scottish Parliament
[03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:24.600]  tried to add an amendment to the bill that would have made it harder for sex offenders
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:29.560]  to fraudulently apply to change their legal gender in order to avoid helping out convicted
[03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:34.800]  rapists like Adam Graham and to prevent the legislation from being exploited by male predators
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:42.280]  to gain access to female spaces but members of the Scottish Parliament wait for it voted
[03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:46.680]  it down yes because apparently it's more important for people like Adam Graham I mean
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:51.760]  sorry Isla Bryson to be able to claim and have it legally recognized after 30 years
[03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:56.640]  of being a man that they're now a woman and it is to not send convicted male rapists to
[03:10:56.640 --> 03:11:01.960]  female prisons full of women LGBT activists who supported the legislation that attempts
[03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:07.720]  to stop convicted sex offenders from being able to change their gender were transphobic
[03:11:07.720 --> 03:11:11.480]  the fact that sending a convicted rapist to a women's jail would be even considered shows
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:15.120]  how mad this has all become said Susan Smith the director with the four women's Scotland
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:20.080]  campaign group okay transfer note how the LGBT activists are not saying now these convicted
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:24.480]  criminals are just exploiting transgender identities to get more lenient treatment this is nothing
[03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:29.480]  to do with us don't conflate the two they're not saying that the LGBT activists are defending
[03:11:29.480 --> 03:11:35.600]  the right of the convicted criminal sex offenders to identify as transgender Bryson told the
[03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:40.840]  court that she expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for transgender surgery on the NHS
[03:11:40.840 --> 03:11:45.240]  she also revealed how as a young child she was quote always hanging about with the girls
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:50.960]  and always doing makeup obviously Isla was a girly girl from an early age I mean what
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:56.960]  kind of female princess doesn't one day dream of getting a Mike Tyson face tattoo similar
[03:11:56.960 --> 03:12:01.160]  cases to that of Mr Graham's convicted rapists claiming to be transgender to avoid being
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:13.840]  properly punished abound and yet the trans lobby continues to insist that their rights
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:14.840]  be protected.
[03:12:14.840 --> 03:12:18.760]  Well there you have it that was the situation as of yesterday with this case and again as
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:23.280]  I mentioned in the video the Scottish government has been vehemently lobbying lobbying for
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:29.400]  this gender identity law it was blocked it was even blocked in Westminster by Rishi Sunak
[03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:35.920]  the British Prime Minister so that's all going on in the background the LGBT activists actually
[03:12:35.920 --> 03:12:44.280]  lobbied for the protection of sex offenders convicted of rape to be able to transition
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:50.000]  or announced they've transitioned to be able to avoid a male prison now of course they're
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:57.240]  doing that purely out of self-interest and this individual has become the centre of
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:13:02.680]  this controversy now that was yesterday massive backlash built up overnight and then this
[03:13:02.680 --> 03:13:07.960]  morning we had this headline on summit.news and it changed very quickly after that.
[03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:12.160]  Scottish government refuses to remove convicted trans rapists from women's prison because
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:17.520]  again it made a complete mockery of this gender identity law which they're trying to pass
[03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:24.280]  so they actually stood by the Scottish government and the MPs in Parliament stood by sending
[03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:32.240]  this trans rapist this biological male rapist to what is by the way the only all female
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:38.600]  prison in Scotland in the entire country so they've only got one and he was sent to that
[03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:44.040]  prison because they couldn't back down because it would then render their gender identity
[03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:49.400]  bill completely ludicrous which is obviously what it is anyway but again this is from this
[03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:53.680]  morning despite a massive backlash the Scottish government is refusing to remove a transgender
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:59.520]  rapist from a female prison despite his conviction for raping two women.
[03:13:59.520 --> 03:14:06.240]  So they quoted in this ITN article Keith Brown Scotland's justice secretary who quote expressed
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:11.440]  faith in the Scottish prison services decision to place a transgender woman convicted of
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:17.680]  raping two women before she had transitioned yeah identified when he was on trial in a
[03:14:17.680 --> 03:14:22.760]  women's prison and then Nicola Sturgeon the first minister the leader of Scotland basically
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:27.840]  backed up that decision but it soon changed the pressure was too great that they had to
[03:14:27.840 --> 03:14:35.080]  finally back down daily mail now reporting transgender double rapist Isla Bryson and
[03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:40.080]  of course all these news outlets some of which are supposedly right-leaning conservative
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:46.760]  will graciously honour the pronouns of the convicted rapist every available opportunity.
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:52.440]  Isla Bryson Adam Graham a man will move from women's jail to a male prison within hours
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:58.560]  as Nicola Sturgeon makes humiliating U-turn purely because of media pressure but purely
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:04.640]  because of public pressure pressure by women's campaign groups they finally had to back down
[03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:08.880]  they wouldn't have backed down and now they're trying to present themselves as reasonable
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:15.160]  the same government that is going to give kids who are now 15 the opportunity once they've
[03:15:15.160 --> 03:15:19.840]  lived as a woman if they were born a man for six months to legally change their gender
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:28.040]  identity with no oversight no medical intervention no parental intervention they live as a woman
[03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:33.560]  for six months and on their 16th birthday they can become a woman no matter what's between
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:35.560]  their legs.
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:40.280]  When we come back though I'm going to talk more about the history of this new transgender
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:46.560]  icon Isla Bryson Adam Graham and his recent history we're also going to get into the

[03:20:21.360 --> 03:20:31.520]  so despite the insanity of scotland's gender identity laws i love rison real name adam
[03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:38.400]  graham a bloke with a penis who used it to rate two women will be moved to a male wing of a male
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:44.080]  prison on thursday afternoon they were gonna try and keep him in this women's prison as far as i
[03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:48.960]  could tell for another month at least because it was going to shut down anyway or at least be
[03:20:48.960 --> 03:20:52.880]  suspended because they're renovating it i think and the prisoners are going to be moved to another
[03:20:52.880 --> 03:20:57.440]  jail so they hoped that the story would have gone away by then but because of the sheer
[03:20:57.440 --> 03:21:02.880]  absolute relentless public pressure over this one story and bear in mind these kind of stories
[03:21:02.880 --> 03:21:07.840]  happen every week we see them pop up every week they're forgotten about by the next day this one
[03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:15.040]  finally got people's attention and now the individual the convicted rapist is being moved to a male
[03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:22.720]  prison of course claiming he identified as a girl from the age of four that claim has
[03:21:22.720 --> 03:21:28.960]  been completely rubbish by his estranged wife headline again out of the daily mail i married
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:34.480]  the man who became transgender rapist isla brison and think she only became a woman to get an easier
[03:21:34.480 --> 03:21:42.240]  time in jail well imagine my shock shona graham who married brison so she believes the transition
[03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:47.440]  is an act to make a mockery of the justice system well it's already a mockery doesn't really need
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:53.600]  any help in that regard does it she said quote never once did he say anything to me about feeling
[03:21:53.600 --> 03:21:58.320]  you was in the wrong body or anything i have a lot of sympathy for real transgender people it's
[03:21:58.320 --> 03:22:05.680]  a hard thing to live with but he's just blessing the authorities remember only claim to be transgender
[03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:12.800]  in 2020 after he was caught and on trial about to be found guilty of raping these two women
[03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:18.320]  she said his gender transition is a sham for attention and an easier life in prison
[03:22:18.320 --> 03:22:22.800]  i saw the photos of him dressed as a woman with a blonde wig and pink lycra leggings i fell out of
[03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:32.800]  the bed laughing yeah not not much effort has been made a bad wig some leggings and a pink suitcase
[03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:38.880]  makes your woman apparently now i can see why he doesn't want to be in prison with loads of big
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:44.160]  scary men yeah good luck with that so he's come up with this ploy to get himself a much easier
[03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:50.400]  sentence well that ploy has now unraveled and of course now the scottish government gets to pose
[03:22:50.400 --> 03:22:56.720]  as if it's all reasonable when they wanted the bill in the first place it's going to the courts
[03:22:56.720 --> 03:23:02.160]  they're going to struggle over it to allow basically kids to self identify with no intervention
[03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:10.320]  whatsoever no prognosis of gender dysphoria whatever that is at this point i can just say i'm a woman
[03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:15.200]  give me the documents i'm now a woman i have all the rights of a woman i can enter locker rooms
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:22.960]  public toilets as a woman i'm a woman because i've put on a bad wig some lycra leggings
[03:23:22.960 --> 03:23:30.560]  and a pink suitcase let me in the female changing rooms now there's a quite a common trend emerging
[03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:38.160]  here and we see it in this headline out of redux.info trans identified male teacher removed from
[03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:44.080]  middle school after encouraging sixth graders to follow his tiktok do you wonder why that was
[03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:51.680]  a trans identified male substitute teacher i don't even know if this is a man or woman
[03:23:51.680 --> 03:23:56.720]  i can't even figure it out was banned from king middle school in portland may in course at portland
[03:23:56.720 --> 03:24:02.640]  after sharing his highly sexualized tiktok account intentionally with students
[03:24:03.920 --> 03:24:10.160]  so i think this is a biological man identifying as a woman lydia lemare also known as chris
[03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:14.320]  wrote his tiktok handle on the whiteboard at the front of the classroom
[03:24:15.200 --> 03:24:23.120]  and encouraged students to check it out now again this gets to the root of the evil which is this
[03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:31.600]  trans lifestyle predatory behavior but also tiktok tiktok is now a haven for these pedos
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:37.280]  they've had massive investigations into this you've had traffic children who have gone missing
[03:24:37.280 --> 03:24:43.920]  and they turn up in tiktok videos tiktok is the central hub for all this demonic perversion
[03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:50.880]  and degeneracy and josh holey in fact has just introduced a bill to ban tiktok entirely in
[03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:55.120]  the united states don't know how they're going to get it off people's devices obviously not for
[03:24:55.120 --> 03:25:00.160]  that reason for the reason that china is using it to spy on us citizens it's already banned of
[03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:06.240]  course in many if not all military installations this is why it should be banned because it's the
[03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:12.800]  fulcrum it's the haven for pervs and nonces to try to exploit kids and this is yet another example
[03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:20.000]  of a trans identified individual trying to get close to kids substitute teacher then i then
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:26.800]  advertises his own perverted tiktok videos on a whiteboard in the classroom with the sixth graders
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:35.120]  there's a common trend emerging here in the uk manslaughter arrest after well-known drag queen
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:41.680]  darren moor found dead now of course any death is a tragedy but there's some very crucial details
[03:25:41.680 --> 03:25:49.040]  here which the mainstream media has left out of this report and in fact entirely so this drag queen
[03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:54.320]  was found dead they're already trying to hype it up as some transphobic hate crime transphobic
[03:25:54.320 --> 03:25:59.760]  murder on twitter the police are not releasing any details yet the man has been arrested on
[03:25:59.760 --> 03:26:04.640]  suspicion of manslaughter after a well-known drag queen was found dead in cardiff city centre now
[03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:13.280]  what they don't tell you about 39 year old darren moor is that he was convicted of raping a 14 year
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:19.360]  old boy well they don't tell you about darren moor is that he got up on stage and told jokes or made
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:28.240]  light of the behaviour of serial child abuser jimmy savill interesting that they don't include
[03:26:28.240 --> 03:26:34.240]  those details that he in fact after he was convicted for raping a 14 year old boy went and
[03:26:34.240 --> 03:26:41.040]  got a job in a school god knows how he got through the checks but he did as a gymnastics teacher
[03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:47.600]  he got caught again trying to get close to kids to carry out his perversions and he got
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:55.440]  another criminal sentence after that he became a representative for british airways at a gay
[03:26:55.440 --> 03:27:03.920]  pride parade he was also a rep or at least appeared at one of ruPaul's dragcon events
[03:27:03.920 --> 03:27:10.480]  in the united kingdom so again this individual with this criminal record of raping a minor
[03:27:10.480 --> 03:27:16.160]  trying what later on to get close to kids obviously to carry out his perversions once again
[03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:21.520]  he's been found dead they're going to play it up as a transphobic hate crime the reporting on it
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:27.840]  completely omits those details now this is interesting because tate gallery partly at
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:36.880]  least publicly funded art gallery in central london is having a drag queen event on the 11th
[03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:43.360]  of february now this drag queen event is being hosted by the founder of drag queen story time
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:48.320]  uk and in fact the video that we played earlier i get into that in the second half of the video
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:54.640]  which we didn't play but this individual is now fundraising to cover funeral costs for
[03:27:55.920 --> 03:28:02.400]  this drag queen who was killed and is calling him basically a fantastic human being once again
[03:28:02.400 --> 03:28:10.720]  omitting some key details that individual the founder of drag queen story time uk has posted
[03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:20.480]  tweets saying love has no age gee i wonder what that could mean hmm posted numerous other tweets
[03:28:20.480 --> 03:28:26.160]  in a similar context and this individual who again is now fundraising for a convicted pedophile
[03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:32.640]  is being hosted by tate gallery partly taxpayer funded for a drag queen event at which they're
[03:28:32.640 --> 03:28:40.080]  inviting kids to attend on february the 11th so some very interesting connections some very
[03:28:40.080 --> 03:28:46.800]  interesting patterns going on here in transworld with the whole lgbt movement and i've got one
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:51.600]  more story on that after the break which we'll get to then we'll talk about the latest on the

[03:33:36.640 --> 03:33:46.480]  joseph watson couple more bits on this transmania lgbt institutional takeover bear in mind that
[03:33:46.480 --> 03:33:53.440]  every major western government corporation and institution has now took the knee basically
[03:33:53.440 --> 03:34:00.080]  to this movement turned over every organ of propaganda to amplify its deranged agenda
[03:34:00.080 --> 03:34:05.600]  not only do we have our cities festooned with its flags on one weekend of the year it's basically
[03:34:05.600 --> 03:34:11.840]  now year round they're now seeping into the architecture of our daily life i posted on
[03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:20.800]  twitter last week barriers on escalators that are closed the barrier is the lgbt rainbow flag
[03:34:20.800 --> 03:34:29.200]  the doors on banks the entire door handle is now covered with a trans flag i walked past a atm
[03:34:30.240 --> 03:34:38.000]  cash machine in the center of town last weekend and an lgbt flag including the trans
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:43.840]  non-binary crap and whatever else they've added to it recently covered about half of the screen
[03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:48.480]  so when you go to get your cash out boom it's there once again it's everywhere
[03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:54.480]  what does an occupying army do once it conquers territory they put up their flag and this is
[03:34:54.480 --> 03:35:00.160]  the flag that we're all now supposed to worship but the characters the stories the behavior that it
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:08.880]  produces is completely morally abhorrent and we have another example here wisconsin parents
[03:35:08.880 --> 03:35:16.080]  outraged after finding queer porn in children's school library parents of children in shabuigan
[03:35:16.080 --> 03:35:21.680]  wisconsin i have no way to say that that's my best effort shabuigan demanded that the school
[03:35:21.680 --> 03:35:27.200]  districts remove several books from the libraries there after they discovered the material contained
[03:35:27.200 --> 03:35:34.320]  graphic gay pornographic images lovely nice wholesome stuff you really want that in your
[03:35:34.320 --> 03:35:39.440]  kids library don't you i'm not even going to talk about what it is i don't they are showing it
[03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:45.040]  it's blurred out but you can see what it is most interesting about this story though
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:52.080]  is the reaction from the lgbt community so several people oppose the decision to remove the books
[03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:57.280]  arguing that the move seems a harmful message to gay transgender and non-binary students
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:04.080]  so tolerate the gay books with the graphic homosexual sex scenes or you're a transphobic
[03:36:04.080 --> 03:36:14.240]  bigger they're not so tolerant in paris brightbart reports drag time story hour for kids cancelled
[03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:19.360]  by french mayor after backlash it's not actually in paris if it was in paris they'd celebrate it
[03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:23.760]  it the french mayor has cancelled a drag queen story time event for children after a backlash
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:29.520]  and reorientated the event for adults only after a petition against the event garnered around 5000
[03:36:29.520 --> 03:36:35.680]  signatures that is in toulouse which is a fairly big city in france so the backlash in some senses
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:42.640]  is growing in others though this cultural conquering continues apace as i mentioned before
[03:36:42.640 --> 03:36:48.720]  take gallery hosting the founder of drag queen story time despite the fact that he's fundraising for
[03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:57.440]  a convicted pedophile let's move on from all that do the phyza bombshell video which i'm sure
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:03.520]  alex has covered at length earlier on in the show daily skeptic reports phyza doing gain of function
[03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:09.680]  research to mutate covet and make more vaccine says phyza executive and of course you've seen the
[03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:16.800]  video by now this cackling director of research and development demonically laughing as he explains
[03:37:16.800 --> 03:37:23.280]  quote one of the things we phyza are exploring is why don't we just mutate it covet ourselves
[03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:29.760]  so we could create preemptively develop new vaccines i was interested in about this story
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:35.040]  posted on the daily skeptic as that it was cross posted or at least they've quoted a big section
[03:37:35.680 --> 03:37:42.160]  out of a daily mail article and when you click on that link to the daily mail the original article
[03:37:42.160 --> 03:37:47.840]  is gone and in fact i made a short video about this earlier today let's get to it right now it's
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:55.040]  called they buried it let's roll the clip how is this not the biggest news story in the world today
[03:37:55.040 --> 03:38:01.040]  project veritas just released an undercover video featuring jordan tristan walker a phyza director
[03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:07.360]  of research and development and well i'll let mr walker do the explaining himself phyza ultimately
[03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:14.000]  is thinking about mutating covet well that's not what we say to the public no don't tell anyone
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:21.280]  the story you know the virus keeps mutating yeah well one of the things we're exploring is like
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:25.760]  why don't we just mutate ourselves so we could both thought we could preemptively develop new
[03:38:25.760 --> 03:38:29.920]  vaccines right so we have to do that if we're going to do that though that's a risk of like
[03:38:29.920 --> 03:38:34.800]  as you could imagine no one wants to be having a pharma company mutating five or six
[03:38:34.800 --> 03:38:38.720]  we like very controlled to make sure that this virus that you use it doesn't create something
[03:38:38.720 --> 03:38:43.600]  like you know it goes everywhere it's so crazy is the way that the virus started it would happen
[03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:47.920]  to be honest like it's it makes no sense that this virus is up out of nowhere like yeah i know
[03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:53.920]  incredible probably the biggest story of the year so far or it would be if we had an honest media
[03:38:53.920 --> 03:38:58.240]  you know the kind of media that doesn't take billions in advertising from big pharma every
[03:38:58.240 --> 03:39:05.200]  single year 6.6 billion in tv ads alone at the last count as is to be expected mr walker responded
[03:39:05.200 --> 03:39:10.000]  to the release of the video by deleting his linkedin account but way more concerning is this
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:15.600]  mainstream news outlets that picked up the story and now deleting it to the Daily Mail covered the
[03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:20.640]  story and said they had quote reached out to Pfizer for common well whatever Pfizer said to them
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:25.600]  must have made some impression because when you go to click on the Daily Mail link to the story
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:30.960]  poof it's gone it just takes you back to the main page of their website they deleted the story
[03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:36.240]  why there's nothing wrong with it it is what it is did they get a call who from the FDA is now
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:41.280]  proposing Americans be given a new covid booster vaccine every autumn every year they want to make
[03:39:41.280 --> 03:39:47.840]  it as routine as the annual flu shot after its mRNA vaccine captured 70% of us and european markets
[03:39:47.840 --> 03:39:55.680]  Pfizer's 2021 revenue was double its 2020 revenue that profit included nearly 37 billion dollars in
[03:39:55.680 --> 03:40:00.960]  sales solely from the covid vaccine the big pharma companies profits are expected to have jumped by an
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:08.480]  order of magnitude again for 2022 with revenue soaring to over 100 billion dollars as walker
[03:40:08.480 --> 03:40:13.520]  himself acknowledges in the project veritas clip that's nice work if you can get it either way it's
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:18.000]  going to be a cash cow go there's probably a cash cow for us for a while going for it well yeah i
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:25.200]  obviously right and it's very important to keep these numbers up Pfizer needs to continually sell
[03:40:25.200 --> 03:40:30.640]  more and more vaccines so i guess we're going to need more viruses yeah where are they coming from
[03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:38.880]  you be the judge and now in a completely unrelated story this just broke about an hour ago former
[03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:45.840]  nfl player jessie lomonie dies suddenly age 25 well i guess that's routine now it happens almost
[03:40:45.840 --> 03:40:52.320]  every day so move along no questions asked australians were once prosecuted for claiming
[03:40:52.320 --> 03:40:58.800]  face masks worked against viruses this of course in australia the most draconian lockdown country
[03:40:58.800 --> 03:41:05.520]  in the world where they literally choked people in the streets for not wearing face masks they sent
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:11.600]  up drones to track if people weren't wearing face masks or not outdoors the government did
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:18.640]  of course they put people in covid camps well australians who tried to sell surgical face masks
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:24.720]  on the back of claims they worked against viruses back in the early 2000s were threatened with
[03:41:24.720 --> 03:41:31.600]  prosecution a massive fines by the government this is documented in a sydney morning herald
[03:41:31.600 --> 03:41:41.040]  article titled false mask it's only safe for 20 minutes they knew this in 2003 there's retailers
[03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:46.800]  who cash in on community fears about sars which of course was the big viral outbreak at the time
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:53.600]  by exaggerating the health benefits of surgical masks could face fines of up to 110 000 australian
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:59.840]  dollars and in this article they quote health experts as saying that basically masks don't work
[03:41:59.840 --> 03:42:04.400]  they might work temporarily for 20 minutes but you'd have to constantly change them multiple
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:10.880]  times an hour and in fact because they collect moisture droplets basically a petri dish for
[03:42:10.880 --> 03:42:17.760]  germs you're constantly touching it that they could make the viral spread even worse that was
[03:42:17.760 --> 03:42:24.320]  acknowledged back in 2003 of course it was also acknowledged that face masks didn't work right at
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:30.880]  the start of the covid outbreak antony found she was exchanging emails with numerous people stating

[03:47:03.280 --> 03:47:15.200]  it's alex jones you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[03:47:15.200 --> 03:47:23.360]  now i'm going to get to the news stories over the past couple of days about the
[03:47:23.360 --> 03:47:29.200]  wondrous benefits of cultural enrichment which continues to impact europe with its bouncer
[03:47:29.200 --> 03:47:38.240]  full joys but first i'm going to go to this video because japan has been lambasted scorned demonized
[03:47:38.240 --> 03:47:46.320]  monstered by the legacy media for not embracing mass migration and boy we wonder why let's go to
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:54.480]  this clip it's called no thank you the bbc has published an article lambasting japan for not
[03:47:54.480 --> 03:47:59.920]  copying other first world countries by importing millions of migrants from the third world japan
[03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:04.720]  was the future but it stuck in the past they blasted the japanese for refusing immigration
[03:48:04.720 --> 03:48:09.360]  and maintaining the patriarchy for maintaining strict border controls for demanding newcomers
[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:14.240]  integrate with their way of life for rejecting immigration as a solution to falling fertility
[03:48:14.240 --> 03:48:19.360]  for only about three percent of japan's population being foreign born compared to 15 percent in the
[03:48:19.360 --> 03:48:24.560]  uk much of the rest of the article laments the horror of japan having low affordable property
[03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:30.080]  prices oh no how awful how dare the japanese not have to wait until they're almost middle age before
[03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:35.040]  they can afford to scrape together the deposit to buy a house or a giant mortgage what's funny
[03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:41.200]  about this article is that the reasons why japan rejected mass immigration are explicitly spelled
[03:48:41.200 --> 03:48:45.920]  out in the article itself it's a peaceful prosperous country with the longest life expectancy in the
[03:48:45.920 --> 03:48:51.520]  world the lowest murder rate little political conflict it's a beautiful place japan still feels
[03:48:51.520 --> 03:48:56.400]  like japan well there's your answer that'll be why they won't it the japanese may struggle with real
[03:48:56.400 --> 03:49:02.160]  wage growth but japan is still the world's third largest economy japan may have sacrificed a small
[03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:08.560]  amount of its gdp to maintain its soul and identity as a country but would the majority of the population
[03:49:08.560 --> 03:49:14.000]  in any major western country swap with them yeah of course they would in a heartbeat i mean ask the
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:20.080]  french in the name of keeping up gdp numbers they vastly accelerated the importation of migrants is
[03:49:20.080 --> 03:49:36.000]  it worth it you be the judge
[03:49:43.760 --> 03:49:48.800]  official crime data shows 48 percent of all crimes in paris were committed by foreigners
[03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:53.760]  entire suburbs have been completely taken over by migrant crime gangs police firefighters
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:58.560]  ambulance workers refuse to even enter these areas migrant youths routinely stage riots
[03:49:58.560 --> 03:50:02.640]  violent crime and terror attacks are a common occurrence not the kind of problems you'll
[03:50:02.640 --> 03:50:09.360]  encounter in tokyo or asaka yeah try telling the japanese diversity is a strength uh no thanks you
[03:50:09.360 --> 03:50:18.080]  can keep it so let's see how diversity cultural enrichment has been unfolding in europe over
[03:50:18.080 --> 03:50:25.840]  the past few days and why japan might not be so bigoted to reject it of course it's just broke
[03:50:25.840 --> 03:50:32.160]  in the past hour that we have this bombing attempt outside a hospital in leeds the city in northern
[03:50:32.160 --> 03:50:39.040]  england the perpetrator has been identified as mohammed furuk the old british name in spain
[03:50:39.600 --> 03:50:46.160]  remix news reports one dead several injured in spanish church machete massacre of course we've
[03:50:46.160 --> 03:50:53.040]  had numerous church attacks in france priests being beheaded well now at least one person
[03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:57.680]  has died and several others were injured following a machete attack at two spanish churches on
[03:50:57.680 --> 03:51:03.440]  wednesday evening the priest was attacked and sustained serious injuries to his neck
[03:51:03.440 --> 03:51:08.480]  looks like they were trying to behead him once again local police confirm the arrest of a moroccan
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:14.480]  national in his 30s the case is being treated as a terrorist incident meanwhile in germany
[03:51:14.480 --> 03:51:21.520]  a knife man who killed two injured several on german train is syrian migrant several deaths
[03:51:21.520 --> 03:51:25.840]  and further injuries were reported on a german regional railwell service allegedly at the hand
[03:51:25.840 --> 03:51:30.480]  of a syrian migrant local media claimed on wednesday afternoon two people are known dead
[03:51:30.480 --> 03:51:36.400]  several people injured after the stabbing attack on a train traveling between hamburg and keel
[03:51:37.440 --> 03:51:43.440]  meanwhile in paris churches targeted by arson attacks three times within days two churches
[03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:47.440]  in the city of paris has been subjected to arson attacks over the period several days of police
[03:51:47.440 --> 03:51:52.160]  have yet to arrest any suspect linked to the fires of course basically for the past 10 years we've
[03:51:52.160 --> 03:51:58.000]  had a spay of church attacks we had the burning down of the notched am cathedral which wasn't
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:04.160]  suspicious at all of course berlin has 10 times more crime than war saw gee i wonder what the
[03:52:04.160 --> 03:52:09.760]  difference is between those two cities says polish consul in berlin while issuing new travel warning
[03:52:09.760 --> 03:52:17.200]  to tourists meanwhile ethnic germans are dying out and migrants will inherit germany claims
[03:52:17.200 --> 03:52:23.120]  iranian writer in one of germany's biggest newspapers this is an individual who was
[03:52:23.120 --> 03:52:28.800]  reacting to the riots on new year's eve in numerous german cities by gangs of migrant youths
[03:52:31.200 --> 03:52:36.080]  foreign origin of course the culprits the german iranian author of this article
[03:52:36.080 --> 03:52:41.280]  published by the german media says they're fueled by historical racism yes throwing fireworks in
[03:52:41.280 --> 03:52:48.880]  people's faces throwing hand grenades at people burning cars in massive numbers across cities
[03:52:48.880 --> 03:52:55.040]  that's because of your racism he asserts that regardless of what germans think about the riots
[03:52:55.600 --> 03:53:00.160]  migrants are not only going to stay in the country but will eventually inherit germany from ethnic
[03:53:00.160 --> 03:53:07.120]  germans who are dying off that's why they call it re colonization or reverse colonization
[03:53:08.080 --> 03:53:14.080]  meanwhile nearly 400 illegals land on british beaches as government's rwanda scheme is delayed
[03:53:14.080 --> 03:53:20.480]  again saw a video earlier today of a migrant in a hotel again they're being put up in four five star
[03:53:20.480 --> 03:53:26.400]  hotels being given food being given free health care when the nhs is basically on its knees
[03:53:26.400 --> 03:53:33.360]  free cash meanwhile our own pensioners are dying because they can't afford to heat their own homes
[03:53:33.920 --> 03:53:40.000]  in this video this migrant basically had a fit and complained because he didn't get his breakfast
[03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:45.280]  on time so that's just a snapshot of cultural enrichment as it applies in europe today now do
[03:53:45.280 --> 03:53:53.120]  you kind of realize why japan has shied away from it let's go to this next video now this is again
[03:53:53.120 --> 03:53:58.320]  one of the absolutely ludicrous developments that we've had in terms of woke nonsense in the
[03:53:58.320 --> 03:54:04.640]  uk over the past week this is called black boy lane let's roll it well in case you missed it
[03:54:04.640 --> 03:54:10.960]  they just solved racism in the uk you see this road in london was called black boy lane and that
[03:54:10.960 --> 03:54:15.920]  was racist nobody really knew why it was racist it just kind of felt racist and after the black
[03:54:15.920 --> 03:54:21.440]  lives matter riots local authorities decided it had to go despite the vast majority of the
[03:54:21.440 --> 03:54:27.200]  residents of black boy lane opposing the change including 100 of the black residents of black
[03:54:27.200 --> 03:54:32.240]  boy lane lucky for them city corn and haringay council were fully prepared to be offended on
[03:54:32.240 --> 03:54:41.600]  their behalf so the sign was changed at a cost to the taxpayer of 186 000 pounds yes 186 000
[03:54:41.600 --> 03:54:47.440]  pounds 50 000 pounds was spent on a support and administration officer to help the residents who
[03:54:47.440 --> 03:54:55.280]  were affected 50 000 on what therapy still it was all a small price to end racism right oh yeah i almost
[03:54:55.280 --> 03:55:00.720]  forgot the sign still has black boy lane written on it and several residents of black boy lane
[03:55:00.720 --> 03:55:04.960]  including presumably the black residents who opposed the change full pop signs outside the
[03:55:04.960 --> 03:55:09.520]  houses that say black boy lane and now the new name on the sign has been graffiti over probably
[03:55:09.520 --> 03:55:14.160]  by one of the black residents of black boy lane but i'm sure they'll claim that's racist too all in
[03:55:14.160 --> 03:55:23.040]  all a stunning victory for anti-racism i'm sure you'll agree let's hit some final news stories
[03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:28.400]  now in the final couple of minutes u.s weapons manufacturers enjoy soaring profits thanks to
[03:55:28.400 --> 03:55:33.600]  the current thing the war in ukraine state department records show u.s weapons sales to
[03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:41.920]  other countries rose from 103 billion in 2021 that wasn't enough to 153 billion in 2022 and of course
[03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:48.720]  that's going to rise continually Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Raytheon among those
[03:55:48.720 --> 03:55:55.600]  financially benefiting and then we have this today top us arms maker ready to provide Kiev or Kiev
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:56:00.960]  with f-16s this is Lockheed Martin basically saying we can provide all the f-16s you need to
[03:56:00.960 --> 03:56:07.840]  germany poland whoever it is to continue to prolong this war german foreign minister declares war on
[03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:14.000]  Russia then we had this which is also related to the current thing the government in the uk in
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:21.200]  pursuit of net zero climate change alarmism is paying people not to use electricity national
[03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:27.120]  grid made energy requests to europe to help to avert blackouts across the southeast of england
[03:56:27.120 --> 03:56:32.720]  after network fault so this is our lifestyle the reduction of our living standards that's
[03:56:32.720 --> 03:56:38.720]  increasingly going to be felt with the race towards net zero they call it net zero because
[03:56:38.720 --> 03:56:43.760]  that's what your bank account looks like at the end of it after all your carbon credits have been
[03:56:43.760 --> 03:56:50.080]  used up and in this article they brazenly admit it says quote one million homes and businesses
[03:56:50.080 --> 03:56:54.560]  have rushed to sign up to a scheme that pays them to turn off washing machines ovens dishwashers and
[03:56:54.560 --> 03:57:01.040]  even the lights craig dyke who leads the operation has refused to rule out using the world leading
[03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:08.000]  scheme every winter saying it will drive forward towards net zero asked if it could become a feature
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:14.160]  of british life each winter mr. dyke told the bbc it's something we strongly believe in this is
[03:57:14.160 --> 03:57:19.920]  the start of something much much bigger so they want you in the cold they want you in the dark
[03:57:19.920 --> 03:57:26.080]  and they want you literally powerless the government paying people not to use electricity
[03:57:26.080 --> 03:57:32.640]  in pursuit of this net zero climate change madness and they brazenly admit it all in the article
[03:57:32.640 --> 03:57:37.920]  on the same day that it was revealed that a pensioner has died in his own home because he
