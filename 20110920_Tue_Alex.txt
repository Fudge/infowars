[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:41.600]  Texas Alex Jones it is September 20th 2011 I'm Alex Jones your host we're
[00:41.600 --> 00:53.160]  going to be live here for the next three hours I have again ladies and
[00:53.160 --> 01:03.320]  gentlemen it is September 20th 2011 and we're going to be live here for the
[01:03.320 --> 01:10.360]  next three hours I have been out of town on slash investigation slash spending
[01:10.360 --> 01:21.760]  time with my family for the last few days and have waxed reflective and I'm
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.680]  really going to officially kick off the news and analysis portion of this
[01:26.680 --> 01:37.920]  transmission today starting in the second and third hour I want to be calm
[01:37.920 --> 01:51.760]  and focused coming up in the second hour and I want to get into Gardasil and
[01:51.760 --> 01:56.840]  exactly what Gardasil stands for the fact that we have had a victory that it
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.600]  is now become a major issue in the presidential campaign and the
[02:01.600 --> 02:05.720]  establishment's been forced to run a hoax claiming that no one has been damaged
[02:05.720 --> 02:11.320]  by it they have miscalculated grievously so we're going to be exposing that as
[02:11.320 --> 02:18.800]  best I can also Democratic Party minions and operatives in the Chicago
[02:18.800 --> 02:24.200]  Tribune Washington Post and other publications have been calling for
[02:24.200 --> 02:30.600]  Barack Obama to step down and to not run for reelection so they can put a new
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.760]  puppet in and kind of bamboozle and sucker people into thinking there's
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.200]  going to be change out of the establishment two-party dictatorship
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.840]  and here's the headline of the Chicago Tribune while Obama should withdraw
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.800]  there's another one liberals vow to challenge Obama in Democratic primaries
[02:48.800 --> 02:59.280]  that's out of the Washington Times that is all coming up today now Ed
[02:59.280 --> 03:03.960]  Asner is joining us for the balance of the hour coming up after this break he
[03:03.960 --> 03:08.640]  really needs no introduction he's the former head of the screen actors
[03:08.640 --> 03:12.680]  Guild recently he was one of the big voices in a great movie that was
[03:12.680 --> 03:17.560]  actually very family friendly the movie up big fan of that animated Pixar
[03:17.560 --> 03:22.640]  specials but he won't be here joining us today to talk about Hollywood too much
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.640]  though I might bring up a few of his films that I admire like well JFK Wow
[03:27.640 --> 03:36.440]  what a what a great role he played in that as a government operative so Ed
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.400]  Asner is coming up to get into 9-11 truth to get into Gardasil vaccines the
[03:41.400 --> 03:47.200]  two-party dictatorship and a lot more he is scheduled to join us for the balance
[03:47.200 --> 03:52.320]  of the hour and then I need your help in the second hour I mean I really need
[03:52.320 --> 03:59.640]  you to listen pay attention and take notes on this Gardasil issue because I
[03:59.640 --> 04:06.400]  get blindsided all the time and I was listening to the show Friday when Mike
[04:06.400 --> 04:12.480]  Adams had a medical doctor on and they were talking about forced inoculations
[04:12.480 --> 04:17.520]  basically where they don't need parental consent in California this bill is now on
[04:17.520 --> 04:22.280]  the desk of the governor to inject the children they just show them films and
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.560]  rain wash them and say do you consent and then basically give the children the
[04:26.560 --> 04:32.720]  deadly Gardasil shot and the parents even very young children don't have any
[04:32.720 --> 04:37.360]  say in that this is so evil on so many fronts and really a precedent setting
[04:37.360 --> 04:42.280]  case it's all about eugenics and population reduction so we're going to
[04:42.280 --> 04:46.560]  be going over that the second hour but Ed Asner is straight ahead and we've
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.080]  also got this you in vote coming up with a Palestinian state and we've got a lot

[08:05.520 --> 08:08.440]  radio network
[08:08.440 --> 08:27.400]  well to say we have an icon on with us for the balance of the hour today is
[08:27.400 --> 08:36.400]  putting it lightly he's ed asner a long time head of the screen actors guild he
[08:36.400 --> 08:41.040]  of course is one of the biggest television stars in history with the
[08:41.040 --> 08:45.720]  Mary Tyler Moore show and it's been off Lou Grant he also was one of the main
[08:45.720 --> 08:52.920]  voices in my favorite animated film Pixar's award-winning animated feature
[08:52.920 --> 08:59.320]  up which is 100% wholesome effect when I saw it I was like wow no no anti family
[08:59.320 --> 09:04.760]  anti-liberty globalist messages in this and of course he's also working and
[09:04.760 --> 09:10.120]  returning television as a butcher Hank Greziak I think I'm pronouncing it in
[09:10.120 --> 09:15.880]  working class the first original sitcom on cable channel CMT and there's no way
[09:15.880 --> 09:22.440]  to really go over all of the long bio of Edward Asner known as Ed Asner but he
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.720]  is with us today he's also very eclectic you know the media tries to put him in
[09:26.720 --> 09:31.440]  this in this box of oh you know just a Hollywood liberal well you know we're
[09:31.440 --> 09:34.600]  outside the box here it's not about liberal or conservative it's about right
[09:34.600 --> 09:38.080]  and wrong and he knows about the population control program he's been
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.320]  here and talked about it you know he's been fighting and speaking out against
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.680]  the dangers of many vaccines and of course he has the courage from for many
[09:45.680 --> 09:50.800]  years to talk about 9-11 truth and he's now put out an amazing little 15-minute
[09:50.800 --> 09:54.680]  piece that we've got linked at info wars.com with architecture engineers for
[09:54.680 --> 09:59.440]  9-11 truth where he talks about the 1500 plus architecture engineers and the
[09:59.440 --> 10:02.840]  fact that no modern steel building has ever collapsed like they did until the
[10:02.840 --> 10:08.160]  day of 9-11 looking at building 7 so he joins us here in the next 50 minutes
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.280]  Mr. Asner great to have you thank you Alex it's a pleasure to be back with you
[10:12.280 --> 10:15.720]  you know we were talking right before he went live and I said what do you want to
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.360]  get into first I threw out a few issues you said Alex you're so eclectic you
[10:19.360 --> 10:23.000]  just lead but that's really the same thing I'd say to you they try to put me
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.240]  in a box they try to put you in a box out of the gates who is Ed Asner what
[10:27.240 --> 10:33.240]  have you always really stood for socialism okay so break that down for
[10:33.240 --> 10:42.240]  us well we we are in such such a confused state in this in this country
[10:42.240 --> 10:48.840]  right now with the Tea Party leading the Republican intransigence fighting
[10:48.840 --> 10:55.080]  Obama on anything they can't tax the rich that that type of crap if we were
[10:55.080 --> 11:01.120]  back to the taxes of Eisenhower where this country would be in so much better
[11:01.120 --> 11:07.200]  shape I wonder what you know all those Republicans out there can remember that
[11:07.200 --> 11:12.800]  and if we don't start taxing the rich and trying to make up some of this
[11:12.800 --> 11:16.640]  deficit then we're fools
[11:16.640 --> 11:29.080]  elaborate on that elaborate sure any any approach on taxes that you find is is
[11:29.080 --> 11:37.600]  that the the rich have gotten more and more leniency in terms of acts in
[11:37.600 --> 11:47.880]  Congress the offshore companies are not are not lambasted at all they have not
[11:47.880 --> 11:53.880]  made any effort at taxing offshore companies to any extent it is it is on
[11:53.880 --> 12:02.000]  it there their single drive is to cut entitlements cut your Medicare cut your
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.080]  Medi-Cal whatever that may be to even invade Social Security if they have the
[12:08.080 --> 12:14.680]  guts to but or or or they they had enough of an audience it's taking it from
[12:14.680 --> 12:19.640]  the middle class and the poor and that's how they hope to balance that they
[12:19.640 --> 12:30.120]  want to as as Robert Nordquist that phenomenal dragon who heads the anti
[12:30.120 --> 12:36.800]  tax groups in this country said he wants to reduce government so it's on its
[12:36.800 --> 12:42.200]  knees so it's starting well I believe in big government as long as it is not
[12:42.200 --> 12:49.680]  corrupt as long as the people keep it from being delivering and and creating
[12:49.680 --> 12:57.600]  jobs and creating education and in the present instance creating health and
[12:57.600 --> 13:06.680]  47 million people in this country are now classified as poor or or or living
[13:06.680 --> 13:14.120]  less than poor 47 million out of 300 million that's a shocking terrible
[13:14.120 --> 13:21.360]  statistic and if that's what capitalism gives us then to hell with it now Ed
[13:21.360 --> 13:28.240]  again I admire you because you have exposed the dangers of vaccines and the
[13:28.240 --> 13:35.120]  fact that these companies are given immunity you have exposed globalist
[13:35.120 --> 13:40.160]  population reduction programs you have exposed the inside job it's 9-11 you
[13:40.160 --> 13:45.080]  have a lot of courage you definitely are a smart guy obviously and you believe in
[13:45.080 --> 13:50.840]  what you're saying but navigating this this this ice flow you know in the good
[13:50.840 --> 13:58.840]  ship USS Republic look I understand that if men were angels and and and our
[13:58.840 --> 14:02.960]  better selves were helping share the wealth and knowledge that does make
[14:02.960 --> 14:10.840]  society better I understand that in its purest idea the idea of of of socialism
[14:10.840 --> 14:17.640]  would be good but but but here's the problem the crony capitalist who were
[14:17.640 --> 14:22.000]  not free market they actually will lobby for big government programs because
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.880]  they can control and lobby government and end up giving themselves the money
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.120]  and use it to shut down their competition and then exempt themselves
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.520]  take General Electric to head of the president's council their former head
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.400]  taken the jobs to China and other places well trying to put regulations in that
[14:38.400 --> 14:45.360]  shut down our jobs or take take all the other corporate welfare see see that's
[14:45.360 --> 14:52.280]  my issue is that is that these social systems I mean look at the Soviet Union
[14:52.280 --> 14:58.640]  look at look at any of these other examples you it's just we trade out one
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.240]  group of criminals and then even if you have well many people up front they
[15:02.240 --> 15:06.000]  always get thrown out and a new group of crooks come in so that's why I believe
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.680]  in local control and then diversity of control because then you can find a town
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.080]  or a county or a city or a state that is more to your liking and I just don't
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.360]  see socialism ever working now now I don't want to digress into this whole
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.760]  debate you're certainly correct that right now we have all the socialism for
[15:25.760 --> 15:30.360]  the rich they take our money our labor our infrastructure amass it they make
[15:30.360 --> 15:36.160]  themselves exempt that the middle class pays high taxes but most of Fortune
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.600]  100 or 100% exempt as you know my issue is is them and I hear about a new
[15:41.600 --> 15:47.280]  tax plan it's not the tax Google or General Electric it's the tax you know
[15:47.280 --> 15:51.920]  the guy down the street making $125,000 a year now now that's a mouthful Mr.
[15:51.920 --> 16:02.760]  Asher but what's your view on it well my my view is that because of a clerk's
[16:02.760 --> 16:10.000]  reading a Supreme Court clerk's reading in the 1880s something
[16:10.000 --> 16:20.320]  corporations have been been regarded as individuals and they have gotten a
[16:20.320 --> 16:25.720]  free ride ever since it's only because of that court clerk's ruling and all
[16:25.720 --> 16:31.560]  justice has been delivered in terms of viewing corporations in that life we've
[16:31.560 --> 16:36.480]  got to reach a point where the Supreme Court says the corporations are an
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.160]  individual and they can contribute to political campaigns and and it's
[16:42.160 --> 16:50.560]  regarded as free speech well no no one man or or group of men can compete with
[16:50.560 --> 16:56.120]  what a corporation can contribute to a campaign to a candidate and corporations
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.520]  live forever and are exempt from the rules that they have more rights than an
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.600]  individual founding fathers even there were some of the founding fathers who
[17:05.600 --> 17:11.520]  even spoke of the beware fight the corporations they were troubled by the
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.160]  power of corporations and wanted to limit them and it's been a losing battle
[17:16.160 --> 17:22.120]  ever since we are now at the worst stage of this this corporate
[17:22.120 --> 17:28.760]  licentiousness this corporate freedom corporate fascism yes exactly and I
[17:28.760 --> 17:34.360]  would say that the majority of our wars are a spedly butler put it best about
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.720]  all of his campaigns in Central America and South America and the and the fact
[17:39.720 --> 17:44.280]  that he did it for this bank or that corporation or this one we've been
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.600]  fighting the corporations ever since and when will this country and its so-called
[17:49.600 --> 17:55.760]  representatives wake up to realize that the socialism I talk about is a
[17:55.760 --> 18:05.320]  control on obscene profits a fair tax on profits and we would not be in the
[18:05.320 --> 18:11.720]  mess we're in now and above all Eisenhower's warning about the military
[18:11.720 --> 18:17.040]  industrial complex certainly didn't last long did it look at the wars we're
[18:17.040 --> 18:22.960]  engaged in the look at look at the the oil companies that we are enslaved to
[18:22.960 --> 18:31.640]  it's it's it that my only issue is is that it is that the politicians of the
[18:31.640 --> 18:36.200]  two-party dictatorship the two twins are bought and paid for by these interests
[18:36.200 --> 18:40.240]  and so no matter what you try to do to the government it only gives them more
[18:40.240 --> 18:45.240]  power and and and and so that's my that's my issue is it's almost like the
[18:45.240 --> 18:50.520]  ring of Mordor and and that's how I see socialism yes there's been philosopher
[18:50.520 --> 18:55.320]  kings that actually spent the largesse and created education and and created
[18:55.320 --> 19:00.600]  civilizations but those are rare and they almost always you know hand over power
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.160]  to someone worse than them and then worse than them and so it's like the ring
[19:04.160 --> 19:08.760]  of Mordor I mean Ed you know that ring and they offer it to Gandalf and he
[19:08.760 --> 19:13.000]  says no I'd try to use this for good and it would only be turned to evil that's

[24:18.120 --> 24:23.780]  segment coming up I want to get into the plan destruction of Obama we we told
[24:23.780 --> 24:27.000]  you this would happen in the Obama deception when he had an 85 percent
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.240]  approval rating but now the Democrats are getting ready to flush him down the
[24:30.240 --> 24:34.880]  political tubes because they want to give you a new puppet and on the right
[24:34.880 --> 24:39.680]  we have Rick Perry to save us a total theater but you know people are getting
[24:39.680 --> 24:43.880]  wise to these puppets quicker and quicker so we'll get Ed's view on that
[24:43.880 --> 24:47.160]  coming up in the next segment get into Gardasil that I'm doing a big special
[24:47.160 --> 24:51.400]  report on in the next hour and on the nightly news tonight 7 o'clock central
[24:51.400 --> 24:59.800]  again legend Ed Asner joins us of films like JFK TV and Mary Tyler Moore one
[24:59.800 --> 25:03.640]  of the best films I think is one of the main voices in the movie up as an
[25:03.640 --> 25:07.160]  incredible job this is a short segment Ed but we're gonna come out of break and
[25:07.160 --> 25:11.440]  play a few minutes of the special presentation you did for architects and
[25:11.440 --> 25:16.660]  engineers but wow they have really put on an amazing case what do you think the
[25:16.660 --> 25:24.960]  biggest smoking gun of 9-11 is well building seven building seven being
[25:24.960 --> 25:35.200]  brought down without having been damaged to that extent now am I strong yes sir
[25:35.200 --> 25:42.640]  if you know the amazing thing about about 9-11 in his totality is that this
[25:42.640 --> 25:47.440]  greatest country in the world with the greatest strongest defense in the world
[25:47.440 --> 25:56.440]  have this horrendous obscenity done to them on 9-11 so we supposedly had
[25:56.440 --> 26:03.440]  gatekeepers watchmen protecting us why has not one single person been punished
[26:03.440 --> 26:11.200]  for the flaws that occurred in 9-11 I mean there is no guilty person in
[26:11.200 --> 26:16.800]  America is there they made the Japanese Prime Minister resign the heads of Tokyo
[26:16.800 --> 26:23.040]  Electric heads rolled in Japan some people committed suicide over it yeah
[26:23.040 --> 26:27.720]  but but here they got promoted for standing down Ed doing a great job
[26:27.720 --> 26:37.240]  brownie yeah Fema mm-hmm so what does that tell you I guess they're doing the
[26:37.240 --> 26:41.840]  job they want I think that they want to make sure nobody nobody shoots their
[26:41.840 --> 26:49.880]  mouth off and if eventually they do then the probably end up dead well that's
[26:49.880 --> 26:54.560]  another good point building seven is the is for me the big smoking gun you've
[26:54.560 --> 26:58.440]  done this great presentation that's at the architects for engineers architects
[26:58.440 --> 27:04.720]  and engineers final event with sight I'm just incredible big-time architects now
[27:04.720 --> 27:09.400]  major skyscraper architects are now going public as you know yeah yeah
[27:09.400 --> 27:18.600]  physicists engineers architect 1500 of and are these all fools these highly
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.280]  educated people then they may not be the the leading architects in the country
[27:24.280 --> 27:32.520]  but boy they share our are aware of the conditions of 9-11 well some of them now
[27:32.520 --> 27:35.680]  and in the video in the video interviews I'm seeing are some of the
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.840]  leading architectural engineers and architects in the country it's just
[27:40.840 --> 27:44.520]  amazing but I don't have to be an architect or engineer to know that when
[27:44.520 --> 27:48.400]  I see seeing in footage of police saying get back they're gonna bring that
[27:48.400 --> 27:51.840]  building down and Larry Silverstein says they gave the order to pull it and I
[27:51.840 --> 27:56.800]  could see blast points going off as it falls at freefall and this says no it
[27:56.800 --> 27:59.920]  wasn't freefall only controlled demolition can do that and now they
[27:59.920 --> 28:06.640]  have to admit the building did fall at freefall and well well you know listen
[28:06.640 --> 28:13.360]  I I've reached the top 9-11 and I come across good American burgers and
[28:13.360 --> 28:19.040]  educated people middle-class people and when I bring up 9-11 they don't want to
[28:19.040 --> 28:23.040]  know that the emperor has no clothes they don't want to know that there is no
[28:23.040 --> 28:28.440]  Santa Claus they don't want to know they want to believe further in the
[28:28.440 --> 28:35.960]  American myth that we can do no wrong that we would not do such heinous acts as
[28:35.960 --> 28:43.360]  participate in some way to the destruction that occurred in 9-11
[28:43.360 --> 28:48.280]  well now we learn that Amaral Alaki two weeks after 9-11 when he was on the most
[28:48.280 --> 28:52.720]  wanted list number three in al-qaeda was meeting secretly at the Pentagon with
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.760]  the secretary of the army Ed oh really I didn't know that yeah that's even an
[28:57.760 --> 29:01.160]  associated press came out a few months ago but didn't really get any attention
[29:01.160 --> 29:07.640]  that's pretty suspicious well do people even wonder why Osama bin Laden was not
[29:07.640 --> 29:16.000]  on the FBI wanted list for 9-11 do people even realize that every time I
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  mentioned that I get emails saying I didn't believe you and went and looked
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.680]  and they find out it's true he was never on it let's talk about that when we come
[29:23.680 --> 29:27.640]  back a short break long segment we're gonna come back from break play a few
[29:27.640 --> 29:34.160]  minutes of Ed Azzar's intro video Ed Azzar on building seven and then we're
[29:34.160 --> 29:39.440]  gonna go right back to Ed and start breaking down some of the other facets
[29:39.440 --> 29:43.240]  of 9-11 the whole bin Laden fable then we're gonna look at the two-party
[29:43.240 --> 29:48.160]  dictatorship in America and where Ed sees this country going is now even
[29:48.160 --> 29:52.360]  Mayor Bloomberg's talking about riots we're on the March the Empire's on the

[33:45.880 --> 33:50.200]  9-11 truth narrated by Ed Asner here's just the first minute of it
[33:50.200 --> 33:55.080]  throughout the ages architects and engineers have designed and built the
[33:55.080 --> 34:00.320]  great structures that have made our world and withstood the test of time
[34:00.320 --> 34:10.680]  hi I'm Ed Asner welcome to architects and engineers let's look now at modern
[34:10.680 --> 34:19.200]  steel-framed buildings this is the Empire State Building a marvel of modern
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.880]  architecture it was built to last
[34:24.880 --> 34:32.320]  architects and engineers of today use computers to design and engineer
[34:32.320 --> 34:39.000]  buildings that will endure the forces of nature such as earthquakes fires and
[34:39.000 --> 34:47.560]  hurricanes this modern skyscraper was also built to last
[34:47.560 --> 34:57.480]  building seven we've seen buildings completely destroyed like this before
[34:57.480 --> 35:02.360]  but I when done intentionally only when done intentionally you got to go watch
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.120]  it some of the most powerful 9-11 truth information I've ever seen and we just
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.000]  appreciate it as they're having the courage and the will to do what he does
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  just amazing and in undoubtedly reaching millions of people because if we
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.200]  don't expose false flag terror the military industrial complex is going to
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.640]  continue to stage these cold-blooded events to completely overthrow our
[35:23.640 --> 35:27.640]  Republic and you were finishing up with the summit bin Laden the fact that he
[35:27.640 --> 35:32.280]  was never on the most wanted list and then what do you think of the report
[35:32.280 --> 35:38.400]  that that that Obama had him killed and then the Navy Seal helicopter blows up
[35:38.400 --> 35:42.560]  our intel was they blew the seals up on the ground we predicted they'd have a
[35:42.560 --> 35:47.360]  crash with the seals on it later that indeed happened why would they do that
[35:47.360 --> 35:51.680]  to get rid of the witnesses because the report has been a lot and was not in the
[35:51.680 --> 36:01.520]  building really it was already dead yeah oh my god well I'm too busy with 911 to
[36:01.520 --> 36:06.800]  pursue that crime now I understand there is too much in any other points on 911
[36:06.800 --> 36:12.720]  truth that you think are are central for people to look at I think that does
[36:12.720 --> 36:17.600]  anybody wonder why there are no black boxes from any of the planes has
[36:17.600 --> 36:25.360]  anybody seen the black boxes has anybody seen the various TVs that were on in the
[36:25.360 --> 36:33.480]  various stores at the time of the Pentagon and why all those security
[36:33.480 --> 36:43.160]  cameras product was confiscated nobody's seen that the the stench in the
[36:43.160 --> 36:50.360]  cover-up of all the acts that took place on 911 are so enormous people just feel
[36:50.360 --> 36:57.840]  too small and and and refuse to to tumble to the fact that there was
[36:57.840 --> 37:04.440]  complicity in this country in terms of the carrying out it was not a perfect
[37:04.440 --> 37:11.640]  threading of the of the needle that 911 took place there there there should have
[37:11.640 --> 37:20.200]  been some exposure some talk somebody and and I understand that the 911
[37:20.200 --> 37:28.680]  ceremonies in New York that they did not even have the first responders make a
[37:28.680 --> 37:34.360]  making appearance there is that true yes sir I'm seeing in Fox News AP all
[37:34.360 --> 37:39.040]  reported it when I first saw it a month ago I didn't believe it and told my guys
[37:39.040 --> 37:42.040]  let's go pull some more articles up and it was confirmed and then there was a
[37:42.040 --> 37:46.520]  statement by Bloomberg and then we learned a White House memo that they did
[37:46.520 --> 37:51.760]  not want them there because there they know they're angry about the asbestos
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.920]  dust and bush covering that up we knew it was deadly and the head of the EPA and
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.280]  also that so many of them are 911 truthers that it would be embarrassing
[38:00.280 --> 38:08.600]  yeah that's too bad isn't yeah you've got damn bad well I think these people are
[38:08.600 --> 38:15.840]  dying on us as we go along dying from the the bronchial and the pulmonary
[38:15.840 --> 38:20.680]  diseases they got that day and that's a hell of a way to honor them by not
[38:20.680 --> 38:31.680]  having them there so I I've got nothing but negative sorry I find that an 18
[38:31.680 --> 38:37.080]  foot hole of the Pentagon in the least occupied section of the Pentagon by a
[38:37.080 --> 38:45.400]  pilot who could not fly at all hardly but never have engineered a a total U
[38:45.400 --> 38:50.040]  turns so that he could hit his plane into that particular section of the
[38:50.040 --> 38:58.760]  Pentagon it's all such hokey make believe and our people keep flying well I
[38:58.760 --> 39:02.280]  know that when you've gone public some of the media has demonized you Martin
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.320]  Sheen question building seven they tried to evenize him Bill O'Reilly shook his
[39:07.320 --> 39:12.400]  finger at the at the camera and said you better watch it it's total
[39:12.400 --> 39:19.120]  gangsterism by these people trying to intimidate folks and now we've had Cass
[39:19.120 --> 39:23.160]  Sunstein at the White House his memos of course have been made public where he
[39:23.160 --> 39:27.960]  said they want to infiltrate 911 truth to inject false information to
[39:27.960 --> 39:33.600]  discredit us if it was just hokey and if Ed Asner was wrong and if Andres Von
[39:33.600 --> 39:37.240]  Bielow the former German defense minister was wrong and the former Italian
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.000]  prime minister was wrong and president was wrong if all these scientists were
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.600]  wrong and all these fighter pilots were wrong and all these police officers it
[39:44.600 --> 39:48.680]  said there was a countdown and they blew up building seven and BBC reported
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.720]  that it was gonna fall before it fell yeah I mean if all that evidence is is
[39:53.720 --> 40:00.960]  just bunk then why would there be government programs covertly trying to
[40:00.960 --> 40:06.440]  demonize his head well I haven't you know I felt like a demon for a long time
[40:06.440 --> 40:13.600]  so I haven't felt any new trust I was on O'Reilly a few months ago and he treated
[40:13.600 --> 40:18.320]  me like a kid I was very nice to me I know I'm talking about years ago when
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.920]  they were really getting scared of 911 truth there was some demonization and
[40:21.920 --> 40:26.240]  some and some attacks on Fox and other channels and they would mention 911
[40:26.240 --> 40:30.680]  truthers I remember you being mentioned amongst them so yeah that that just I
[40:30.680 --> 40:34.320]  think shows a little bit of the the fact that it is to showmanship on their
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.480]  part but even even the liberal commentator you know Bill Maher won't
[40:38.480 --> 40:46.920]  even touch it he runs he runs from it it they they don't want they they're
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.800]  afraid they'll look like fools if they engage in it or be demonized and I
[40:51.800 --> 40:56.440]  guess that when they're up that high they can be demonized and it can have an
[40:56.440 --> 41:07.960]  effect but that shows how much courage they've got the the the the list of
[41:07.960 --> 41:12.680]  horrors that that occurred and hold on just a moment I think you've got call
[41:12.680 --> 41:16.440]  waiting I think you've got a call coming in it's taking care of Alex okay
[41:16.440 --> 41:19.920]  great I just don't want to interrupt you but that's all right please repeat what
[41:19.920 --> 41:22.360]  you were saying to me during the break you're saying the list of horrors start
[41:22.360 --> 41:28.600]  over the list of horrors of 9-11 is so enormous and and even even the the heads
[41:28.600 --> 41:35.240]  of the the spurious 9-11 Commission said that they were lied to by the CIA so
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.240]  where do you begin for God's sake my my my feeling is that the corruption and the
[41:40.240 --> 41:46.960]  lies that we've been fed have reached such an enormous extent the the the
[41:46.960 --> 41:55.120]  military lies the the the congressional lies the presidential lies the
[41:55.120 --> 42:03.640]  corporate lies that the the level of corruption is of such an extreme nature
[42:03.640 --> 42:11.160]  I think of what the comment I said to you is that I think under unless we bomb
[42:11.160 --> 42:18.640]  the city we can't save so we've got the level bring down to a level of clear
[42:18.640 --> 42:23.200]  understanding and begin again and I don't know how much destruction that
[42:23.200 --> 42:28.560]  entails but we need a change in this country certainly a third party of
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.360]  healthy proportions would help well this nation has turned into the happy
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.120]  looting ground of these global corporate crime bosses it's like we're the
[42:39.120 --> 42:44.120]  right whale and we're basically being hunted into oblivion and if you study
[42:44.120 --> 42:47.640]  corruption history as you were just alluding to when it reaches this
[42:47.640 --> 42:54.240]  flashpoint it races over the edge into oblivion and none of us have any future
[42:54.240 --> 42:58.320]  including the people looting the nation it's almost like they're cancer they
[42:58.320 --> 43:01.200]  think because they've got all this power and have gotten away with so many
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.600]  crimes they become emboldened and then race through the body politic until
[43:06.600 --> 43:11.120]  they destroy the society and the crime is exploding the illegitimacy is
[43:11.120 --> 43:15.680]  exploding the illiteracy is exploding we've got close to 50 million people on
[43:15.680 --> 43:20.480]  food stamps those you know basically digital soup lines every mainline
[43:20.480 --> 43:24.520]  economist I talked to says we're really in a depression and we've got both
[43:24.520 --> 43:31.440]  parties lying to us what about this two-party dictatorship Ed I mean at
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.280]  at at this point it's now in the news today that the Chicago Tribune editorial
[43:37.280 --> 43:42.600]  staff is saying Obama should withdraw and step down for a new candidate here's
[43:42.600 --> 43:45.600]  another one Washington Times liberals vowed to challenge Obama in
[43:45.600 --> 43:50.640]  Democratic primaries the Washington Post has said they need somebody else to run
[43:50.640 --> 43:55.400]  Obama faces questions on his investments USA Today so they're now bringing up old
[43:55.400 --> 43:59.640]  corruption stuff they knew during the campaign so so they've put forward their
[43:59.640 --> 44:04.080]  puppet reading off a teleprompter they're gonna destroy him now and act like
[44:04.080 --> 44:08.000]  he did all this when it's the Republican and Democratic leadership and I want
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.680]  your view on this who were bought and paid for by the big offshore mega
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.680]  corporations and banks and oil companies and the rest of it and and so the
[44:15.680 --> 44:19.480]  Democrats are so upset no they're upset that they're getting the blame for this
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.000]  they want a new puppet to take all the blame and do you agree with that I mean
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.800]  that the Democrats who are upset with Obama doing the opposite of what he said
[44:28.800 --> 44:32.560]  he would do they should realize this is the corporate fascism what do they
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.240]  expect just like Republicans who are getting ready to vote for Rick Perry I
[44:36.240 --> 44:41.760]  mean what do they expect this guy died in the wool establishment you know Carl
[44:41.760 --> 44:55.600]  Rove minion to do we've got to destroy the city to save it the I in early
[44:55.600 --> 45:05.560]  1945 president Roosevelt gave a speech and as far as I'm concerned if we could
[45:05.560 --> 45:11.960]  preserve that man in oil to continue being a president forever it would have
[45:11.960 --> 45:20.840]  been my pleasure he talked about a second four freedoms in this country
[45:20.840 --> 45:30.480]  education jobs housing health for things which are going into the toilet as we
[45:30.480 --> 45:37.560]  speak for things which the people should have and I feel that socialism would
[45:37.560 --> 45:44.240]  certainly have provided it for us to the to the light of the the conservatives
[45:44.240 --> 45:49.160]  Roosevelt died and those four freedoms were buried and there are people of
[45:49.160 --> 45:54.840]  attempts to restore them in various ways shapes and forms socialism would give
[45:54.840 --> 46:01.720]  us a ground bottom to and that's the thing in this country just like they
[46:01.720 --> 46:06.320]  don't want to hear about 9-11 people use since they can't use communists anymore
[46:06.320 --> 46:15.000]  but they use socialism now as the means of saying how unpalatable it would be
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.600]  for this country what a taste it would be if we could have guaranteed income for
[46:20.600 --> 46:29.640]  every citizen guaranteed education guaranteed housing guaranteed jobs my
[46:29.640 --> 46:34.920]  god and the liberals have betrayed us to I mean the Fair Trade Act that went on
[46:34.920 --> 46:40.600]  the NAFTA the CAFTA all that crap well that was my next point today yeah that
[46:40.600 --> 46:43.480]  was my next point is that a lot of mainland conservatives say they're
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.880]  against socialism but then they're for trillions of dollars in bailouts to big
[46:48.880 --> 46:53.680]  mega banks yeah and trillions in corporate welfare trillions in defense
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.560]  that is more corporate welfare no they just don't like the other type of
[46:57.560 --> 47:02.520]  socialism they like the fascism of big corporations coming in and taking our
[47:02.520 --> 47:06.440]  money at the barrel of a gun so so that's why I understand your perspective
[47:06.440 --> 47:11.280]  and that you are a well-meaning good person who has that perspective and
[47:11.280 --> 47:15.400]  certainly what we have hasn't worked I'm just saying there's a model of
[47:15.400 --> 47:19.840]  socialism pushed by the mega corporations where it's only enough to
[47:19.840 --> 47:25.320]  make people dependent and and not to actually empower them and and so I
[47:25.320 --> 47:29.440]  guess if you had some robot you know because we've got unlimited resources
[47:29.440 --> 47:33.720]  basically when it comes to knowledge and information building people up through
[47:33.720 --> 47:36.840]  a socialist model that could work the problem is there's always going to be
[47:36.840 --> 47:40.720]  people who don't want to build folks up and of course that gets into the
[47:40.720 --> 47:44.880]  eugenics the population reduction from my research you know into the whole
[47:44.880 --> 47:49.120]  vaccine thing everything the forced inoculations of the eugenics the the
[47:49.120 --> 47:53.800]  Gardasil causing all these deaths wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what
[47:53.800 --> 48:01.000]  causing what death Gardasil the the the the papilloma virus shot in its trials
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.960]  cause deaths and it's since caused deaths and a lot of a lot of quote adverse
[48:04.960 --> 48:10.160]  reactions and now in California they're moving to try to basically give all the
[48:10.160 --> 48:13.800]  school children the shot that's what Rick Perry is getting in all this trouble
[48:13.800 --> 48:18.800]  for yeah he started I have not read of these deaths I know that Michelle
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.320]  Beckman claimed this one woman that her daughter suffered terrible health
[48:24.320 --> 48:30.080]  problems from the shot but she did not produce the woman or her name yeah what
[48:30.080 --> 48:33.880]  they're doing is they're using Bachman to politicize it to make it a left
[48:33.880 --> 48:41.320]  right issue right now but I actually believe I sent yeah here it is girl
[48:41.320 --> 48:47.680]  dies within hours of Sarah Vax Gardasil vaccine and this is just one of
[48:47.680 --> 48:55.320]  literally dozens and dozens of CBS ABC this is sky news out of England we're
[48:55.320 --> 48:58.320]  gonna skip this break for the network this is a network breaks of stations
[48:58.320 --> 49:05.280]  shouldn't skip this with that asner guys will you queue up clip 3091 and if you
[49:05.280 --> 49:09.960]  just Google sir or go to YouTube and type in death from Gardasil you'll you'll
[49:09.960 --> 49:14.360]  get newscasts from 2007 but they're always local and then a lot of times the
[49:14.360 --> 49:21.360]  kids die right there at the school here it is here's that clip we're gonna back
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.760]  that back up the death of a teenage girl if indeed it is linked to the drug will
[49:25.760 --> 49:30.680]  be sad proof of their fears the 14 year old was vaccinated along with most of
[49:30.680 --> 49:34.560]  her school yesterday it's understood that around lunchtime shortly after
[49:34.560 --> 49:38.440]  having the injection she turned pale stopped breathing and collapsed
[49:38.440 --> 49:42.440]  paramedics took her to Coventry's University Hospital but she died there
[49:42.440 --> 49:48.320]  hours after receiving the drug NHS Coventry released a statement last night
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.280]  saying that it has taken the proactive step to quarantine the batch of vaccine
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.240]  being used as a precautionary measure only and have informed the regulatory
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.120]  authority the statement continues on to say we are conducting an urgent and full
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.880]  investigation into the events surrounding this tragedy okay teenage girls in
[50:05.880 --> 50:08.960]  particular have been more aware of cervical cancer since the illness and
[50:08.960 --> 50:12.880]  death of Jade Goodie last September a national vaccination program that's
[50:12.880 --> 50:18.560]  enough motion and you can you can search this but I even have a CDC
[50:18.560 --> 50:22.080]  documents admitting deaths connected to it and that's why they now have this
[50:22.080 --> 50:26.880]  challenge for $10,000 by a doctor connected to the vaccine lobby saying
[50:26.880 --> 50:30.720]  Bachman give me the proof that it's ever caused a mental problem it's on the
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.520]  drug insert as well as the H1N1 flu shot that it can cause an arcolexy
[50:35.520 --> 50:41.920]  artificial onset of epilepsy that it can cause Guillain beret I have a lot of
[50:41.920 --> 50:45.120]  friends that they've gotten Guillain beret from vaccines and their doctors have
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.080]  told them but I mean they've had trouble covering up the Gardasil because
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.040]  sometimes you die within 10 minutes also they line the girls up and a lot of
[50:53.040 --> 50:57.600]  times large numbers collapse and then have autoimmune responses and it came
[50:57.600 --> 51:03.600]  out last week yet I'm covering this next hour in a special report that they
[51:03.600 --> 51:08.160]  now tested 13 different vials from different sub manufacturing plants of
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.480]  it and found that it's got the RNA DNA bound to the adjuvant so it's causing
[51:13.480 --> 51:20.600]  autoimmune problems well I had not heard any of this so thank you for the
[51:20.600 --> 51:24.920]  information well overall Ed you have been critical of some vaccines what's
[51:24.920 --> 51:31.000]  your view on on this push to want kids to take hundreds of vaccines I don't
[51:31.000 --> 51:36.400]  know about the push to take hundreds of vaccines I do know since I have an
[51:36.400 --> 51:46.320]  autistic son and grandson that there was a long strong push against the with
[51:46.320 --> 51:53.200]  the triple shot vaccine that most kids get the whooping off and I forget what
[51:53.200 --> 52:06.360]  the mmR yeah and it turned out that the the scientist who had spoken of the
[52:06.360 --> 52:12.800]  fact that it had caused autism fudge his information he's been discredited yeah
[52:12.800 --> 52:17.160]  yeah no we've had dr. Wakefield in studio even last week and it turns out
[52:17.160 --> 52:21.200]  now that there's two other studies before him and that was a hoax just like
[52:21.200 --> 52:26.000]  the Gardasil people just said no one has ever been hurt in any way and the CDC
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.320]  says tens of thousands have been hurt we're doing a special report in the next
[52:30.320 --> 52:34.800]  hour but a more detailed one tonight on our nightly news I would like to when
[52:34.800 --> 52:39.200]  the nightly news is done and I'll send you a link to it to your assistance
[52:39.200 --> 52:43.760]  email will you please watch this special report for me I will all right
[52:43.760 --> 52:48.320]  because because again this is there this is how deceptive they are then they
[52:48.320 --> 52:51.800]  have Bachman come out and talk about it and people don't like her politically
[52:51.800 --> 52:55.960]  so then they say well it must be bowl of Bachman saying it I mean I understand
[52:55.960 --> 53:00.280]  how this gets now shifting gears always wanted to ask you about your view of
[53:00.280 --> 53:07.920]  JFK and the assassination I know that you did a great job with Mr. Lemon in
[53:07.920 --> 53:13.480]  Oliver Stone's JFK what's your view on the JFK assassination well I think that
[53:13.480 --> 53:20.320]  probably was some government complicity there who was the who was the
[53:20.320 --> 53:32.080]  lawyer done it in Johnstown Mark can't remember his name Garrison no no not good
[53:32.080 --> 53:37.280]  he had the Congressman Gary's typewriter when they were making their escape yes
[53:37.280 --> 53:53.600]  Mark Mark Lane yeah he wrote a book on on this subject but in Willis Cartwell
[53:53.600 --> 54:01.280]  spotlight magazine a fascist sheet nevertheless said that he Howard Hunt
[54:01.280 --> 54:11.600]  was in Dallas as a member of the CIA at the time of the JFK assassination he
[54:11.600 --> 54:21.320]  then sued and won key Howard Hunt did so Willis Cartwell came to Mark Lane and
[54:21.320 --> 54:26.840]  said on the retrial I want you to defend me so why do you want me I'm totally
[54:26.840 --> 54:31.840]  opposed to everything you believe you did that's why I want you to realize how
[54:31.840 --> 54:40.480]  that I believe in your objectivity so Mark Lane defended Willis Cartwell and
[54:40.480 --> 54:47.840]  he won because he was able to prove that he Howard Hunt and I imagine other he
[54:47.840 --> 54:54.680]  was able to prove also that other CIA gentlemen were all over the area at the
[54:54.680 --> 55:01.000]  JFK assassination how that does not necessarily mean that the the CIA pulled
[55:01.000 --> 55:09.320]  triggers but they they certainly were in a vicinity and could have done much to
[55:09.320 --> 55:14.240]  probably stop it if they weren't firing the guns themselves well add you're
[55:14.240 --> 55:19.920]  right about that famous case there with the Liberty Lobby spotlight finally
[55:19.920 --> 55:24.800]  winning the second round but I've interviewed St. John Hunt we've we've
[55:24.800 --> 55:32.560]  we've premiered the video and also the audio coast-to-coast of course did the
[55:32.560 --> 55:37.080]  first interview but the point is that on his deathbed or the first time they
[55:37.080 --> 55:41.360]  thought he was gonna die he did an audio and a written letter admitting and of
[55:41.360 --> 55:45.120]  course he ran black op assassinations were alive at the CIA Howard Hunt that
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.640]  indeed he had been there to basically bench warm but run the whole operation
[55:50.640 --> 55:58.800]  and that they did have CIA trigger men there yes sir this just came out a few
[55:58.800 --> 56:02.800]  years ago Rolling Stone was the only big mainstream media to report on it
[56:02.800 --> 56:07.600]  coast-to-coast AM of course also broke it on radio and then we did subsequent
[56:07.600 --> 56:13.720]  in-depth investigations with St. John Hunt his son he's in California and I
[56:13.720 --> 56:16.800]  believe in Los Angeles you ought to you ought to meet with him sometime it is
[56:16.800 --> 56:21.720]  extremely powerful even helped his dad with the Watergate stuff get rid of the
[56:21.720 --> 56:29.560]  evidence with that an incredible person to have dinner with well I am quite
[56:29.560 --> 56:39.880]  my eye and my ear and my heart are open to any of that I I must condemn the CIA I
[56:39.880 --> 56:47.000]  must say and I am very troubled whenever I hear something about the CIA
[56:47.000 --> 56:55.360]  because there are tons of good people in it I know but there's a element of
[56:55.360 --> 57:01.160]  corruption keep rising up be it the Kennedy assassination be it tenet
[57:01.160 --> 57:13.200]  talking about slam dunk to allow the invasion of Iraq or the the fact that
[57:13.200 --> 57:18.720]  weapons of mass destruction were to be found there sure of this this this
[57:18.720 --> 57:27.080]  constancy of participation in lies is certainly very troubling to me it
[57:27.080 --> 57:31.120]  certainly is and real quick Ron Paul what's your view of Congressman
[57:31.120 --> 57:36.280]  Ron Paul I think he's refreshing I disagree with him on certainly a great
[57:36.280 --> 57:43.160]  number of things but I think that he's certainly probably one of the few
[57:43.160 --> 57:49.200]  honest politicians you can find in Washington you know I think that's what
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.640]  I could say about you I don't agree with you on some major issues but you're real
[57:52.640 --> 57:55.960]  you're the same yesterday today and tomorrow and that's what you've got to
[57:55.960 --> 58:02.280]  say about Ron Paul is that he is real and and that's such a rare quantity
[58:02.280 --> 58:07.440]  nowadays well Bernie Sanders is another one Bernie Sanders has been yes I think
[58:07.440 --> 58:15.400]  a lot of hearts and minds though he's a socialist in in claiming how this
[58:15.400 --> 58:20.680]  country has to proceed how it must attack to get out of the deficit into
[58:20.680 --> 58:28.000]  then to raise up our people I am and as their hold on I know you've got to go
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.880]  this is a one-minute break if you could just do five more minutes to finish that
[58:31.880 --> 58:35.560]  point I want to talk about a few lighter things like my favorite animated film up

[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:23.280]  Alex Jones
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:30.680]  well it's been an amazing interview with Hollywood and television legend long-term
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:34.960]  serving head of the screen actors Guild you name it Ed Asner and it's been a
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:38.880]  couple years since he's been on not that we haven't tried to get him back on I
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:42.400]  guess he's been busy but and I appreciate you coming back on the show
[1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:48.440]  well thank you Alex it's a pleasure to vent I have to learn how to vent more
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:52.320]  controllably now you've done a very good very good job it's been a I believe a
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:56.240]  very informative and thought-provoking interview in closing we were debating
[1:00:56.240 --> 1:00:59.200]  socialism during the break and you brought up the example of Germany and
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:03.160]  I said well that's that's quasi and you said that's what I'm talking about so
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:06.480]  I'll give us your view on Germany which does have a higher standard of living than
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:10.520]  we do and at the higher standard of living the citizens are better cared for
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:19.720]  they their education is is certainly better they their their guarantees of
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:27.760]  jobs are better their health is better what where do they lack and it's a it's
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:34.320]  a quasi socialist country but by God they're thriving they are thriving so
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:38.520]  well that they're probably sorry they're in the European community and got to
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:48.520]  support the other communities I don't know why people I mean there there is
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:54.680]  no end to capitalism with a a quasi socialist government most of those
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:59.400]  European countries are quasi socialist but they certainly have thriving
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:05.880]  corporations we have the richest men in the world Warren Buffett say our rich
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:11.920]  people are not taxed enough he's not taxed enough so that when he is paying
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:17.240]  less tax than some of the people who work for him this is criminal and I
[1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:22.080]  admire him enormously but Ed again you really looking at this from a
[1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:26.280]  sophisticated angle they're just lobbying to then raise taxes on the middle
[1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:29.880]  class and they'll still be exempt and then that middle-class money gets
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:35.920]  conduit it out but but but I I want to end on a lighter note and talk about Ted
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:38.960]  Knight you were telling me that he was one of your best friends and I don't
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.720]  know if you want to tell that story or if it was private what you were telling
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:46.000]  me but just in the two minutes we've got left tell us what you thought of Ted
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:50.480]  Knight well I love them he was the funniest man I've ever known and you
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:55.200]  talk about how you love them in Caddy Shack well the funny thing is being
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:59.320]  Ronnie Dangerfield hated each other while they wrote that show now both of them
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:07.040]  are gone Ted Ted taught me humor like nobody else
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:13.440]  unfortunately when Lou Grant got cancelled under its controversy he gave
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:20.200]  some his show was just debuting too close for comfort was debuting and he
[1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:28.120]  gave a widespread press conference and he attacked Lou Grant and condemned it
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:33.560]  instead of he was found it boring blah blah blah and this was my good friend
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:39.960]  talking so that alienated us for a few years there I never spoke to him or
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:44.920]  saw him again then when he was dying I was told he was dying and would I come
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:52.120]  and I came and we reunited and I gave him my love and my blessing and and
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:59.400]  happy for it well all's well that all's well that ends well in closing up
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:03.760]  really is a masterpiece and nothing but a pure wholesome movie you really don't
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:08.440]  see that a lot now in Hollywood I hope that's the beginning of a new trend well
[1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:15.400]  let's hope so nothing it hasn't started a cat a cattle stamp eat but maybe it's
[1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:24.000]  slow a morning let's hope there are more ups but whether I'm in it or not it
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:30.800]  doesn't matter because the genius that created it is its writer director Pete
[1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:37.400]  doctor and helped from Bob Peterson they did marvelous work in it I had no
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:42.240]  idea how good it would be until I saw it well so you share my view of it amazing
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:45.380]  and the same view of Ted Knight I envy you getting to know people like him and
[1:04:45.380 --> 1:04:49.000]  I at least I get to know you sir I really appreciate you spending so much time
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.520]  with us mr. Asner and and hopefully we can speak to you again in the near
[1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:57.720]  future that night lives through you all right God bless we'll be right back

[1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:18.720]  private joker is silly and he's ignorant but he's got guts and guts is
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:24.760]  enough that's the master sergeant drill sergeant in full metal jacket Stanley
[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:32.080]  Kubrick film and I don't think Ed Asner silly and ignorant but he certainly has
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:36.160]  guts and guts is enough I'm not just nice to him because he's famous and an
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:42.760]  icon I respect him because I know socialists out there like Ed Asner who
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:49.520]  really mean well and I try my best to communicate with him and to try to
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:55.880]  educate him you know the last time he was on three years ago he brought up
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:09:03.400]  multiple members of his family who after taking guard mmr shots became
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:07.000]  autistic and I can't tell you how many hundreds of families I've talked to on
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:12.120]  air off air on the street who don't even know who I am I'll be sitting there at a
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:17.200]  park or at a hotel in a hot tub or at a church visiting family and they'll start
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:21.040]  talking about their autistic child who's sitting there in the corner nodding
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:25.320]  up and down or playing with their fingers and tell their autistic and I'll
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:35.320]  say when did this begin well Bobby was Billy or David Tom was 18 months old and
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:40.040]  he got his third round of shots and he had a convulsion in the back of the car
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:46.480]  and he was talking and running and walking and he never talked again or
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:53.440]  yeah we got a third round of shots and he was basically unconscious for a couple
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:10:02.760]  days he had blood coming out of his nose and we took him to the hospital and they
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:06.520]  tried to take him away from us and said that we must have shook him because he
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:16.000]  had blood on the brain or yeah we got in the third round of shots it hurts boys
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.600]  a lot worse because their blood brain barrier isn't as strong as girls any
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:24.920]  medical doctor will tell you girls are about twice as tough as a boy not not
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:29.040]  mentally generally physically women are tough as nails that's why they live
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:33.720]  longer women generally can take higher levels of poison than men because they
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:39.320]  are designed to grow another human and to have a baby and to go through that in
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:48.160]  all mammal species women the female is a lot tougher than the male and it's
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:53.360]  it's really hurt our boys bad now Gardasil is a little gift to girls
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:11:01.560]  but you know talking to Ed Asner earlier I could see the propaganda at work on
[1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:07.800]  him he's seen some of my films you know he likes them but like Terror Storm and
[1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.400]  things like that you know he's probably listening right now I'll just
[1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:17.640]  communicate to Ed Asner and others like him right now just like he doesn't agree
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:21.560]  with everything Ron Paul says but he admires him and thinks he's a breath of
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:26.000]  fresh air because he's real and he's coming against the establishment from a
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:33.960]  different angle total liberty almost anarchy and you've got Asner on the
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:37.920]  other end with this with this idea of you know the greater welfare general
[1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:43.620]  welfare clause different perspectives but both men believe in what they're
[1:11:43.620 --> 1:11:47.080]  saying and doing it's the globalist that manipulate you heard him talk about
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:51.960]  Warren Buffett earlier coming out and saying hey I should pay more tax well
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:55.400]  turns out Warren Buffett if you go back a decade ago lobbied this has come out
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:12:01.280]  to change the laws and have loopholes to not pay the tax what he wants is more
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:05.280]  money for more banker bailouts for banks he owns he needs to raise taxes to get
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:10.080]  that but see expert politicians like Warren Buffett and that's what he is
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:14.640]  know how to play an Ed Asner and play a Republican on the other end of the
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:18.840]  controlled spectrum they know how to put out messages that are going to
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:24.320]  manipulate well-meaning and intelligent people like Ed Asner you've got to really
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:27.920]  study this stuff and that's why this radio show is such an important brain
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:33.480]  trust you know Ed even said me during the break he said no I like to hear the
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:37.280]  show I learn a lot he said I'll be happy to come back on sooner of course he was
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.680]  also just being gracious but we really do have something to offer here it's not
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:47.080]  just that Ed Asner's bad or Ron Paul's bad or Ron Paul's good and Ed Asner's
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.240]  bad or vice versa it's that they see things through a different rose colored
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:55.960]  glasses and it doesn't mean each and every one of us is wrong or right it
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:01.080]  means our hearts are right now we've got to figure out how the globalist are
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:10.040]  manipulating our good intentions and co-opting it I'm gonna be honest with you
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:17.400]  I was moved so strongly this morning spiritually that with a with a feeling
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:25.240]  of absolute mission and crystal clarity and understanding of what I need to do
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:30.280]  and what my responsibility is that I almost didn't come into the show and
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:37.160]  then dealing with office issues you know driving in dealing with stuff I lost
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:44.080]  that that essence of clarity I mean I still have it but it's like looking into
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:49.520]  water that was crystal clear 300 feet down and now I can't see the bottom it's
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:55.880]  still pretty clear but I can't see the bottom and that happens so much on this
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:00.440]  radio show I read hundreds of news articles do all this research get up at
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:05.480]  5 a.m. 6 a.m. stay up late at night researching and then I get up here on
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:09.440]  air and how do I bring all this clarity and all these thousands of points
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:14.320]  because the mind can move so fast with all the interconnected knowledge and they
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:21.280]  call that I guess wisdom and then how do I impart that to people because you've
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:27.640]  already got that knowledge you're just not consciously able to map it and
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:33.040]  grasp it that's why when you hear this show it's not that I'm in a lot of cases
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:37.080]  teaching you something I am illustrating something you already knew was
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:45.120]  there kind of like a bomber jacket your grandpa gave you from World War two and you box it
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:50.760]  up when you move you get busy you forget about it and 30 years later you open up
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:54.560]  that trunk and you're like oh my god look at all these photos look at this
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:15:03.440]  bomber jacket of granddaddy in World War two you always knew it was there but
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:12.680]  you'd forgotten but you knew you're like how did I not remember I had this and
[1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:15.680]  then you remember all the times that you were driving down the road or saw
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.880]  somebody else with a bomber jacket on the football game and hey that looks
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:23.960]  like granddaddy's jacket but you didn't remember when you got home to go dig it
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:29.240]  out of the trunk you've had those flashes those just stalts of
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:35.920]  understanding dr. Wakefield three different studies it's now emerged came
[1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:39.960]  out from it's one of them in the British government finding the exact
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:46.240]  findings he'd found a year before but they didn't publish he did real test he
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:52.960]  didn't engage in a fraud they came out with a hoax and said that he had been
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:57.200]  discredited as a fraud and ran it everywhere and the boldness of the hoax
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:02.400]  somebody like Ed Asner who whose son and grandson you heard him earlier been
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:07.480]  damaged by this who was angry and sure of it a few years ago now said well no
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:11.680]  that's been discredited because he doesn't want to hate the vaccine makers
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:15.720]  he doesn't want to believe they're this evil he wants to believe that and it was
[1:16:15.720 --> 1:16:20.840]  made for him and all the other victims
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:30.120]  just like this latest hoax over the weekend one of the independent and
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:34.280]  that's in quotes doctors who it turns out is on the Merck payroll and on the
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:39.920]  big vaccine bill of Melinda Gates bandwagon came out and said I'll give
[1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:47.200]  $10,000 to anybody that could show me proof that Gardasil's causing mental
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:57.000]  problems a nice nebulous statement and Aaron listed the tens of thousands CDC
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:04.480]  reports of adverse reactions including epilepsy convulsions narcolepsy I mean
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:09.680]  it's all on the drug insert but they don't care that ran I did a search this
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:15.120]  morning of it that ran in thousands of newspapers last week and over the weekend
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:21.800]  and NPR CBS NBC ABC saying hey a doctor says it's a hoax that Gardasil ever hurt
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:25.720]  one person and if you could show one person was hurt with by this mentally
[1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:32.760]  their brain I will give you $10,000 well he knows that there's a vaccine
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:36.960]  damage fund and the government quietly pays people off and makes them keep it
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:42.000]  secret as part of the agreement and they know full well that it says on the
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.360]  insert it can cause this that's how they get the liability protection and they
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:50.080]  know full well there were deaths in the trials that were confirmed and that
[1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:54.360]  India didn't even allow widespread use and they know full well you can go
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:58.520]  search YouTube and watch hundreds of local newscasts of girls dead dying
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:02.520]  convulsions autoimmune diseases and their own family doctors saying that an
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:06.280]  autoimmune response within five hours of taking this they had blood pouring out
[1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:11.680]  their nose their genitals every pore in their body people becoming paralyzed
[1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:19.800]  neon beret narcolepsy every form of brain damage you can imagine and their
[1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:23.640]  answers to come out and say it's all been discredited Michelle Bachman with
[1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:27.800]  this one case of this woman who says it made her daughter and Bob and just said
[1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:32.400]  the woman told me it brain damaged her daughter now going back four years ago
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:39.640]  in the trials it's actually five years ago 2006 with the deaths there were on
[1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:42.920]  average hundreds of times adverse reactions what what were they what did
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:48.360]  our news articles say and our links it was always about autoimmune disorders
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:53.200]  now what came out last week big company to test of 13 different sub
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:59.880]  manufacturers of Gardasil and found all of them had DNA of the virus mixed in
[1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:06.480]  with the RNA attached to the adjuvant meaning that now that will bind with the
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:13.400]  body's DNA and trigger cancer in areas that the cervical cancer previously
[1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:18.920]  would not grow by the way the rarest form of cancer in the US the lowest
[1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:24.720]  death rate a very common one that by the way is connected to a buffer to more
[1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:28.720]  deadly cancers if you have that type of cancer you can pull the studies up you
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:33.080]  have many times less chance of getting a lot of other cancers it turns out that
[1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:39.800]  wart causing virus causes some kind of buffer to the other cancer viruses that
[1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:44.440]  they've been making common formerly rare cancers in the vaccines but listen

[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:32.080]  third-world dictatorship or something and then we're gonna get into the big
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:37.360]  U.N. vote coming up on Palestinian statehood and a lot more and just other
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:41.960]  off-the-chart behavior we've got telescreens going up at 9,000 locations
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:47.280]  saying don't trust your neighbor only trust big brother now they have actual
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:52.280]  coffee mug sides that look like something out of artwork from the 1984 movie
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:57.880]  that show big eyes looking at you saying see something say something that
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:01.640]  they're now paying coffee shops all over the country to give you with your coffee
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:07.480]  so just big brother or Wellian messages of course the NFL has also announced
[1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:13.640]  that everyone will be groped TSA style grabbing the genitals so sixteen point
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:17.800]  six million people to be conditioned we're gonna be breaking that down also
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:23.160]  El Paso times more confirmed reports of the U.S. government shipping narcotics
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:32.800]  into the U.S. and guns out of the country that is all coming up today but
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:36.880]  right now let's go to your calls but again I'm gonna try to do a focused
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:45.640]  presentation on the fact that I knew this five years ago the evidence was
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:50.560]  clear but now we're really honing it in not only do they know Gardasil was
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:54.880]  killing people in the trials not only is it a giant boondoggle to make tens of
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:59.400]  billions for Merck not only is California set to have the governor sign
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:04.760]  the law to inject children without parents consent with Gardasil including
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:09.720]  boys not only is all of that going on and this is a precedent to inject you
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:13.320]  with everything they want all the new vaccines coming online these aren't
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:21.320]  really vaccines they're genetically changing you there they're nanotech but
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:30.520]  the evidence is now overwhelming this is a biological cancer virus attack 13
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:35.120]  different manufacturers of the Merck vaccine in a major test have been
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:41.560]  engineered it's not a mistake that the that the virus has been bound and at the
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:45.400]  virus is basically whole that was what doctors said five years ago this is not
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:51.360]  really new news has been bound to the aluminum adjuvant like it's just
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:55.440]  unspeakable what this is going to do to people and and and this whole thing this
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:58.040]  is what hit me this morning and again I've said this before I know it
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:04.040]  consciously but I cannot express to you enough this is a soft kill test all of
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:08.800]  the sis what do you think nerve-gassing thousands of us trips in
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:13.600]  hundreds of tests under Shad and other programs from the 40s through the 80s
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:20.560]  killing them killing them in many cases the mainstream news Reuters life
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:28.200]  magazine all reported on it to my film in game marching troops into a chamber
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:33.840]  telling them we're testing tear gas on you you signed a waiver spraying them
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:40.160]  with nerve gas this is just one famous case that they did a whole bunch the
[1:27:40.160 --> 1:27:45.440]  person flops around and dies the army dissects their body and sends letters
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:48.640]  home to their wives and children and mothers and fathers saying they died of
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:55.040]  the flu of course the people running the government are putting cancer
[1:27:55.040 --> 1:28:04.200]  viruses and vaccines of course and we just sit here and take it and the
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:08.840]  nerve-gassing and the radiologicals and the biologicals on the ships and that
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:12.000]  making the troops sit in holes and dropping atomic bombs on them a
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:15.920]  quarter mile away and seeing what it would do to them and blocking people
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:20.200]  getting health care who were in the radiation-ridden uranium mines and
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:25.840]  and blocking the first responders from 9-11 this is a religion of abusing
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:31.320]  heroes of sacrificing them like the Aztecs highest form of sacrifice was a
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:39.960]  warrior and creating cadres of scientists who get off on using troops
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:46.400]  like getting pigs and the 4,000 plus declassified foster children radiated to
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:49.960]  death if you're a new listener tuning in it's like well it didn't polite to bring

[1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:11.720]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:15.200]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:19.760]  this influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:25.040]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:29.560]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:34.240]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:38.280]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:41.960]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:47.040]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:07.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:32:07.640 --> 1:32:11.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control
[1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:15.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:19.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:23.880]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:32.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:36.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:40.360]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:47.400]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:53.000]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:01.080]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:33:07.320 --> 1:33:14.240]  all right head CJ Jonathan Corey Matthew everybody I'm gonna get to your calls
[1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:17.520]  here in a moment when you hear a call or disconnect that's your chance to join
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:24.920]  us on air we'd love to hear from you 800-259-9231 I do not feel worthy
[1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:31.000]  tonight with an info war special report in between doing other TV interviews and
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:36.400]  other work to even try to present to you the information that I'm gonna cover
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:44.040]  some of the next hour but it is a fact that every major vaccine that's been
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:51.440]  produced when it's studied is found to have cancer viruses added to it added
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:34:01.080]  to the adjuvant and that it's binding to the human DNA and it's a fact that
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:07.480]  cancer is growing off the chart in a hyperbolic curve diabetes neurological
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:13.320]  disorders we are being murdered and humans are so tough humans are designed
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:17.280]  to muddle through things as people are dying around us and as long as our
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:21.160]  leaders tell us that only dancing with the stars and the NFL is important I
[1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:26.600]  can't sit in restaurants I listen to talk radio if I go to a church just all
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:29.680]  I hear is that's right they're four-year-old daughters die out of the
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:34.000]  brain tumor you're standing there with the bell hop at a hotel and you hear
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:44.440]  him whispering you know going yeah yeah yeah my cousin's dying of cancer he's only 22 and then most
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:49.000]  people in the office have got young friends dying of cancer Rob do's had
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.640]  multiple friends in his bands young women you name it die of cancer I mean
[1:34:52.640 --> 1:35:01.480]  just there's murder going on all around me I want to go to your calls and I look
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:07.240]  at my little innocent daughters and I think about these people running this
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:15.520]  government who want to inject them with cancer viruses and we know it always
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:20.000]  caused autoimmune disorders that was the majority of quote adverse reactions
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:26.920]  that's that's the real trait that they want God knows what it's really designed
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:35.440]  to do and they would boldly come out and have a governor run a military hoax a
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:44.320]  military style hoax and say it's the law you've got to take this shot and I came
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:49.240]  out on air and I said it is not the law here is the state and federal code he's
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:53.200]  put on the list of recommended health department shots that's their policy to
[1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:58.400]  ask you to take but then they lie to you and tell you it's the law these are bad
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:05.320]  people it'd be bad if it was the law but this isn't even the law they're lying
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:10.880]  to you and it killed a bunch of people and it caused autoimmune disorders here's
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:13.960]  all these medical doctors interviewed here's these local newscasts around the
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:19.280]  country and other countries from the trials it's the same thing blood
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:28.760]  convulsions paralyzed death and that murderer Rick Perry that Judas Iscariot
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:35.720]  for that little bag of silver who I now learn knows all about the New World Order
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:42.360]  and used to tell people about it in the late 90s when he was agriculture
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:49.880]  commissioner here in Austin he knows all of this and literally decided to do it
[1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:53.880]  what a test will you be the only governor we can get to come out and lie
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:57.440]  and say it's the law to take this will make billions in Texas alone and they
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:00.200]  bought off most of his political operatives his campaign people let's
[1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:04.080]  it's all come out in the news even associated presses reported on it you
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:09.800]  know Perry Gardasil Perry Merc ties run deep let's put it up it's AP headline
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:14.200]  they won't believe it that was from four years ago and then we watched the
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:17.560]  maiming and the death and then they said well yeah we give it to millions it'll
[1:37:17.560 --> 1:37:20.840]  protect them from cancer and there'll be some adverse reactions but it's a cost
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:28.000]  benefit analysis that itself is a hoax autoimmune impaired people who are
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:32.680]  generally old if they don't get the pap smear and a scraping if they do have it
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:38.520]  sometimes can get it terminal 4,000 a year the rarest form of cancer in the
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:42.640]  United States of standard cancer and those are probably inflated numbers I've
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:46.280]  talked to medical doctors it's more like a thousand a lot of times it's well
[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:52.400]  they for lack of a better word it's it's a crack addicts generally lowest room
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:57.920]  drug addicts who are on the street crack horse is the medical doctors I've talked
[1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:01.200]  to is mainly who they see dying of this because they're not even eating food yeah
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:05.480]  there it is and something's going on with that computer system in there is it
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:10.680]  blown out for you like that like I like it is yeah we're gonna need to get that
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:14.240]  new on a different computer we got to pull that computer out of service it's
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:18.840]  for a couple weeks that's no longer serviceable we'd like that because you
[1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:23.160]  can't see anything on it that's the Washington post about Perry and his
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:29.520]  merc ties running deep is there a way to get the headline now what we need to try
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:35.960]  is to remove that computer I mean when something's broken we got to remove it
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:40.440]  and again I got to be careful here folks because I become violently angry when I
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:44.360]  start talking about this and thinking about this
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:52.480]  they consciously knew and so of course the leader like well we won't give you
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:56.040]  the next president you're cold-blooded killer
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:39:00.760]  can I see the actual headline on it
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:09.480]  Perry's financial ties to merc run deep that's out of the Washington post I saw
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:13.920]  that exact headline he must write for the Associated Press as well and it breaks
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:19.400]  it down oh that's a September 14th 2011 I guess he actually took the exact
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:25.240]  headline of the Associated Press from 2007 out of Texas so I guess Dan Egan
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:35.080]  I guess just thought up the exact same headline for a new article or he wrote
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:39.520]  the same headline years ago or he took that name it doesn't matter thank you
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:47.720]  just wanted to show people that article now all right I said I get into this the
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:52.200]  next hour I want to succinctly in the focused way I was ready to give a
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:56.680]  powerful focused speech from my heart this morning at about 8 a.m. I was so
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:59.120]  ready
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:10.240]  and just like they ran that hoax to say that Dr. Wakefield's been completely
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:13.600]  discredited when it's admitted that it was just a complete hoax that he's
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:16.960]  discredited and it's now admitted that it's a hoax and they've had to retract
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:20.720]  but that was in the back of the paper not in the front of the paper that Ed
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:24.080]  Asner goes well I guess my family two different family members of autism
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:29.440]  didn't get it from the MMR because Wakefield's been discredited just like
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:32.320]  they had one of the big Merck connected people come out over the weekend and
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:40.720]  say hey I'll give you $10,000 Bachman if you can prove that somebody ever got
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:46.120]  damaged by Gardasil when they admit in the CDC and Aaron covered this last night
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:49.040]  I'm gonna get more into it tonight on the nightly news and in the next hour I'm
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:55.400]  gonna cover it it's admitted that it's had tens of thousands of horrible
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:02.360]  adverse reactions and conservatively hundreds of deaths and it causes auto
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:07.680]  immune disorders bleeding all sorts of different autoimmune diseases early on
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:13.280]  set of arthritis inflammation in the joints this is all confirmed I mean
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:18.080]  people take these shots and in some cases die in minutes in fact I'm gonna
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:24.760]  play that sky television clip again I just typed in girl died after Gardasil
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:28.320]  shot and this morning I couldn't even watch them all I was looking for newscast
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:34.280]  I saw during the trials in 06 and 07 and there were had to be a 50 60 70 of them
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:37.960]  then because I'd air them here and warn people but nobody else is really talking
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:48.920]  about it but regional local news and I found all these new ones I've never seen
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:56.320]  it was just like page after page after page CBC British TV US television a lot
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:00.200]  of times they don't even make it out of the room they're dead in minutes I mean
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:07.120]  they die they just go up not not related like being run over by a truck and your
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:10.920]  guts are all over the highway you're saying not related then they had other
[1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:14.720]  medical doctors that come out and say no this woman can't talk she's paralyzed
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:20.280]  it's a extreme form of Gion beret which is in the drug insert I mean H1N1 all
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:26.480]  these shots says Gion beret but whenever but we expose them and you go to the big
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:31.480]  pharma outfit the Walgreens or the CVS or whatever the case is they'll have
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:35.280]  little fact sheets oh here's fact sheets honey that that's burned out by the
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:40.040]  company and it just says no problems no but nothing ever happened here take this
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:44.280]  you want a vaccine party we'll come to your house at a party and shoot all of
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:48.320]  you up that's the new billboards I'm saying and you ought to get a
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:51.840]  prescription they're like hey you want a vaccine I'm like no thank you want one
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:58.680]  for shingles no I I'll just be healthy you know I won't get the flesh-eating
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:03.840]  herpes that's what it is basically and and they're just like are you sure we'll
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:07.560]  come to your house we'll come have a vaccine party they use the word party
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:14.880]  it's a psychological warfare thing they're reading off the manual it's a
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:23.880]  vaccine party yeah it's a party and Bill Gates has come out and said you don't
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:28.240]  want to be vaccinated we're gonna release mosquitoes loaded with the
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:32.400]  biological pathogen but we don't call it a biological virus that goes in and
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:38.800]  reprograms the brain or other tissues because it's not even a vaccine a
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:43.400]  vaccine is you know a little bit the denatured of what it is you're wanting
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:47.840]  to get an immunity to you know a little of something bad which there's some real
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:52.680]  science there the problem is you've got eugenesis that can't be trusted who are
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:59.880]  loading up all this garbage into it that's the issue and now they're calling
[1:43:59.880 --> 1:44:07.160]  it vaccines a live cancer virus I read the drug insert during the trials five
[1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:11.400]  years ago and it was a live cancer virus and I'd say that some doctors would
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:15.880]  say well no Alex it's the protein of the virus and I'd say I'm sorry doctor I've
[1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:20.400]  read the actual insert and I've talked to other medical doctors who said no it's
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:25.920]  pretty much the entire virus and now it comes out it is and it's not just the
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:30.800]  whole virus that's been slightly manipulated to quote not be completely
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:36.320]  live attached to aluminum that supercharges it and then binds it into
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:41.600]  the rest of the tissues it's like a missile system the adjuvant is a
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:45.520]  missile system to carry the warhead
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:56.320]  rush to require cancer shot threatens to promote backlash they just brought me an
[1:44:56.320 --> 1:45:00.200]  old story us today thanks to vaccines devastating disease such as smallpox
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:05.800]  pallium and virtually eradicated the US they wouldn't have happened in states
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:09.320]  hadn't required immunizations for serious contagious vaccines hadn't
[1:45:09.320 --> 1:45:13.240]  required not the law they just say required which they know fools most
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:18.200]  people before a child can attend school now there's a new vaccine was the
[1:45:18.200 --> 1:45:22.960]  potential to prevent cervical cancer that kills 3,700 women each year in the
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:28.880]  US called Gardasil it's manufactured by Merck it goes on to say governor Rick
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:32.640]  Perry is so enthusiastic about Gardasil that we could go he ordered all girls in
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:37.320]  the state to be immunized before entering the sixth grade but see we called
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:40.720]  him on this and he had to say oh I don't have the power and now he says in the
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:51.000]  speeches it's recommended see there you are oh I just recommended it and now
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:58.320]  it's coming out all over the news that they paid off the California legislature
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:03.160]  all right I said I'd go to your calls I'll get to this next hour I don't want
[1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:07.560]  to cover this and not cover it with precision and hit all the points the
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:15.240]  magnitude of this murdering killers run the major big pharma companies and give
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:20.600]  money to eugenics organizations the eugenics organizations were founded by
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:25.120]  big pharma that was owned and run by the British royalty Dutch royalty Roth
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:29.840]  Childs and Rockefellers the Rockefellers in the 20s discovered with their
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:36.080]  scientific firms it's all on record that cancer was viral most cancer is from
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:41.480]  viruses the Daily Mail in fact guys pull this up they have video headline
[1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:46.600]  electron microscope shows white blood cells eating cancer viruses no eating
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:52.120]  cancer cells but see when they flood your body with all this with adjuvants and
[1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:57.760]  all these different cancer viruses tied in with other DNA baby DNA from fetal
[1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:02.120]  tissue you name it your body stops your body can only get up and fight so many
[1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:06.520]  fights it's awesome but it keeps getting hit and it keeps getting hit it's only
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:10.680]  got so many hits it can take and finally your immune system just gives up
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:14.320]  starts fighting in all directions at first and you have all these disorders
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:18.840]  all these joint problems all these intestinal problems all this horrible
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:25.000]  stuff happens and finally just gives up and you die of cancer they played that
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.840]  doctor that helped develop the polio shot with Dr. Sot from CBC last Friday I
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:33.800]  played that many times and the YouTube clip they found was one that had like
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:38.920]  text over it and stuff you ought to find the raw CBC like I think we'll find
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:42.880]  that we've played it years ago and we should do that in a nightly news piece
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:49.040]  where the scientist unedited goes into and I said you know that this is all got
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:52.880]  cancer viruses they all laugh about it and have a little celebration and you
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:55.960]  could pull up the US government documents where they talk about hundreds of
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:48:00.600]  millions of Americans being given cancer viruses in some cases more than 40
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:06.800]  different ones in every polio vaccine by the way it's still going on and
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:12.280]  leukemia virus is everything and then you wonder why all these kids are getting
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:15.320]  leukemia I'm gonna tell you again I've had medical doctors on this show you've
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:19.000]  heard them every one of them agrees people that were just trained 30 years
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.480]  ago some of them are older and 50 years ago like Dr. Stan Montief he will tell
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:29.800]  you that when he went to medical school they would put you on a train as a
[1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:37.600]  medical student graduate who was in you know finalizing their their degree
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:44.520]  working in hospitals they would put them on a train and later on planes and fly
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:49.400]  them thousands of miles to see a child with cancer you would walk in and there
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:54.000]  would be men in lab coats everywhere and went and just like this is this is in
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:59.440]  you know incredible the studying the rareness it was like a four-leaf clover
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:03.600]  to the medical community now it's just death to the left death to the right
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:08.800]  kids shaved heads eyes children's eyes when they're getting their death burn
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:14.160]  was so much life right before death not not not as they're sick and feeling

[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:54.160]  them is because people didn't realize the level of evil they were dealing with
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:59.360]  and tyrants have learned how to hide things in your food your water your
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:07.600]  vaccines how to cowards kill they weaken they poison that's what a soft kill is

[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:20.000]  religion of soft kill why do some people like to grab kids off the street and
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.640]  torture them and kill them or you know grab a cat throw it in a garbage can and
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:30.160]  set it on fire run over somebody it's those type of people that run things but

[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:08.720]  style false flag news dealing with the underwear bomber who he witnessed the
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:12.920]  US government getting on the plane and we're gonna get into Gardasil I'm gonna
[1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:16.800]  start really hammering this big report tonight I'm gonna do more in the next hour
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:20.000]  after we get through these calls. Ed in North Carolina thanks for holding her on
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:25.400]  the air. Hey how's it going Alex? Oh I'm doing all right but it's really shaking me
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:28.520]  up that even though they've been caught killing people with this Gardasil and
[1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:34.640]  maiming others California is set to inject the kids without parents consent
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:37.840]  I didn't even know about this till I heard Wakefield on Friday I went and
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:41.960]  read the bill over the weekend and sure enough it's true it's on the governor's
[1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:50.320]  desk. Jesus. Yeah. Not good at all. Well it shows you how authoritarian these
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:57.480]  people are. Yeah it's insane just saying California you never expect that you
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:01.240]  shouldn't expect that but I guess we're all on the same page now we're being
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:05.360]  controlled by people that are secretive enough and powerful enough. Well yeah
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:09.480]  California is really woken up to vaccines I've seen statistics but even in
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:14.320]  the Washington Post of upwards of 70% in the highest educated areas don't
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:17.520]  vaccinate their children and so the system just says they're gonna take
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:22.560]  your kids and do it anyways. I'm sorry what you calling about? I just had a few
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:27.560]  points basically it's nothing really on the topic today I think you pretty well
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:31.960]  covered it and I think it's a very important topic and I definitely share
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:35.640]  your... Brother we're all over the map that's why we take calls this isn't a
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:40.080]  standard talk show go ahead what's your point? Basically I just wanted to
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:45.760]  support Ron Paul and I see the Republican nomination trying to block him in
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:50.840]  any way possible. Yeah but he now just won the California straw poll Perry had
[1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:53.720]  the Texas straw poll canceled because it would have embarrassed him that's not
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:58:01.760]  coming out. The website called americanselect.org they are paying to put a
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:07.200]  third-party nominee on the ballot 50 states so if we get all the Ron Paul
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:10.840]  supporters on there you answer about I think they have four or five hundred
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:15.800]  different questions about everything you can think of on there and then in fall
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:20.000]  sometime in the next month or two they're gonna start having candidates to vote for
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:25.400]  so that's... Well I gotta tell you I've talked to Ron Paul he is not gonna run
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:29.840]  his third party he's doing this with the Republican system that's his best shot
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:34.120]  and if not he's gonna go to Congress for one more year and then retire but good
[1:58:34.120 --> 1:58:38.000]  points all right I'm gonna keep going to your calls till this this bank of him's

[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:40.400]  news I'm gonna have but let's finish up with these calls have been holding
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:50.680]  always enjoy hearing from you CJ and Michigan you're on the air hey CJ buddy
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:58.680]  welcome okay let's go to Jonathan and Kansas Jonathan you're on the air yes
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:06.920]  Alex I have a few news articles one about Taliban another one about something
[2:01:06.920 --> 2:01:11.880]  I know you feel like we're in the matrix well this is something that will remind
[2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:18.720]  you that we are in a matrix and another one which is about Google Street View
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:24.040]  and there's one video but I'm gonna go really quick to it quick so I don't want
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:29.200]  to take up too much of your time okay the one about news article that will
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:33.280]  remind you you're in the matrix do you remember in the matrix they said about
[2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:40.720]  liquefying the dead well in the BBC there's a news article saying new body
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:46.280]  liquid liquefaction unit meaning that human bodies to dispose of them instead
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:51.560]  of cremation they're advocating for this new system of liquefying human bodies
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:56.080]  yeah because burning them is carbon evil and so you can't even have the death
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:02:01.160]  ritual the death right you want because burning something as bad you've got to
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:05.440]  get a permit from these sickoes are pay attacks I did see that in fact guys
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:10.920]  print that for me I what was the headline again uh go to BBC and put in
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:19.020]  body liquefaction like liquefying is liq not I got it I got it I got it body
[2:02:19.020 --> 2:02:24.740]  liquefaction thank you what was the next thing okay the next thing is about how
[2:02:24.740 --> 2:02:30.400]  Google Street View snapped pictures of a naked woman in Florida and it was on
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:37.040]  her property. Yeah, I saw that as it was a naked black lady. Yeah, that was one. Another one
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:47.280]  is about, um, let's see, it's about how Taliban former president Barhundi or a Barhan Nandan
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:52.960]  Robini, he was assassinated because he was supposedly going to negotiate with the Taliban
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:58.400]  and he was stalled this negotiation because he was killed by a bomber with a bomb in his
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:05.920]  turban. So how convenient, right? It's all ridiculous. You can't believe a word of it.
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:14.880]  I also have a video. Are you still there? Yep. Okay. The video is, you remember how you were
[2:03:14.880 --> 2:03:21.040]  in the documentary, The Rise of the New Right? Well, and they was talking about how they falsely
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:29.360]  claimed erroneously that you inciting violence. Yes. What about Obama supporting Jimmy Hoffa
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:34.960]  saying, let's take these SOBs out. You remember that? And they've since had unions take over and
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:40.720]  hold people hostage and beat people up and break things. But that's a okay because that's something
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:44.720]  the government wants to happen right now because they want the unions to think government's their
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:53.360]  friend when it's actually the opposite. But sure, go ahead and play the clip. Oh, the clip?
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:03:59.120]  Yeah, you said you had a video clip you wanted to play. No, no, I don't think you guys could
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:04.240]  hear it anyway. But the video, you could just look it up on YouTube and just say Jimmy Hoffa.
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:10.080]  No, no, he did it two weeks ago. I remember. Yeah. Well, I mean, it got big national news. He said,
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:17.440]  let's take these SOBs out. I remember. Okay, do you also have, did you find the article about the
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:25.200]  Afghan president yet? Because the former president, because I don't know, I was thinking that it was
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:30.640]  just convenient. Well, yeah, I mean, who knows. Look, over in Afghanistan, you got a bunch of
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:35.840]  tribes killing each other over opium. And before that, if you go back 300 years ago, they were
[2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:41.840]  killing each other over the silk route out of China into Eastern Western Europe, all the pottery,
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:49.520]  the different silks, the different spices that the West wanted to pay for. And so they're always
[2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:53.600]  going to be killing each other. And that's the way it is. The only reason our government has,
[2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:58.480]  quote, our troops there is to control and cultivate the opium so they can run it up your
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:09.440]  children's veins will be right back. tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become
[2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:15.440]  reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:21.200]  the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:27.440]  network of FEMA cares now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:32.480]  government program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the
[2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:37.520]  sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world
[2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:44.160]  of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras
[2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:49.360]  on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police
[2:05:49.360 --> 2:05:56.640]  state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the

[2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:13.760]  life is different now for all of us, isn't it? Very different. People are using this great food to
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:19.040]  survive the present hurricane season and we've already had 40 billion dollars worth of damage
[2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:24.240]  from floods, storms, quakes and droughts. And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:29.600]  Natural disasters are newsworthy but only touch a few of us Americans. The huge issue of the
[2:06:29.600 --> 2:06:34.960]  greatest depression is on everyone's mind. The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses
[2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:40.560]  and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American so everyone needs food security. Folks,

[2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:06.480]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:11.600]  America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:15.840]  shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:20.800]  own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:25.920]  he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[2:07:25.920 --> 2:07:31.520]  biggest small owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:36.000]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:41.200]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:45.360]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know including simple
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:51.760]  steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:58.160]  That's End of America, the number three.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:29.360]  We had a very thought-provoking and revealing and down-to-earth interview with
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:36.960]  Hollywood and TV legend Ed Asner in the first hour today. I'm taking your phone calls right now
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:44.000]  and then I'll continue into other news. We had a caller who just called in about this article.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:50.320]  New Body Liquification Unit unveiled in Florida Funeral Home and you guessed it. They want to ban
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:55.520]  being able to have your body cremated because it creates carbon dioxide which is evil and so again
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:08:58.960]  it's about taking control of every facet. First the toilets, the light bulbs, and the washing
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:03.760]  machines. Then a fire in your own fireplace. Germany's trying to ban those outdoor space
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:09.440]  heaters. It's a total dictatorship over all human activity including the air you exhale the New
[2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:15.360]  York Times says a tax is needed on that. The makers claim the process produces a third less
[2:09:15.360 --> 2:09:20.640]  greenhouse gas than cremation uses a seventh of the energy and allows the complete separation
[2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:28.000]  of dental amalgam for safe disposal. Mercury from amalgam vaporized in the crematorium
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:33.280]  is blamed for 60 percent of UK airborne mercury emissions and many UK crematoria
[2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:38.240]  currently filtering mercury filtration systems to meet reduced emission targets. So just more
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:44.240]  harassment all day. Absolutely ridiculous. All you gotta do is run the smoke through water and
[2:09:44.240 --> 2:09:51.040]  then it takes out all the mercury. That's called a scrubber. Then all the GMO contamination that's
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:55.840]  just fine and mercury in shots with the government lying and saying it's the law you gotta take it
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:00.160]  that's okay. Now I want to take some more calls and get into some other geopolitical news.
[2:10:01.040 --> 2:10:05.680]  Then I want to start getting into Gardasil some more with a focus report. I want to play part
[2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:10.320]  of InfoWars Nightly News last night with Dr. Russell Blalock coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:18.560]  By the way we're going to start something new in the future. We'll be streaming
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:26.240]  at prisonplanet.tv and infowarsnews.com 24-7. We'll of course have the premiere each night of
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:31.360]  the nightly news and then afterwards it will stream consecutively after that and then also
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:39.040]  then an hour or two be archived as a MP4 and different systems. We've had a couple different
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:44.160]  streaming services some of the biggest out there and we have hiccups in certain areas of the country
[2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:50.640]  or certain browsers. So we've added three different streams, three different streams with different
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:11:02.480]  companies, different systems, CDN server and the vaunted devil cloud. So there's three different
[2:11:02.480 --> 2:11:09.120]  ways for the stream and remember this is a beta test. It is amazing how many people are tuning
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:14.480]  in, how many folks are watching, I get calls every day saying why aren't you on national tv yet?
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:18.400]  Well it's taken me years to get the money in the capital to build this to train the people to set
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:24.000]  this up. We're beta testing with prisonplanet.tv members. You are literally funding us getting
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.120]  this message out the next level. You are paying our way by supporting us. We're not like the government
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:34.240]  who takes your money and then uses it against you. If you want to be a member 15 cents a day,
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:40.160]  5.95 a month, prisonplanet.tv and I want to thank the people that have become members. We are
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:47.280]  right on target for what we need to have the moderate expansion and build out to finish the
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:53.520]  show, develop new shows and really start having two or three new shows every day with other hosts,
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:12:01.280]  other reporters. That's my plan. I've got to pay for the fiber optic uplinks that syndicate tv.
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:05.680]  They don't really use satellite anymore. You can do a satellite uplink then send it up
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:10.320]  but then it's still got to go through another system. You can have the show basically streamed
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:14.400]  over fiber optic just like satellite with a one second delay technically live
[2:12:15.600 --> 2:12:19.440]  and I've been talking to experts about that and working on that. The point is we need to learn
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:27.040]  to walk before we run with tv. An example of that is they had two computers die Friday and a comedy
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:32.400]  of other errors and they didn't even get the show on to the next day and now we've built more redundant
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:37.680]  computers and gotten in some of the other systems and added more streaming systems because I knew I
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:42.160]  was surprised it took two weeks to have some kind of disaster because we're doing this on our own.
[2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:47.200]  We don't have big consultants and big companies and with regular tv if you want to call in some
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:52.960]  big consulting company it's millions of dollars. We're having to do this with good with decent
[2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:57.840]  prosumer equipment but we're really reinventing the wheel because we don't want to be part of
[2:12:57.840 --> 2:13:05.680]  that mainline system. So the crew's doing an exemplary job but we are just getting the kinks
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:10.000]  out working the bugs out and in a way that's better because some nights the show's two hours long
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:16.080]  other nights it's 45 minutes long. I've never done the targeted 30 minutes for prisonplanet.tv
[2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:20.800]  but once tv wants to carry it and that now a lot of tv is telling me well we want an hour.
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:24.880]  I don't know if we can produce really with hard hitting reports and on the street and
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:28.080]  everything an hour every night but it's probably gonna be 30 minutes at first and then
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:32.880]  the 30 minute show will end with the news brief then we'll say special report next
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:39.040]  and then go into another 30 minute maybe long form but I'm working on a lot of things right now.
[2:13:40.640 --> 2:13:44.480]  If you do believe in what we're doing though become a prisonplanet.tv member today because
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:51.360]  we're certainly already having a big effect and if we get even more members I'll be able to grow
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:56.560]  even faster and that is our target goal. Also when I go on the road I'm gonna start doing
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:01.200]  more speaking engagements we will stream it for prisonplanet.tv members everywhere we go.
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:07.600]  We're doing behind the scenes stuff. I haven't really announced or done a tour yet of the RV we
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:12.960]  bought so that I don't have to get groped by the TSA as we can draw attention to that and so I can
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:17.840]  also then hit like two or three affiliates and do the show from the road either from the radio
[2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:24.960]  station or from the RV and I went up to Hot Springs Arkansas this weekend went to Hope Arkansas
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:29.840]  to Bill Clinton's birthplace and went inside the birthplace and did Bill Clinton limitations to the
[2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:36.960]  to the National Forest Service who runs its anger that's going to be out this week.
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:43.200]  We did some research on the Rockefellers and whiskey running with the Kennedys and Capone
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:47.200]  even their mainline historical society is aware of that there. I'm working on getting some of
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:54.160]  those historians on how the official water of the U.S. with the U.S. government would actually
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:15:01.040]  ship Moonshine all over the country working with some of the best actual spring water out there
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:05.280]  but they would put it in the spring water bottles and put it on government certified trains. The
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:10.240]  government banned alcohol so they could ship it in and control it. The Rockefellers were making
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:14.240]  a hundred million a month according to the historians there. They were all running it out of
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:23.200]  Hot Springs as their control arm so that's why I went there for that and I've got those reports
[2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:28.240]  and okay let's go to your phone calls. Corey in North Carolina you're on the air welcome.
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:34.480]  Hey Alex thanks for having me on the show. I want to tell a story just to contribute to the show.
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:38.320]  I sort of need your permission for time. I know you have a lot of people.
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:41.120]  Now go ahead and tell your story. You've been waiting. We got time. Go ahead.
[2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:48.480]  Okay this is related to the NFL thing. I was actually at a college football game two weeks ago
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:54.000]  and it was about half time and I went downstairs to the concession stand to get a water for my
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:16:00.560]  girlfriend who was feeling ill. It happened to be very hot at the stadium so I had my shirt off.
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:07.440]  I was obviously had been in the stadium before and as I came up the stairs with my water I saw
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:12.080]  a security person standing at the top. This didn't seem too unnatural because they have
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:17.760]  security at stadiums all the time so I walked right past. Well as I walk up the stairs I feel
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:24.320]  a tap on my shoulder. I turn around she says I need to see your ticket. I say okay so I look
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:30.000]  through my pocket and I don't have my ticket. So I tell her I don't have my ticket. I've been
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:35.920]  legally checked in and I'm sorry that I can't find it. She says well you have to leave and I say
[2:16:35.920 --> 2:16:41.120]  leave what? And she says you have to leave the game and I said ma'am I have been checked in.
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:46.800]  They scanned it. I obviously have been here. I had my shirt off. I went downstairs to get a water
[2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:51.440]  and I'm coming back upstairs and I don't think I have to leave and she says sir you have to listen
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:59.120]  to what I have to say and I say with all due respect no I don't because you're a police officer
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:04.000]  but I am a customer here. I have paid for my ticket. I can take you up and introduce you
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:10.880]  to the people I'm with and I'm here completely legally. She says come with me right now. She
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:19.440]  grabs my arm. I pull away and I say no no. She reaches for her radio says we need assistance
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:24.480]  in the sector whatever and I say ma'am we don't need assistance. I am being reasonable with you
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:32.320]  and she reaches for her taser and I say are you going to taze me? At this point there are people
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:38.880]  watching. I say are you going to taze me for this? And she says sir you're not listening to what I have
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:43.520]  to say. I'm the police. I'm the authority and I say you need to tell me what law I've broken
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:49.600]  or I am walking away. She makes this long story shorter. I happen to have my ticket in my back
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:55.520]  pocket so I got out of it but honestly Alex if she had pulled out that taser I don't know what would
[2:17:55.520 --> 2:18:01.600]  have happened. Well look let me break this down. It was like the top archaeologist at his university
[2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:06.960]  up in Michigan. They said I want to eliminate for my daughter and they delivered the hard
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:10.800]  lemonade which by the way I've been at parties before and thought it was lemonade and it has like
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:16.800]  vodka in it and his daughter took one drink and so he complained and said give me another one and
[2:18:16.800 --> 2:18:21.840]  they said oh but you opened it and he said well yeah she took a drink. They called the police arrested
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:28.800]  him took her did a blood test no alcohol but this new culture is about a religion of bossing you
[2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:33.200]  around letting you know you're little letting you know you're scum and it's in these football
[2:18:33.200 --> 2:18:41.600]  stadiums malls airports are the new cathedrals of worshiping this and they will taser pregnant women
[2:18:42.640 --> 2:18:48.320]  that argue with a cop in any way. They will beat you to death for no reason. They will arrest you
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:54.960]  for videotaping in public. I was at a Willie Nelson concert. I'm friends with Willie. I wanted to take
[2:18:54.960 --> 2:19:00.800]  my wife and friends out and the kids to the rodeo to see Willie Nelson play. Everybody's taking photos
[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:06.400]  there's no signs you can't take photos and video and I'm in one of the nice boxes and a security
[2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:10.960]  guard runs up and says give me that camera and I said well look everybody else is taping and it
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:14.640]  turned out they knew who I was it was some weird form of harassment and they said you're not allowed
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:20.800]  to tape and I said well okay I said I'll just erase it and they said no I want to I'm going to take
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:25.680]  your camera and you're going to be thrown out of here and I said you need and I did my you know
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:31.600]  angry focus voice I said listen to me very carefully you may win this exchange on your petty
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:37.680]  power trip but you're going to end up being sued by me do you understand now get police now
[2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:42.320]  and the state police came over and I talked to them like that and I said you can beat the rap
[2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:46.240]  but you're not going to beat the ride this person's a control freak I'm going to go sit back down
[2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:51.760]  I'm not going to erase this everybody else is filming and that's how it is they said yes sir
[2:19:51.760 --> 2:19:56.960]  now that's how you got to talk to them but I was ready to have the confrontation that's why
[2:19:56.960 --> 2:20:02.800]  they backed off and I told them what was coming at the end of the ride optics planet.com is where

[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:55.440]  didn't like it i'd rather be fishing or something or go to a regular restaurant and get a beer back
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:00.800]  when i was in college i'd get drugged by girlfriends or whatever to some club with loud music there'd
[2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:05.200]  be some giant steroid guy at the door and i started noticing if you were with really good looking
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:09.360]  women they'd try to hey you got a problem punk even though you wouldn't be looking like no or
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:13.840]  they'd say that to my friends and it's like good because i'll you know get out of here if you

[2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:26.000]  powerful uh standing around at some club and they basically take that type of individual
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:30.640]  and put them in power in fact we've got an article i want to cover this now and then go back to

[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:51.600]  don't burn your hand and it looks like something kind of the iconography of the 1984 book put into
[2:25:51.600 --> 2:25:57.040]  the movie with this big 1950s style all seeing eyes remember a few years ago in england they had big
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:04.000]  transit authority uh underground metro signs that said safe under the watchful line it showed
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:10.240]  a pyramid with a with a single line same thing here if you see something say something and
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:16.240]  it turns out they're paying uh to have uh coffee shops you see there's a lot of coffee shops they'll
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:22.080]  have an they'll get free paper sleeves but it has an advertisement on it and that's what they've got
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:26.640]  now is see something say something so it's all about you watch a football game jan and apolitano
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:32.240]  is there telling you to watch your neighbor she physically is there with the nfl head or the head
[2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:38.880]  of the national baseball league she's there on jumbo trons she's there on the commercials uh
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:45.200]  she's there at walmart she's at mall of america she's there everywhere she's there at the city park
[2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:49.520]  on a big jumbo tron they have that in many parks now they're telling you don't trust your neighbors
[2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:54.880]  here's a psa shows white people everywhere blowing stuff up good minorities reporting them
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:59.120]  it's all about playing us off against each other the rebranding now they're saying they're going
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:05.920]  to flash wanted people on the big telescreens directly out of the running man and so the caller
[2:27:05.920 --> 2:27:12.480]  is saying and i've been at a uh early fall football game i've been to a ut football game about this
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:17.440]  time of year where it's during the day it's about 120 degrees and i was in great shape
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:22.560]  in college and i feel like i was going to pass out just roasting and taking my shirt off and just
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:28.720]  sitting there in the heat and uh you know you lose your ticket not being reasonable not taking you
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:33.200]  up the guy sounded well spoken and i like he's a hooligan or something not going up saying yeah he's
[2:27:33.200 --> 2:27:38.960]  with us and you know seeing the tickets or whatever and then well we're sorry sir we have a policy
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:43.920]  need to go it's that immediate no you're not going to go look for your ticket no and he's like oh my
[2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:51.840]  gosh actually here it is it's this need to jump on you because the bankers are social engineering
[2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:56.480]  they've bankrupted the economy we're going into total implosion and they need to get their hands
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:01.200]  on your body they need to have federally funded checkpoints nationwide taken blood without warrants
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:06.880]  they need to get you ready to get in your body bill clinton put it in the law as an executive order
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.120]  didn't implement it till this year they've now begun in multiple states taking blood to get a
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:17.440]  driver's license but at first it's get your license for free wave the couple hundred dollars
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:24.400]  if you opt in to the dna database you see how they do that
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:32.000]  my first film 1997 has the executive order i go to the dmv i bring it up they laugh at me
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:38.800]  it's on the federal books and so all of this getting their hands on you is about forced
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:44.640]  inoculation they tried to get police in 2002 and firefighters to be part of the
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:50.720]  model states health emergency powers act they didn't hide it they said we're training all 50
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:56.880]  states forced inoculation during a pandemic to take you to the emergency center the police would
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:02.480]  not take it the firefighters they said at a 14 million first responders the la times reported
[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:09.040]  a couple thousand took it it was less than a percentage point you can look up the numbers
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:16.800]  and so they went to a new mode all these new movies that are out every month a new movie about a
[2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:23.120]  pandemic the government saving you with vaccines all this propaganda all this fear all this it's
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:28.400]  going to get you all this you got to take the shot and now california is saying we're going to give

[2:33:57.120 --> 2:34:04.160]  montana ladies and gentlemen tony montana we are live seven o'clock info wars nightly news
[2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:10.800]  okay i have a blind spot and it's with when something has such an incredible magnitude
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:16.560]  level to it i will tend to not cover it on the show by the way we have that clip from the beginning
[2:34:16.560 --> 2:34:22.320]  of that segment with dr. blaylock last night with erin good because i want it with erin's
[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:28.160]  intro in that report when i saw this report last night when i got home from out of town
[2:34:28.800 --> 2:34:35.920]  i was watching the restream it it made my brain explode in fractals of understanding
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:44.960]  that a it's about a hundred times worse than erin and douche said in the report but b that's no
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:50.480]  criticism of them because i don't know how to explain all their lies and duplicity but take 10 hours
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:58.240]  and the frustration and the anger and the research last night and again today
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:03.360]  just going back and re-pulling a lot of stuff i've researched over the years and then calling
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:09.280]  watson this morning and working with him to write this article and then i get up here to this three
[2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:19.520]  hour show and i'm i'm like smoke coming out of my ears in fact i wrote some notes on this
[2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:31.120]  number one the gardasil frontman and and and spokesman coming out and saying to the public
[2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:39.040]  that no one's ever been hurt from gardasil is just absolutely asinine it's absolutely and totally
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:48.000]  and completely ridiculous that's number one continuing here with
[2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:57.840]  the other points i just want to get it out here that we are winning and this is what
[2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:04.080]  blindsided me last night the fact that every republican candidate from mit romney to michelle
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:12.720]  bachman to ron paul and he's the guy that kicked it off are bringing this up that the crowds are
[2:36:12.720 --> 2:36:18.480]  booing perry and that the polls are showing that most people are angry about this that he lied and
[2:36:18.480 --> 2:36:25.360]  said you have to take a shot and his hoax is backfiring on them people are saying the government
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:31.200]  could order you to take a dangerous shot wow we don't like perry but but but again that was a lie
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:36.960]  as well this goes to the criminality from the school nurse up to the governor up to the cdc
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:42.960]  and so we should be very happy we're having an open debate about abolishing the federal reserve
[2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:47.520]  over 85 one will abolish it or at least audit it no one even know about the federal reserve 10
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:56.080]  years ago one out of a hundred might now it's 85 plus percent um the un over 80 hate it now and
[2:36:56.080 --> 2:37:01.520]  know it's criminal group the vast majority are angry at garter cell and murk and know it's killed
[2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:10.160]  a bunch of people perry is in trouble over it but again how do they respond to being attacked with
[2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:17.040]  bold outrageous in your face acting like they own the place con artist what's a con artist
[2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:25.120]  confidence artist it's the con it's burning made off it's landing on the helicopter it's
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:29.760]  having all the bling it's it's telling you everything's going to be great having a few
[2:37:29.760 --> 2:37:35.680]  followers along to tell you how again they have all these straight talking scientists
[2:37:35.680 --> 2:37:39.440]  who are all connected to murk and the rockefeller foundation which is really
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:43.680]  running billa millen gates foundation and all of this
[2:37:47.760 --> 2:37:50.640]  and again how does the billa millen gates foundation get away with all this
[2:37:50.640 --> 2:37:59.440]  they go to the major foundations the big church foundations and others and they actually tell
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:03.440]  them we're going to help save all these kids with shots and then the churches get behind it
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:10.160]  all these well-meaning idiots out there are the people empowering this and going come on
[2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:14.480]  they're not putting bad stuff in the shots how many times has government been caught
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:19.440]  adding polio and syphilis and everything else you can imagine to the shots and killing people by
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:26.160]  design and it wasn't about testing chemical and biological so that by killing a few kids millions
[2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:32.480]  could live in justifies the means that's the cover for the lower level people
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:41.520]  who are twisted but think they're doing good and who are on power trips the higher ups are looking
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:46.800]  for psychopath armies that will carry this out it's why every major government does these secret
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:52.800]  programs and then they find other scientists that will do it and put the older scientist in
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:57.440]  command of them and create these institutions and then promote these scientists who've been part of
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:06.080]  this into the national and international health services this is the issue not even yeah i thought
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:11.520]  i was going to come back today and talk about the nfl announcing 16.6 million people to be
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:16.960]  grobbed to condition the public to accept this to where then everybody's acclimated so they can now
[2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:21.600]  do it at checkpoints on the highway and everywhere else as you say well i just won't fly well i just
[2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:26.560]  won't go to a football game well now they're doing it at checkpoints and school proms this is the
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:34.000]  complete end of all liberty this is a globalist revolution against freedom this is the introduction
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:43.040]  of hardcore tyranny with a sickening candy coated packaging with people with npr trained lisping voices
[2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:48.320]  about now listen you're going to see your mommy again just don't scream when i take you out of
[2:39:48.320 --> 2:39:53.440]  this shopping mall you know they say the good psychopaths that like to kidnap kids they have
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:59.840]  an npr voice they walk over and go listen listen i'm going to kill your mommy if you scream or
[2:39:59.840 --> 2:40:05.360]  say anything you understand understand a lot of times kids will scream and run off but they
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:09.600]  just let them go and walk then they find the one that won't that's the child that gets tortured for
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:16.080]  six months and that's why they've all got an npr voice they all practice acting nerdly and weak
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:22.480]  to make you feel at ease and non-threatened you wonder why all these people act so niniish
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:33.760]  this is a trained affectation to keep you calm while they suck you dry okay they're like shh
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:40.400]  we're the government we just want to be reasonable nice old man nice old suit no there's not been
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:46.240]  one person hurt by Gardasil and it's the law you've got to take it okay don't listen to that man who's
[2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:53.360]  angry at us we're the nice men we're from the government we're from murk everything's all right
[2:40:54.240 --> 2:41:04.880]  everything's everything's going to be all right Dave please don't do that Dave i'm afraid Dave i'm
[2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:19.360]  afraid remember 2001 space Odyssey the howl 9 000 is trained to be real calm hello captain
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:25.760]  good to have you on board i've provided some music for your enjoyment
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:34.400]  after the howl 9 000 has killed the other astronauts trying to kill commander
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:39.680]  he gets into a service hatch from the outside of the craft and is starting to shut down the
[2:41:39.680 --> 2:41:45.520]  neural networks of the system and as he's turning it off how was the howl 9 000 talking to him
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:57.360]  Dave let's talk about this let's talk about this Dave i'm afraid Dave i'm afraid i'm afraid
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:05.680]  oh god i'd love to hear the new world order sing daisy i'd love to shut them down ladies and
[2:42:05.680 --> 2:42:13.200]  gentlemen you know as he's going down the lower functions this is a song taught to me by my first
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:20.960]  instructor dr johnson daisy daisy
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:27.760]  all right i said i get to this report from the nightly nose
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:34.400]  they they play with a straight face clips from over the weekend
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:40.800]  with the fatherly old independent doctors who it turns out are on the government and
[2:42:40.800 --> 2:42:46.720]  globalist payroll telling you this is completely safe oh i'm challenging michelle bachman 10 000
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:54.000]  if she can show me one person heard by it it's preposterous let's not get a new controversy
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.480]  going with this and here's the key to everything i've said today i'm gonna say it again maybe i'll
[2:42:58.480 --> 2:43:03.840]  say it five more times the globalist are like how do we start really reducing population
[2:43:03.840 --> 2:43:11.280]  while at the same time sucking the wealth out of the people we're killing how do we do this and
[2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:19.360]  the answer is we just slowly put out more and more vile systems that degenerate and kill people
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:24.880]  but then we create organizations to whitewash it and make excuses and have pr fights so so it's just
[2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:30.400]  this background noise of death and destruction and cancer and diabetes and uh the the life
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:38.000]  expectancy dropping in the last oh yeah that's now officially happened and then they just sit
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:43.120]  there and manage all of this let's go ahead and go to a clip from last night's info wars nightly
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:54.560]  nose here it is welcome back now in a moment we have a guest coming up dr rustle blalock but first
[2:43:54.560 --> 2:44:01.120]  we have continued controversy over the h pv vaccine comments that michelle bogman made during
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:08.320]  last week's gop debate the american academy of pediatrics countered her claim that the vaccine
[2:44:08.320 --> 2:44:15.120]  causes retardation saying the medical community issued swift criticism after republic rep michelle
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:20.560]  bogman dragged the safety of the h pv vaccine into the political spotlight saying since the
[2:44:20.560 --> 2:44:26.240]  vaccine has been introduced more than 35 million doses have been administered and it has an excellent
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:32.080]  safety record on the other hand we have the cdc's own statistics and we're about to get into this
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:40.240]  with dr blalock of over 18 000 adverse reports and many deaths as well for more on that vaccine
[2:44:40.240 --> 2:44:45.200]  controversy we take you to rob do's investigative piece right now is he less conservative than
[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:51.440]  meets the eye Gardasil has once again entered the presidential debate first it was ron paul
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:58.720]  attacking rick perry forcing 12-year-old girls to take an inoculation to prevent this sexually
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:05.440]  transmitted disease this is not good in medicine i do not believe and now it's michelle bogman the
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:11.280]  governor's former chief of staff was the chief lobbyist for this drug company the drug company
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:16.640]  gave thousands of dollars in political donations to the governor well i will tell you that i had a
[2:45:16.640 --> 2:45:21.760]  mother last night come up to me here in tampa florida after the debate she told me that her
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:28.480]  little daughter took that uh took that vaccine that injection and she suffered from mental retardation
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:34.080]  thereafter doctors around the country are offering rewards for proof of her claim that one of her
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:39.920]  friend's daughters is now mentally retarded after receiving the Gardasil vaccine the former irs attack
[2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:45.920]  dog is now on the defensive john is there any science that suggests hpv vaccine can have that effect
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:50.240]  it's got it's so important to separate the politics from the science what the science is this is a
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:55.520]  vaccine that can prevent the virus that causes cancer of the cervix there are 35 million doses
[2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:00.560]  that have been given in the united states in 2006 according to the centers for disease control
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:05.040]  the institute of medicine and the american academy pediatrics there's no link between this vaccine
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:11.040]  and any kind of mental impairment and the media has once again come to the defense of the vaccine
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:18.480]  industry we don't need to start a new sort of controversy there are no data to indicate that
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:26.240]  hpv vaccine or any other vaccine has any association with mental retardation of course this has
[2:46:26.240 --> 2:46:30.720]  nothing to do with the amount of advertising big pharma buys each year i chose to get my daughter
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:35.120]  vaccinated i chose to get my daughter vaccinated when her doctor and i agree that the right time to
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:40.800]  protect her is now because it's about prevention right Gardasil is the only cervical cancer vaccine
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:47.200]  out to protect against four types of hpv hpv vaccine and other vaccines are wonderfully safe
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:53.760]  vaccines so who is dr. william schaffner is the president of the national foundation for infectious
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:59.520]  diseases an organization that is given awards to the bill and melinda gates foundation and dr
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:06.160]  paul off it a vammit vaccine promoter who holds a 1.5 million dollar research chair at a merc
[2:47:06.160 --> 2:47:12.000]  funded children's hospital and holds several patents on vaccines he's also been quoted as saying
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:18.080]  a young baby could get up to 10 000 vaccines at once these doctors should take this reward money
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:22.480]  and give it to the thousands of girls that you can find all over youtube who have had
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:28.000]  adverse reactions after getting the Gardasil vaccination gaby was diagnosed with inflammation
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:32.960]  of the central nervous system as a result to the Gardasil vaccine she suffered from two
[2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:42.800]  tias or mini strokes she is now vomiting on a regular basis i'd had an adverse reaction
[2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:53.040]  i lost the ability to walk um i started falling down i needed help i had head pressure um this
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:48:01.840]  is very hard to talk about if i had never gotten a shot i would be a normal teenager and i wish i
[2:48:01.840 --> 2:48:08.880]  could go back i wish there was a way to cure this and i hope that they can figure something out
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:18.800]  a treatment plan but i can't plan for that i got my second Gardasil shot in january of 2008
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:28.320]  now it's november of 2008 and i've had problems every day ever since doctors like vaccines because
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:34.400]  they will cause large percentages of the population to become lifelong customers whether it's allergies
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:39.280]  autoimmune diseases or any other types of inflammation these people will need expensive
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:44.960]  treatments and prescription drugs and that is why you now see vaccine companies setting their sites
[2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:54.880]  on every mexican girl by the year 2012 this is rob do reporting for info wars nightly news
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:03.280]  that's just devastating footage and there's even more interviews from cbs and other major
[2:49:03.280 --> 2:49:09.120]  mainstream reporters on the true face of garter cell the victims it causes the people it hurts
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:14.720]  and they only claim there's what 4 000 deaths from cervical cancer each year yet there's more than
[2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:23.520]  18 000 adverse reactions at least 30 deaths from the vaccine itself it's it's really disgusting
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:29.760]  for more on the debate over the safety of vaccines we go now to expert dr russell blalock
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:35.920]  doctor we spoke a year ago in depth on some of these issues but what can you tell us today about
[2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:42.800]  the dangers of the hpv garter cell and cervix vaccines and about the effects of vaccines in general
[2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:49.680]  well it's well known that there's a connection between the vaccination particularly multiple
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:55.200]  vaccinations and brain inflammation and seizures and that's been well established it's been
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:50:01.680]  recently admitted by the institute of medicine that these are two things that are seen so the
[2:50:01.680 --> 2:50:08.640]  fact that uh represented by when was attacked for their statement is rather lucris on the
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:14.080]  part of these uh doctors and others that are attacking uh because it's backed up by the the
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:19.680]  scientific study and we know there's a well-defined mechanism which i've read several papers and
[2:50:19.680 --> 2:50:25.120]  peer reviewed journals describing this mechanism in detail now we look at the government reporting
[2:50:25.120 --> 2:50:31.840]  system the bear system which is voluntary only two percent uh it's estimated of actual reactions
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:40.960]  are reported but they had met 18 700 adverse reactions with the garter cell vaccine okay yeah
[2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:48.320]  that's the government itself with only two percent reporting 18 000 i know women who've got
[2:50:48.320 --> 2:50:56.320]  suddenly narcolepsy women having convulsions uh who took it i know i mean it's just devastating
[2:50:56.320 --> 2:51:00.240]  now they want to give it to california school kids without asking the parents stay with us
