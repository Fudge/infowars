[00:00.000 --> 00:11.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.040 --> 00:18.600]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.600 --> 00:22.520]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.520 --> 00:32.360]  After Climate Gate, Pachari Gate, Glacier Gate, Amazon Gate and you've got
[00:32.360 --> 00:37.520]  racketeering globally that document came out two months ago with the UN
[00:37.520 --> 00:42.200]  going and organizing key universities to engage in fraud we go look at each
[00:42.200 --> 00:47.840]  university Canada Australia the US New Zealand England they are all cooking the
[00:47.840 --> 00:53.280]  books cutting out temperature data that shows that we're cooling in the last
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.280]  10 years at least the the the the heating ended 15 years ago you've got
[00:59.280 --> 01:05.000]  Pachari making all this money this is unprecedented because the entire globalist
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.640]  agenda for the UN IMF World Bank to set up world taxation and to be able to shut
[01:09.640 --> 01:15.360]  down or curtail any industry that isn't part of their inside coterie it's all
[01:15.360 --> 01:20.520]  imploding but the battle isn't over we've won a lot of big battles we've
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.400]  now got the initiative we can beat them but they're in scotch they're dug in
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.200]  we're gonna have to go house-to-house with these people in our towns our city
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.000]  Swartz and Eggers organizing governors and mayors to take over locally
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.680]  absolute treason he needs to go back to his own country they'll sure kick him
[01:37.680 --> 01:41.880]  out in Austria James Dillingpole writes regularly for the Times of London the
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.000]  Sunday Times the Daily Telegraph he's also a TV critic the spectator he is
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.880]  the author of various novels including and we'll tell you about some of those
[01:49.880 --> 01:56.000]  also well he's a best-selling author and one of the great analysts breaking
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.680]  down what these people are up to will also give you his website this is a
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.800]  short segment but but James is it safe to say or let me ask you this question
[02:04.800 --> 02:11.120]  is this exploding in their face in an even bigger fashion than than than you
[02:11.120 --> 02:15.240]  thought climategate would originally definitely I you know I thought Christmas
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.080]  had come early with climategate it seems that next Christmas has come come
[02:19.080 --> 02:22.960]  early as well because this has been fantastic we are having so many scandals
[02:22.960 --> 02:28.060]  I almost can't keep up with it but that's the good news the bad news is as
[02:28.060 --> 02:32.920]  Shakespeare said we have scotch the snake but not killed it and that's the
[02:32.920 --> 02:38.560]  problem the snake I think that the great AGW anthropogenic global warming
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.440]  snake is much more dangerous now it's wounded I think you're going to see all
[02:42.440 --> 02:50.280]  sorts of devious attempts by the IPCC by the various green movements to try and
[02:50.280 --> 02:55.440]  trick their way out of the situation and we've got to be on our guard they've
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.200]  gone from stonewalling to now the BBC the age and others going there were a
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.760]  few bad scientists that meant well because they know how real the problem
[03:05.760 --> 03:11.760]  is and and we now see the IPCC head and others saying well we did want to make it
[03:11.760 --> 03:16.040]  look worse because it is a real problem so now they're saying we lied to save
[03:16.040 --> 03:40.040]  you
[03:40.040 --> 03:56.040]  the IPCC
[03:56.040 --> 04:01.840]  heavily involved in carbon trading which is kind of weird even though he's
[04:01.840 --> 04:07.200]  supposed to be saving the planet from big oil anyway you know he's up to the
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.720]  neck in carbon trading which is a kind of I think the most polite way of putting
[04:11.720 --> 04:18.280]  it is he has certain conflicts of interest okay so this has been going on for
[04:18.280 --> 04:23.760]  quite some time he's been exposed by us gallant bloggers and who were the guys
[04:23.760 --> 04:28.680]  calling most most loudly for his his resignation
[04:28.680 --> 04:38.040]  stay there James James Dilling polled top writer over in England author
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.720]  researcher somebody's really been tracking this fraud long segment coming
[04:42.720 --> 04:48.680]  up I want to just go through all the new scandals one by one each one dwarfing
[04:48.680 --> 04:53.360]  climate game each one more wild and you said it it's five or six new scandals a
[04:53.360 --> 04:59.640]  day I can't even keep track of it we're gonna try here today stay with us this
[04:59.640 --> 05:03.040]  is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the a cola blue atmospheric water

[05:59.680 --> 06:08.160]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[06:08.160 --> 06:13.280]  we have the best-selling author of Obama land I've seen the future and it
[06:13.280 --> 06:19.000]  doesn't work journalists mr. Dillingpole with us his website is James
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.200]  Dillingpole.com and he's with us for the rest of the hour now if you just
[06:24.200 --> 06:29.960]  joined us we're going to chronicle the aftermath of climate gay and it's kind
[06:29.960 --> 06:37.640]  of like a battle at sea where you torpedo a big ship and it starts exploding
[06:37.640 --> 06:43.840]  and burning but then the magazine where all of its explosives and artillery
[06:43.840 --> 06:49.160]  shells are stored ignites and the whole ship just blows up now they're still in
[06:49.160 --> 06:52.240]  our local towns and cities they've invested hundreds of billions they're
[06:52.240 --> 06:57.920]  not going to stop but their capital ship their main flagship has completely
[06:57.920 --> 07:01.360]  exploded they are now known as frauds but they don't care they're going to
[07:01.360 --> 07:07.480]  continue on so we're going through the UN climate chief who is admitting oh
[07:07.480 --> 07:11.600]  all these errors in their reports but it's coming out that they quote did want
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.440]  to make it look worse so that we would accept them saving us and of course he
[07:16.440 --> 07:21.240]  makes money off shutting down ancient and I say ancient some of the oldest and
[07:21.240 --> 07:28.960]  best steel mills forges in England and the government pays him to then set one
[07:28.960 --> 07:34.360]  up in India so this is also a hijacking of industry we're recovering that
[07:34.360 --> 07:38.520]  scandal first then we're going to get into all the other scandals with Mr.
[07:38.520 --> 07:44.400]  Dillingpole please continue sir we've got Dr. Pichari here is the bearded trolling
[07:44.400 --> 07:49.720]  personator we talked about earlier and this guy is in charge of the UN body
[07:49.720 --> 07:54.600]  responsible for telling the world that the world is getting dangerously hotter
[07:54.600 --> 07:59.320]  it's all man's sport we must spend lots and lots of money we must increase
[07:59.320 --> 08:07.080]  regulation we must have carbon credits carbon controls and lo and behold what
[08:07.080 --> 08:12.520]  is this guy doing he happens to have involvement in the carbon trading
[08:12.520 --> 08:16.280]  industry this carbon trading industry which is invented of course by Ken
[08:16.280 --> 08:21.000]  Lay of Enron this guy has got connections with the Chicago carbon
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.400]  exchange which of course is his shareholder's include Goldman Sachs and
[08:25.400 --> 08:30.080]  Al Gore so you know that the net broadens of a lot of a lot of very rich
[08:30.080 --> 08:35.280]  people and organizations who are involved in this massive scam and so
[08:35.280 --> 08:42.480]  Pichari gate as we call it is this guy being exposed as being compromised let
[08:42.480 --> 08:49.360]  us say then after Pichari gate we get this thing called Glacier gate it turns
[08:49.360 --> 08:56.520]  out that the the United Nations the IPCC's fourth assessment report you know
[08:56.520 --> 09:02.800]  supposed to be supposed to be the most accurate up-to-date most scientifically
[09:02.800 --> 09:06.520]  reliable report on the street on the state of the planet
[09:06.520 --> 09:15.800]  climate-wise tells us that the world's glasses could be gone by 2035 the 2035
[09:15.800 --> 09:21.560]  is not very far away is it and so that's kind of quite a scary prospect could it
[09:21.560 --> 09:26.240]  be that the man's evil work has been melting our glasses so quickly they're
[09:26.240 --> 09:32.480]  going to be gone by 2035 well guess what no it isn't true at all it turns out
[09:32.480 --> 09:37.360]  that this report got its figures wrong the actual figure it should have quoted
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.480]  was 2350 that's a difference of them I don't know you to the math but it's
[09:42.480 --> 09:49.200]  quite it's over 200 years isn't it and how did the IPCC which is supposed to
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.720]  be the work of what is it 2000 expert scientists in their field two and a half
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.760]  thousand peer-reviewed scientists were told how come this mistake got slipped
[10:00.760 --> 10:07.400]  into this reliable report well it turns out that the IPCC plays pretty fast and
[10:07.400 --> 10:14.640]  loose with its scientific fact he's got this from a magazine article in new
[10:14.640 --> 10:19.560]  scientist where did new scientists get this information from about the glass
[10:19.560 --> 10:25.720]  he is melting by 2035 you've got this information from a conversation on a
[10:25.720 --> 10:30.480]  mobile phone with an Indian chap who has since admitted that he made a terrible
[10:30.480 --> 10:36.440]  mistake now isn't it that the IPCC never bothered to check up on this mistake
[10:36.440 --> 10:42.440]  here this is the reliable the key business word robust the IPCC repair
[10:42.440 --> 10:46.680]  reviewed process is robust well I'm sorry but this is anything but robust this is
[10:46.680 --> 10:53.200]  this is a climate fraud now James Dillingpole investigating this for
[10:53.200 --> 10:59.600]  major publications in England in the United States we know that when they
[10:59.600 --> 11:03.680]  have this mantra of but it's peer-reviewed it's peer-reviewed ignore
[11:03.680 --> 11:09.000]  ignore climate gate and the and that one of the main climate facilities used by
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.760]  the UN at East Anglia England ignore the fact that they are trying to hide
[11:14.760 --> 11:18.360]  decline we have all these other scientists all peer-reviewed but when
[11:18.360 --> 11:24.240]  you look at it they are all using the data collated at that university and
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.000]  three or four others who are all in the emails lying together and then we go and
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.160]  look at the temperature measurements with NASA and with New Zealand and with
[11:35.160 --> 11:42.240]  everybody it's all fraud it's all lies and and their peer-reviewed journals are
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.000]  somebody on a cell phone I mean you know you could just call into the UN and say
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.680]  Martians are gonna land if we don't put taxes on gasoline oh that's it peer
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.920]  reviewed put it in there yep that's absolutely right I think whenever you
[11:54.920 --> 11:59.000]  hear somebody use the phrase peer-reviewed you should reach for your browning
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.040]  because peer-reviewed I'm sorry to say is a bankrupt notion since since climate
[12:07.040 --> 12:11.040]  gates because what what what the climate gate emails from the University of
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.200]  East Anglia showed quite clearly was that the scientists at the heart of this
[12:15.200 --> 12:21.040]  process are shutting out of the peer-reviewed process any scientists
[12:21.040 --> 12:26.480]  disagree with them so it's not a question of the pursuit of scientific
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.040]  truth it's not what they're not to do with the ship the open sharing of
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.600]  information and the the replacement of one hypothesis by another hypothesis
[12:34.600 --> 12:38.040]  which is which is the way that traditionally science has advanced
[12:38.040 --> 12:41.880]  through the ages otherwise we'd be still thinking the world was flat but in
[12:41.880 --> 12:45.280]  the new science you're not allowed to question Al Gore he says it's settled
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.760]  that's the end of it and but but isn't it worse sir because they're not just
[12:50.760 --> 12:57.000]  only allowing a small inner group to produce these fake studies that have
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.240]  been proven to all be absolute fraud they will never release the data and now
[13:02.240 --> 13:05.760]  because the data is being forced to be released we find out when you actually
[13:05.760 --> 13:10.640]  go to Russia or go to China or go to the United States or go to South America
[13:10.640 --> 13:15.400]  that the numbers they use from the temperature measurements are absolute
[13:15.400 --> 13:21.200]  frauds every time you spot check I mean this needs to be fully audited but again
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.760]  the UN and all the major governments are behind this so how do you let the crooks
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.160]  audit themselves well I know I mean everything the fantastic report released
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.040]  today by Joseph DeLeo who's a meteorologist and Anthony Watts of
[13:35.040 --> 13:40.680]  the famous what's up with that website it's fantastic it says surface
[13:40.680 --> 13:46.200]  temperature records policy driven deception and what it argues this this
[13:46.200 --> 13:52.840]  very thorough report is that the surface data records from the last century or
[13:52.840 --> 14:00.000]  so are so corrupt and unreliable that we cannot even be sure that any global
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.760]  warming whatsoever has taken place in the last century or so and they've got a
[14:04.760 --> 14:08.600]  lot of tricks to they will you that all over the world this is on record now we
[14:08.600 --> 14:12.400]  posted the mainstream articles where they admit it in the last 20 years these
[14:12.400 --> 14:17.060]  funded groups have set up their own reading systems or they have contracted
[14:17.060 --> 14:24.920]  with airports or they've contracted with weather centers on top of buildings
[14:24.920 --> 14:29.160]  where they know the temperature is going to be many degrees hotter and that's
[14:29.160 --> 14:38.960]  another way it's called the urban heat island effect what this means is that the
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.880]  weather sites you know which are where temperatures have been measured around
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.520]  the world originally they were built maybe on the edge of town and as
[14:47.520 --> 14:53.680]  civilization as cities have grown in size so the area surrounding that the
[14:53.680 --> 14:58.320]  weather gauge has become you know more and more built up some of these things
[14:58.320 --> 15:03.440]  have sighted near airports so what this means is that inevitably the record the
[15:03.440 --> 15:08.760]  temperature records they're keeping have been distorted by the urban heat island
[15:08.760 --> 15:13.200]  effect of you know the cities because cities are warmer than the country
[15:13.200 --> 15:19.440]  outside that's how it works so how are we to trust these these records which
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.840]  show that the earth is getting getting warmer when it may simply be the result
[15:23.840 --> 15:32.760]  of the urban heat island effect that's not all what happened in the sometime
[15:32.760 --> 15:41.800]  between the 1970s and 1990s is that they vastly reduced the number of weather
[15:41.800 --> 16:01.480]  stations used to compile the world this is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[16:01.480 --> 16:05.520]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.280]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.200]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.600]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.040]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.800]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.600]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[16:30.600 --> 16:34.200]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[16:34.200 --> 16:38.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[16:38.560 --> 16:41.720]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.400]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[16:45.400 --> 16:50.960]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[16:50.960 --> 16:55.720]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[16:55.720 --> 17:03.720]  1-877-327-0365 hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[17:03.720 --> 17:08.160]  silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.120]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the
[17:12.120 --> 17:15.920]  solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[17:15.920 --> 17:19.800]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[17:19.800 --> 17:24.640]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions
[17:24.640 --> 17:29.000]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.280]  bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver
[17:33.280 --> 17:38.360]  products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver
[17:38.360 --> 17:42.760]  lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided
[17:42.760 --> 17:49.400]  making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn
[17:49.400 --> 17:52.720]  more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's
[17:52.720 --> 17:57.280]  www.silverlungs.com
[17:57.280 --> 18:04.600]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[18:04.600 --> 18:09.160]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda

[20:06.800 --> 20:27.400]  network. Network. I'm gonna break down all the other big hoaxes coming up in the
[20:27.400 --> 20:32.720]  next hour you know we told you back in 2002 we've gotten all the details then
[20:32.720 --> 20:40.560]  that it was the most weaponized US great anthrax ever seen now eight years
[20:40.560 --> 20:50.720]  later the Wall Street Journal Washington Times reporting it was the most
[20:50.720 --> 20:58.320]  super weaponized US and that and that Fort Dietrich couldn't even do it but
[20:58.320 --> 21:01.960]  that it is US designed now they claim that a couple different people made this
[21:01.960 --> 21:06.760]  in a bucket in their basement going back to James Dillingpole who's a writer for
[21:06.760 --> 21:10.760]  the Times of London Sunday Times of London the Daily Telegraph the spectator
[21:10.760 --> 21:16.600]  and best-selling author of course of Obama land I have seen your future and
[21:16.600 --> 21:21.160]  it is doesn't work so and he broke that right when Obama got into office he
[21:21.160 --> 21:23.680]  certainly been proven right so we've been proven right with the Obama
[21:23.680 --> 21:28.560]  deception and fall the Republic at those DVDs and keep educating folks as we are
[21:28.560 --> 21:33.040]  starting to route these people at info wars.com okay James getting back now
[21:33.040 --> 21:36.640]  I've been asking a lot of questions but I want to get into it other you're a
[21:36.640 --> 21:40.980]  wellspring of knowledge on these issues how you see them counter attacking how
[21:40.980 --> 21:44.560]  they're trying to buttress themselves by giving each other awards Prince Charles
[21:44.560 --> 21:50.800]  going and visiting the the the the main nest of criminals yeah what happened
[21:50.800 --> 21:56.080]  with climategate the new investigations in hindsight what climategate blowing up
[21:56.080 --> 22:01.920]  the Copenhagen fraud did to the move for the EU-wide global dictatorship James
[22:01.920 --> 22:08.360]  Dillingpole break it down. Well Alex I had a very depressing lunch on New Year's day
[22:08.360 --> 22:14.560]  with a distant member of my family and it turns out he's now working for
[22:14.560 --> 22:19.920]  something called the European Climate Foundation and the European Climate
[22:19.920 --> 22:26.600]  Foundation is one of those charitable bodies which is pumping in a lot lot lot
[22:26.600 --> 22:33.960]  of money into funding climate change advocacy groups you know it is up to the
[22:33.960 --> 22:38.600]  neck it was there at Copenhagen at the negotiating table you know staying in
[22:38.600 --> 22:44.280]  all the best hotels and I asked him whether climategate which as you remember
[22:44.280 --> 22:49.520]  broke during the story broke during the at the beginning of the Copenhagen you
[22:49.520 --> 22:56.840]  know Libertad fest and I said how's climategate had any effect whatsoever on
[22:56.840 --> 23:02.720]  the negotiation process and you know he said it didn't even register he said as
[23:02.720 --> 23:07.760]  far as we were concerned the process moves on we don't really care what other
[23:07.760 --> 23:12.960]  people say all the matters is the process and this I'm afraid is what we're
[23:12.960 --> 23:18.680]  going to see throughout the world we're going to see the government ignoring the
[23:18.680 --> 23:23.720]  arguments against man-made global warming completely and carrying on with
[23:23.720 --> 23:30.600]  the legislation on carbon carrying on with the taxing the reason this scam is
[23:30.600 --> 23:34.000]  so dangerous as I keep trying to revive we know I blog about this every day for
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.280]  the telegraph in London and some people say to me why do you keep going on and
[23:39.280 --> 23:43.400]  all about this subject why can't you talk about something else because I mean I
[23:43.400 --> 23:47.540]  want to hear your answer but it's a takeover of society it's a cult you've
[23:47.540 --> 23:53.520]  got common purpose and and others funded by this EU group here locally in Austin
[23:53.520 --> 23:59.720]  they reported last year that a CIA attached special forces Colonel is
[23:59.720 --> 24:04.880]  running for the city the green movement they're taking property that they're
[24:04.880 --> 24:08.760]  implementing Swartz and Eggers getting the governors and mayors together and so
[24:08.760 --> 24:14.480]  I think what you're saying here is this is literally a collectivist cult of
[24:14.480 --> 24:18.760]  robbers and their brainwashing our kids they're not going to stop they've got
[24:18.760 --> 24:22.800]  kids riding fake tickets in England in the US in the New York Times climate
[24:22.800 --> 24:26.880]  cops they've got TV shows about reporting on your neighbors the point is
[24:26.880 --> 24:32.640]  this is the Bolsheviks. I would say Alex that it is no exaggeration at all to say
[24:32.640 --> 24:38.680]  that the green movement is more dangerous than the communist movement or even the
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.840]  Nazi movement and the reason is that okay we have to fight a terrible war to defeat
[24:43.840 --> 24:50.080]  Nazism but the point was that the threat of Nazi was essentially military we
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.120]  defeated the Soviets as well through a combination of proxy wars and and
[24:54.120 --> 24:57.920]  effectively Ronald Reagan bankrupted them didn't he through the Star Wars
[24:57.920 --> 25:03.880]  program the green movement is more dangerous in a way because it is more
[25:03.880 --> 25:09.240]  insidious it is not confronting a true military means it is it is presenting
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.960]  itself as this caring movement which which only a heartless nature hating
[25:14.960 --> 25:20.240]  evil person could possibly disagree with and that is why it presents a problem
[25:20.240 --> 25:24.640]  to those of us who understand it's true minutes how do we show to the world at
[25:24.640 --> 25:31.760]  large that this this movement threatens our society threatens our freedoms
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.920]  threatened everything we believe in it's it's a big problem because you know a lot
[25:36.920 --> 25:41.080]  of the people involved in the green movement are cuddly polar bear loving
[25:41.080 --> 25:46.720]  caring people they're not they're not they're not nasty people and it is it is
[25:46.720 --> 25:53.120]  a constant struggle fighting against their their arguments well yeah you're
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.360]  absolutely right and and I mean I have the New York Times I have the LA Times I
[25:57.360 --> 26:04.080]  see it where I live I see the textbooks I I put my children in a for example you
[26:04.080 --> 26:10.680]  know my daughter started doing having choir lessons at Christmas and one of
[26:10.680 --> 26:13.600]  the songs they sang with that lovely song about the snowman which is very nice
[26:13.600 --> 26:20.080]  and another of the songs was called when will we learn and it went on and on
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.760]  about you know when will we learn to be certain is to stop being so horrible to
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.960]  nature humans are evil you know we must save the planet the kids are brainwashed
[26:30.960 --> 26:34.800]  you know let me stop you let me stop you because I was about to say I put my
[26:34.800 --> 26:38.880]  kids in private school for one year and even a Christian private school it was
[26:38.880 --> 26:42.600]  all government-approved brainwashing we try to even buy homeschooler material
[26:42.600 --> 26:48.440]  most of it has the brainwashing and and they chant these songs in the public
[26:48.440 --> 26:53.960]  schools they have the kids go home and and write fake tickets and reports on
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.320]  their parents don't take a hot bath don't run the water while you brush your
[26:57.320 --> 27:00.320]  teeth and it has nothing to do with the environment that's the thing they say
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.400]  well it's to save the earth no these are cold-hearted tacticians at the top
[27:05.400 --> 27:10.880]  that want to create a anti-human guilt to make humanity the enemy so the
[27:10.880 --> 27:34.880]  collectivist can run the state
[27:34.880 --> 27:40.880]  and the school is actually designated itself an eco school the reason it does
[27:40.880 --> 27:45.480]  half the middle-class mothers actually like like this nonsense they like to
[27:45.480 --> 27:49.280]  hear that the school is an eco school and it teaches their children as well
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.120]  because it has become a fashionable agenda for the what we call the
[27:54.120 --> 27:58.440]  chattering classes you know the yummy mummies all these nice you know high
[27:58.440 --> 28:03.040]  earning middle-class people they too subscribe to the organic movement they
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.200]  too let me go further mark dies who's a reporter who I know he went out last
[28:07.200 --> 28:12.880]  week in San Diego and over 90% of the people he talked to yeah it was mainly
[28:12.880 --> 28:19.200]  women young women and in middle-class middle-aged women they all the women
[28:19.200 --> 28:23.320]  except for one old lady said ban free speech he had a fake petition saying
[28:23.320 --> 28:28.120]  ban free speech arrest anybody that disagrees with Obama it's time to shut
[28:28.120 --> 28:32.720]  these people up and they would sign it put their name their info and I mean
[28:32.720 --> 28:39.440]  they are ready and they think we run society we're good and so now it's a
[28:39.440 --> 28:46.400]  Nazi slash Soviet movement run by a bunch of useful idiot women

[33:52.960 --> 33:58.120]  accurate records in in forecasting the economy and picking investments and
[33:58.120 --> 34:02.160]  analyzing what's happening Dr. Mark Fawber again was born in Zurich

[34:19.760 --> 34:23.920]  interview joining us from Switzerland Dr. Fawber thanks for coming on it's my
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.040]  pleasure thank you very much for having me it's good to have you here okay so
[34:28.040 --> 34:32.640]  much is going on what's really happening in the world economy what's really
[34:32.640 --> 34:37.280]  happening with sovereign debt private debt the dollar dollar devaluation give
[34:37.280 --> 34:40.700]  us your fork well write down what's currently happening and your forecast
[34:40.700 --> 34:49.040]  please sir well basically what we have is excessive credit growth that led in
[34:49.040 --> 34:58.440]  the period 2001 to 2008 to the housing bubble and then the collapse of the
[34:58.440 --> 35:08.000]  housing bubble and then we had the recession in 2008 2009 and the recession
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.160]  was cushioned through huge government stimulus and monetizing in other words
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.960]  the government through the Federal Reserve is buying government debt and
[35:18.960 --> 35:25.000]  is expanding its balance sheet and I think that this will not help the economy
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.560]  very much but what it's helped is essentially emerging economies because
[35:30.560 --> 35:38.280]  don't forget after 1998 because of the credit bubble and the housing bubble
[35:38.280 --> 35:44.040]  what the US did was to over consume and this over consumption in other words
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.960]  consumption went up as a percent of the economy led to the trade deficit and the
[35:49.960 --> 35:55.480]  trade deficit was then offset by trade purposes in emerging economies in
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.480]  particular in China and that drove industrial production employment and
[36:01.480 --> 36:08.560]  capital spending in China and along with that also commodity prices higher so
[36:08.560 --> 36:15.000]  actually the monetary policies of the US under Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.480]  have been a complete disaster for the United States but complete but it has
[36:21.480 --> 36:26.680]  helped the rest of the world the rest of the world the emerging economies and the
[36:26.680 --> 36:33.280]  producers of oil and copper and iron ore should all send a thank you note to Mr.
[36:33.280 --> 36:39.200]  Ben Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan that they flooded the world with liquidity and as
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.520]  a result of that that emerging economies in particular the resource
[36:43.520 --> 36:52.200]  produces benefit now when we look at what's happening with the economy they've
[36:52.200 --> 36:56.480]  been telling us in the last year that we've had a recovery that unemployment's
[36:56.480 --> 37:00.080]  only ten point two but most of the big private institutions that that they use
[37:00.080 --> 37:05.720]  the old numbers crunching system of the government previously used that most
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.400]  statisticians and economists believe is is much more accurate they say it's over
[37:10.400 --> 37:17.560]  22 percent right now and that we're just going to continue sliding in to a
[37:17.560 --> 37:22.400]  deepening really depression for Main Street the big banks and brokerage
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.840]  firms are all having record profits off all the money they've stolen through the
[37:25.840 --> 37:30.360]  bailouts can you speak to what you think the economy is going to look like and
[37:30.360 --> 37:37.680]  and the health of the dollar and and what you see unfolding given the huge
[37:37.680 --> 37:45.600]  stimulus we had and also given that the economy collapsed between September 2008
[37:45.600 --> 37:52.400]  and March 2009 the figures economically speaking will look somewhat better in
[37:52.400 --> 37:58.880]  the next three months because these months January February March 2009 were
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.520]  very bad so I mean maybe the economy shows signs of bottoming out and some
[38:04.520 --> 38:12.440]  improvement will take place even but in general I think that the outlook for
[38:12.440 --> 38:22.880]  future growth is very poor in other words the large deficits lead to larger
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.880]  government debt that keeps interest rates on long-dated securities you know
[38:28.880 --> 38:35.360]  some long-term bonds relatively high and may even lead to inflation at some point
[38:35.360 --> 38:41.880]  I mean my sense is that in the last 20 years actually the typical household in
[38:41.880 --> 38:49.160]  the US the median household as they call it has not made any progress but who's
[38:49.160 --> 38:54.600]  made progress are of course as you said said the thieves on Wall Street they
[38:54.600 --> 39:02.120]  have made a lot of progress and government employees well that's the
[39:02.120 --> 39:07.960]  issue is that government is exploding in size Obama has spent more money in one
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.520]  year than all presidents before him combined they're just hiring more
[39:11.520 --> 39:14.640]  police more bureaucrats that's the only sector that's growing and they're now
[39:14.640 --> 39:18.680]  saying they're going to continue the spending and that they're going to raise
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.360]  taxes and they are raising taxes at every level state federal local
[39:22.360 --> 39:28.200]  international and that we see many UN chiefs and others saying look we want to
[39:28.200 --> 39:31.920]  end the industrialized world they government says we're consuming too much
[39:31.920 --> 39:35.520]  so they're doing us a favor clamping down on the economy and this is actually
[39:35.520 --> 39:43.880]  being done by design many experts believe what's your take on that well
[39:43.880 --> 39:48.600]  basically I think that means Obama is right to hire a lot of policemen because
[39:48.600 --> 39:56.400]  if I were such a bad president I would also need increasing protection but in
[39:56.400 --> 40:03.360]  general I think that his administration is a complete failure in terms of
[40:03.360 --> 40:10.480]  economic and foreign policies nothing has been addressed overseas he has
[40:10.480 --> 40:16.720]  increased the engaged engagement in Afghanistan and I can assure you that
[40:16.720 --> 40:24.040]  Afghanistan is a country where nobody has an interest that the US will win the
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.200]  conflict neither the Chinese nor the Indians nor the Pakistani nor the Russians
[40:29.200 --> 40:34.920]  nor the mercenaries who are hired in Pakistan so it will never end and it
[40:34.920 --> 40:40.960]  will be a bottomless pit and in terms of domestic policies the health care
[40:40.960 --> 40:46.480]  reform is another disaster because it creates uncertainty so let's assume you
[40:46.480 --> 40:51.520]  have a business you employ 50 people you don't know what your tax rate will be
[40:51.520 --> 40:55.240]  three years from now you don't know what your health care bill will be three years
[40:55.240 --> 41:00.960]  from now about the last thing you will do is hire people in addition to that as
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.640]  you just pointed out he has piled up huge deficits they're running now at an
[41:06.640 --> 41:13.000]  annual rate of say one and a half trillion dollars the problem is that they
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.920]  will not go down I think they will actually increase and so the government
[41:17.920 --> 41:23.640]  debt increases and one day this increased government debt will lead to
[41:23.640 --> 41:28.520]  substantially higher interest rates well Venezuela as you know last week the
[41:28.520 --> 41:34.360]  value of their currency by 50% we have experienced a long slide in the value of
[41:34.360 --> 41:40.120]  a dollar evidenced by a candy bar 20 years ago being a quarter and now it's a
[41:40.120 --> 41:48.720]  dollar or a beer being a quarter and now it's a dollar 50 or two dollars I mean
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.760]  obviously people know there's real inflation but towards the end of a
[41:52.760 --> 41:58.240]  devaluation it tends to accelerate we're certainly seeing that right now you
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.160]  know there's temporary as people do the reverse carry trade for those that don't
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.160]  know back into the United States yeah we saw a buoying for a time as Dr. Paul
[42:07.160 --> 42:10.400]  Craig Roberts and other economists predicted on the show in the fall of
[42:10.400 --> 42:14.920]  last year but they say overall it is a downward sliding slow death of the
[42:14.920 --> 42:18.680]  dollar and that the global interest have decided to go ahead and abandon the
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.600]  dollar the only question is how to abandon it what's your take on that
[42:22.600 --> 42:27.800]  Dr. Faber there isn't really an international currency at the present
[42:27.800 --> 42:38.200]  to replace the dollar and also where I'm very critical of the U.S. monetary and fiscal policies
[42:38.200 --> 42:45.800]  I'm also critical of other countries fiscal and monetary policies because other countries are also very good at printing money
[42:45.800 --> 42:53.320]  when the people leave the leaders they will have to follow
[42:53.320 --> 43:03.760]  hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going

[44:58.440 --> 45:02.200]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.520]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[45:06.520 --> 45:10.680]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[45:10.680 --> 45:14.720]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[45:14.720 --> 45:18.600]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[45:18.600 --> 45:22.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[45:22.680 --> 45:27.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[45:27.040 --> 45:31.320]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.040]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.240]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[45:39.240 --> 45:42.640]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[45:42.640 --> 45:48.800]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[46:00.200 --> 46:03.800]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[46:03.800 --> 46:08.560]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[46:08.560 --> 46:12.480]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[46:12.480 --> 46:16.360]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[46:16.360 --> 46:21.320]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[46:21.320 --> 46:26.600]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.200]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[46:31.200 --> 46:35.400]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[46:35.400 --> 46:40.280]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[46:40.280 --> 46:44.760]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go
[46:44.760 --> 46:49.960]  to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[46:49.960 --> 46:56.760]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[46:56.760 --> 47:05.840]  coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.160]  broadcasting network network
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.880]  now a dr. farmer looking at that so you have all the major currencies the world
[47:25.880 --> 47:31.240]  simultaneously engaging basically in the same big government footprint and a
[47:31.240 --> 47:35.840]  huge deficits and thus devaluation of currencies so it's happening
[47:35.840 --> 47:46.720]  simultaneously and that's what the G20 admits they're doing meanwhile
[47:46.720 --> 47:51.360]  helicopter Ben Bernanke is delivering billion dollar bills out of helicopters
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.800]  but only directly into JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs and his own pocket
[47:55.800 --> 48:03.000]  and so now there's open talk that is correct it's a funny it's actually
[48:03.000 --> 48:09.840]  tragic it sounds funny but it's tragic because it doesn't reach decent people
[48:09.840 --> 48:16.680]  in America in fact through monetary policies they have impoverished normal
[48:16.680 --> 48:22.280]  people and let me explain you why first of all when you cut down interest rates
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.800]  to zero a lot of decent people they accumulated savings in the life they
[48:28.800 --> 48:34.160]  have these savings on certificate of deposits in banks or on bank deposit
[48:34.160 --> 48:41.840]  now even if you have 20 million dollars on zero interest you can't live so if
[48:41.840 --> 48:47.280]  the interest was a 5% on 20 million dollars you could I would have income
[48:47.280 --> 48:54.480]  of one million dollars secondly commodity prices went up and peaked out in
[48:54.480 --> 49:02.200]  May 2006 and then they moved ciphers including oil which was prior to the
[49:02.200 --> 49:09.160]  rate cuts in September 2007 at seventy five dollars at that time the combined
[49:09.160 --> 49:13.880]  expenditures for oil in the United States were approximately five hundred
[49:13.880 --> 49:19.080]  billion dollars but when Mr. Bernanke slashed interest rates to zero oil went
[49:19.080 --> 49:26.320]  247 dollars and the combined expenditures for oil in 2008 went to an
[49:26.320 --> 49:32.480]  annualized rate of a trillion dollars so the consumer you and decent people in
[49:32.480 --> 49:40.400]  America were saddened with another five hundred billion dollars in taxes and the
[49:40.400 --> 49:44.720]  beneficiaries of that were the speculators largely on Wall Street
[49:44.720 --> 49:51.560]  absolutely so we have the real economy being fed into the speculators
[49:51.560 --> 49:57.520]  you have a pie and the pie has obviously through the recession become somewhat
[49:57.520 --> 50:05.680]  smaller but what is now happening the gangsters like Mr. Ben Bernanke and Mr.
[50:05.680 --> 50:12.720]  Larry Summers and Mr. Tim Geithner they take the smaller pie but allocate a
[50:12.720 --> 50:18.040]  larger portion of the pie to their friends on Wall Street and in the banking
[50:18.040 --> 50:23.600]  sector and to very questionable organizations like AIG and so forth
[50:23.600 --> 50:29.880]  that's the expense of decent people who work in America so where does it where
[50:29.880 --> 50:32.960]  is it all heading I mean you talk about them hiring more policemen to protect
[50:32.960 --> 50:37.480]  themselves I was recently interviewed by parents which is a leading financial
[50:37.480 --> 50:45.440]  paper I said we all doomed it's gonna end in a complete disaster but we have to
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.680]  distinguish the disaster may not happen for five to ten years but we're heading
[50:50.680 --> 50:57.680]  into an iceberg and what will eventually happen is that the population
[50:57.680 --> 51:03.800]  will suffer very badly from inflation and declining real wages and the
[51:03.800 --> 51:09.320]  establishment including the government will protect itself and when
[51:09.320 --> 51:15.120]  everything becomes very bad and you have simultaneous essentially a recession
[51:15.120 --> 51:20.520]  depression like you said in unemployment is of course higher than 10% I don't
[51:20.520 --> 51:27.440]  think it's 22% but say maybe 15% when that doesn't improve they'll go to
[51:27.440 --> 51:32.040]  war and nobody can pay for the war so you print more and more money and you
[51:32.040 --> 51:36.800]  have hyperinflation and then the system goes that's why I'm telling everybody
[51:36.800 --> 51:44.720]  you ought to own some land and you ought to own some stocks and you ought to own
[51:44.720 --> 51:50.760]  some gold or a lot of gold and other precious metals because paper money and
[51:50.760 --> 51:57.400]  bonds are very vulnerable over the next five to ten years absolutely I mean this
[51:57.400 --> 52:03.640]  is a giant black hole of debt that's mathematically impossible to get out of
[52:03.640 --> 52:08.320]  and the system I have made the calculation I don't want to bore you with
[52:08.320 --> 52:15.600]  everything but when you consider that to GDP 375 percent but that excludes the
[52:15.600 --> 52:22.560]  unfunded states liabilities the unfunded liabilities arising from Medicare
[52:22.560 --> 52:28.280]  Medicaid and Social Security that are coming to you I mean the whole is so
[52:28.280 --> 52:35.680]  big we are doomed and that's what the private central banks set up they they
[52:35.680 --> 52:39.880]  take over the world with fiat currency and credit they put out they bring in a
[52:39.880 --> 52:44.880]  cashless society after they bankrupt at all and the entire world is a giant
[52:44.880 --> 52:49.640]  scientific police state dr. Vauber that is clearly from all of their own
[52:49.640 --> 52:53.160]  documents their own statements this has been a premeditated as you said
[52:53.160 --> 53:01.440]  concerted coordinated master economic domination what Napoleon Hitler and
[53:01.440 --> 53:06.320]  Julius Caesar couldn't do the private banks have done unless we identify them
[53:06.320 --> 53:10.080]  as the criminals and bring them to justice but even if we were to stop them
[53:10.080 --> 53:14.960]  today they have a revocably savaged us so bad is there any way to get out of
[53:14.960 --> 53:20.240]  this new world order well first of all I don't think so because I have to say
[53:20.240 --> 53:27.320]  there's no political will because as you say the US Federal Reserve is actually
[53:27.320 --> 53:32.920]  a corporation in other words it's a private entity and it's most likely owned
[53:32.920 --> 53:37.960]  by all the banks in the United States but the point is and there were voices in
[53:37.960 --> 53:43.080]  the United States that rightly asked for the Federal Reserve to be audited but
[53:43.080 --> 53:48.720]  why do they refuse to be audited if you have a business and someone comes along
[53:48.720 --> 53:52.480]  and says listen we want to audit you because we want to do business with you
[53:52.480 --> 53:57.200]  then you said sure if you have nothing to hide but if you have something to hide
[53:57.200 --> 54:05.320]  you say I refuse to be audited so I think the Federal Reserve is first of all
[54:05.320 --> 54:16.200]  99% responsible for the Nasdaq bubble and the subsequent crash 99% responsible
[54:16.200 --> 54:24.080]  for the debt buildup and subsequent housing crash and 99% responsible for
[54:24.080 --> 54:31.960]  having misled people who simply from the education cannot make a decision about
[54:31.960 --> 54:37.080]  how much leverage they use when they buy a house because if you buy a house and
[54:37.080 --> 54:43.360]  you borrow only 50% on your house and the house may drop 50% in value and your
[54:43.360 --> 54:49.640]  mortgage is still not underwater but if you borrow 99% or 120% then you have a
[54:49.640 --> 54:55.200]  big problem and the Federal Reserve especially Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke
[54:55.200 --> 55:03.200]  encourage people to take second home loan mortgages and so now here we are and
[55:03.200 --> 55:06.800]  their media is still putting out the hype that people's housing loans caused
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.360]  this they baited and switched day one with the bailout money and didn't use it
[55:10.360 --> 55:13.520]  for that and said we're not going to tell you where it's going they're clearly
[55:13.520 --> 55:19.120]  out of control Congress is talking about not re-approving the nomination of
[55:19.120 --> 55:25.440]  Bernanke for another term they're talking about inditing Geithner or making
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.600]  him leave but but but but then you just get rid of sacrificial goats we need to
[55:29.600 --> 55:34.440]  go after the entire system or as you said we are doomed and I try to explain
[55:34.440 --> 55:40.920]  that every real economist Ron Paul you countless economists we interview Dr.
[55:40.920 --> 55:44.840]  Paul Craig Roberts George Humphrey they all say mathematically impossible
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.080]  design to take over and you try to tell yuppie reporters this and they just
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.200]  laugh at you they think it's funny they think it's cute they think it's going to
[55:52.200 --> 55:59.000]  go on forever I mean the problem is that nobody in government and in the
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.600]  establishment wants to face the truth and even very decent people they tell you
[56:06.600 --> 56:12.800]  the truth but they are very diplomatic about the statements they make they
[56:12.800 --> 56:18.800]  don't say it's inevitable that eventually they'll be a huge mess they
[56:18.800 --> 56:23.600]  guard themselves very much but the mainstream and the government officials
[56:23.600 --> 56:28.440]  they keep on misleading people that is the problem and they know don't they
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.960]  mean they designed it well I'm not sure they know because you know the
[56:31.960 --> 56:37.440]  intelligence level of government employees is obviously not very I'm at
[56:37.440 --> 56:44.120]  the bankers the the actual technicians running this yes I mean that's the real
[56:44.120 --> 56:48.320]  government is the banks even Congress admits that now well I mean the
[56:48.320 --> 56:56.280]  government basically financed by large corporations and by election campaign
[56:56.280 --> 57:02.080]  contributions and so forth and so on and then every politician then owes
[57:02.080 --> 57:07.080]  something to the people that gave him money that brought him into office and
[57:07.080 --> 57:13.400]  so nothing really gets ever decided when there is a crack in the building they
[57:13.400 --> 57:18.600]  don't fix the crack they just put paint on top of it and then two three years
[57:18.600 --> 57:23.400]  later the crack reappears and they put fresh paint until the whole thing
[57:23.400 --> 57:31.160]  collapses Dr. Mark Fawber is our guest gloom boom doom.com is his website sir
[57:31.160 --> 57:34.840]  I really appreciate you spending time with us and I look forward to talking to

[57:57.960 --> 58:02.040]  As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[58:02.040 --> 58:06.320]  the Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in
[58:06.320 --> 58:11.200]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[58:11.200 --> 58:16.160]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies
[58:16.160 --> 58:21.240]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[58:21.240 --> 58:25.960]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke
[58:25.960 --> 58:29.960]  their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[58:29.960 --> 58:33.760]  do we make the check out to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:34.080]  already scheduled for the show but now he can comment on Patriot icon Eustace

[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:04.560]  back to Ken and Michigan can finish up your point well I just have no but it's
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:09.760]  all you have to do is I'm not a big TV watcher but it knows you have to do
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:16.800]  really is watch some of the police documentaries like first 48 cop all you
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:22.360]  see is a bunch of criminal Mexicans probably most of them are illegal and
[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:30.040]  they're causing havoc and nobody seems to care no you know there's a hundred
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:37.680]  million people in Mexico and criminals flee there and come here it's a shame you
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:41.840]  know and they've been doing this for how long Alex I mean when what are people
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:48.440]  gonna wake up they have woken up but the government whether it's Republican or
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:56.200]  Democrat is controlled by the New World Order yeah they come at us from so many
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:02:01.440]  angles sometimes it's just hard I can't imagine you know how you deal with it
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:05.800]  all but because I know this is how I deal with it this is how I deal with it
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:13.600]  can things would be a thousand percent worse if people like red Beckman and
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:21.720]  Bill Benson and G Edward Griffin and Myron Fagan and Eustace Mullins and
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:29.160]  countless other people 30 40 50 60 years ago hadn't been telling the truth
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:36.800]  people like Gary Allen people like Bob Chapman they understood what was
[1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:40.760]  happening they warned us so other generations of people could wake up and
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:46.240]  we grew slowly but we are now probably 30 percent of the population and it took
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:50.800]  three to five percent to win the Revolutionary War look 80 percent of
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:57.640]  the public wanted to be slaves okay and another 17 percent or so supported the
[1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:00.800]  Patriots but it was only about three to five percent that started it and wanted
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:05.840]  and so we're in the right we've got 30 percent in the globalist don't go to
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:09.920]  full martial law in the next year we'll have 50 percent another year or two we
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:14.320]  are growing that fast it's been a slow growth but it's been exponential and
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:20.120]  now it's doubling and and just expanding massively every few years and we'll talk
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:23.000]  to red Beckman about the mass awakening and when we say mass awakening
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.600]  folks it is a mass awakening and that's why they openly said they want to
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:31.280]  restrict and censor and have the UN take over the internet that's openly
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:35.840]  being announced world governments openly being announced they tried the game of
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:40.360]  denying any of this existed for decades that doesn't work anymore so now they
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:47.520]  say oh well world governments good so that's so Ken that's why I stay in the
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:51.680]  fight I don't have a choice there's nowhere to run if there was some free
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:56.640]  country I'd be just like my ancestors jumping on the Mayflower and coming to a
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:01.400]  new land to be free and left alone by government there's nowhere to run my
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:06.560]  roots are here I'm cornered I have nowhere to go I've got to fight and
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:10.640]  that's a powerful position folks when you've committed that you know there's
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:15.120]  nothing else you can do and you realize you're gonna die regardless you might as
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:20.600]  well stand up and fight and just commit to it all of you so what do you think of
[1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:27.040]  them appleskin oh you're about right on and I hope I hope more people will wake
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:34.440]  up to what's going on and I try to wake up as many people as I can and I think
[1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:39.720]  we we got a chance but we all need to band together and fight against the
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:45.440]  Satanic Hitler wannabes I hear you my friend I appreciate your call in three

[1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:29.680]  the corrupt judge or prosecutor backman documented by going to all of the
[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:35.080]  states that existed when we got the 16th amendment for the income tax that it

[1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:57.320]  affiliates and listeners encapsulate who you are you're awakening and what
[1:06:57.320 --> 1:07:01.400]  you've seen over the last 50 years fighting this tyranny and where you
[1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:09.000]  think we are today well I think that when I really woke up to the fact that
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:15.720]  our government was not performing as it was supposed to was while I was in the
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:20.720]  military in the service during the Korean War and I've seen things happen
[1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:28.080]  that didn't make sense and of course when I got out of the service in
[1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:37.280]  December of 52 I tried to be involved in the political process and it took me a
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:43.720]  number of years to figure out that our vote on election day just didn't do the
[1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:48.640]  job as far as controlling our government and so I had to do some
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:54.360]  studying and all and of course I discovered that our votes we have a
[1:07:54.360 --> 1:08:00.200]  three-vote system not a one-vote system because we have learned to our sorrow
[1:08:00.200 --> 1:08:06.360]  that just electing people to Congress and such that we don't have the control
[1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:11.040]  that we should have and the founders were wise men and they put the grand jury
[1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:17.920]  system in and they put the trial jury system in and both the grand jury and
[1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:23.800]  the trial jury had been in existence for centuries prior to our war of
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:32.760]  independence and so I found that the the juries had the power to nullify law and
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:38.560]  that the we the people are the sovereign we're not we're not the peons of
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:45.000]  government we are to control government and and of course they
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:49.800]  government control the schools the education process they actually control
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:56.960]  the churches and the media and and you have hit it so hard over the years about
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:03.480]  how they are attacking our minds and and trying to control our minds and they do
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:10.680]  that by feeding us a lot of propaganda a lot of lies and so we have to overcome
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:17.880]  that and today we have an exciting situation going on in this country with
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:23.600]  all the tea parties the oathkeepers the fully informed juries all these
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:28.760]  Sheriff Mack all these things are happening right now and of course here
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:34.920]  I am at 81 years of age and I'm getting to see all of this I'm getting to enjoy
[1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:41.880]  what's happening we the people you know the the concept the declaration of
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:47.040]  independence says that the government the derives are just powers from the
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:52.080]  consent of the government well if they can tamper with the minds of the people
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:59.640]  then they can derive unjust powers they get unjust powers and we the people pay
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:06.360]  the bills and that's what has happened to us in this country too much of our
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:12.440]  power the people power has been transferred to government now government
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:16.480]  isn't going to give that power back they're not just going to give it back
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:21.320]  when we say we want our power back they're a greedy bunch and they will
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:26.680]  keep your power I'm seeing it happen I'm seeing the things that are happening
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:35.200]  all across this country and it's a real exciting time in 1989 I wrote my little
[1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:40.000]  book walls on our minds and I made the statement how that Germany was the first
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:45.840]  country to be conquered by the Nazis and of course Germany paid an awful price
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:52.520]  for letting an enemy within conquer the nation they paid the price of World War
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:11:00.320]  2 because they allowed an enemy within and of course in 89 I wrote about how
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:08.000]  our government had become an enemy within and that our future was somewhat
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:15.760]  cloudy and here we are 20 years later and of course at that time I
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:21.680]  said that we would probably have an economic crash our meltdown and that
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:28.480]  would open the door and people would wake up and so Alex we're seeing it and
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:33.920]  what a thrill it is there's the added there's the added danger though that
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.240]  people are waking up because now the enemy is trying to fully implode the
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:41.800]  country so they can control it and robbing us of tens of trillions of
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:46.480]  dollars a year and launching all these new wars in our name and so it's good
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:51.120]  that people are waking up but they should be because we're in very very dire
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:56.480]  straights Red Beckman from your 50 years of study who runs the New World Order
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:01.040]  what is the New World Order what is this system how do the central banks get so
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:08.240]  much power well I'll tell you every generation every generation will always
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:16.560]  produce a certain number of well some people call them mattoids they're mental
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:22.120]  cripples who think that they are far superior to anybody else and that they
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:28.680]  have a well they used to call it the divine right of kings and and and our
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:34.760]  generations are no different I've seen three generations now at my age we have
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:41.120]  these people show up and they really belong in mental institutions but we
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:48.160]  don't we end up following them because they usually have enough propaganda and
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:52.320]  such to where they can and and they line up enough suckers to believe what they
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:59.440]  are trying to tell you tell you and of course over the history of our country
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:06.760]  we've had some of these people always trying to get a central bank and of
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:11.280]  course we've had a couple of presidents that said no they understood what how
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:19.720]  dangerous a central bank is well in 1913 of course we got the income tax and the
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:26.480]  17th amendment we got the Federal Reserve Bank because we had well we had
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:32.320]  about 30 million immigrants in this country that had come from Western Europe
[1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:37.040]  and they hadn't really assimilated to the point where they understood our
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:43.640]  language our political system and all of that and and they were too easily
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:50.320]  manipulated that's how Wilson became president of the United States as far as
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:55.640]  I'm concerned that's what happened and of course we have somewhat of a parallel
[1:13:55.640 --> 1:14:01.160]  today we have so many of these immigrants and so many of them are
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:09.080]  illegal and as I told you before we went on the air I I had recently written
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:18.880]  a an op-ed piece and I told how that the Roe v. Wade decision the abortion
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:25.880]  thing those first people that lost their lives in in the abortion mill back
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:30.560]  there would now be 37 38 years old in the prime of their life of their
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:37.320]  productive life and and we have now murdered over 50 million and that's our
[1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:42.800]  workforce that we we eliminated through the abortion thing and the globalists
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:46.080]  in many of their own documents admit that was their plan kill off the
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:50.280]  Americans bring in the foreigners yeah and they'll pull the lever for gun
[1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:55.280]  control big government yeah everything and it's now happening yeah it's there
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:00.760]  there was that vacuum in our workforce and they brought in all these illegals
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:07.720]  and they want they're working very hard to give them amnesty and of course they
[1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:11.360]  give them all our social security money they give them all their free health
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:18.000]  care and everything and we the people of this country we're getting the short end
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.960]  of the stick and we subsidized driving down our own wages and with the console
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:27.440]  matricula on record they will give unlimited numbers of these two
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:31.720]  citizens now other countries are duplicating what Mexico's done to where

[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:36.880]  operations I'm not risking my life I'm not fighting 14 15 some days 18 hours a
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:42.280]  day some days 24 hours a day against the globalist because I think I'm gonna
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:47.240]  lose these people are dangerous killers they run the planet they do whatever
[1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:51.680]  they want but history shows tyrants always reach too far I wouldn't be
[1:21:51.680 --> 1:21:58.080]  fighting them and risking my life if I didn't know they could be beaten I know
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:04.000]  they will be beaten and if you listen to my show 10 years ago it was a lot
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.520]  more negative than it is now I said if we don't wake people up if we don't
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:11.080]  educate people about the true architecture of world government if we
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:15.560]  don't educate them as the control banking collapse comes we have the IMF
[1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:18.760]  World Bank documents we know what they've done in every other country we know
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:23.480]  what they've done in England and in 1815 with the Rothschilds if we don't do
[1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:27.240]  this and we don't educate the military and police that they're expendable and
[1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:31.720]  being used and brainwashed then these people are gonna win but I started
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.560]  waging war 16 years ago against the tyranny 14 years ago on air red Beckman
[1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:42.040]  back in the early 1950s and it takes time and and that's the number one
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:45.000]  message now going back to red Beckman and then your phone calls and a lot of
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.200]  other issues read I was asking you the question of the enemy's counter
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:55.360]  operations I mean I am shocked by how out in the open they are now I guess
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:23:00.240]  that's hubris or false arrogance or a face they're putting on because their
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:04.960]  internal documents from Cass Sunstein the Congress the UN stuff they don't
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:09.160]  widely publicize but that is a publicly available they say they're in deep
[1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:13.920]  danger they are freaking out saying we've got to go with shutting down web
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:17.560]  arresting people that criticize government we've got to go to a hot
[1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:22.120]  tyranny not a cold incremental tyranny which is good because the cold
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:27.720]  incremental tyranny is hard to beat because it sneaks around like Cicero
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:34.360]  said inside your gates I I like it that they're coming right out in the open and
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:37.640]  and so why do you think they're openly announcing world government why do you
[1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:42.600]  think they're openly shifting from denying all this to admitting it but
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:47.680]  putting their spin on it and how do you see them counter striking well you know
[1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:57.320]  I I think that so much of this is the spin masters of course they're just paid
[1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:02.080]  these are people that are paid to come up with all this stuff I think that they're
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:11.880]  in a state of terror they're they're looking for a place to hide their you
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:16.540]  know everything is going backwards for them they're not getting that the job
[1:24:16.540 --> 1:24:22.000]  done they're not getting the guns they're not going to get the guns I mean
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.200]  they might get what comes out the end of the barrel of the gun but they're not
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:36.880]  gonna get the gun itself and I think that you know 9-1-1 they were able to you
[1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:43.160]  know fool the American people initially and into thinking it was those
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:49.520]  foreigners those aliens that had pulled this off taking control of those planes
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:55.640]  and flying into the World Trade Center how many Americans today are there that
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:02.320]  that still believe that very very very few and what we have is we've got
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:09.280]  hundreds of people all over this nation that are trying to put the pieces
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:16.720]  together they're collecting the evidence and I I would dare say that there's some
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:23.600]  people out there that pulled that off they're right here in this country they've
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.040]  got an escape hatch they'll fly to some other country or something when it gets
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:32.600]  too hot but they're still here but I would dare say they kind of rub their
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:37.160]  necks once in a while and and I wonder if they kind of feel that rope
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:43.480]  settling around their neck because if they if they take another do another
[1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:50.360]  dirty trick like they did 9-1-1 the American people are not going to sit
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:56.360]  still for any more of their false flags it's not gonna happen and I think that
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:02.360]  what we've got going on in in Iraq and Afghanistan right now I think that the
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:09.320]  military they're they're doing some thinking on their own they're not
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:15.320]  depending on Obama to give them a sense of direction I think they are getting
[1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:21.320]  along with the Iraqi people like they have never done they're getting along
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:26.160]  with the Afghan if you're if you're reading between the lines and and even
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:31.840]  not always between the lines we're getting a different picture coming from
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:38.840]  both Afghanistan and Iraq because I think our military I think they we've got
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:43.800]  some people in there that have enough smarts to recognize that we cannot
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:50.320]  finance all these wars out there such as we've been doing the bank corrupt the
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:54.800]  nation it's to bankrupt the states right to the bankers made all this money out
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:59.880]  of fiat thin air and want to bankrupt us just like a local bank wants to bankrupt
[1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:08.280]  the farmer they want the land sure and but I'll tell you it's coming to an end
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:15.000]  and coming very very rapidly much faster than I would have ever thought that it
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:21.320]  could happen because I see it happening all the last time I was on your show
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:27.440]  several months ago I you know why you you put my address on there and we said
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:30.680]  anybody that sends a five dollar bill we'll send them a copy of that little
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:36.680]  book walls in our mind we sent out hundreds of them we had never I've done
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:43.160]  hundreds of talk shows and I have never never had the response that we had from
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:49.440]  that show I we were on I was on for at least an hour I think but we got a
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:55.360]  tremendous response well which is another indicator of how large the radio
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:28:00.440]  shows gotten but how active the people are and how hungry they are for
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:08.120]  information read so much so much other stuff is going on and happening but you
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:13.880]  look at how they do create walls in our minds they paint false pitchers Obama is
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:17.920]  expanding all these wars increasing the military budget while cutting the pay to
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:22.320]  the troops last year he tried to make troops by their own insurance I even had
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:27.720]  the head of I haven't had the head of the American Legion on speaking out
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:32.400]  against it but then they spin it to say the troops are angry they say Obama
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:37.720]  isn't waging enough wars they say Obama isn't giving him the surge they need
[1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:42.440]  which is total false reality the troops know we're going bankrupt they know it's
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:46.920]  a fraud they know it's a lie they don't want to be there but the media creates
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:51.480]  this fake spin that Obama's a liberal against the war when he's actually
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:54.080]  expanding it

[1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:15.720]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:20.080]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:30:20.080 --> 1:30:24.160]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:28.720]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:32.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:36.800]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:09.240]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:32:09.240 --> 1:32:12.840]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:17.880]  I've turned an endless influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:22.520]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:26.880]  citizens to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:32.120]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:36.440]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:39.920]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[1:32:39.920 --> 1:32:45.160]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:50.840]  have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:56.200]  at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[1:32:56.200 --> 1:33:05.440]  prisonplanet.tv. Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the
[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:14.040]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network ease the t-rex of political talk Alex
[1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:28.160]  Jones on the GCN radio network. Well Red Bagman is just gonna be with us for the
[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:32.360]  rest of the hour and I want to start getting to your phone calls with our
[1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:39.840]  guest but Red you were trying to make a point as we went to break about the fact
[1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:44.160]  that we're calling this the second American Revolution I say the answer to
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:51.240]  1984 is the spirit of 1776 but in truth we are the restorationist we are the
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:55.920]  lawful government we're the good guys a bunch of offshore banks robbing us of
[1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:00.080]  trillions of dollars and setting up a police state they're the bad guys they're
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:06.480]  the revolutionaries go ahead well I if we're in a revolution it's the third
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:12.760]  revolution which is going to restore our lawful government in this
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:18.800]  country because the second American Revolution started right in the very
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:24.000]  beginning because we had some of those people back there in that generation who
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:30.840]  also thought that they were smart enough to where they could rule and the rest of
[1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:38.120]  us would be their servants and and so through subversion and it comes down
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:43.600]  you can trace it all the way down through our history the Civil War was
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:51.360]  an absolute atrocity that was perpetrated by some of these so-called very
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:56.760]  wise people smart people and it's on record that the Rothschilds and the
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:01.200]  British I mean it's mainline history manipulated both sides to have the war
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:05.820]  there wasn't a good side or a bad side it was all manipulated to try to break the
[1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:11.320]  country up right and and and you can see it then and of course as you come down
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:18.160]  through history you can see that tremendous influx of European
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:25.200]  West European immigrants coming into this country starting about 1880 for
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:33.440]  sure and continuing on until about 1910 or 1920 30 some odd million they figure
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:38.280]  came and of course they didn't learn the language that quick they learned it and
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:44.880]  they became great Americans but they were so easily manipulated and of course
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:51.520]  well like I said earlier we got the income tax and the 17th amendment of
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:57.600]  course and we got the Federal Reserve Bank in 1930 that's right most of the
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:00.960]  first Americans really wanted to get away from tyranny didn't mean they were
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:06.880]  angels or perfect but they were pretty pretty street smart wise and sly but you
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:10.800]  get a bunch of people say from Germany hard-working great people they were
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:16.160]  property of their local Lord you had the Hessians who were military slaves you
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:18.840]  know they don't teach that in school because supposedly only blacks were
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:22.720]  indentured servants or slaves at the complete fraud you had other people from
[1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:28.440]  Poland people from France where they were under Napoleonic law of the
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:34.200]  government is God and so they got here and didn't understand and now we've got
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:39.600]  people from Mexico and Asia and other places with no history of freedom and
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:43.840]  and red have you noticed the government's hiring all these illegals to be the
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:50.200]  military and the police and and to be the CPS workers absolutely and it's all
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:57.040]  according to their plan and here's the thing that I have said I've had so many
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:02.160]  people call me over the years and and just so concerned they say oh they're
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:07.240]  gonna bring in the foreign troops and and there might be a certain amount of
[1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:14.200]  that but you see that's where we we reach these people these foreign troops
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:19.280]  when they come in and they they are going to be absolutely amazed at what we
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:25.080]  have in this country no instead they're incrementally well instead and hold on
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:29.320]  six I want to add this they're incrementally having drills with foreign
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:33.240]  troops having foreign troops help run the command and control but no they're
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:37.480]  recruiting the boy scouts to be the paramilitary they're militarizing the
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:41.360]  police they're bringing in the immigrants and making them our police in our
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:45.120]  military they don't need to bring in a foreign force they're turning the force
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:50.400]  into a foreign force yeah well the thing is we have to we have to inform
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:56.840]  those people and and they'll come over and they'll be on our side in fact that
[1:37:56.840 --> 1:37:59.960]  happened in the Revolutionary War I know you know this but tell folks about
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:05.120]  the Germans defecting in mass to our side oh there was a tremendous number of
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:13.880]  them they were the English of course they hired the Hessians they were
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:20.160]  German troops and of course they're the ones that were the victims of George
[1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:26.040]  Washington and Trenton the famous crossing of the Delaware River I think
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:31.000]  was the Delaware if I remember it was Trenton yes it was yeah and and and of
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:39.160]  course I just think that I it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out how
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:45.880]  corrupt our government is and as long as we're able to speak and as long as we
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:52.440]  have our our written materials out there and such the whole world is watching
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:39:00.520]  us now they're watching us very close and I think that we've got more people
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:07.680]  out there in the other countries of the world that are cheering us on they're
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:13.040]  all for us so I know I like nice they recognize that we have something here
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:20.360]  that they would all like to have and they don't they don't you know they they
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:24.520]  don't like the central banks the central banks are in trouble all over this world
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:31.000]  today yes and so you know the Euro isn't doing all that great the dollar the
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.800]  only thing that's holding up the dollar at this point is the fact that the
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:38.920]  Euro is having a problem well read think how far we've come and now they go
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:43.880]  okay it's all real what's the big deal I want to go to phone calls but coming
[1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:47.640]  up I want to get into your book why the militia with an encapsulation of what
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:52.360]  the militia really is how do you stop infiltration provocateur false flag
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:58.040]  setups and the enemy racing to put their cashless grid in and so how getting
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:02.480]  back to rural communities being self-sufficient will defeat the enemy
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:07.080]  it's like a cancer it can only come into a certain or it it's like something
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:10.600]  with a rundown immune system so we're going to talk about that as well but

[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:33.360]  we had Max Kaiser on the show and he was talking about learned helplessness and
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:38.320]  he was reading from an article our Americans are broken people why we've
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:43.200]  stopped fighting back against the forces of oppression and then I had a
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:50.160]  chance to see Dr. Bruce E. Levine on Max's TV show so we got him on the
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:55.880]  broadcast today because I've read so many corporate documents one of the best
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:01.740]  examples was in 2001 they had a RFID summit in Chicago with Gillette the
[1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:06.280]  Pentagon and others saying how do we force everybody to accept RFID and
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:11.000]  every can of beans every razor all your tires tracking everywhere you go will
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:14.400]  make the real world like a Google searchable system where everything's
[1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:21.760]  tracked and they said our internal studies show 87% don't want this but it
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.440]  also shows we can create a sense of brokenness or desperation where they
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:29.640]  just submit once we break through these barriers so they know what they're
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:32.880]  doing and the naked body scanners recording you and your children's
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:36.400]  genitals lying about it saying they don't record it now it's admitted they do
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:41.120]  record it in the TSA zone documents it's all about a journey into total
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:44.720]  enslavement now the chief of police in Austin takes blood without warrants they
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:50.640]  do it all over the state of Texas I mean under a federal grant in England they
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:54.280]  come up and do random checkpoints and ask you if you're a terrorist we're being
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:50:01.720]  bathed in tyranny Bruce E. Levine PhD is a clinical psychologist an author of is
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:07.320]  surviving America depression epidemic how to find moral energy and community in
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:13.440]  a world gone crazy dr. Levine has been a private practice since 85 and has
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:16.440]  presented talks and workshops to diverse organizations around North America
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:20.200]  he's also the author of common sense rebellion taking back your life from
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:24.520]  drugs we've been decking and we've had it really good for a long time and that
[1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:28.760]  always leads to weakness we've been spoiled our children we haven't gone
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.880]  through adversity people don't appreciate things I think the most important thing
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:36.680]  of a cornucopia factors and I want dr. Levine to talk about this because I've
[1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:41.480]  read his writings and really think it's very piercing and and right along my
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:46.360]  own research just from studying this and watching it being part of it the
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:51.800]  process of awakening people that Madison Avenue and I've read Bernays two books
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:55.480]  I've read many other books by the big modern fathers of advertising and
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:51:00.280]  propaganda and most people know this but they don't consciously real you know
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:05.280]  put into their decision-making every day and people don't think about it but
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:11.160]  most people know that Madison Avenue learned about a hundred years ago to
[1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:15.440]  make you feel inadequate so they choose a body type on average that women don't
[1:51:15.440 --> 1:51:19.720]  look like for thousands of years the full-bodied voluptuous figure was the
[1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:24.440]  most beautiful in every culture it's what I like it's what men like I don't
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:27.680]  like what modern porn has done in a lot of ways but in one respect it has brought
[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:31.800]  back the real figure men like you know the market has shown they don't want
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:38.200]  some skinny heroin head but but but but Madison Avenue chose that because then
[1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:41.280]  women will feel inadequate and they could sell them all the cosmetics the drugs
[1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:46.840]  the the diets ever Bernays you know they had women with cigarettes at at
[1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:53.000]  rallies they paid them to smoke cigarettes at meetings where women were
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:57.600]  trying to get voting suffrage their voting rights and so because it was a
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:00.920]  good cause overall because they were smoking cigarettes and the cigarette
[1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:06.640]  manufacturers funded that they tied it into fake rebellion but bottom line they
[1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:11.600]  make you feel inadequate men women then they can give you a false image of what
[1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:15.560]  it is to be a strong man or woman which actually makes you feel even less
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:18.600]  empowered and then people just keep doing more and more of what the system
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:22.400]  says and so people don't see themselves as leaders they don't see themselves as
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:29.000]  trailblazers our role models aren't inventors and civil rights activists and
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:35.720]  scientists and trailblazers and explorers as America's icons had been
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:40.600]  previously now it's some drug addict athlete or it's some drug addict actress
[1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:45.440]  or it's some the image makers know what they've done and they've told you if
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:49.800]  you're not 22 in a blonde or you're not you know a 25 year old basketball star
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:54.640]  you have no worth and the children are all given false dreams of being something
[1:52:54.640 --> 1:52:59.440]  that one out of 10,000 are gonna be able to do or maybe one out of a million in
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:04.240]  some cases be a movie star and so people feel pathetic about themselves so how
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:09.440]  could they stand up and be leaders going back to Dr. Levine go ahead sir yeah I
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:14.120]  mean I think there's two really are in cities forces working at the same time
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:18.160]  one is that there's a you know what you're talking about just kind of making
[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:23.280]  people feel bad about their basic humanity you know pathologizing
[1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:27.520]  medicalizing disease and doing all these kinds of things to make people you
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:31.160]  feel like who they are or something problematic one thing happens off of
[1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:34.320]  that is that there's a lot of money to be made off of that certainly in my
[1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:38.760]  profession and I can go through that with you is there's also what ends up
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:43.320]  happening is as folks are making money you know the powers to be get to have a
[1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:48.800]  more kind of compliant population who feels lousy about themselves so it's
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:53.240]  in the total interest of the kind of corporate authoritarian kind of society
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:57.600]  that we have here that that that gets spread and that's why it'll it will not
[1:53:57.600 --> 1:54:01.600]  be confronted in any kind of on any kind of mass media I mean for the obvious
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:05.280]  thing is that they're being supported by all by commercials by all of these
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:08.600]  kinds of different companies that are selling it but on another level it
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:13.160]  won't be confronted by any of the powers to be that are on top of this whole
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:16.680]  hierarchy here because you know at some level they want a population not really
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:20.000]  feeling too good about themselves that's not a population that's gonna rebel is
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:24.920]  this not a corporate psychological dictatorship we're living under well it
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:29.680]  has been for a pretty long time idea one little story here the the actual the
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:33.440]  father of the American Psychiatric Association literally I mean he's if you
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:37.840]  took a look at their in their their image there you know that that that it
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:42.280]  warns the American Psychiatric Association seal it's a guy named Dr. Benjamin
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:46.760]  Rush you know he's like signed the declaration of independence and so
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:50.520]  he's you know they're real proud of him well what this guy did was in addition to
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:54.960]  many other crazy treatments they killed a lot of people including George
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:58.520]  Washington including George Washington yeah yeah yeah I mean one of his
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:02.840]  illnesses that he came up with was something called anarchy which which
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:06.600]  which he defined as quotes an excessive passion for liberty and it
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:11.320]  constituted for him a form of insanity so for him certainly anybody who at the
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:16.240]  time who was upset about the American rule of revolution going in the way of a
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:20.800]  more centralized totalitarian kind of society that we've ended up with here
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:24.640]  today was was anybody who confronted that they had some kind of disease called
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:29.120]  anarchy up and throughout the whole history of my profession you'll see
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:32.840]  that and so today I mean now more and more people used to say this and and
[1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:35.760]  guys like you who were interviewing me they think I'm making this up that I'm
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:39.760]  being it was being sarcastic but there but more and more people are hit to the
[1:55:39.760 --> 1:55:43.440]  idea that there actually is an illness today in in my business called
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:49.240]  oppositional defiant disorder ODD and this is not an arcane diagnosis is given
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:54.160]  often and kids are behaviorally modified no no no no John Gartner on the phone was
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:58.880]  basically telling me I had this that you had ODD yeah I mean basically I'm
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:04.360]  I'm yeah and schizophrenic well let me tell the audience I would doubt that
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:08.960]  there's one member of your audience there who does not have the symptoms of ODD
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:12.320]  I sure as heck I'm proud to have it I mean some of the symptoms that they call an
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:18.400]  illness are one often argues with adults to often refuses to comply with adults I
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:22.200]  mean you know often gets upset and angry with with adults I mean these are
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:26.240]  these are the symptoms of an illness and you know what that's the most odd one of
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:31.520]  more obvious so-called psychiatric you know so-called illnesses that it's
[1:56:31.520 --> 1:56:34.840]  clearly a form of rebellion but if you take a look at almost everything else
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:39.800]  that has been labeled as a illness or a pathology or you know throughout the
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:45.360]  history of my business it's really either an overt or a covert form of
[1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:49.720]  rebellion and and of course it there's much more money and you know to be made
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:53.120]  by labeling an illness especially nowadays when you drug drug everything
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:57.480]  and pharmaceutical companies are making a ton off of off of people's problems
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:00.640]  and off of people's rebellions but it's also in the benefit for the whole
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:05.760]  culture in society if you can if you can drug every rebellious kid out there if
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.360]  you can drug every everybody out there who is depressed because their life is
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:12.960]  is miserable here because there's no freedom there's no justice there's no
