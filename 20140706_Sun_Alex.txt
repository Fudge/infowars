[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.400 --> 00:09.400]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.400 --> 00:38.400]  Even though I knew that the globalist were accelerating their plan for a total global takeover via engineered collapse, it's one thing to know it intellectually as I've said many times.
[00:38.400 --> 00:42.400]  It is another thing entirely to be witnessing it unfold.
[00:42.400 --> 00:48.400]  We are seeing just the beginnings of that accelerated collapse taking place right now.
[00:48.400 --> 01:06.400]  Really only one thing that can change this peacefully and that is a awakening across the board a paradigm shattering understanding by people on the so-called left and right that the larger system is rigged.
[01:06.400 --> 01:25.400]  And people have to become aware of how the social engineers are manipulating us playing us off against each other so that we're busy fighting mindlessly over diversionary issues while the real decisions are being made by the technocrats.
[01:25.400 --> 01:38.400]  Now on this sixth day of July 2014, we're really going to focus for most of the broadcast about the collapse of the US border. That's a big deal.
[01:38.400 --> 01:49.400]  And it is a high crime in misdemeanor. It is the president not faithfully executing his oath to protect the country's border.
[01:49.400 --> 01:56.400]  And this is the exact type of thing that we saw begin the impeachment of Richard Millhouse Nixon.
[01:56.400 --> 02:06.400]  So we're going to be discussing all of this and more today. Now, Kit Daniels, one of our great reporters at infowars.com is out of town visiting family.
[02:06.400 --> 02:18.400]  He's not in Austin where this broadcast comes to you from. He's out in the country with his folks, but he's going to drive into town where he can get cell signal at the start of the next hour and do a few segments with us.
[02:18.400 --> 02:38.400]  Because late last week we got a letter in the mail here at the offices from the Department of the Air Force from the head general of the 502nd Air Base Wing that covers a bunch of bases in San Antonio saying that they're basically looking at federal prison for Kit Daniels.
[02:38.400 --> 02:53.400]  Who said I'm here for an anti Pelosi press conference and I'm here to try to ask her questions and they also got some footage of the facility within the facility holding the illegal alien kids for a cost of 250 bucks a day.
[02:53.400 --> 03:06.400]  And they're saying that they they will arrest him if he ever comes back and that they're basically looking at coming after him feds threatened journalists with prison of a report on illegal immigration.
[03:06.400 --> 03:17.400]  Now this broke last Friday only drudgereport.com picked it up just giving credit where credits are due. It's pretty big news when they threaten journalists already last week.
[03:17.400 --> 03:35.400]  Guys I forgot it. Will you print it for me already last week back last Monday. A member of Congress we will we learn for three weeks have been trying to get into the same base and others and a federal judge ruled no you can't go on the base to see what's going on.
[03:35.400 --> 03:52.400]  This isn't like some secret base with nukes when Kit Daniels went on the base they were at it was open because they had a graduation going on there separately just a separate area fenced off with the illegals is off limits but a congressman has been barred access to any of it.
[03:52.400 --> 04:08.400]  So again congressman barred from the facility as well. This illustrates how controlled the system is and another story that we broke that that no one covered but drudge was finally picked up by the New York Times.
[04:08.400 --> 04:28.400]  And by a bunch of other publications like the daily caller border meltdown this is three weeks after we broke it border meltdown Obama delivering 290,000 illegals to the US homes and they admit they put them on buses at the border and then just deliver them to wherever they want to be dropped off.
[04:28.400 --> 04:45.400]  We broke that back on June 16th drudge carried it on the 17th and 18th and we'll give you that headline if you want to go look it up and watch the video and I'm just showing how controlled this is the New York Times reported on July 3rd.
[04:45.400 --> 04:59.400]  I'm at influx of migrants Obama is to skip border visit in Texas trip. Our story was caught red handed border patrol paying to ship illegals deep into US and broke that it was going to their families who are illegal aliens themselves stay with us.
[04:59.400 --> 05:17.400]  The police are shoving people shoving Alex shoving the crowd whether it's the radio show the news websites documentary films or the nightly news info wars is the tip of the spear.
[05:17.400 --> 05:30.400]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[05:30.400 --> 05:38.400]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so called rebels.
[05:38.400 --> 05:51.400]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth. It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[05:51.400 --> 06:10.400]  Visit info wars news dot com today become a member share your membership and help take the info war to the next level.
[06:10.400 --> 06:39.400]  It is only fitting that a free screen should sound the alarm against those who would destroy freedom or in its part to deceive and inflame or enlighten and inspire the motion picture as no equal.
[06:39.400 --> 06:55.400]  Ladies and gentlemen I am Alex Jones your host thank you very much for joining us on this Sunday worldwide transmission the sixth day of July 2014 again I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:55.400 --> 07:03.400]  We have the news websites prisonplanet.com because our planet by the technocrats is being turned into a prison planet.
[07:03.400 --> 07:16.400]  Then of course we have info wars dot com the very tip of the spear worldwide in unabashedly wearing our bias of telling the truth and defending freedom on our sleeve.
[07:16.400 --> 07:30.400]  You know I'm going to be as calm as I can today and I say that often and rarely or am able to do it but I'm going to try my best today because I've got to get to the big picture and then drill down into each facet of it.
[07:30.400 --> 07:38.400]  In an attempt to try to raise the alarm for people out there about how serious a situation we're in.
[07:38.400 --> 07:52.400]  And then if we don't get past the political correctness with a political brainwashing that we are under in this country it is over.
[07:52.400 --> 08:04.400]  And of course I'm talking about the fact that for the last three months according to the president of the border patrol union and the vice president who we've interviewed both of them.
[08:04.400 --> 08:19.400]  Obama has ordered a completely illegal unlawful tyrannical autocratic opening of the border from Southern California to Texas the entire 2,200 mile piece of land.
[08:19.400 --> 08:37.400]  Now again it's not like Switzerland borders us a failed collapsed country that has had over 100 plus thousand people killed in just the last seven eight years literally cannot even field an Olympic team.
[08:37.400 --> 08:46.400]  And even the highly controlled tourist areas are now not safe to go to and the State Department has to admit you shouldn't go anywhere in Mexico.
[08:46.400 --> 08:54.400]  And Mexico has opened its southern border in the last three months in a conservative effort with the White House and that's all come out by the way.
[08:54.400 --> 09:01.400]  But it's not in the big national newspapers but it's confirmed we're going to be going over it has opened its border with Guatemala.
[09:01.400 --> 09:14.400]  Probably one of the most dangerous countries in the world and one of the few countries in this hemisphere more dangerous long term than Mexico.
[09:14.400 --> 09:22.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, so Central America, South America are now open right through Mexico.
[09:22.400 --> 09:42.400]  And the fact that Obama has been by fiat legalizing all these different illegals when they get here and putting them on welfare as new Democratic voters is only an incentive obviously to bring even larger waves in and this could completely collapse the southwest.
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.400]  And then there'll be an emergency the federal government can use to basically militarize everything.
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.400]  They have another word for it. It's called martial law.
[09:53.400 --> 09:56.400]  This is a false flag. This is a staged crisis.
[09:56.400 --> 10:09.400]  Obama said we can't let a good crisis go away so does Chief of Staff and he's been saying I will act unilaterally outside of Congress if they don't legalize all the illegals that are here 30 million at least because that will fix illegal immigration.
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.400]  Yes, legalize anyone that can get here and then that will stop more coming.
[10:14.400 --> 10:25.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, if we needed skilled workers and if skilled workers weren't being laid off in massive numbers in the US, I would be all for unlimited skilled workers coming in.
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.400]  I don't care where you come from Germany, China, Mexico, wherever it is.
[10:30.400 --> 10:34.400]  But we don't. We're in the middle of a depression slash recession.
[10:34.400 --> 10:41.400]  Inflation is kicking in food prices are exploding and the rest of the world is sinking even faster.
[10:41.400 --> 10:55.400]  And the answer is take on a bunch of single moms with three or four kids into the United States and let the government bypass federal law and flood the states that have got to pay for it.
[10:55.400 --> 11:03.400]  And let three, four time loser criminals from all over the world come here and then when they catch them, they don't even deport them.
[11:03.400 --> 11:14.400]  I've got the Austin Chronicle current issue here in front of me of the July 4 issue and it's got an illegal with an American flag with holes cut in it on his face.
[11:14.400 --> 11:23.400]  And it attacks the Travis County Sheriff. This is just a microcosm example, basically saying it's racist that he deport 13 people a week.
[11:23.400 --> 11:27.400]  And that's the third biggest deportation number of any city in the country.
[11:27.400 --> 11:33.400]  We're a city of over a million people metro and growing 10th largest city in the U.S.
[11:33.400 --> 11:37.400]  I would guess 5000 legal shop a week conservatively.
[11:37.400 --> 11:39.400]  I mean, that's a very conservative number.
[11:39.400 --> 11:43.400]  They're only deporting hardcore aggravated felons.
[11:43.400 --> 11:46.400]  And by the way, I just turned them loose when he gives them to him.
[11:46.400 --> 11:48.400]  I mean, this is a sanctuary city.
[11:48.400 --> 11:51.400]  The article is like, we're supposed to be a sanctuary city.
[11:51.400 --> 11:52.400]  What are you doing?
[11:52.400 --> 11:57.400]  Deploying 13 people a day. Oh my gosh. This is incredible.
[11:57.400 --> 12:00.400]  In our days, the beta chimes in, you know, that's not a good thing.
[12:00.400 --> 12:02.400]  We need to have trust with these communities.
[12:02.400 --> 12:06.400]  Let's get something straight, folks.
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.400]  People like Robert Rodriguez, who's going to host Obama coming up this week when he goes to three Texas cities,
[12:11.400 --> 12:18.400]  but doesn't visit the border, even though the governor is begging him to aren't saying anything about the qualities that have killed hundreds of thousands of Mexicans.
[12:18.400 --> 12:22.400]  They're not saying a word about the tyranny in Mexico.
[12:22.400 --> 12:30.400]  No, it's just fashionable and cool because the Ford Foundation and the federal government wants to balkanize this country in North America
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.400]  to promote a type of new modern clan movement, but with Hispanics.
[12:35.400 --> 12:42.400]  And that's what this is, is to basically radicalize Hispanics, break the border, flood North America,
[12:42.400 --> 12:45.400]  and then create a new political system out of that.
[12:45.400 --> 12:48.400]  That's the globalist model to take control.
[12:48.400 --> 12:59.400]  And by the way, I had a top UC Davis professor, Daryl Hamamoto, who's a prestigious professor, sociologist, anthropologist, a political scientist,
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.400]  an expert on the Japanese-American internment, saying exactly what I just said,
[13:04.400 --> 13:11.400]  and he worked for the Rockefeller Foundation and has been given awards by him and is basically blowing the whistle.
[13:11.400 --> 13:16.400]  Okay, you can go see the interview from last Thursday on infowars.com.
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.400]  In fact, I'm going to have that reposted right now on the front page of infowars.com.
[13:21.400 --> 13:30.400]  They used America's total openness to say it's racist if you don't take unlimited illegals.
[13:30.400 --> 13:36.400]  Oh, and by the way, ICE has now been ordered, according to AP, to not call them illegals.
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.400]  First, don't call them aliens, then don't call them illegals.
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.400]  Every country in the world, by the way, that goes back to Latin.
[13:43.400 --> 13:47.400]  Call someone who's in a country, legally a resident alien.
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.400]  It just means not from this area.
[13:50.400 --> 13:52.400]  But it's political correctness.
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.400]  Now you call them unaccompanied children.
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.400]  This is the reality, ladies and gentlemen, and the whole police state set up for the American people,
[14:00.400 --> 14:06.400]  and they sell this idea that why, if you're not a racist, you need to support Obamacare and turn your guns in.
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.400]  You know, not turning your guns in is racist. The NRA is the new Klan.
[14:10.400 --> 14:15.400]  You've heard that. When the NRA was founded to arm blacks after the Civil War by Christian groups,
[14:15.400 --> 14:17.400]  so the Klan wouldn't kill them.
[14:17.400 --> 14:20.400]  Founded to fight the Klan? You're the Klan.
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.400]  You're the Klan, according to the Klan's over at MSNBC.
[14:24.400 --> 14:27.400]  Freudian slip, they dress in clown outfits.
[14:27.400 --> 14:31.400]  That's what we're dealing with here, just upside down reality.
[14:31.400 --> 14:38.400]  Do all of you trendies wonder why you can't get jobs or why you have three degrees with the colleges but work at McDonald's?
[14:38.400 --> 14:44.400]  Do all of you trendies understand that the world is collapsing into a global depression right now
[14:44.400 --> 14:50.400]  and no country in the world has ever opened its borders up to outsiders like this, totally dropping them?
[14:50.400 --> 14:58.400]  I mean, this is the very definition of treason by Obama and the political class and the Republican Party.
[14:58.400 --> 15:01.400]  Where is Rick Perry declaring civil emergency?
[15:01.400 --> 15:06.400]  He's just mildly criticizing Obama saying you should come down to the border and see it for yourself.
[15:06.400 --> 15:08.400]  See it for himself.
[15:08.400 --> 15:17.400]  We broke back on June 16th at infowars.com and only drudgereport.com would carry it the day after.
[15:17.400 --> 15:30.400]  The video of the emergency manager in McAllen, Texas and of an ice agent blowing the whistle to us with his voice altered saying for months they bust them in.
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.400]  Mexico's part of it, we put them on buses, pay for their tickets or ship them wherever they want to go.
[15:35.400 --> 15:37.400]  They're just freed, they're released.
[15:37.400 --> 15:41.400]  36,000 aggravated felons released in one month, last month.
[15:41.400 --> 15:43.400]  I mean, they're releasing child rapists, folks.
[15:43.400 --> 15:47.400]  The government pays to do it, they advertise it in Latin America.
[15:47.400 --> 15:56.400]  This is a plan to fully have tens of millions come, not hundreds of thousands a month to implode and wreck and bankrupt the country.
[15:56.400 --> 16:21.400]  It's called Cloward and Pivot.
[16:21.400 --> 16:31.400]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.400]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[16:35.400 --> 16:39.400]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.

[20:39.260 --> 20:43.240]  have Infowars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central, five nights a week with all of
[20:43.240 --> 20:47.840]  our great reporters from Adon Salazar to Jacarie Jackson, from Leanne McAdoo to
[20:47.840 --> 20:56.400]  Darren McBreen to John Baum, Mark Ghost Morales, Kurt Nemo, Kit Daniels is
[20:56.400 --> 21:00.040]  coming up in the next hour. Pentagon's threatening to arrest him. You have the
[21:00.040 --> 21:04.320]  official letter. It's national news because he dared videotape some of the
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.120]  illegal aliens on the military bases in San Antonio. So I'll have to defend that,
[21:09.120 --> 21:12.760]  probably in federal court. Yeah, they're telling they want to put him in federal
[21:12.760 --> 21:17.520]  prison for six months. That story was up on dredgerport.com for three days. By the
[21:17.520 --> 21:23.680]  way, ladies and gentlemen, continuing here with the fact that we know what we're
[21:23.680 --> 21:29.320]  talking about with our reporters, here is the headline from the 18th. We
[21:29.320 --> 21:33.360]  originally put out a video report on the 16th, caught red-handed border patrol
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.360]  paying to ship illegals deep into the U.S. Exclusive federal government works to
[21:38.360 --> 21:43.360]  keep illegals outside U.S. while passing the cost to American taxpayers. And
[21:43.360 --> 21:49.960]  what's the report on Drudge today? The headline is Obama pays the ship 300,000
[21:50.320 --> 21:55.000]  illegals to private homes in the U.S. And where does that come from? It's in the
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  New York Times in the last page of a three-page article amid influx of
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.600]  migrants. Obama is to skip border visit on Texas trip. And then later it has the
[22:05.600 --> 22:11.400]  border agencies defending that they just bust them in and then give them a bus
[22:11.400 --> 22:14.840]  voucher and let them go wherever they want. The daily caller has a boil down on
[22:14.840 --> 22:20.920]  it. Border meltdown Obama delivering 290,000 is actually 300,000 illegals to
[22:20.920 --> 22:25.160]  U.S. homes. Okay. Look, if you're a new listener, just need to get something
[22:25.160 --> 22:32.320]  straight. I was up here on Saturday working. Okay. You understand? I'm not
[22:32.320 --> 22:36.920]  playing games. Okay. I've had to have arguments with my family, not and I got
[22:36.920 --> 22:40.280]  a lot of smart family, by the way, who've worked in black operations, you
[22:40.280 --> 22:46.480]  name it, to not leave the country. Okay. This is a planned total shutdown of the
[22:46.480 --> 22:50.360]  U.S. If these illegals aren't turned back and I'm talking in the next month or
[22:50.360 --> 22:53.480]  so, then this isn't shut down. You're not going to see hundreds of thousands a
[22:53.480 --> 22:57.240]  month. You're going to see millions and you're going to see a total collapse of
[22:57.240 --> 23:01.840]  resources. It's already happening as far north as New York. Now, by the way, I
[23:01.840 --> 23:06.560]  don't hate these people. If they were libertarians and had skills, I would be
[23:06.560 --> 23:10.720]  all for it. I could care less what color their skin is. I know the geopolitical
[23:10.720 --> 23:14.640]  plan that is written in stone to bring this country and the world down under
[23:14.640 --> 23:20.000]  globalism. The UN is complaining right now in my stack saying, Oh, Australia, you
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.720]  got to open your borders up to anybody and the U.S., you got to open yours up. You
[23:24.720 --> 23:29.080]  can't go. I was reading about African countries. In fact, print me the article
[23:29.080 --> 23:32.280]  guys. I was reading about African countries where they say all whites
[23:32.280 --> 23:36.440]  out, no whites allowed. Nobody cares if that happens. You know, when Mugabe comes
[23:36.440 --> 23:41.600]  out and says it, if I went down to Mexico and said, give me free healthcare, give
[23:41.600 --> 23:45.720]  me free welfare, they would laugh at me because no one could do that. If you did
[23:45.720 --> 23:51.720]  that, people would come from all over the world until you collapsed. And again,
[23:51.720 --> 23:56.760]  Mexico is rated in the top five of unstable countries worldwide by our own
[23:56.760 --> 24:03.080]  State Department CIA fact book. Look it up. CIA.gov. It's one of the most
[24:03.080 --> 24:10.320]  unstable, dangerous places in the world. And I'm literally looking at articles in
[24:10.320 --> 24:13.600]  the Austin American Statesmen and the Chronicle where I live in Austin going,
[24:13.600 --> 24:21.400]  how dare the racist evil people not one open border be friendly. This is crazy
[24:21.400 --> 24:26.600]  town, ladies and gentlemen, crazy town. I like Mexico. I want to be able to go
[24:26.600 --> 24:31.840]  down there and vacation. Can't do it. It's too dangerous now. So continuing,
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.600]  let's get to some of these Obama clips because on July 4th, Obama, the
[24:36.600 --> 24:40.640]  globalist who says, if you have a business, you didn't build it. Who says
[24:40.640 --> 24:48.800]  people that own guns and have Bibles are better clairs. This guy at a citizen
[24:48.800 --> 24:55.760]  ceremony, nationalization ceremony sits there and shows a bunch of exploited
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.160]  immigrants who had to join the military and, you know, get arms and legs blown
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.440]  off to become citizens. But that shows what they had to go through. Now you
[25:03.440 --> 25:08.640]  can just walk across the border and he says, you know what, we need more
[25:08.640 --> 25:12.040]  people. That's what makes this country great. Yes, we have the most open
[25:12.040 --> 25:16.800]  immigration ever. Ellis Island, only a third of the people were let in because
[25:16.800 --> 25:20.400]  if you had diseases or you had a criminal record, you got sent back,
[25:20.400 --> 25:23.120]  ladies and gentlemen. By the way, I've got articles in my stack. I'm going to
[25:23.120 --> 25:27.240]  get to I'm giving you a big picture right now where TB is breaking out all
[25:27.240 --> 25:32.040]  over the country. Drug resistant drug immune. What do you think third world
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.400]  countries are like? What do you think they're like? They don't have any
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.000]  social services. They've collapsed. And now if we take all these people on, it
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.200]  collapses us. It's not like we're in a boom time here in America, ladies and
[25:46.200 --> 25:51.240]  gentlemen. Yeah, here it is. Robert Mugabe says no whites may own land in
[25:51.240 --> 25:55.600]  Zimbabwe. This is after 15 years of almost every white family being butchered
[25:55.600 --> 25:59.320]  and burned up in their houses by the equivalent of black land. There's this
[25:59.320 --> 26:05.280]  idea that only white people can do racist bad things, which is pure crap.
[26:05.280 --> 26:08.720]  They even call it reverse racism when a non white does something racial.
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.440]  People are exactly the same folks. You've always had people that think
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.920]  tribally and think at that level. And the Democrats think at that level. They
[26:17.920 --> 26:23.760]  want a bunch of unwashed dregs on welfare with disabilities and criminal
[26:23.760 --> 26:28.600]  records who cannot work to weigh down the system. It's an official plan. Look
[26:28.600 --> 26:33.720]  it up by the Democratic Party, sociology, cloward and piven 1966 to
[26:33.720 --> 26:37.520]  overload the system and collapse it. And if they can't collapse it by shutting
[26:37.520 --> 26:41.120]  off our coal power plants that supply half the power and by having taxes on
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.480]  us, the China, India, Mexico and 169 of the third world countries don't have,
[26:45.600 --> 26:49.320]  they will ship in because let me tell you the cliche that most of these
[26:49.320 --> 26:52.960]  Latin American and Mexican workers are hardworking is true. They've been
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.200]  hardworking and they had to go across 50 miles of desert to get here before and
[26:57.200 --> 27:00.760]  most of the Mexicans wouldn't go on welfare. They've got sociologist
[27:00.760 --> 27:04.760]  groups trying to figure out how to get them on welfare. So what do they do?
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.240]  They advertise. If you're a big lazy person that wears six X underwear from
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.240]  anywhere in the world, literally, you know, they bought 43,000 pairs of
[27:12.240 --> 27:17.560]  those I stood last week, come to America and we're here waiting. You'll go on
[27:17.560 --> 27:22.720]  instant welfare with a free ticket voucher to be bust anywhere you want.
[27:23.320 --> 27:28.560]  This is a political takeover to get the welfare money by criminal groups in
[27:28.560 --> 27:32.600]  every major city and the new movies, the TV shows being financed by people like
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.320]  Robert Rodriguez with government funding are openly promoting racial
[27:36.320 --> 27:42.920]  division and race war. And this week coming up, Rodriguez will be hosting
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.600]  Obama here to celebrate their victory against Texas to quote, turn it blue.
[27:48.440 --> 27:51.320]  And it's not that I'm even a Republican. I'm a libertarian, but the
[27:51.320 --> 27:56.240]  Democratic Party is like brain cancer folks. It is metastasizing. It is
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.160]  taking over. It is, is persecuting people politically. I'm getting into, I
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.480]  mean, they're trying to arrest. They're threatening to arrest my reporter. Get
[28:04.480 --> 28:08.040]  Daniels who's coming up the next hour. This is national news. We have the
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.680]  official letter from the Pentagon for going and reporting on it. I mean,
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.160]  that's how screwed up this country is. I said, I was settled down. I got to
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.480]  settle down right now. Let's go to Obama, literally urinating on the fourth
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.320]  of July. And remember Pelosi two weeks ago saying, we're all the same
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.000]  hemisphere. We're all Americans. Really. I can't go to Guatemala and get free
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.640]  healthcare. I can't go to Nicaragua and get everything free. I can't go to
[28:30.640 --> 28:34.400]  Mexico and get me. It's a bunch of bull. Can I go to Mexico and say you're
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.040]  racist? If I can't come here and have my baby for free. And if I can't fly
[28:39.040 --> 28:44.920]  into your country and just be let in, nobody does that. So when we come back,
[28:44.920 --> 28:49.000]  I'll play the clips of Obama saying I'll act alone. He's already acted outside
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.520]  of Congress. That's called dictatorship. And here's the big issue. If he gets
[28:53.520 --> 28:56.480]  away with that, you already got away with turning al-Qaeda loose all over the
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.840]  Middle East. You already got away with putting NATO over our military. I began
[29:00.840 --> 29:03.840]  to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family
[29:03.840 --> 29:09.280]  so much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has
[29:09.280 --> 29:13.880]  been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's
[29:13.880 --> 29:18.040]  functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by
[29:18.040 --> 29:23.160]  a doctor group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that
[29:23.160 --> 29:27.000]  your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.760]  this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And
[29:31.760 --> 29:37.320]  the results that I personally have had have been life-changing. Nobody else has
[29:37.320 --> 29:41.540]  got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is
[29:41.540 --> 29:46.240]  innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the
[29:46.240 --> 29:50.000]  TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas. For a
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.240]  limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take

[29:59.520 --> 30:04.560]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is
[30:04.560 --> 30:08.120]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day. But it's not just the air
[30:08.120 --> 30:11.840]  outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times
[30:11.840 --> 30:15.720]  higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And most Americans
[30:15.720 --> 30:20.080]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There
[30:20.080 --> 30:24.320]  are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand
[30:24.320 --> 30:28.120]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the
[30:28.120 --> 30:31.800]  fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When
[30:31.800 --> 30:35.480]  I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start
[30:35.480 --> 30:40.280]  cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape
[30:40.280 --> 30:44.320]  but that we can fight back against. Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[30:44.320 --> 30:49.000]  and manufactured in the USA, the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.160]  convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic

[31:14.280 --> 31:19.880]  seven to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine environmentally clean
[31:19.880 --> 31:26.320]  conditions. The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300
[31:26.320 --> 31:32.600]  million plus year old deposit deep in the earth. It's the strongest nascent

[33:05.320 --> 33:10.320]  to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:12.920 --> 33:19.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[33:19.840 --> 33:27.200]  Radio Network. I literally have over a hundred exhibits, news articles, letters,
[33:27.200 --> 33:33.040]  documents, laws, impeachment documents. I've got to get to all this and I told
[33:33.040 --> 33:39.400]  you I would try to remain calm. It's just that ladies and gentlemen, no country in
[33:39.400 --> 33:45.040]  history that I can think of. Guys, will you print me? I meant to do this, the
[33:45.040 --> 33:50.880]  Cicero clip. Just type in Cicero. The trader is the plague. It's from 2040
[33:50.880 --> 33:55.240]  something years ago. Cicero, the trader is the plague. I want to read
[33:55.240 --> 34:01.920]  that quote. This is so epic what's happening that I can hardly sleep at
[34:01.920 --> 34:09.200]  night. Okay? The United States of America is being imploded into the North
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.360]  American Union. And Nancy Pelosi said it two weeks ago. General Petraeus said it
[34:13.360 --> 34:17.320]  two weeks ago. I played the clip so many times, I'm not gonna play it again. Now
[34:17.320 --> 34:24.360]  Obama comes out last Monday, seven days ago, and says I'm gonna act alone if
[34:24.360 --> 34:28.640]  Congress doesn't. He already acted alone. The Border Patrol President and Vice
[34:28.640 --> 34:35.560]  President, the Union, went public and talked to us and said, no, there's
[34:35.560 --> 34:41.560]  been a stand-down for three months, Mr. Jones. You say you broke all this fine
[34:41.560 --> 34:47.040]  and dandy. We've been telling you that they tell us stand down, you'll be
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.000]  replaced and then no one is replaced. They tell them go pick trash up on the
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.880]  side of the road. Go find people in national parks drinking beer, citizens
[34:54.880 --> 34:58.840]  and ride them tickets. This is what they told us on air. You can go see the
[34:58.840 --> 35:03.720]  interviews at infowars.com. Just type in Border Patrol President. We've been
[35:03.720 --> 35:09.400]  ordered to stand down. Three months ago, while the TSA searches you, while they
[35:09.400 --> 35:13.440]  increase, quote, security at public events on the 4th of July, while they
[35:13.440 --> 35:20.480]  admit Pakistanis, folks from Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia are also part of it now.
[35:20.480 --> 35:25.240]  Because by the way, planes are landing in airports all over the US. You've seen
[35:25.240 --> 35:30.360]  this in the news. I just can't believe it when I even say it. And they're landing
[35:30.360 --> 35:32.920]  at military bases and they're legalizing them right on the spot and
[35:32.920 --> 35:36.240]  busting them wherever they want to go, directly to Democratic Party operations.
[35:36.240 --> 35:42.440]  It's like Akron times a billion. Remember Akron got caught. Yeah, we'll run
[35:42.440 --> 35:46.120]  child slaves out of Latin America for you. Yeah, we'll, you know, we'll do
[35:46.120 --> 35:51.120]  whatever you want. This is how lawless they are. These are not liberals. They
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.640]  use our goodwill. They use our friendliness. They use our hospitality. No
[35:56.640 --> 36:01.480]  one acts like this. No other country puts up with this. Again, Mexico has
[36:01.480 --> 36:06.400]  collapsed. Don't even an Olympic team. That's why they're coming here. The
[36:06.400 --> 36:10.480]  global issue in is bringing in slavery worldwide and it has to bring down
[36:10.480 --> 36:15.160]  national sovereignty so nothing can stand in its way. And the masses are
[36:15.160 --> 36:19.560]  getting played off against each other. I feel sorry for these poor immigrants. I
[36:19.560 --> 36:24.000]  respect them more than I respect the average white, black or brown, yuppie. I
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.760]  see you don't care about having kids, you know, you know, men or men, women or
[36:28.760 --> 36:32.240]  women in a lot of these third world countries. I have more in common with
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.160]  these illegals than I have with the average snot-nosed American citizen. And
[36:36.160 --> 36:39.280]  in a way, I kind of go, you know, let things go ahead and collapse. Go ahead
[36:39.280 --> 36:42.920]  and bring in 10, 20 million. Let them vote to take the guns. Let's become one
[36:42.920 --> 36:47.760]  big giant third world hellhole because that's what all you dumbass so-called
[36:47.760 --> 36:53.120]  liberals want. You're not liberals. You are fad driven, mindless, empty people
[36:53.120 --> 36:56.960]  who follow what the system says. You'll get two, three degrees. You're never
[36:56.960 --> 37:01.760]  gonna get any job with them. You wear whatever you're told by the MTV sicko
[37:01.760 --> 37:05.520]  trendy culture and you wonder why you're such losers. You say you're
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.400]  intellectuals. I've been around you. You're dumber than a whole rock quarry.
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.600]  You're bigger idiots than a box of rocks, ladies and gentlemen. You're a damn
[37:15.600 --> 37:22.480]  asteroid belt of them and you people are stupid. You are stupid. You know, those
[37:22.480 --> 37:27.160]  of us that know how to escape will just leave. You morons have no idea what
[37:27.160 --> 37:32.040]  you've done. Your only identity is saying, oh my gosh, Michelle Obama came out
[37:32.040 --> 37:37.520]  and said, don't be bossy. And I went and saw the clip. Well, that means
[37:37.520 --> 37:42.160]  feminism's not good. So don't be bossy. How bossy is saying, don't say the word
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.920]  bossy. They're attacking the English language. They're attacking thought.
[37:45.920 --> 37:50.120]  These people are the most wild authoritarians. They make 1984 look like
[37:50.120 --> 37:56.640]  a vacation manual. You know what I mean? These people are are are money, Python
[37:56.640 --> 38:05.040]  level, tyrants, joke level and they know they are and they're involved in all
[38:05.040 --> 38:10.280]  sorts of criminal operations. Oh, and by the way, the globalists are using the
[38:10.280 --> 38:16.040]  illegals as a cutout of their own private Democratic Party black market. You
[38:16.040 --> 38:19.360]  get caught with fake documents as a citizen five years in jail, book thrown
[38:19.360 --> 38:22.560]  at you. If you're an illegal, you can do whatever you want. You get back
[38:22.560 --> 38:25.720]  accounts with whatever you want. It's all on record. And remember a few years
[38:25.720 --> 38:30.360]  ago in Austin, $87 million to one house of tax returns and nobody got in
[38:30.360 --> 38:37.040]  trouble. One house, they got $87 million in fake tax return. Atlanta was 100
[38:37.040 --> 38:42.080]  something million at one house. Nobody got in trouble because governmental
[38:42.080 --> 38:46.760]  mafia groups, the people at that house weren't getting that money. Don't you
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.240]  understand? This is the money laundering big bank, narcotics, trafficking,
[38:51.240 --> 38:58.200]  globalist, combine, taking us down. And listen, if Rick Perry does it
[38:58.200 --> 39:03.560]  demand that the Texas guard down there, if they don't start removing and
[39:03.560 --> 39:06.480]  throwing them back over the border and if the Mexican troops want to fire on
[39:06.480 --> 39:09.640]  them like they're already doing on the state police, let's have a war. Let's see
[39:09.640 --> 39:15.280]  what Texas can do. Texas will kick Mexico's ass like we've done before and
[39:15.280 --> 39:21.280]  I've had enough of it. Ladies and gentlemen, the globalist are literally
[39:21.280 --> 39:26.520]  imploding the country right now and Rick Perry is saying, oh, you know, you need
[39:26.520 --> 39:29.240]  to come down there and see this Obama. People are like, that's too tough of
[39:29.240 --> 39:35.200]  Perry. What? And again, I'm talking about the corrupt Mexican military. But see
[39:35.200 --> 39:39.440]  Texas, Texas has sent more DPS down there. You name it, trying to do
[39:39.440 --> 39:43.040]  something to Texas's credit and to Rick Perry's credit and to the head of the
[39:43.040 --> 39:46.520]  DPS's credit and of course it's being demonized. How dare you put some police
[39:46.520 --> 39:50.280]  down on a totally collapsed border with a third world hellhole? How dare you? This
[39:50.280 --> 39:57.720]  is insane. But if you look at what's going on with Mexico, it's the CIA, it's
[39:57.720 --> 40:01.320]  the big banks that launder the money on record that actually went and created
[40:01.320 --> 40:04.960]  Los Zetas and destabilized Mexico and helped bring it down with the Mexican
[40:04.960 --> 40:09.280]  army and then use a fake drug war to go after the competition they don't
[40:09.280 --> 40:14.320]  control. This is all come out in federal court. So it isn't even Mexico's fault.
[40:14.320 --> 40:18.840]  It's the same global criminals running Mexico that run the United States. And
[40:18.840 --> 40:23.560]  the truth is the American people have solidarity with the people of Mexico.
[40:23.560 --> 40:28.160]  See, this is this is reality radio folks. On one hand, I'm angry at Mexico and
[40:28.160 --> 40:32.280]  the corruption and then shooting at the border patrol and the state police and
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.600]  killing people and shaking people down and all the corruption. But on the other
[40:37.600 --> 40:40.720]  hand, I understand the bigger picture and how it's all a giant manipulation. And
[40:40.720 --> 40:45.880]  we need to understand what's going on before it fully collapses and the next
[40:45.880 --> 40:53.480]  big giant waves get here. Let's go to this Obama clip on July 4th and that's
[40:53.480 --> 40:56.800]  why if we want to keep attracting the best and the brightest from beyond our
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.000]  shores, we're going to have to fix our immigration system, which is broken and
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.840]  pass common sense immigration reform. We shouldn't be making it harder for the
[41:05.840 --> 41:09.320]  best and the brightest to come here and create jobs here and grow our economy
[41:09.320 --> 41:15.040]  here. We should be making it easier. And that's why I'm going to keep doing. He
[41:15.040 --> 41:17.520]  agrees with them.
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.240]  So I'm going to keep doing everything I can do to keep making our immigration
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.960]  system smarter and more efficient. So hardworking men and women, like all of you,
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.880]  have the opportunity to join the American family and to serve our great
[41:35.880 --> 41:39.640]  nation so we can be stronger and more prosperous and more. Remember what
[41:39.640 --> 41:46.480]  Pelosi said? She said, I'll close with a quick story. George, that's enough. She
[41:46.480 --> 41:52.840]  said, remember two weeks ago, she said, oh, we're all one, one, one region. We're
[41:52.840 --> 41:59.160]  all one hemisphere. I mean, this is globalism. That's what Petraeus said over
[41:59.160 --> 42:01.920]  the weekend. He said, what comes after America? North America, but not like
[42:01.920 --> 42:06.640]  freedom in Canada or Mexico, total corporate tyranny where the elite live
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.000]  in these big armored compounds and areas. And we're all thrown in with all these
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.320]  poor desperate people to drive down the wages and implode the economy. And even
[42:16.320 --> 42:21.480]  unwashed masses overall would be good long term because I believe in humanity.
[42:21.480 --> 42:27.280]  If they weren't being given free welfare, again, that destroys people. Adversity
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.240]  makes men. The quote, Victor Hugo, prosperity makes monsters. We've seen
[42:32.240 --> 42:35.480]  what's happened. I have another clip of Obama coming up and I'm going to go
[42:35.480 --> 42:39.960]  through all this news of what's happening, but a failed, collapsed,
[42:39.960 --> 42:45.720]  narco terrorist kleptocracy called Mexico that feeds on its poor people and
[42:45.720 --> 42:51.280]  is just unrivaled in this hemisphere for total oppression is now being merged
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.840]  with our sickening evil corrupt political class with the Democratic
[42:55.840 --> 42:57.400]  Party riding at the head of it.

[44:58.640 --> 45:02.560]  life healthy. I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was
[45:02.560 --> 45:07.320]  helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know
[45:07.320 --> 45:12.680]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to
[45:12.680 --> 45:16.720]  so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a
[45:16.720 --> 45:21.440]  product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield true
[45:21.440 --> 45:25.840]  nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said
[45:25.840 --> 45:29.440]  listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.440]  deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had have been

[46:10.280 --> 46:16.760]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from seven to ten thousand feet below the

[47:00.400 --> 47:27.160]  Coast to coast. Direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network from the
[47:27.160 --> 47:35.800]  front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. Yeah that intro about from
[47:35.800 --> 47:40.680]  the front lines of the war. People like to laugh at that for about 15 years. How
[47:40.680 --> 47:46.560]  funny now is it? The whole world every nation state is being wrecked. Ukraine,
[47:46.560 --> 47:54.040]  Iraq, Syria, Libya, Pakistan. They're using Al Qaeda, Pentagon. It's in the
[47:54.040 --> 47:59.000]  London Guardian yesterday, Saturday, up on infowars.com. I've got it in the stack
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.080]  that British government was in secret program to train 100,000 rebels to fight
[48:05.080 --> 48:09.840]  Assad and they were Al Qaeda. Gave them stinger missiles. And then now oh we got
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.600]  to take your rights because of Al Qaeda. Oh we've got to have civil emergency in
[48:15.600 --> 48:19.920]  the Southwest with the federal government because Obama and the rest of
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.440]  them had award ceremonies for the quote dream act kids and advertise for him to
[48:24.440 --> 48:29.680]  come up here. And so now hundreds of thousands a month are slamming into the
[48:29.680 --> 48:33.840]  U.S. and being given free bus rides wherever they want being put on welfare
[48:33.840 --> 48:40.960]  and Obama says just legalize them all or he'll do it by executive order. That's
[48:40.960 --> 48:46.040]  called dictatorship. And I've been saying over and over again you notice he gets
[48:46.040 --> 48:49.080]  away with more and more. Even if he leaves office the precedent set for
[48:49.080 --> 48:54.720]  presidents and the bureaucracies to do whatever they want. But remember you
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.320]  don't get left alone. It's like selective anarchy. There's anarchy on the
[48:58.320 --> 49:02.360]  border. There's anarchy at the federal government. I saw mainstream news. What
[49:02.360 --> 49:10.720]  was it last week about at the FDA and the EPA. They they defecate and urinate in
[49:10.720 --> 49:14.360]  the halls. The toilets aren't broken. They just like to crap on the walls. I
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.520]  mean I you know I don't know. I mean it's just a government completely at the
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.480]  federal level out of control. And then now you've got border patrol getting
[49:24.480 --> 49:29.120]  shot and killed. You got state police in their gunboats that they deployed down
[49:29.120 --> 49:32.040]  there. I criticize them when they bought those. I guess they needed them. They
[49:32.040 --> 49:37.800]  knew something I didn't know. It's incredible. You know we had a state
[49:37.800 --> 49:40.440]  senator on a few years ago and then I talked to some folks at the Capitol
[49:40.440 --> 49:43.760]  privately last year and said this on air that they believe Mexico would fully
[49:43.760 --> 49:47.000]  collapse into the U.S. and that the federal government may allow that to
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.680]  bring in the North American Union. I had no confidence in the state of Texas to
[49:50.680 --> 49:55.480]  actually do anything. Now they're openly talking about this and deploying
[49:55.480 --> 50:01.320]  paramilitary Texas Rangers and state police and others. The local sheriff
[50:01.320 --> 50:04.800]  departments have done what they're supposed to created posses of auxiliary
[50:04.800 --> 50:08.960]  unpaid deputies just to stop the hardcore criminals that are down there. And
[50:08.960 --> 50:14.880]  it's already a war on the border ladies and gentlemen. A full-scale crazy town
[50:14.880 --> 50:20.680]  war. And again order out of chaos. The globalist want to then bring in more
[50:20.680 --> 50:25.200]  control and Obama's answer is legalize all the illegals. That'll make them all
[50:25.200 --> 50:30.480]  legal. Problem solved. If you can get here you're legal. Well yeah and it'll
[50:30.480 --> 50:35.480]  increase the amount of people coming here. We should be doing like Australia and
[50:35.480 --> 50:41.440]  Switzerland does only taking the best immigrants ladies and gentlemen. Instead
[50:41.440 --> 50:46.440]  we take the low on skilled and look at what we've turned into. Let's go to this
[50:46.440 --> 50:52.480]  club of Obama last Monday saying he would act alone outside of Congress. Again
[50:52.480 --> 50:56.880]  they have a name for it. Hitler was one of these people. Stalin was one of these
[50:56.880 --> 51:00.760]  people. Mao Zedong was one of these people. It's really happening here. By the
[51:00.760 --> 51:05.200]  way he's now saying he's going to sign executive orders to ban a lot of guns. And
[51:05.200 --> 51:08.720]  even the NRA's warning of that. Get ready folks. You're like well that'll never
[51:08.720 --> 51:14.380]  happen. There'll be a civil war. That's the plan Jack. And then they plan to
[51:14.380 --> 51:19.600]  implode Latin America into us and have that be basically the blue team against
[51:19.600 --> 51:23.200]  the red team. Anybody who isn't a communist. Anybody who thinks the state
[51:23.200 --> 51:26.400]  doesn't run their life. Anybody who thinks they built their business is going to
[51:26.400 --> 51:30.960]  be on the red team a racist demon. And that doesn't mean the Republicans are
[51:30.960 --> 51:37.320]  good. The globalists have just chosen that as a split. And that's the plan. And
[51:37.320 --> 51:41.560]  Obama's like the new Abraham Lincoln that will crush the evil rebellion. I mean
[51:41.560 --> 51:45.960]  this is all in the liberal publications. These people are not liberals. These
[51:45.960 --> 51:54.600]  are a bunch of lazy government payroll weirdos who actually think they're
[51:54.600 --> 51:59.960]  going to have some weird holy war on the American libertarian or conservative. You
[51:59.960 --> 52:04.280]  people are crazy. I mean once this thing starts you're going to get your clocks
[52:04.280 --> 52:09.080]  cleaned so bad you can't even imagine the time bomb you're sitting on morons. And
[52:09.080 --> 52:14.240]  your bosses are going to sit offshore in Luxembourg in London and in other
[52:14.240 --> 52:18.920]  rich areas while everything goes to hell in a handbasket. This is the
[52:18.920 --> 52:24.680]  takedown. Did you know from France to South Korea to China to Russia they all
[52:24.680 --> 52:28.280]  just left the dollar this week. That's why you notice prices are exploding
[52:28.280 --> 52:32.560]  everywhere. Do you people have any idea how we've been betrayed and thrown
[52:32.560 --> 52:37.160]  under the bus. We're going to be just like the poor Latin Americans with no
[52:37.160 --> 52:42.080]  future bankrupted and made poor on purpose for political control. Do you
[52:42.080 --> 52:47.960]  realize how rich resource wise and culturally Latin America is. But they
[52:47.960 --> 52:52.000]  never got out from under colonialism. And we never fully did either. But our
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  little experiment a little bit of freedom produced more wealth than any
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.640]  country ever has. And all that's going right down the crapper right now. We're
[53:01.640 --> 53:06.400]  losing everything because you American people white black Hispanic Asian I
[53:06.400 --> 53:11.240]  don't care wanted to watch the World Cup and the NFL and didn't give a you know
[53:11.240 --> 53:15.880]  what about the future. And so you were wide open with no political immune
[53:15.880 --> 53:21.440]  system and the wolves came in and now if you don't wake up right now the police
[53:21.440 --> 53:25.680]  the military the government all of you bureaucrats the average citizens and get
[53:25.680 --> 53:31.200]  up off your giant political weak butts you're going to get gang raped by
[53:31.200 --> 53:36.680]  hardcore global financial jackals that are taken down Spain Greece Iceland
[53:36.680 --> 53:42.560]  Ireland everything else they will watch this country burn dumbasses and I don't
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.480]  usually talk like this a lot but I'm talking to the people out there that
[53:46.480 --> 53:51.000]  have made jokes about this radio show for years. You're gonna see every bit of
[53:51.000 --> 53:57.400]  it unfold very soon. Hell Obama might even become a dictator. I'm talking to
[53:57.400 --> 54:00.240]  all of you that work at places like media matters for the White House and
[54:00.240 --> 54:04.080]  think you're all cute and funny lower in the drawbridge to bring down this
[54:04.080 --> 54:10.680]  nation. You're involved in treason. It ain't just a word. Let's go to the clip
[54:10.680 --> 54:14.360]  of the traitor. Let's go to the clip of the would-be dictator the titular head
[54:14.360 --> 54:19.920]  the figurehead the front man of the political correct militarized takedown
[54:19.920 --> 54:25.500]  of this country. We've seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the
[54:25.500 --> 54:30.720]  border brought here into other countries by smugglers and traffickers. I'm
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.520]  beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my
[54:35.520 --> 54:41.080]  own without Congress. As a first step I'm directing the Secretary of Homeland
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.480]  Security and the Attorney General to move available and appropriate resources
[54:45.480 --> 54:50.040]  from our interior to the border. Yeah that's to that's to bust the illegals
[54:50.040 --> 54:54.280]  and faster. Again imagine back in the middle of June we have video of the
[54:54.280 --> 54:57.520]  buses coming in and the border patrol giving them vouchers and loading them
[54:57.520 --> 55:00.600]  on buses to go wherever they want. We have the head of emergency management of
[55:00.600 --> 55:04.280]  McCallan admitted. We have it all admitted. We have ice whistleblowers. We
[55:04.280 --> 55:07.160]  have the head of the border patrol tells us coming on and the media wouldn't
[55:07.160 --> 55:13.280]  cover it until two days ago when the New York Times covered it and everyone went
[55:13.280 --> 55:20.280]  oh my gosh the New York Times admitted it. Oh my it must be true then. I mean
[55:20.280 --> 55:28.000]  pathetic. I said I'd settle down. I have been so angry. I have been so upset about
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.600]  this ladies and gentlemen and again we could take a few million more immigrants
[55:32.600 --> 55:37.280]  on top of the ones we got even if they went on welfare. The problem is they
[55:37.280 --> 55:40.920]  love the Democratic Party. They have no idea politically. They've come from
[55:40.920 --> 55:43.640]  governments where they're totally disarmed and there's guys in black uniforms
[55:43.640 --> 55:47.400]  with machine guns that rape their wives and daughters whenever they want. All
[55:47.400 --> 55:53.600]  they want is food for their kids. I don't blame them. But they're gonna vote to take
[55:53.600 --> 55:56.960]  the guns. They're gonna vote like MSNBC says that your kids don't belong to you.
[55:56.960 --> 56:01.640]  They're gonna bring in the control freak totalitarian system. Totalitarian means
[56:01.640 --> 56:07.640]  total control. But that's not even the issue. What is going on with the
[56:07.640 --> 56:11.280]  political elite that they would open the border up like this and do all this
[56:11.280 --> 56:15.720]  other lawless stuff and do whatever they want and have a sign on to a thousand
[56:15.720 --> 56:20.280]  five hundred trillion dollars of derivatives in 2008 by partisan. And
[56:20.280 --> 56:25.440]  where is the Republican leadership doing anything? They're doing nothing. They're
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.760]  acting like they don't know what Obama and the Democrats are doing. Gee there's
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.960]  a lot of kids coming in. Why aren't you doing anything about it? Doing anything.
[56:33.960 --> 56:38.800]  They load them on buses and take them wherever they want to go and put them on
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.680]  welfare. Man I'm sick of doing everybody's job around here. But the good
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.560]  news is we've been breaking most of this big news and we've been getting it
[56:48.560 --> 56:51.560]  covered and that's why we have this article that was up on drugs the last
[56:51.560 --> 56:56.880]  three days since last Friday. Feds threatened journalists with prison over
[56:56.880 --> 57:00.600]  a report on legal immigration. Then I have the other article right here where
[57:00.600 --> 57:06.800]  congressman from Oklahoma told by federal judge he's not allowed he's not
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.080]  allowed ladies and gentlemen to go and find out what's even on these bases.
[57:12.080 --> 57:16.440]  Congress can't see what's on the basis. Congress is co-equal to the stinking
[57:16.440 --> 57:21.680]  dictator. I mean America listen listen if you want to get robbed and politically
[57:21.680 --> 57:24.840]  have everything you got taken you ever wondered how America would get
[57:24.840 --> 57:30.000]  conquered? From within folks. We find the Cicero quote. I desperately need the
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  Cicero quote. I want to come back in the next hour with the Cicero quote. We
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.880]  found it. We're gonna we're gonna read this quote when we start the next hour
[57:37.880 --> 57:41.400]  and I'm gonna go try to settle down but you know what I don't need to settle
[57:41.400 --> 57:46.320]  down. We've gotten in this position because we've been in a coma. Awaken! Get out of
[57:46.320 --> 57:52.440]  your coma or be slaves! Shag an hour! From the water table to our soils to the
[57:52.440 --> 57:57.120]  atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[57:57.120 --> 58:01.000]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.160]  have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.680]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[58:08.680 --> 58:12.440]  chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the
[58:12.440 --> 58:16.280]  United States. Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to
[58:16.280 --> 58:19.960]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[58:19.960 --> 58:23.640]  with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics
[58:23.640 --> 58:28.280]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat
[58:28.280 --> 58:31.800]  the toxic environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back against.
[58:31.800 --> 58:36.560]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA. The
[58:36.560 --> 58:40.680]  new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be
[58:40.680 --> 58:44.040]  brought with you throughout any toxic environment. Now available exclusively
[58:44.040 --> 58:49.560]  at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[59:42.840 --> 59:47.640]  Molan Lombay. You can take my gun from my cold dead
[59:47.640 --> 59:56.520]  inch. Coast to coast direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[59:56.520 --> 59:59.560]  Broadcasting Network.
[1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:12.760]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:20.760]  You want answers? Well, so does- Turn me loose. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting
[1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:25.960]  worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:30.840]  You notice how much stuff's happening ever thought would happen. Obamacare. 21
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:35.240]  taxes. Seven out of a month people under the poverty line. Payroll taxes you
[1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:42.280]  name it. Medical device taxes on little kids prosthesis. Artificial legs, arms.
[1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:48.440]  You name it. And it starts stalling the economy since it went into partial
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:52.840]  implementation. That's planned. I mean look let me tell you something. If I wanted
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:57.160]  to shut a country down I'd shut down its power plants. I mean this is not rocket
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:00.600]  science ladies and gentlemen. If you study geopolitical systems in history
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:05.560]  and you look at what's going on it gives you the big chill. I thought I have a
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:09.320]  segment called the big chill because I keep saying I'm getting chills and I
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:12.920]  mean I'm getting chills all the time.
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:16.600]  And I grew up in Dallas and the few times I'd gotten mugged or whatever I'd get
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:20.600]  a chill right before it happened. And I don't need a six cents ladies and
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:23.960]  gentlemen to know we're in grave danger. I don't need Robbie the robot to say
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:27.880]  danger, danger, Will Robinson. Danger approaching from the south, the north,
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:35.640]  east, the west. You can see it. And I was just telling Nico and CJ out there
[1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:40.600]  during the break.
[1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:43.480]  The fact that they'd pass Obamacare, the fact that they would do this to power
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:46.360]  plants, the fact that they would put our military into NATO command and Congress
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:48.120]  would do nothing. The fact that they would spend tens of
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:52.280]  billions in fake energy companies and just give it to their friends. I mean
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:57.080]  there's never been corruption like this that I've seen.
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:01.720]  And basically I watched the looting of Mexico in the 80s
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:05.720]  with Salinas and others. And he was allowed to run to the U.S. with billions of
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:09.400]  stolen dollars after he devalued the Mexican peso.
[1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:13.320]  And I watched how he was run out of the United States
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:17.880]  you know up into the 90s. I watched it with several Mexican presidents.
[1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:22.120]  And then I studied the IMF World Bank, John Perkins, Economic Hitman, others.
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:26.440]  And the globalist said back in 2002 when Sticklets leaked that memo, I mean
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:29.960]  he claims he didn't when Sticklets quit as they had economists at the World Bank
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:34.520]  and the memos came out. And Greg Powell's released it here
[1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:40.920]  that Europe and the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia were next.
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:44.760]  And the Australians to their credit got pulled far down the rat hole by this.
[1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:48.920]  They're starting to claw back. So that gives us some hope. Will we claw back
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:52.040]  from it and start voting down carbon taxes? Start
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:57.080]  controlling our borders? Start repealing all the draconian
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:01.480]  anti-liberty laws? But I'm telling you the fact that the New World Order
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:05.800]  would open the border up and ship the illegals in and try to keep that
[1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:08.360]  secret. And then let me tell you it freaks me
[1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:11.720]  out even worse when guess who time after time
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:15.400]  continues to blow holes in their operation
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:19.480]  in FullWars.com. And believe me that's not fun
[1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:22.760]  because I know what it means to be sneaking around in smog's
[1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:27.480]  lair. And DrudgeReport.com continues to take our articles.
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:30.440]  It isn't about being popular, being well known at this point. It's about
[1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:36.120]  literally in an information war. And I know how serious and dangerous it is
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:40.360]  to have the White House run groups, MSNBC, Media Matters attacking me every
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:43.880]  week, every day in some cases. And Drudge knows that too folks.
[1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:46.920]  And I look at all the other mainline conservative talk shows.
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:51.400]  They're starting to go there but not not really because they're scared.
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:55.480]  They're scared. And we need more people, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:04:01.800]  to start telling the truth, to beat this but also so they don't come after me.
[1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:06.280]  And I'm ready for them to come after me. I'm not afraid of that. I'm afraid of
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:10.120]  failure. I'm afraid of letting evil continually
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:15.080]  win over and over and over again. I'ma tell you something else too.
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:18.840]  I'm the only person I know who's consistently
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:23.880]  cheered for the last few years. The false flag may be opening the border up
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:27.480]  because that was in Pentagon plans that were shot down by Reagan.
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:31.000]  But it was produced by his people wanting to bring in total control by
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.560]  partisan. Rex 84. Look it up. It's in the Miami
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:39.320]  Herald. I've got it in my films. Police state film.
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:43.080]  Police in 2000. And I'm the only one saying they would
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:46.440]  let Alcada come into attack a city and inform a new Alcada army in the Middle
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:49.000]  East. That's what ISIS now is. And then they're now saying that.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.120]  And I'm the only one that told you they would do an economic implosion to
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:56.840]  bring a Marshal on. And that they'd set off a nuke.
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:00.040]  Oh yeah, a nuke.
[1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:15.080]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:18.360]  nightly news. Info wars is the tip of the spear. Is this
[1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:21.320]  another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more
[1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:24.120]  homeland security while sticking the hands down on our pants on the streets?
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:28.040]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:31.160]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:36.120]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:39.400]  chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:42.920]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:46.920]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of
[1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:50.840]  prisonplanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11
[1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:54.520]  friends and family. Visit infowarsnews.com today.
[1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:58.600]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next
[1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:01.080]  level.
[1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:09.080]  So this is how America dies. Loveless treachery.
[1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:11.560]  Treason.
[1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:16.040]  And it's only the beginning if they get away with it.
[1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:19.880]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:22.760]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else
[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:27.160]  than anyone else.
[1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:30.760]  Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns.
[1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:35.640]  But El Castro took the guns. Do you though Chavez took the guns?
[1:06:35.640 --> 1:06:41.640]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:46.680]  The republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:49.800]  I am sworn upon the altar of God.
[1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:58.280]  Internal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of men.
[1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:05.160]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:10.920]  Alex Jones show.
[1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:15.000]  Give me some more. Give me some more.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:22.520]  Some more truth. Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:26.840]  It's not talk radio. It's survival. It's not talk radio. It's resistance.
[1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:29.800]  It's not talk radio. It's freedom. It's blood
[1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:36.440]  pumping. It's red, white and blue 1776 worldwide.
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:43.960]  And I am your host Alex Jones. We have Kit Daniels who is facing prison.
[1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:46.680]  Our reporter feds threatened journalists with prison
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:50.760]  of a report on illegal immigration in fauxwars.com. We have the official
[1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:53.960]  letter, the phone numbers. You'd think the horror media
[1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:57.560]  since Drudge picked this up last Friday would have
[1:07:57.560 --> 1:08:01.240]  picked this up but it took them three weeks to pick up that we broke that
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:05.400]  Obama has the board of patrol in black buses for DHS
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:08.840]  ship the illegals in. The protests in Texas and California you see
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:13.000]  of folks blocking the DHS buses. How do people know about that?
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.480]  In fauxwars.com, drudgerport.com. And I'm not tooting our horn.
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:22.520]  We're right up front on point in maximum overdrive going right into the front of
[1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:25.880]  this ladies and gentlemen. And I'm not going to get into the dirty
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:29.160]  tricks that go on. The stuff that gets pulled. I love it
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:31.720]  because I've told the story of my grandfather's. One of them was a fighter
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:36.040]  pilot in World War II. The other a B-17 pilot.
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:39.640]  And it was a famous World War II saying you fly into the flag to find the
[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:41.960]  target. Or if you're a fighter protecting
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:46.200]  bombers you fly into the flag to protect the bombers.
[1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:49.560]  And so I'm I'm steered into the flag. I expect the flag.
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:52.920]  Don't take don't take my victory away from me
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:57.800]  anyway we cut it. I'm not a coward. I know what I'm flying into.
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:01.400]  The point is do you out there know how serious things are?
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:06.360]  Do you out there realize how real this is? The federal government is no more.
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:10.200]  It is completely bankrupt and run by offshore criminal interests that want
[1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:14.520]  a giant poor North American union with all these poor desperate people from
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:16.520]  Latin America where the globalists have already
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:20.040]  imploded their countries and blamed it on the USA.
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:23.480]  So they hate the U.S. on average but love the Democrats.
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:27.320]  And we'll vote to take our guns almost to a man.
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:31.400]  This is the reality and again last week I had a top U.C.
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:34.120]  professor. He's all over national television. Daryl
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:40.040]  Hamamoto expert political scientist the head
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:44.520]  of Asian American Studies at the University of California
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:49.480]  at UC Davis saying this is a giant social engineering operation.
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:52.600]  And by the way he's got a Rockefeller Foundation
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:56.200]  accredited. That's where he was basically funded and trained for his PhDs and the
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:59.880]  rest of it just like Francis Boyle who was trained at the
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:05.560]  high level Harvard secret PhD. The same one Kissinger and Brzezinski were
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:08.040]  given. And he's coming out saying this is exactly
[1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:10.680]  what it is. I care about every man woman and
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:13.480]  child in this country. I don't care what color you are and where you are
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:16.120]  worldwide. I can't go to the third world and see
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:19.640]  poor destitute people in the homeless children. It's too painful.
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.720]  But merging with all of that will bring us down not bring us up
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:27.240]  and that's the globalist plan and that's why I'm firmly against it.
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:32.840]  We're about to go to Kit Daniels info wars.com reporter but first
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:36.360]  a quote by the statesman philosopher historian
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:44.680]  Marcus Cicero attributed to a speech in the Roman Senate on the floor
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:49.240]  that was then put out in public proclamations.
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:54.280]  A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious.
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:57.400]  When you study things that's so true. We can survive our fools
[1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:01.480]  and even aren't the ambitious because you can be taught by fools and by
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:08.280]  sages to quote Harris Smith. Back to Cicero. A nation can survive its
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:14.360]  fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within.
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:19.080]  An enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:22.360]  openly but the traitor moves amongst those within the
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:26.040]  gate freely. His sly whispers rustling through all
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:30.200]  the alleys heard in the very halls of government itself.
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:33.880]  For the traitor appears not a traitor. He speaks
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:38.280]  in accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face
[1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:41.720]  and their arguments. He appeals to the baseness
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:47.080]  that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of the nation.
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:52.120]  He works secretly and unknown the night to undermine the pillars of the city.
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:56.360]  He infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist.
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:01.880]  A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:05.800]  And ladies and gentlemen you ever wondered how America would fall?
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:10.280]  You'll never even know it falls as third world populations are all around you.
[1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:13.880]  I go down to the hiking bike trail all the time with my children
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:18.280]  and I go to an area that nobody said and I went down to it and it literally
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:22.440]  literally and I was I just I wanted I didn't even dislike them.
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:28.120]  I felt sad even surveilling them but all up and down it were Guatemalans
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:33.320]  fishing with strings they found and cans and they had backpacks
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:36.760]  and I did shoot some video but I just it's so painful with their little desperate
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:41.880]  children. I felt sorry for them. The globalists are manipulating my own humanity
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:44.680]  but I'm going to dispatch my reporters next week down there. There are groups of
[1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:48.200]  Guatemalans. I went and talked to them and I saw their Mayan
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:52.200]  backpacks and they didn't speak English but I said Guatemala and they said yes
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:54.680]  yes Guatemala. Folks we have a literal homeless
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:13:00.680]  Guatemala on the bike trail now. Down off of
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:05.160]  I just can't down off the hill life. I mean I mean folks this country is
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:08.360]  being imploded right now. That's all I can tell you. How long until we go to
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:10.680]  break here?
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:14.760]  We're going to hold kid into the next segment. Here's the headline. Feds
[1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:18.360]  threatened journalists with prison over report on illegal immigration.
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:21.800]  I'm following the amazing coverage at drudgerport.com
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:26.040]  of just the complete collapse of this country and then we have the full
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:29.960]  letter with the one star general that issued it
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:33.880]  saying that you will be
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:39.400]  if he ever enters any bases or the jurisdiction of the United States
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:43.240]  that he will face six months in jail and then it goes into the whole fine just
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:46.600]  to begin with. You shall be fined not more than
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:49.800]  5,000 or in prison not more than six months or both
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:58.120]  by 18 USC 3571B6 and this was sent to our unlisted address here
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:01.560]  and to our listed address and this is what he gets for
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:05.000]  going in saying I'm here as a reporter goes through the open base
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:10.520]  and then he shows the illegals en masse there. So Kit Daniels I know you're out
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:13.880]  in Lampasses near Fort Hood sending the tail into the
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:18.920]  Fourth of July weekend with your parents but in the land of the free home of
[1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:22.040]  the brave. I mean Obama has arrested tea partiers and
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:26.680]  journalists like no other president and audited and shut down pro-life groups
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:30.520]  and has an enemy's list that would make nicks and blush and they're now
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.840]  sending want to shut down internet freedom so I guess
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:35.640]  you ought to be proud of this letter I know Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs who went
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:39.720]  with you he's very upset combat vet hero in his own right
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:44.840]  he's very upset over the fact that he wasn't sent a letter as well this is a
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:48.520]  badge of honor. Yeah absolutely this is this letter
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:51.880]  shows you that you are you're definitely in the flat cloud
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:55.000]  you know you're definitely on target and I was thinking about this when I was
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.200]  driving up here to Lampasses that the Obama administration is
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:02.360]  intentionally using military bases to have the legals if they have an easier
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:05.400]  time to block access to the press and to the public
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:09.240]  you know back before 9-11 I used to go on Fort Hood which is about 30 miles from
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:13.240]  here for martial arts class and I could just drive on base no problem
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:17.000]  but after 9-11 I was had to go through a checkpoint and had to
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:20.520]  had to go through a vehicle search so a lot of this
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:24.760]  is all due to the police state that's been implemented
[1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:29.720]  for 9-11 it's being used on us though I mean have you noticed Pelosi and Obama
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:34.120]  keeps speaking at bases but on domestic issues they do it to control everything
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:37.640]  there's no press there they call it a press conference no one's there
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:41.480]  in fact you guys went down twice and they they detained you guys once in
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:44.280]  Biggs and said you can't be here Homeland Security to have the secret
[1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:47.720]  service for Pelosi and you guys had the press release
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:51.320]  that they were having a press conference I mean I send I got former

[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:11.640]  that i said criminal elements in government and corporations are
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:14.680]  funding these groups to destabilize the world
[1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:18.440]  so they can radically transform our country into a police state
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:22.040]  and now you hear the police state isn't for al-qaeda it's not for the open
[1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:24.840]  borders it's not for the illegals it's for the
[1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:29.400]  american people and the tea party and gun owners and returning veterans
[1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:34.200]  i mean this is dangerous they train the military to fight who they think the
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:37.720]  next enemy is going to be and now in hundreds of mainstream
[1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:42.120]  publications not just info wars dot com breaking at six years ago
[1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:45.720]  but in hundreds of mainstream publications all you know this it's all
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:49.160]  over the news they say gun owners and veterans are terrorists
[1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:51.240]  and are going to blow up federal buildings and we've all got to be
[1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:55.720]  arrested now you know that's a bunch of bull
[1:21:55.720 --> 1:22:00.280]  you know clinton had his hands all over oklahoma city
[1:22:00.280 --> 1:22:04.120]  so much proof i could spend 10 hours on it i could convict all of them
[1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:09.560]  in front of a jury in just a few hours i have the eyewitnesses the names where
[1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:13.240]  the bombs were at and video of it
[1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:19.960]  so listen they're doing all this because they think they can win
[1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:24.360]  and i'm not trying to scare you telling you all this
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:27.640]  i'm trying to get you to realize that your only hope is to speak out against
[1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:31.800]  it and say no to it and to stand behind those that tell the truth
[1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:35.080]  there's all these talk show hosts locally and nationally that make fun of me all
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:39.160]  day long and i don't even need you to apologize to me
[1:22:39.160 --> 1:22:42.280]  i need you to apologize to your own family and yourself and start telling the
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:46.040]  truth and to admit that info wars knows what it's
[1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:50.360]  talking about that i know what i'm talking about
[1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:55.080]  and you better get on the ball right now
[1:22:55.960 --> 1:23:00.520]  or quite frankly i've sworn to stay here till it all collapses i don't know
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:03.480]  what i'm doing with my family but
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:08.680]  i could broadcast from another country i'll tell you right now
[1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:12.360]  again a lot of people have said you should have an exit plan and i agree with
[1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:16.040]  this isn't a game people i mean this is not a game
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.440]  the level of crime being committed by the federal government
[1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:24.840]  is i've never i've let's just go back to kid Daniels kid i you got cut off by
[1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:28.040]  that last break uh again the white house uh is
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:32.680]  want you arrested for saying hi i'm here to report i'm here to go on
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:36.120]  and because their own gate person still thought it was a free country on an open
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:39.000]  base they let you in with our reporters
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.880]  i guess it was it was it you've been down there a bunch was it you and jacari
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:45.080]  was it you and bigs which trip is this letter covering
[1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:49.560]  it was uh the trip of me and bigs it was about i think it's about the middle of
[1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:53.080]  cune yeah and this letter was signed the 28th we
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:57.320]  didn't get it till uh thursday yeah so it took them a good two three weeks to
[1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:00.120]  send me this letter saying we're gonna put you in
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:04.520]  prison if you ever come on the base again yeah and i want to point out that
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:07.480]  when the founding fathers talked about freedom of the press they were not
[1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:10.440]  talking about corporate media what they were talking about was independent
[1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:14.040]  publishers like at the time was you think about like the uh
[1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:17.640]  poor rich development act and so on so forth which for those that don't know
[1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:21.000]  it was total underground hidden little presses
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.840]  printing off 20 little you know proto photocopies
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:27.960]  two-sided bills about what what the redcoats did
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:32.120]  that's why all of you aren't just as important as the new york times
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:37.240]  it's compromise and globalists run you are all we've got
[1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:40.520]  listeners get out there go ahead kid i'm sorry
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:44.600]  yeah absolutely because the uh the little underground publishers back then
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:48.680]  they are the bloggers of today they are the citizen journalists of today
[1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:53.720]  and that's why it's critical to support the alternative media because what
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:57.000]  we're seeing right now is a result or a result of the press
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:00.520]  we uh to give a journalism is almost dead
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:05.240]  and mainstream media but all the former investigative journalists and
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  are now coming to alternative media so within the next five ten years there's
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:12.760]  going to be explosion of alternative media
[1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:16.840]  and again we're not even alternative i use that word too we're the real media
[1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:21.240]  versus the state run media three weeks ago kit we broke
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:25.320]  this is so bombshell not that we broke it but that it's it they could cover it
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.800]  up three weeks that they're shipping the
[1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:30.680]  illegals in and giving them vouchers on government
[1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:35.080]  funded buses grayhound and we have video of it and all being admitted
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:39.000]  it's now in the new york times but they hit it
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.880]  like flatulence in church in the back of an article
[1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:48.280]  that oh yeah the spokesman said they're shipping them into the country
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:51.960]  yeah it's it's pretty common that the the real news
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:56.040]  in articles is usually in the eighth or ninth paragraph and again they do that
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:59.400]  just to cover their butts and uh they get fired if they don't
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:06.360]  i mean i know a lot of big folks i've had abc nightly news host
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:09.480]  had dinner with him he didn't say it was off record and i was on nightline he
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:12.680]  also hosted that and they basically just admitted you know
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:18.120]  their mercenaries i've i've i mean i've had dinner i'm not bragging
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:22.360]  it's just i've seen stuff people haven't seen and most people that even work for
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:25.240]  the system were scared and they got bills to pay and have had
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:28.280]  divorces and you know got alimony to pay and they
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:31.880]  are literally mercenaries and they go home and get drunk at night because
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:35.880]  they're so depressed about it and and now they're losing their jobs
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:40.520]  the globalists don't even need them anymore they rode the mainstream media
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:43.080]  like a horse until it had a heart attack and died
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:47.000]  they rode it to death until it was fully discredited and now they announce
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:51.320]  oh we have robots to write the articles now
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:54.760]  i mean what type of system is this a bunch of traders
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:59.800]  there's no honor among thieves people none of your pensons are safe
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:03.240]  nothing safe under a system like this this is pure
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:07.800]  evil coming in can't other points well if you want to
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:10.840]  protect yourself as a journalist you got to be an individual you cannot
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:14.200]  you cannot be a part of the collective because the collective doesn't care about
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:16.440]  you as an individual they're not going to care about you as a journalist they're
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:21.480]  just going to use you until they can bring in the robot journalist
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:26.680]  so it's just a it's you notice you notice on the cable news now that
[1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:30.280]  most of the so-called news shows are political commentary
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:33.720]  like alex wagner and msnbc so on so forth they're not really
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.560]  reporting on anything they're just badmouthing other media heads
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:40.520]  or people they disagree with and that is how
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:44.760]  mark that's how far the mainstream media has fallen
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:48.920]  because you no longer not only has investigative journalists disappeared
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:52.440]  but now news reporting in essence has also disappeared
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:57.400]  and now it's just political commentary that supports the establishment viewpoint
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:01.400]  well well said kit we're going to have more with you coming up i really
[1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:05.080]  appreciate your courage because as george arwell
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:10.360]  said in a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act

[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:33.720]  counterfeit debt in 2008
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:36.680]  there's political elites getting caught doing you name it secret
[1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:41.080]  experimentation forced abortions nobody gets in trouble in this country
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:46.440]  the political class is in a crazy revolution against normalcy and decency
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:50.760]  and against any restraint on them satanism is the only description of it
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:54.680]  these people are out of control we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen i'm

[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:02.600]  i'd be called a liberal i'd be hailed as a trendy
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:05.560]  but i'm against killing the mexicans i'm a racist
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:08.760]  i'm against killing the blacks 52 percent are aborted
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:13.160]  i'm a racist i'm for human liberty and dignity worldwide
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:18.680]  so i'm evil and i guess that's just the way it is ladies and gentlemen
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:22.360]  but there's a wind on down the road
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:26.280]  ha your shadow's taller than your soul

[1:34:31.720 --> 1:34:36.280]  gone along with this and now you will face judgment
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:40.600]  still time to repent politically but for those of you that have consciously
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:46.440]  been part of this judgment always comes and it
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:50.840]  comes twice judgment has always served up
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:55.880]  while you're still alive and then again and not because it's even
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:01.320]  judgment it's the path that you've chosen
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:05.880]  it's the way that your soul turned
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:09.480]  all right ladies and gentlemen let's now leave this
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:13.720]  live rendition of the stairway to heaven stairway to new world order l
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:17.320]  and let's go back to kit daniel's kit you got the floor great reporter
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:21.080]  making national headlines every few weeks just going out reporting reality
[1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:24.840]  just going to the border watching uh with uh the rest of the great crew
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:29.880]  jacari jackson and others adan salazar breaking that big story
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:32.600]  the buses come across they let on land security buses
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:36.280]  they're taken to greyhound buses they're given vouchers you interview them they
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:40.120]  admit it and now they've been forced to report on that
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:44.440]  even though we're watching the republic burn it's satisfying
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:48.600]  that we did our job and i've been very critical the texas state police
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:51.160]  since they got rid of the last director and went along a lot of federal
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:53.960]  initiatives that they have put gunboats down on the
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:56.520]  border they are getting shot at they are still arresting
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:01.640]  violent felons and and up to eight times like our pio said in maricopa county
[1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:06.440]  um arizona they just give them the ice and ice releases them over and over
[1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:11.960]  again and the police are are working overtime for free all over the country
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:15.720]  because i guess they really have an instinct to try to secure the borders
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:20.200]  uh and the sheriffs are being attacked in travis county everywhere else
[1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:24.200]  for for just deporting violent felons i mean that's
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:27.960]  that's evil according to the chronicle i tell you the chronicle might as well
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:30.760]  just feel like a soviet rag or something here in austin i mean i can't
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:35.160]  believe how evil it is with this latest article i mean this is twilight zone
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:40.200]  level that that the states um are actually trying to do
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:44.600]  something other than california and are being criticized for trying to deport
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:50.760]  aggravated felons arsonist armed robbers rapist child rapist i mean i read
[1:36:50.760 --> 1:36:54.840]  36 000 released by obama in the last month aggravated felons
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:59.560]  and it's in mainstream news and they say release felons are your racist
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:03.880]  i mean kit it's like i've entered the twilight zone what's happening
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:07.320]  absolutely it's like uh outside the alternative media
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:11.720]  they're probably being impressed about it but that's how even more bizarre it is
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:14.760]  all right now listen let's get into this letter that's up on info wars dot
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:18.360]  com and been on drugs since friday i haven't checked if it's still up there
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:21.240]  today but uh there's so many great headlines uh
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:26.120]  so many important headlines up there but i mean tell folks what happened they
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:28.920]  let you on the base because there's video of this you guys
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:32.680]  always are up front we don't lie that's our policy
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:38.360]  you you told them you were coming you went on yeah we just drove we drove up
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:42.760]  we showed our id to the guard at the uh entrance he gave us directions and we
[1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:46.680]  drove on in so whether it wasn't anything like we were uh
[1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:50.440]  we jumped the fence to go over across to the
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:53.160]  base just like how the illegals are getting through america well if you were
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:57.960]  like the you know the the uh railway killer who killed dozens of people and
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:00.680]  wasn't illegal they would just release you if you were a child rapist
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:03.720]  kid your problem is is you're not a child rapist
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:09.000]  yeah i'm just a proud american so continue to tell folks what you saw
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.760]  uh and of course we have video reports again that got picked up big time
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:19.160]  uh that made them angry well at least uh went to the immigration shelter we saw
[1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:24.280]  hundreds thousands of the legal children you know playing games playing basketball
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:27.080]  i saw probably the biggest trash bags ever seen in my life
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:31.560]  in my life people uh the uh subcontractor for homeland security had taken
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:35.400]  them out to the dumpster there was three full-size 18 wheeler pool
[1:38:35.400 --> 1:38:40.760]  trailer trailers out in the back uh there was a mobile uh a huge rv mobile
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:44.360]  health unit for uh emergencies for health care
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:48.760]  which is something actually something that b8 doesn't do that veterans
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:52.520]  and what really bothered me the most was the fact that all these children are so
[1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:56.600]  close together that it wasn't a very sanitary operation
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:03.000]  and it really brings fear that theoretically a incurable
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.240]  or a un a disease unknown to science could easily cross the southern border
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:10.120]  and affect millions of people but let's expand on that that's already
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:13.160]  happened diseases communicative diseases are off the
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:16.840]  chart now because that's on record it's on record also as
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:20.440]  senator ted cruz has said that that they use teenagers as mules
[1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:24.120]  this is a giant drug running operation and the texas state police have said
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:28.680]  that and the border patrol to info wars dot com in video interviews
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:34.920]  we have yeah and you know i have to emphasize the fact that this
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:38.280]  this kind of epidemic as far as diseases already happened in america
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.640]  this is what how 80 percent of native american populations die between the
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:46.840]  16th and the 19th century they had no immunity to diseases from europe
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:51.000]  just like how we don't have any immunity for diseases from latin america
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:54.280]  because they're rare here in north america not only rare but
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:57.880]  the doctors here don't even know how to check for them and by the way the
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:01.400]  control press says oh that's racist or whatever and sure there's racist
[1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:04.440]  there's racist hispanics has racist whites sure there's a bunch of white
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:08.280]  races that are upset about all this the point is that doesn't matter
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:11.160]  everybody knows you go to central or south america you gotta take like 10
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:14.280]  shots and all these pills and you still get sick
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:18.440]  i mean this is a real issue folks
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:22.600]  yeah and the uh the mama obama administration to talk it all off is
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:26.280]  setting the president for media blackout you know for example uh when
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:30.760]  jacardi and i went to uh on ut austin and back in april when obama came in
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.560]  town a talk of her older journalists for several
[1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:37.640]  years and he told me that the press access was the worst he's ever seen it
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:41.480]  and also the white house press association said the exact same thing
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:44.360]  oh it's on record they have university studies that show
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:48.680]  obama's not the worst he's double the worst so the worst it ever was it's
[1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:51.880]  double that if yeah if you can control the press
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:55.720]  you can control the narrative well look look look look that's a great point
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:59.720]  i'm glad you raised that only drudge report dot com i hate to keep
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.400]  just constantly thanking drudge it's almost obnoxious but only drudge thought
[1:41:03.400 --> 1:41:06.440]  that was important that they're threatening to arrest you for
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:09.080]  reporting on the illegals not the other libertarian or
[1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:12.360]  conservative media not the liberal media no one
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:15.880]  does anyone care if they're persecuting the press
[1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:20.520]  i mean as a culture as a guild as a society
[1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:24.200]  doesn't the press stick together i mean when they arrested anesh the susan
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:27.720]  i got upset about it if they arrested michael more for a film
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:31.720]  i would get upset about it where is the basic stick together instinct
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:36.760]  kit daniels it's disappearing i mean even the associated press is moving
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:40.600]  toward using a robot reporter so to speak hiring a
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:44.600]  a software program that can write news reports the cia developed that 10 years
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:48.040]  ago we told folks last year in an info war story it was coming
[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:50.760]  last week they reported ap's get rid of the reporters
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:53.640]  they'll just put the press release of the white house in
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:57.880]  and a robot will make it look like a human wrote it talk about control
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:42:01.560]  see how you whore media people you press the two mainstream media
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.480]  sold out you sold out your own profession dummies
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:09.480]  and now the new normal is going to be a media blackout on the same levels of
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:13.240]  invasion granada back in 1983 when the press could even get on the island for
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:18.040]  three weeks after the invasion began all they could once they got on
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:21.320]  island all they could do was report on secondhand sources
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:25.160]  on the invasion well the people perish for lack of knowledge and
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:28.600]  every listener out there you're a journalist you better get a video camera
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:31.880]  or recorder go to city council ask questions start a blog
[1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:35.960]  a facebook whatever start reporting and we'll beat them they can't shut us all
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:38.760]  down and the good news is police military
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:41.720]  media people government folks are more upset than ever
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:44.760]  i went through us customs last week coming back to the us
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:48.760]  most of them were listeners it blew me away and we're totally freaked out
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:51.800]  so the good news is the average person in government
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:55.160]  is more awake than the general public because they understand how serious this
[1:42:55.160 --> 1:43:00.600]  is

[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:45.560]  how corrupt the political and corporate system is
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:49.560]  it's epic how asleep the general population has been
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:52.680]  there's a big awakening happening but people are either awakening
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:55.960]  or they're getting even more lethargic and dumbed out
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:48:01.480]  and as this hyperinflation kicks in with the basic commodities as we're seeing
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:05.960]  but as a depression happens in the real economy we're going to see stag inflation
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:11.000]  the yuppies are going to double down on the system and do whatever it says
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:15.400]  whatever it says if it says open to the border so a hundred million people
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:19.880]  they'll do it they believe in the system
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:24.280]  like somebody walking into a nazi death camp always watch those horrible film
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:27.480]  footage of the women going out on the pits with little kids and being shot
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:30.920]  and the men with hat in hand you know stripping down naked
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:34.360]  you watch the raw newsreels that have been released you know bowing and being
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:39.000]  polite and lining their kids up to be shot not me you can go to hell
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.520]  it's just it's not going to happen okay and i've tried to fix this peacefully
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:49.320]  but they're on record building fema camps i had this
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:55.000]  uc top professor head of asian american studies on
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:59.800]  darrell yamamoto darrell hamamoto i keep seeing hamamoto
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:04.200]  and i had him on the show and you know he's one of the top researchers
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:08.040]  on the whole situation with japanese americans being put in the impairment
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:11.640]  camps and he said no i've researched the fema
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:13.880]  camps are real yeah they're all right there they're public they're not called
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:17.800]  fema camps are called emergency centers establishment act
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:23.720]  the civilian inmate labor camp programs civil emergency centers
[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:31.240]  that's darrell hamamoto saying that i mean the system is geared up for war
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:35.160]  with the american people and denial has gotten us
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:41.000]  to the point we're at right now denial has brought us the point we're in
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.320]  and the establishment wants us poor in destitute
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:49.800]  battling with a bunch of third world labor swamping the country
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:53.480]  so that we're too busy fighting with each other over crumbs to deal with them
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:56.520]  who are destroying the wealth and the prosperity on purpose
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:01.160]  to make us politically manageable that's what it comes down to
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:06.280]  and we've been trusting so long that i saw a study last year that 76 percent of
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:09.000]  seafood isn't even seafood and it's fake
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.760]  there was a new study out last week 59 of tuna sold in the u.s isn't even tuna
[1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:19.240]  94 of tuna and more than three quarters of sushi samples in new york city
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:25.560]  mislabeled and that's a new report out of the new york newspapers liberty
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:31.560]  blitzkrieg did a boil down of it but that just shows
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:36.440]  how fake it all is and if you question fraud they call it a conspiracy theory
[1:50:36.440 --> 1:50:39.880]  if you question a bill you're a conspiracy theorist if you question
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:43.240]  why you're being abused you're a conspiracy theorist it's just a way to
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:46.760]  say sit down shut up let me abuse you don't be a critical
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:50.760]  thinker let me tell you what to think let me tell you what to do
[1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:54.840]  and so we now stand here at the crossroads
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:59.960]  as we get deeper into mordor what are you going to do about what's happening
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:04.200]  i mean think how crazy the political classes now that they would publicly
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:09.400]  fund al-qaeda change its name to isis let al-qaeda kill 300 000 people in syria
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:12.760]  most of them christians and call them freedom fighters and nobody gets in
[1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:16.280]  trouble they got away with lying about so many
[1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:22.040]  things the iraq war the afghan war all these other wars
[1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:25.160]  all these other police actions i mean look at this headline exclusive
[1:51:25.160 --> 1:51:28.440]  roiders u.s discloses secret somalia military
[1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:33.720]  presence that's never ended it's not to fight radical
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:37.640]  muslims it's to go after any stabilizing force and our military men
[1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:40.840]  don't know that they're compartmentalized well guess what
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:44.840]  the compartmentalization ends now that's what i'm here to do
[1:51:44.840 --> 1:51:48.680]  doesn't mean i have all the answers but i've got more than most
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:52.360]  and i'm willing to tell you and i've decompartmentalized
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:55.720]  and once you learn how to decompartmentalize you'll do it for your own self
[1:51:55.720 --> 1:51:59.400]  and you'll give us the humet the human intelligence we need
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:04.600]  and the organic human survival system to defeat this new world order
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:08.280]  all we got to do is point out the shadow system the shadow global
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:11.320]  corporate crime syndicate destroying national sovereignty
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:14.680]  destroying due process destroying freedom destroying jobs
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:18.840]  it's game over for the new world order all we got to do is send our reporters
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:22.280]  down to the border to show that obama's shipping them in not just letting them
[1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:24.680]  in and it's game over all you got to do is make
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:28.280]  sure those stories go viral and it's over
[1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:32.680]  and all you got to do if they shut me up is step up into my place and don't
[1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:36.680]  wait for me to get taken out or set up for that to happen
[1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:41.080]  get in the battle now history is happening now you are the resistance
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:45.160]  you are the paul revere people call me up saying oh you're paul revere it makes
[1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:48.760]  you want to throw up we're all paul revere don't thank
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:51.800]  me i'm trying to survive i've got my head screwed on
[1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:55.400]  straight enough to know how things work and i want to live i want to be free
[1:52:55.400 --> 1:52:59.000]  i don't want to be a slave or a peon that's what it comes down to
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:02.840]  so if you want to be free you better fight for it now politically
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:06.360]  in the info war before they blow up a bunch of stuff and blame on the liberty
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:10.120]  movement and start a civil war trying to purge us
[1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:13.720]  which will absolutely wipe out the police and military which is planned
[1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:15.960]  they want to kill the liberty movement and the veterans
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:19.960]  while the police and military get wiped out to then bring in the un forces
[1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:23.400]  when the whole southwest goes up in flames with 20 million legals pouring
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:26.440]  across the border with orders from the democratic party to set
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:29.880]  everything on fire now i've seen their plan it's clear
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:33.080]  you've been given their plan
[1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:36.600]  and that's what it comes down to and i'm here ladies and gentlemen
[1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:39.800]  i'm basically a copy everybody that came before me and so are you
