[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:44.080]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.600]  we are live thank you so much for joining us today almost didn't make it into the
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.160]  studio here for this segment because I was so busy going over news and big
[00:54.160 --> 00:59.520]  developments that are unfolding we're gonna be here obviously for the next
[00:59.520 --> 01:05.480]  three hours today and we have several big guests joining us Lou Rockwell the
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.640]  former chief of staff of Ron Paul will be joining us to talk about the ongoing
[01:09.640 --> 01:18.160]  firestorm of Iran Paul endorsing Mitt Romney happily in his words and the
[01:18.160 --> 01:25.080]  the the response by some of the Ron Paul establishment politicos Tom Woods who
[01:25.080 --> 01:30.360]  is good friends with Ron Paul speaks at many of his rallies put a video out
[01:30.360 --> 01:34.760]  yesterday saying I need to be a top-down analysis of campaign for liberty and
[01:34.760 --> 01:39.120]  pointed out the head of campaign for liberty I don't even know this I went
[01:39.120 --> 01:42.720]  looked it up it was true actually doesn't think we should be involved in
[01:42.720 --> 01:47.480]  foreign policy constitutionalist and we should just get Ron Paul and all of it
[01:47.480 --> 01:52.120]  out of the business of criticizing these wars and he said there should be a top
[01:52.120 --> 01:58.960]  downer to play that video here in a moment a top-down look at it and that the
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.400]  head of it should be removed now we called him up this morning and he said
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.600]  look I think I've said enough I'm gonna just wait and see I trust Ron Paul is
[02:08.600 --> 02:12.400]  not gonna endorse Mitt Romney if he does it's gonna pretty much destroy him
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.040]  folks and everybody is sitting here in horror because there are some rumors
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.040]  fluttering around at high levels that it's being considered and as Ron Paul
[02:23.040 --> 02:28.120]  supporters as admirers and supporters it's all right it's Tom Woods right to
[02:28.120 --> 02:32.360]  come out and say hey we're concerned and people are going yeah I keep getting
[02:32.360 --> 02:39.280]  weird neocon mail from campaign for liberty and from Rand Paul and Ron
[02:39.280 --> 02:44.880]  Paul's groups promoting people and you go look them up and their council on
[02:44.880 --> 02:51.320]  foreign relations their pro war that's why the damn broke look look ran doing
[02:51.320 --> 02:56.720]  that really just made a bunch of concerns break now we've got other huge
[02:56.720 --> 03:04.200]  world news going on and I'm gonna cover that first here today because in the
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.040]  second and third hour we've got Governor Gary Johnson coming on that'll be
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.040]  open phones Lou Rockwell's coming on specifically calls for him so open the
[03:12.040 --> 03:16.040]  phones up with Lou Rockwell and Governor Gary Johnson specifically for
[03:16.040 --> 03:19.040]  questions for both those men we're not just gonna be talking about Ron Paul
[03:19.040 --> 03:23.600]  all day and Rand Paul but this is a big deal because the Liberty Movement is
[03:23.600 --> 03:27.480]  beginning to win getting 70 plus percent of the of the military's
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.320]  donations and that shows that the idea of fighting the globalist restoring the
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.720]  Republic cutting taxes defending the family second amendment states rights
[03:36.720 --> 03:41.200]  nullification getting us out of the UN auditing and abolishing the Federal
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.760]  Reserve we understand Ron Paul's in a dangerous position pushing all that so
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.240]  he went from let's get rid of the Fed to well let's audit it and then maybe get
[03:50.240 --> 03:54.800]  rid of it I understand all that and I understand Ron Paul not coming out and
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.640]  saying 9-11's an inside job even though he talks about false flags states
[03:58.640 --> 04:02.920]  chair and says he questions the official story goes government always lies he
[04:02.920 --> 04:05.560]  also goes along with the you know narrative and says okay if we're not
[04:05.560 --> 04:11.000]  attacking them they wouldn't attack us so I compromise a little bit over the
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.280]  years knowing that Ron Paul couldn't be Alex Jones even though you read his
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.400]  writings from the 80s and early 90s he was I mean this you know this guy is
[04:20.400 --> 04:25.160]  iconic in his understanding of the new world order he's the proto Alex Jones
[04:25.160 --> 04:31.320]  he's the proto info warrior but if he's trying to submit some dynasty with all
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.640]  the power we brought to the table as patriots it's not gonna happen I had
[04:35.640 --> 04:39.120]  Chuck Baldwin on last night the nightly news who Ron Paul endorsed when he
[04:39.120 --> 04:43.960]  couldn't win in the 08 election instead of McCain and he was saying this is
[04:43.960 --> 04:47.800]  devastating what's happened and he believes Ron Paul will not endorsement
[04:47.800 --> 04:51.600]  Romney but basically said it will be like a nuclear bomb going off and then in
[04:51.600 --> 04:54.960]  the Liberty Movement if he does Tom Woods has said the same thing tons of
[04:54.960 --> 04:58.080]  news coming up stay with us

[08:12.160 --> 08:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[08:19.680 --> 08:23.320]  alex jones
[08:24.320 --> 08:29.840]  I was thinking last night and this morning just how crazy it is that
[08:29.840 --> 08:34.720]  everything that we've talked about year after year that was coming under this
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.960]  global corporate fascist world government is now beginning to actually
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.480]  unfold I mean we have been so dead on so accurate because the globalists think
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.280]  the public isn't paying attention and most the population of the planet isn't
[08:48.280 --> 08:52.040]  but we're reading their CFR the trilateral Commission the Bilderberg
[08:52.040 --> 08:56.880]  leaks their public statements where they openly talk about how they're
[08:56.880 --> 09:01.160]  sterilizing us through the food and water how they're establishing world
[09:01.160 --> 09:05.360]  government how they're going to get rid of the family how they're going to put
[09:05.360 --> 09:10.840]  nanotech into us that basically rewires our brains viruses that they call new
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.760]  vaccines coming out that make you not be angry again and to want to submit to
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.680]  them that sounds like Martians from space and some fifties movie that come
[09:19.680 --> 09:25.520]  and spray stuff on the town and make everybody subservient zombies it's all
[09:25.520 --> 09:35.720]  being looked at it's all being done yesterday we saw KXAN TV report on a
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.560]  Army Department of Defense UT test outside Austin out in the Hill Country
[09:40.560 --> 09:48.400]  that blew up a laboratory and fired railgun shrapnel high-speed projectile
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.320]  into someone's car basically blowing the car up and injuring them and I sent
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.920]  reporters out yesterday to look into it I'm just gonna leave it at that we've
[09:56.920 --> 09:59.440]  got to put the report together but this is the kind of thing I'm worried about
[09:59.440 --> 10:03.160]  SWAT teams busting in here any minute and by the way the FBI has been here
[10:03.160 --> 10:08.520]  repeatedly the Secret Service I mean they've tried to shut us down before my
[10:08.520 --> 10:11.520]  wife said the phones have got to be tapped they were flipping on and off this
[10:11.520 --> 10:16.200]  morning and clicking and you pick the phone up somebody be talking so they
[10:16.200 --> 10:19.400]  are and I've gotten calls before and they've said we're listening to you you
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.880]  know you just said this my wife she has gotten calls repeatedly where they tell
[10:22.880 --> 10:26.080]  her what she was just talking about with her parents or with me on the phone to
[10:26.080 --> 10:34.680]  freak her out but the phones were clicking and going wild I'll just go
[10:34.680 --> 10:38.840]  ahead and tell you this okay they were out till 10 o'clock at night working on
[10:38.840 --> 10:44.560]  this this led to a chain reaction of the discovery of a nuclear waste dump off
[10:44.560 --> 10:53.400]  Redbud Trail in the middle of Austin they've still got the shut down old
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.200]  reactor under the lbj library we tried to go look at that and got threatened
[10:58.200 --> 11:03.040]  with arrest and all of this ties in they've got a bio weapons farm out by
[11:03.040 --> 11:06.080]  Bastrop with a bunch of monkeys and apes in it testing stuff that'll
[11:06.080 --> 11:11.960]  literally wipe off 90% of the world population or 6 billion people plus in a
[11:11.960 --> 11:17.800]  matter of months if it was released I've got sources on that just where I live
[11:17.800 --> 11:23.320]  is like a fantasy land of super science weapons from a science fiction movie I
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.120]  mean I'm wondering where Thundar the barbarian is gonna come running by any
[11:27.120 --> 11:31.600]  minute and then I'm about to get in for the most the show about Ron Paul and
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.480]  Rand Paul who are great guys people been hurt by watching the direction of Rand
[11:36.480 --> 11:42.000]  Paul and campaign for Liberty change Ron Paul is involved in this but at the
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  end of the day it doesn't even matter I mean we'll be lucky if the globalists
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.800]  don't release some super weapon in the next five years and kill almost all of
[11:48.800 --> 11:52.200]  us as they've talked about doing and they discuss how they're gonna set up a
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.160]  world government get a control grid in release giant bio weapon plagues to
[11:56.160 --> 12:00.600]  reduce our numbers and we've got the quotes in films like in game what is
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.200]  the end game calm as the online bibliography I read you constant you
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.920]  know government documents and reports here on air I mean it's just we're
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.080]  living in a science fiction land and the general public is just totally obsessed
[12:13.080 --> 12:19.360]  with lotteries and sports and fashion and I'm not knocking anybody that's into
[12:19.360 --> 12:22.720]  that kind of stuff it's all interesting sports is interesting fashions
[12:22.720 --> 12:29.440]  interesting guns are interesting you know women are very interesting I mean I
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.480]  get it I understand saying all the world crazy I'm just gonna enjoy myself but
[12:33.480 --> 12:38.640]  there's something bigger than that our ancestors always were in a struggle
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.640]  against the tyrants and control freaks and megalomaniacs to carve out all the
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.800]  good things we've got today and life is so short I I'm not worried about my
[12:48.800 --> 12:58.680]  physical death I'm not worried about my physical death I am worried about the
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.040]  death of our species and letting a bunch of crazy people that want to vandalize
[13:03.040 --> 13:06.400]  our genetic code and are doing it through the chemical and biological
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.120]  attacks and radiological attacks they've got us under that they brag about I
[13:10.120 --> 13:19.120]  don't want to just give the future over to these people my son is here with me
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.840]  today I took him to work with me because it's summertime my wife's taking my
[13:23.840 --> 13:27.520]  daughters with friends to a water park but he wanted to come here with us and I
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.640]  promised he might take him I'd take off work early today and let Aaron or I think
[13:32.640 --> 13:36.120]  Gary McBrain's doing the nightly news tonight and I take him out and do some stuff
[13:36.120 --> 13:40.080]  today but you know once I go ahead and release the information my gut tells me
[13:40.080 --> 13:46.680]  I need to about the nuclear waste dump hidden in the middle of Austin and the
[13:46.680 --> 13:50.480]  nuclear reactors and all the rest of it and remember they just declassified a
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.080]  few years ago that in Southern California they had that sodium salt
[13:55.080 --> 14:00.200]  reactor meltdown bigger than Chernobyl in what 59 and that was kept secret until
[14:00.200 --> 14:04.400]  just a few years ago that guys that's NBC news will you guys print me just
[14:04.400 --> 14:09.360]  California reactor kept a meltdown kept secret and and and that should bring it
[14:09.360 --> 14:13.400]  up I've shown it on air before and played part of the newscast but I mean
[14:13.400 --> 14:16.880]  the point is is that you discover this and then you know UT runs the San
[14:16.880 --> 14:22.120]  Andia labs out in New Mexico and it's it's just we start going out I'm like
[14:22.120 --> 14:28.560]  let's go do a piece on the nuclear reactor under UT that's still running its
[14:28.560 --> 14:31.760]  half-life and then the two big ones well the little one in the big one they've
[14:31.760 --> 14:35.760]  got up at the JJ Pickle Center that no one seems to know about or care about
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.440]  with all the you know barbed wire machine gun nest over there where they
[14:40.440 --> 14:43.840]  where they do tests the most dangerous type of reactors are doing constant tests
[14:43.840 --> 14:48.720]  and manipulations of them and then you find out that nine out of ten and Aaron's
[14:48.720 --> 14:52.680]  got these numbers the government admits reactors are leaking in the United
[14:52.680 --> 14:58.720]  States nine out of ten it's the same number worldwide and all of that's happening
[14:58.720 --> 15:06.800]  and then we start doing research and discover someone right here in our own
[15:06.800 --> 15:12.000]  crews grandfather was the head superintendent of all the buildings and
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.080]  maintenance for the University of Texas and and and knows all about it I can
[15:16.080 --> 15:19.040]  confirm what he's saying is my dad was in the physics department and worked on
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.440]  the reactor and then I'd already been told about how you know your AM radio
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.120]  won't work out on Redbud Trail there's so much there it is his California's
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.400]  historical nuclear meltdown and then it just goes over that whole report great
[15:32.400 --> 15:39.720]  print that for me but also print the NBC California reactor meltdown and 59 yeah
[15:39.720 --> 15:46.000]  but I want the NBC thank you anyways side issue we sent the guys out to the
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.120]  limestone caves right in the middle of the wealthiest area of Austin where
[15:51.120 --> 15:55.920]  according to our sources grandfather and other documents and information we
[15:55.920 --> 16:02.840]  ferreted out that they used it as a dump I mean it's just it just never ends it
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.560]  we start looking into some type of particle accelerator rail gun explosion
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.920]  Department of Defense UT's running bio weapons labs right outside Austin in
[16:12.920 --> 16:17.480]  level 2 facilities that are level 4 you've seen the level 2 facility with
[16:17.480 --> 16:22.840]  level 4 at the UT University of Texas facility down in Galveston they got
[16:22.840 --> 16:26.960]  hit by the hurricane and destroyed pretty much destroyed I mean it's just
[16:26.960 --> 16:32.440]  again we're living in crazy land and the rail gun fires and blows up a part of
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.520]  a building and shoots a car driving down a country road and they're like never
[16:36.520 --> 16:40.120]  mind there's some type of leak there that's in the news but the Army and
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.320]  UT are working on it I mean who knows it's a nano tech facility I forgot that
[16:44.320 --> 16:50.800]  part yeah there it is ruling expected on LA nuclear cleanup by the way folks you
[16:50.800 --> 16:57.040]  gotta pray for us reporting that our sources who are credible are saying
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.000]  there is a nuclear waste dump in the middle of Austin this has never been
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.920]  reported on just like this situation outside San Diego has never been
[17:05.920 --> 17:11.680]  reported on is movie dangerous but I know they know because our phones are
[17:11.680 --> 17:14.800]  tapped that we're looking at this show it doesn't matter I've got to go ahead
[17:14.800 --> 17:19.720]  and say it here on air even though the report's not ready but this will be
[17:19.720 --> 17:23.680]  national news so I mean I'm supposed to talk about is that's what everybody's
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.680]  upset about I'm upset about it Ron Paul hey you know what Ron Paul's a good guy
[17:27.680 --> 17:37.720]  Rand Paul's a good guy they've got a bunch of mainline Republican analysts working
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.040]  for him now and I think they're making big mistakes but I don't want to hear of
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.160]  the denial that Ron Paul's not involved in this and it's our job as his diehard
[17:45.160 --> 17:50.160]  supporters and contributors to not let them compromise instead of saying gee is
[17:50.160 --> 18:00.880]  it okay to criticize anything they're doing over 80% Nepal we've got an info
[18:00.880 --> 18:08.160]  wars comm was 80% last night let me check it now think that it is a bad idea
[18:08.160 --> 18:15.320]  for Rand Paul to join with Mitt Romney do you approve of Rand Paul's decision to
[18:15.320 --> 18:19.080]  work within the establishment and support Mitt Romney we've got five thousand
[18:19.080 --> 18:25.240]  six hundred 97 votes this poll before it had bugs we took it down used to get
[18:25.240 --> 18:29.640]  like 50,000 votes not this particular poll but I mean the old poll system we
[18:29.640 --> 18:33.160]  had this new one people don't use as much people should go vote there it's the
[18:33.160 --> 18:37.560]  bottom right hand corner of info wars comm do you approve of Rand Paul's
[18:37.560 --> 18:40.600]  decision to work within the establishment and support Mitt Romney
[18:40.600 --> 18:51.200]  80% that's what it was last night 4,574 votes against 20% say yes and that's
[18:51.200 --> 18:56.280]  out of just pure loyalty to Ron Paul and and and I mean I get it I understand
[18:56.280 --> 18:59.560]  work within the Republicans try to change them but that's not what I'm
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.840]  seeing happening I'm I'm getting mail endorsing mainline neocon Republicans
[19:04.840 --> 19:11.320]  from campaign for liberty and so is everybody else Ron Paul wasn't even
[19:11.320 --> 19:16.400]  sure if he was gonna speak at this big festival you know the counter national
[19:16.400 --> 19:19.360]  convention because it might make the Republicans mad but now the Republicans
[19:19.360 --> 19:24.840]  say they're okay with it because of what Rand's done I mean you know I've not
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.680]  found compromises the way to go I'm gonna play Tom Woods this is a video Tom
[19:29.680 --> 19:35.560]  put up but then pulled down and he said well you know what he doesn't want to
[19:35.560 --> 19:38.520]  put salt in the wound he wants to wait and see he thinks Ron Paul will do the
[19:38.520 --> 19:46.040]  right thing and come out and say that he's not gonna endorse Romney we invited
[19:46.040 --> 19:48.680]  him on the show he's been on before years ago he said he'd come on later but
[19:48.680 --> 19:52.080]  he's not gonna come on today well you know what Tom you put the video out
[19:52.080 --> 19:55.640]  there we've got it we're gonna air it here comment up because what you said
[19:55.640 --> 20:02.480]  was very eloquent and took courage to ride back I had tried everything I'd
[20:02.480 --> 20:06.440]  cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but
[20:06.440 --> 20:10.640]  nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace

[24:30.480 --> 24:34.960]  into the 80s the University of Texas dumped radiological waste from the
[24:34.960 --> 24:43.760]  nuclear reactor according to the former head of operations at the University of
[24:43.760 --> 24:51.040]  Texas head of the campus facilities and I know about the reactor and about all
[24:51.040 --> 24:55.440]  the secrecy they even tell students at UT there's not a reactor still going
[24:55.440 --> 25:01.560]  through its half-life phase underneath the lbj library and museum yeah the
[25:01.560 --> 25:05.600]  presidential library museum first one in the country by the way was for lbj they
[25:05.600 --> 25:10.120]  built it on top of nuclear reactor and took the there's also underground tunnels
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.240]  under there I've confirmed that separately that are connected out to
[25:15.240 --> 25:19.480]  barkstrom where they was the former sack base the Hilton hotel out there a
[25:19.480 --> 25:23.520]  circular hotel is the former shack command base for much of the United
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.880]  States there's a whole bunch of secret stuff around here I live here and you
[25:27.880 --> 25:33.320]  need to understand folks this is happening all over the world not just
[25:33.320 --> 25:39.680]  here in the US there are giant black projects secret programs happening some
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.560]  of the other news coming up and then I'll get to the Tom Woods video ahead of
[25:42.560 --> 25:49.680]  our guest joining us I remember Kurt Nemo writing this article yesterday from
[25:49.680 --> 25:54.320]  European Russian and Middle Eastern sources Russia denies sending helicopters
[25:54.320 --> 25:59.080]  as serious as West arming rebels but there are news articles out today out of
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.920]  the Financial Times and others saying that Russia defends arms sales to Syria
[26:03.920 --> 26:12.080]  but it turned out they just make that up here's the New York Times reporting
[26:12.080 --> 26:16.600]  today and again Kurt's for info wars yesterday said it wasn't true people got
[26:16.600 --> 26:20.240]  mad at him in the comments instead he was a Ruski agent or something last time
[26:20.240 --> 26:23.880]  I checked folks it in the Ruskies that are I got drones in the sky and put in
[26:23.880 --> 26:28.160]  sodium fluoride and radioactive isotopes in my water last time I checked it
[26:28.160 --> 26:30.880]  it wasn't the Ruskies that run the Federal Reserve if the Ruskies do
[26:30.880 --> 26:34.360]  anything to America they can go straight to a place where the sun don't shine
[26:34.360 --> 26:39.360]  okay I'm sick of the globalist going well kind is gonna get you you don't give
[26:39.360 --> 26:42.280]  your rights up be paid for all the Russians will get you the Chinese will
[26:42.280 --> 26:45.400]  get you you mean the same Chinese government our criminal government paid
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.800]  20 plus million dollars to ship General Motors to shut up with your lies I am so
[26:50.800 --> 26:54.480]  sick of these neo-congribs putting out articles I see them almost every day
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.680]  saying I'm a Ruski agent or something I am a tooth fairy before I'm that but
[26:59.680 --> 27:07.780]  again it just shows their disinformation sorry I'm ranting here it is
[27:07.780 --> 27:12.600]  copters in Syria may not be new US officials say oh turns out they got
[27:12.600 --> 27:18.000]  sold a long time ago Hillary on Tuesday accused of shipping attack helicopters
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.560]  of Syria with us click the conflict but they go on to say she put a little bit
[27:23.560 --> 27:26.640]  of a spin on it said one senior Defense Department official because they've been
[27:26.640 --> 27:33.280]  delivered a long time ago also seeing an inflows idea of US assassinating Syrian
[27:33.280 --> 27:38.520]  president Assad what's Hillary say they came they saw Gaddafi died and they put
[27:38.520 --> 27:44.560]  al-Qaeda in and again I'm supposed to oh you must like al-Qaeda that you don't
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.600]  want all these wars going on at wars they say look al-Qaeda is in this country
[27:48.600 --> 27:54.480]  invade and then the West uses al-Qaeda to actually invade the country I know I
[27:54.480 --> 27:57.920]  rant a lot about that it just makes my head spin by the way I'm probably seeing
[27:57.920 --> 28:03.360]  no exaggeration 20 or more articles every day saying Obama is done Washington
[28:03.360 --> 28:09.920]  post their spiegel associated press his poll numbers plunging MSNBC saying he's
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.720]  a dead political duck I guess our sources and people like Jerome Corsi are
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.400]  right the Bilderbergs have decided they can't get anywhere with Obama and they
[28:18.400 --> 28:23.080]  are looking at getting rid of him and before you say hip hip hooray and believe
[28:23.080 --> 28:27.480]  me I'll be glad to quit seeing him on TV all the time I hate Obama but I hate his
[28:27.480 --> 28:32.320]  globalist masters a lot more here comes Mitt Romney we're all supposed to get all
[28:32.320 --> 28:36.400]  excited like Obama idiots four years ago when he was president-elect or getting
[28:36.400 --> 28:42.920]  ready to be and oh my gosh whoo bushes out of there McCain you lost we're gonna
[28:42.920 --> 28:47.600]  get free houses and free cars and the economy's gonna be back and a yippie
[28:47.600 --> 28:52.960]  kayak we got rid of Bush I'm like bottom paid for by the same people nothing
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.680]  but puppets that's not even a sophisticated point that's a no-brainer
[28:56.680 --> 29:02.760]  one plus one equals two and now I've got to sit here and watch I mean I saw a
[29:02.760 --> 29:07.480]  CNN clip this morning we'll play later we have time with Rand Paul God blesses
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.840]  little heart you know with his little Ronald McDonald hair and everything I'm

[29:17.680 --> 29:24.880]  affectionately he's sitting there and it's like a mini me of Ron Paul's like
[29:24.880 --> 29:28.840]  here's the big Ron Paul and it's like Dr. Dr. Good has like a little Dr. Evil on
[29:28.840 --> 29:33.520]  his knee and and the host of CNN's going well well wait a minute your dad didn't
[29:33.520 --> 29:36.840]  agree with him on this and that and he's oh no Romney wants to get rid of the
[29:36.840 --> 29:41.920]  fellow reserve oh no he yeah he is I mean it was just like watching this
[29:41.920 --> 29:46.560]  defense of Romney this isn't just an endorsement this is an absolute worship

[30:03.480 --> 30:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:07.840 --> 30:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.080]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:16.080 --> 30:19.960]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.960 --> 30:24.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.400]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.400 --> 30:32.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.680 --> 30:36.400]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[33:21.080 --> 33:28.080]  Mexico has a bunch of big labs it ties into the salt reactor in 59 outside
[33:28.080 --> 33:32.480]  San Diego that blew up bigger than Chernobyl and wasn't even admitted to
[33:32.480 --> 33:37.640]  till decades later in fact you look it up there's hardly even any news about it
[33:37.640 --> 33:44.960]  in fact looking it up we found another reactor site outside LA where they were
[33:44.960 --> 33:49.440]  dumping with stuff ruling expected on LA nuclear cleanup if the case involves a
[33:49.440 --> 33:55.800]  Cold War era accident at the Santa Susanna Field Laboratory and this is NBC
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.200]  News this just came out last year but but the point is that here's another
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.440]  report California's historical nuclear meltdown Japan's nuclear power crisis
[34:04.440 --> 34:09.000]  has planted indelible memories worldwide on the revived doubts about the
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.680]  health and safety nuclear power it may unsettle many discover that California
[34:12.680 --> 34:17.360]  to they kept it secret experienced a partial nuclear meltdown the accident
[34:17.360 --> 34:21.280]  which occurred in 59 is claimed to have released more radiation in Three Mile
[34:21.280 --> 34:26.200]  Island yeah I think it's 70 times they say the severity of health impacts from
[34:26.200 --> 34:29.720]  the incident on site workers and the surrounding community is still being
[34:29.720 --> 34:35.680]  debated oh yes now of course we now learn a year ago radioactive tuna just three
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.160]  months after Chernobyl was being caught and the government knew and covered it
[34:39.160 --> 34:44.640]  up off LA and off San Diego folks we told you at the time they had state labs
[34:44.640 --> 34:50.280]  in Connecticut as far as Connecticut and Vermont high levels you have dozens and
[34:50.280 --> 34:55.560]  dozens it was like 25 30 something to putting on the lab in the milk of cows
[34:55.560 --> 34:58.440]  because they're bio accumulating they're eating grass where this stuff's coming
[34:58.440 --> 35:02.000]  down see the trade winds the jet stream all of it comes from over Japan and
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.400]  dumps in different areas over the United States and you've got the currents
[35:07.400 --> 35:10.960]  going up to Alaska the hair is falling out of the seals and the people that
[35:10.960 --> 35:14.840]  live there that the fishermen and the flight attendants that are flying through
[35:14.840 --> 35:21.640]  it this is in the news I mean this is happening and then we go out to look at
[35:21.640 --> 35:25.520]  the reactor and one of our crew members who hadn't been on area he's gonna be
[35:25.520 --> 35:30.080]  with us after the break here in a moment he's like oh yeah my grandfather was the
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.000]  you know head guy for UT over all the buildings in their maintenance and we
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.200]  looked that up sure enough there he is and yeah he said he you know they would
[35:38.200 --> 35:44.200]  take rods chemicals the fluid out of the reactor the old one that's under the
[35:44.200 --> 35:50.000]  lbj library the presidential library in Austin everything he was saying I'd
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.200]  I'd hurt gotten pieces up from other sources Aaron tried to do a
[35:54.200 --> 35:57.440]  documentary when he was at UT in film school he also got a degree from their
[35:57.440 --> 36:03.200]  school of public affairs there Aaron Dykes and they tried to just ask
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.960]  questions and got threatened with arrest about it wanted to try to get down in
[36:06.960 --> 36:09.320]  there with their cameras the security guards admitted there was a bunch of
[36:09.320 --> 36:13.240]  stuff just like they store the nuclear waste on site reportedly it's still
[36:13.240 --> 36:21.960]  under UT well now we're learning from the 60s and 70s and he'd never been there
[36:21.960 --> 36:26.240]  his grandpa told him where it was how they sealed the limestone caves and he
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.120]  went over there they went over there yesterday and sure enough it's there let
[36:30.120 --> 36:33.920]  me just tell you this AM radio ain't coming in over the site we've got to get
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.080]  some good radiation detectors and get over there before before they try to
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.440]  keep a kick everybody out of the area and again if you got radiation AM radio
[36:41.440 --> 36:46.040]  gets cut out we're gonna find out what's going on it was a plut a uranium
[36:46.040 --> 36:51.320]  reactor and again this is about 98% confirmed we know about the the two
[36:51.320 --> 36:55.240]  research reactors they've got that are more modern at the JJ Pickle Center up
[36:55.240 --> 37:02.480]  at North Austin off research and that area giant area with big fences around
[37:02.480 --> 37:06.760]  it I mean there's hundreds and there's like 500 600 yards just between the
[37:06.760 --> 37:11.000]  fences and the facility and the reactors and they're very quiet about that the
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.520]  average Austin I doesn't even know they're there I'm already getting into
[37:14.520 --> 37:17.600]  it he's gonna join us I'm gonna recap this and I'm getting out just a
[37:17.600 --> 37:22.640]  preliminary him on record before we get the video out tonight because the guys
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.680]  were out till like 9 10 o'clock last night that they just got in that there
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.200]  and I've gone ahead and talked about it because I know they're listening to our
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.600]  phones a lot of stuff going on today and so I'm just gonna get this on record in
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.200]  case they the they swat team us and say we've got heroin and cocaine in here
[37:39.200 --> 37:44.560]  but because believe me ladies or dead children or something or prostitutes I
[37:44.560 --> 37:48.960]  mean or Easter bunnies because believe me if this is correct and this is the
[37:48.960 --> 37:52.840]  report and and we know there's reactors we know that they always did this in the
[37:52.840 --> 37:55.840]  old days just dumped it on the edge of town where they dumped it's the middle
[37:55.840 --> 37:59.680]  of Austin now but the 70s was on the edge of town this is exactly how they do
[37:59.680 --> 38:04.640]  it and old dams and old facilities and old research caves you know where they
[38:04.640 --> 38:11.840]  stored things and that's this needs to be looked into right now so so it fits
[38:11.840 --> 38:15.640]  similar with what I've been told Aaron Dykes again tried to make a film there
[38:15.640 --> 38:22.360]  this is 97 98% confirmed I hope it's false the severity of it but just two
[38:22.360 --> 38:29.320]  days ago we had a Department of Defense cyclotron explosion it's some type of
[38:29.320 --> 38:32.760]  railgun experiment that blew a laboratory up I mean I'm living in the
[38:32.760 --> 38:37.920]  middle of Buck Rogers land they've got bio weapons out at the monkey farm I've
[38:37.920 --> 38:44.080]  got multiple sources on that they admit it's level four it's level four look up
[38:44.080 --> 38:50.440]  level four bio weapons research at University of Texas Galveston that's
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.120]  admitted out on the water and they're building they already built since bush
[38:55.120 --> 38:59.640]  36 more of these around the country now they're planning or completing 200 plus
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.520]  more you know we've done shows on this but it just it just clicked oh hey go do
[39:04.520 --> 39:08.480]  stories on the nuclear reactor and the word is there's waste under the under the
[39:08.480 --> 39:11.680]  LBJ thing oh Aaron's like oh yeah I tried to do a film on that threaten to arrest
[39:11.680 --> 39:15.920]  our guys oh really yeah my dad was in the you know the physics you know
[39:15.920 --> 39:18.520]  department as a student he said there was all sorts of stuff down on there the
[39:18.520 --> 39:22.240]  top of reactor we'll go out to JJ Pickle all right we'll go out tomorrow to where
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.160]  the rail gun blew up now yeah we got to get out to that monkey farm yeah but
[39:26.160 --> 39:29.000]  that's you know that's a couple miles past bar bar to get to that as a carry
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.760]  51 all right well well by the way my grandpa was the head of maintenance and
[39:32.760 --> 39:37.480]  he said they dumped it all in the caves I mean it's just like yeah there it is
[39:37.480 --> 39:43.320]  southern research Galveston National Laboratory develop screening platform in
[39:43.320 --> 39:48.160]  biosafety level four laboratory and they call it developing safety to have a
[39:48.160 --> 39:53.360]  level two with level four level four is weaponized Ebola weaponized pox I mean
[39:53.360 --> 39:57.760]  that we're talking killed 90 plus percent deader than a hammer so they just put
[39:57.760 --> 40:01.560]  that on screen okay enough enough it's just that I realize I've got all these
[40:01.560 --> 40:06.640]  hours talking about where the country is going the election Lou Rockwell coming
[40:06.640 --> 40:10.760]  up Governor Gary Johnson libertarian presidential candidate and then I
[40:10.760 --> 40:15.160]  realized that none of that even really matters in the final equation because
[40:15.160 --> 40:18.480]  no one's talking about all the level four bio weapons labs no one's talking
[40:18.480 --> 40:24.440]  about all over the country right through to today in Indiana and Michigan and
[40:24.440 --> 40:29.920]  Illinois and Texas in California now you see it every few weeks oh yeah nuclear
[40:29.920 --> 40:33.680]  alarms went off they're not gonna turn them on anymore you know when it gets
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.000]  released yeah they did release you know in this town in Canada or this town in
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.080]  California a bunch of radiation but they say it's no big deal yeah radiation
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.880]  detectors went off but it's fine we've raised the levels to say it's safe see
[40:46.880 --> 40:51.520]  and see these reports fit into everything we've seen other areas of the
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.120]  country where they just go and store it in a cave or in a underground warehouse
[40:56.120 --> 41:00.960]  right outside town and the fact that his grandfather when I looked yesterday and
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.200]  I know how these limestone caves work it's like at my house I live by a dry
[41:04.200 --> 41:07.800]  creek bed but when it rains for a week straight all the sudden water starts
[41:07.800 --> 41:11.920]  gushing out of the rocks and there's a big luscious five-foot deep creek behind
[41:11.920 --> 41:15.360]  my house only like that a few few few months out of the year I live out in the
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.080]  country and it's a creek feeding into a bigger creek but even the big creek you
[41:20.080 --> 41:24.320]  know is only running about half the time and it just comes out and his
[41:24.320 --> 41:28.240]  grandfather was telling him how how water would just pour out over all this
[41:28.240 --> 41:34.080]  into the Colorado River I mean this is amazing this is amazing and we're
[41:34.080 --> 41:39.520]  again breaking this here we hope that we're incorrect but I don't think his
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.840]  grandfather is we went out there it's exactly what they said was out there
[41:43.840 --> 41:51.880]  pretty amazing okay let's go to this Tom Woods is a researcher an author friend
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.000]  confidant of Ron Paul speaks at most his big events and he's a man of
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.680]  conscience like Ron Paul who is a constitutionalist who loves liberty who
[42:01.680 --> 42:05.560]  understands the new world order understands dependency I agree with his
[42:05.560 --> 42:09.320]  constitutional ideas that transcend even libertarianism and the globalist
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.360]  trying to co-op that and Woods eloquently in three and a half minutes
[42:13.360 --> 42:19.720]  said some really powerful things and then they noticed that the video was
[42:19.720 --> 42:24.120]  taken down but people already copied it and I saw a comment on the Daily Paul by
[42:24.120 --> 42:29.880]  Woods saying well I don't want to you know rub salt in the wound I want to
[42:29.880 --> 42:33.920]  trust in Paul he's not gonna indoors even though we're hearing rumors that and
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.600]  that I'm getting more information well then we talked to him this morning he's
[42:38.600 --> 42:45.600]  like I'm gonna wait and see and I you know I think my video may do more harm
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.520]  than good no no no Tom your video will do nothing but good when you point out
[42:49.520 --> 42:52.520]  the head of campaign for liberty thinks that we shouldn't be against these
[42:52.520 --> 42:56.240]  wars and shouldn't be involved in foreign policy American citizens have
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.120]  that right and duty where on Paul is dead on that's the heart of what you're
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.920]  saying there should be a top-down review of all these big famous neocon
[43:04.920 --> 43:09.880]  operatives who say on the campaign for liberty site I'm a seasoned operative
[43:09.880 --> 43:13.000]  they call themselves that we don't want that we want statesmen we don't want
[43:13.000 --> 43:19.720]  compromise we want principles we don't want business as usual that's why Ron
[43:19.720 --> 43:23.880]  Paul was loved and if Rand wants to make the mistake I like Rand Paul is out
[43:23.880 --> 43:28.600]  today saying you got to have a warrant for drones he wants a federal law those
[43:28.600 --> 43:31.560]  laws are already in place this enforce them good job he's saying don't arrest
[43:31.560 --> 43:35.720]  Amish we're selling milk let people buy raw milk he's out fighting the Federal
[43:35.720 --> 43:39.520]  Reserve he's doing a great job it's that we love you guys that we don't want to
[43:39.520 --> 43:43.160]  see you co-opted and we're coming in trying to drag you away from the hyenas
[43:43.160 --> 43:48.120]  and and some people don't understand that very a small minority maybe 15% and
[43:48.120 --> 43:54.420]  then and then they basically growl back at us saying you know let us have
[43:54.420 --> 43:58.640]  Rand Paul and Ron Paul you stay out of this folks that built this coalition the
[43:58.640 --> 44:02.600]  people that gave the money and and gave the shoe leather on the street to get
[44:02.600 --> 44:05.780]  the word out and calling in to talk radio and doing countless shows and
[44:05.780 --> 44:11.240]  rallies Ron Paul belongs to us Rand Paul belongs to us and we're not going to let
[44:11.240 --> 44:16.120]  the new world order take him we can understand that he thinks he can work
[44:16.120 --> 44:20.520]  with Romney and that he was led to do this and I can see the politics but we
[44:20.520 --> 44:25.240]  want to see you radically turn back Rand towards being a purist when it comes to
[44:25.240 --> 44:29.740]  liberty and freedom because you will destroy yourself if you don't and you
[44:29.740 --> 44:34.560]  guys we need you as statesmen and icons your father especially look at your
[44:34.560 --> 44:40.120]  father respect him do what he's done don't defend Mitt Romney and and you
[44:40.120 --> 44:42.360]  know when people bring up the fact that he's diametrically opposed your father
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.440]  and twist it like I heard you do on CNN that oh no no he he's against the wars
[44:46.440 --> 44:51.240]  oh no he wants to do something to the Fed oh no he no he doesn't and Rand when
[44:51.240 --> 44:55.200]  he when Mitt Romney gets in that's what it looks like now that he's not a ringer
[44:55.200 --> 44:58.680]  the establishment wants him that's the momentum unless Obama stages a new war
[44:58.680 --> 45:02.160]  or blow something up what are you gonna do when he's for predator drones in
[45:02.160 --> 45:06.720]  America and checkpoints in police state and new wars you're gonna have your
[45:06.720 --> 45:10.920]  wagon hitch like Chuck Baldwin who got your father's endorsement for president
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.440]  when old went when when your father got cheated out of the nomination four
[45:15.440 --> 45:19.000]  years ago he endorsed Chuck Baldwin Constitution Party and Chuck this said
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.360]  exactly what I've said it's called Chuck Baldwin a warning to Ron Paul it's an
[45:23.360 --> 45:28.680]  info wars.com right now the video a partial transcript listen to Chuck
[45:28.680 --> 45:34.320]  Baldwin listen to Tom Woods listen to these people okay you can turn this
[45:34.320 --> 45:38.760]  around you're gonna lose I'd say 80 to 90 percent of your support and then when
[45:38.760 --> 45:43.000]  people see you go along with Mitt Romney later down the road it's over
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.520]  please don't do this Liberty will continue on and and you guys is a focal
[45:47.520 --> 45:51.080]  point and a rallying point we have really won some big battles here okay
[45:51.080 --> 45:54.600]  here's Tom Woods very eloquent then we'll go to break come back with a quick
[45:54.600 --> 45:59.160]  report from the info wars crew member about the the report we shot yesterday
[45:59.160 --> 46:03.400]  Aaron Dykes myself and others will have a report done by tonight that's got
[46:03.400 --> 46:09.680]  video details there needs to be a major investigation of the cave system out by
[46:09.680 --> 46:14.400]  the dam off Redbud Trail off the Colorado River known as Lady Bird Lake
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.160]  it's all doublespeak it's a river folks they call it a lake only in the New
[46:19.160 --> 46:22.980]  World Order this needs to be looked into this is very dangerous news we're
[46:22.980 --> 46:28.280]  breaking here's Tom Woods Congressman Paul this message is for you but I
[46:28.280 --> 46:30.600]  thought the sentiments in it were important enough that they should be
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.160]  heard by anybody who cares to listen one of my favorite parts of Brian Dory's new
[46:35.160 --> 46:40.480]  book Ron Paul's Revolution takes place on page 3 where Dory's been talking
[46:40.480 --> 46:45.480]  about the Giuliani moment of 2007 where you spoke some forbidden truths about
[46:45.480 --> 46:49.360]  the US government's foreign policy truths the whole world knows but which are
[46:49.360 --> 46:52.960]  not allowed to be expressed in the United States and Giuliani attacked you
[46:52.960 --> 46:57.400]  the whole world expected you to back down but as a matter of fact you actually
[46:57.400 --> 47:02.440]  amplified your points and on page 3 of this book Dory quotes just a regular
[47:02.440 --> 47:06.300]  American who said I was watching that debate and I was fully expecting Ron
[47:06.300 --> 47:11.440]  Paul without a friend of the world to back down and then he amplified his
[47:11.440 --> 47:17.640]  points and I felt like at that moment this guy says the world changed forever
[47:17.640 --> 47:23.160]  because in our society whenever anybody strays from the 3x5 card of approved
[47:23.160 --> 47:27.480]  opinion well it's always followed by apologies and retractions and
[47:27.480 --> 47:32.320]  clarifications there's a liturgical ritual of expiation that one undergoes
[47:32.320 --> 47:37.320]  and you refuse to do that and it did change the world forever one of my
[47:37.320 --> 47:40.600]  favorite memories from the campaign this time around is actually a photograph of
[47:40.600 --> 47:46.520]  a college student actually hugging you you had changed his life when was the
[47:46.520 --> 47:50.280]  last time somebody hugged Mitt Romney and said Mitt your philosophy changed my
[47:50.280 --> 47:56.080]  life this is all because of who you are you've been that man who refuses to go
[47:56.080 --> 48:00.520]  along who will not be absorbed into the establishment who's gonna tell us those
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.440]  forbidden truths and that's why you've given people such genuine hope people
[48:05.440 --> 48:10.880]  feel like here's that one honest man who can't be bought and his arm can't be
[48:10.880 --> 48:16.720]  twisted and let's contrast that with Mitt Romney Mitt Romney for one thing
[48:16.720 --> 48:22.040]  thinks that budget cuts cause depressions or even worse I'll just give you five
[48:22.040 --> 48:29.200]  words about Mitt Romney secretary of state John Bolton now I understand that
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.120]  you're under tremendous pressure to endorse Mitt Romney and the people who
[48:33.120 --> 48:36.720]  are urging you to do this and I am certain I know who they are and I've
[48:36.720 --> 48:41.760]  warned you about them do not have your best interests at heart the millions of
[48:41.760 --> 48:45.880]  kids you've inspired would be totally devastated your legacy would be destroyed
[48:45.880 --> 48:54.200]  and people would literally literally be in tears over this now 99 times out of
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.360]  100 I would assume there's no way Ron Paul's gonna endorse Mitt Romney who
[48:57.360 --> 49:02.840]  disagrees with him on every major thing but I can understand the appeal someone
[49:02.840 --> 49:07.880]  might make to a father saying you love your son you want to help your son don't
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.160]  you and people I'm sure are telling you that you would help your son by
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.760]  endorsing Romney but Rand is going to sink or swim on his own merits that has
[49:16.760 --> 49:21.240]  nothing to do with whether or not you endorse Mitt Romney and incidentally may
[49:21.240 --> 49:25.400]  I say parenthetically that all this needs to be accompanied by a top to
[49:25.400 --> 49:30.320]  bottom reform of the organization campaign for liberty for example the
[49:30.320 --> 49:33.480]  gentleman running it right now believes the organization should steer
[49:33.480 --> 49:38.400]  entirely clear of foreign policy now like it or not the head of campaign for
[49:38.400 --> 49:43.120]  liberty is implicitly the custodian of the Ron Paul legacy and this is not an
[49:43.120 --> 49:49.760]  appropriate person to be in charge of an office like that finally dr. Paul I
[49:49.760 --> 49:54.880]  truly believe you are a great man and one of the great privileges of my life
[49:54.880 --> 49:59.200]  has been to be involved in this movement that you've led to have spoken at so
[49:59.200 --> 50:02.760]  many of your events including the rally for the Republic to have worked with you
[50:02.760 --> 50:09.080]  on projects and to have had my own work endorsed by you dr. Paul you changed the
[50:09.080 --> 50:17.960]  world in 2007 don't change it back just be Ron Paul and millions of us will
[50:17.960 --> 50:25.800]  support you we love you Ron and we love the focal point it created to expose
[50:25.800 --> 50:31.200]  the globalist and false flag terror and CIA drug dealing I mean Ron Paul is the
[50:31.200 --> 50:35.480]  real deal he could have sold out the system a long time ago and there's Tom
[50:35.480 --> 50:41.440]  Woods voicing very concisely what I've been trying to say in hours of babble and
[50:41.440 --> 50:46.320]  it's a lot of other stuff I mean some of his family's been upset a lot of people
[50:46.320 --> 50:52.920]  inside the campaign have been upset rand and runs crew this is real folks we're
[50:52.920 --> 50:58.440]  battling in a tug of war to keep the polls pure that's what's happening with

[54:13.000 --> 54:16.920]  we've got some big breaking news here it'll be codified and detailed to nine
[54:16.920 --> 54:21.760]  the nightly news and then more on Friday this is all moving very quickly the
[54:21.760 --> 54:27.360]  University of Texas has been involved with Los Alamos and other national
[54:27.360 --> 54:32.480]  laboratories Sanadia National Laboratories out in New Mexico as well
[54:32.480 --> 54:38.920]  there is a reactor that down under the lbj presidential library they built on
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.760]  it I know because my father was in there as a UT student as a physics student
[54:42.760 --> 54:47.160]  and you can dig around and find you know mentions at UT that did exist it's
[54:47.160 --> 54:51.200]  there it has a half-life so it's still basically going down there and that a
[54:51.200 --> 54:54.240]  lot of waste got stored under there that's what they do at most these
[54:54.240 --> 55:00.840]  facilities but then we went out doing a report on this in more detail and Chris
[55:00.840 --> 55:09.760]  Odin his great-grandfather was Benjamin Ellis and he was the superintendent of
[55:09.760 --> 55:15.720]  facilities for 20 years of all the big UT headquarters campuses here in Austin
[55:15.720 --> 55:21.720]  Texas and he had always told him over off Redbud trail by the dam that there
[55:21.720 --> 55:29.240]  was a area where they was rods encased in concrete fluids barrels and that they
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.240]  put it in there and walled off these caves I mean in your own words tell us
[55:34.240 --> 55:37.520]  about this Chris Odin who happens to work for us we're all doing a report on
[55:37.520 --> 55:40.720]  this he's like well hey my my great-grandfather actually you know has
[55:40.720 --> 55:44.800]  even more on this and this is standard for these facilities built in the 60s and
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.080]  70s as they would just go stick it somewhere on state property or on city
[55:49.080 --> 55:53.680]  property and so if this is indeed true and I'm sure his grandfather's being
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.880]  accurate we need to look into this we need to know about this tell us the
[55:57.880 --> 56:04.200]  basics of this Chris well basically in my knowledge what what my grandfather
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.640]  disclosed to me is that for a number of years they had attempted to get rid of
[56:08.640 --> 56:14.240]  waste in East Austin and that area was growing very fast and they'd found
[56:14.240 --> 56:22.080]  area in the large caves in South Austin where waste was disposed of it wasn't
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.640]  necessarily my grandfather's idea but his job was to oversee transportation over
[56:26.640 --> 56:29.960]  sure we're not throwing him under the bus you know I mean he just knew about it
[56:29.960 --> 56:35.880]  absolutely absolutely and a number of other people did I remember my my
[56:35.880 --> 56:40.400]  grandfather his son-in-law telling me the same stories and he used to explore
[56:40.400 --> 56:45.200]  the caves when he was a kid and closer to that mic for me so a bit low he
[56:45.200 --> 56:50.640]  explored the caves when he was a kid and they had closed them off sometime in the
[56:50.640 --> 56:56.880]  late 60s early 70s systematically I've explored caves in the side of cliffs
[56:56.880 --> 57:00.200]  like airman's cave here in Austin those that are thin enough to get into it can
[57:00.200 --> 57:06.040]  go for hundreds of yards if not miles into the cave network there's giant honey
[57:06.040 --> 57:10.480]  comb there's underground cenotes some of the biggest caves in the U.S. are
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.600]  actually underground some of the biggest populations of Mexican brown bats right
[57:14.600 --> 57:17.960]  in parts the caves are below the water table parts of the caves are above the
[57:17.960 --> 57:21.640]  water table to my knowledge that's where a lot of the waste was stored is above
[57:21.640 --> 57:27.160]  the water table the area in particular off of Red Bed Trail close to Tom
[57:27.160 --> 57:32.480]  Miller Dam was an entrance just like that that was above the water table above
[57:32.480 --> 57:38.960]  where the lake level was that could be explored for miles that now you told me
[57:38.960 --> 57:41.640]  yesterday that your grant your great-grandfather was concerned or
[57:41.640 --> 57:44.560]  talked about the fact that water sometimes did come in there absolutely
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.320]  the entrance there was in a ravine that did it one time flow directly into the
[57:49.320 --> 57:55.640]  Colorado River since then concrete bulkheads massive massive amounts of
[57:55.640 --> 57:59.680]  dirt work have been done there to cover up those entrances so at least they did
[57:59.680 --> 58:05.720]  that yes we need to give out a special email later we'll develop one for
[58:05.720 --> 58:09.680]  whistleblowers on this well let's just make whistleblowers and info wars calm
[58:09.680 --> 58:12.880]  let's make that email right now it'll be up the next hour we need to have
[58:12.880 --> 58:17.280]  construction workers other people call us confirms we can have more witnesses
[58:17.280 --> 58:22.160]  to this right for a long time the city did say that the many cave entrances
[58:22.160 --> 58:27.200]  were covered up because of citizens throwing garbage in them and they showed
[58:27.200 --> 58:32.200]  pictures of piles of trash so that was the cover that's what I believe is the
[58:32.200 --> 58:34.960]  cover but your grandfather said well you stay there we're gonna come back in one
[58:34.960 --> 58:37.400]  minute and Lou Rockwell is coming up specifically what your great-grandfather
[58:37.400 --> 58:39.680]  said
[58:42.520 --> 58:49.280]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:49.720 --> 58:53.600]  sick of the globalist you Genesis control freaks adding poison to your
[58:53.600 --> 58:57.640]  water and laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with
[58:57.640 --> 59:02.080]  pro pure my friends I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:26.800]  Alex Jones okay Lou Rockwell is coming up to talk about campaign 2012 what's
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:36.880]  happening across the board we're gonna have him joining us right now we're
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:42.000]  going back to Chris Ode and since we've been looking into this last day or so
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.240]  we have dug up the University of Texas admissions Collier Bill Collier UT
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.760]  reactor draws safety questions Austin American statesman 1989 so this has been
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.760]  in the news that we found links to blurbs dealing with concerns about where
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.400]  the waste was going and and so that's a whole nother ball of wax you're saying
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.840]  your great-grandfather who was the head of superintendent for facilities said
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.960]  that oh people didn't like it in East Austin so I guess stuff must have been
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:15.000]  dumped there somewhere and so then it moved to what was South Austin but
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.160]  pretty much is the middle of Austin now exactly now it borders a fairly high-end
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:28.920]  community called Westlake his his exact words were if you ever wonder why the
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.360]  radio doesn't work well near that part of Austin it's because there is radio
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:40.120]  activity there I personally have witnessed AM radio not functioning as well as
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:46.080]  it does in other other portions of South Austin so sure if you doubt that I
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.200]  mean if you doubt electricity puts off stuff when you drive under big power
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.120]  lines your AM cuts out right and there aren't any power lines in the area
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:59.160]  except for further west there is of course power generators at the dam
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.080]  let's be specific though for for people's we're gonna put a map on the
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.880]  nightly news tonight and you guys went and got video yesterday where exactly is
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:11.840]  this it's on the southern side of the Colorado River I would say less than an
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:18.160]  eighth of a mile from the low water crossing on Redbud Trail on the west
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:25.000]  side of the road geographically there's probably a I'd say a 20 foot to 30 foot
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.840]  deep ravine so it's right over by the Hula Hut on the other side of the river
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.120]  yeah on the other side across and on the downstream side of the dam there
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.520]  amazing and what else is your grandfather's a great grandfather say
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:48.280]  he did describe a fairly complex amount of construction that went on from the
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:55.040]  early 50s until until the 70s all over Austin for the UT campuses he did say
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.240]  that the University couldn't get funds for anything else but land and that's
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.720]  why it's the largest campus in the United States and they kept on building up
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:10.560]  and down according to him and he said there's as much going on below ground as
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.400]  there was above ground that's why there's so much secret government stuff
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.280]  and we got on to this when the cyclotron rail gun blew up two days ago at a UT
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.760]  facility and that's KXAN folks I mean we're living in like a weird
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:28.800]  experiment area aren't we absolutely I was even shocked to see a fairly large
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.600]  complex or university research complex on the north side of the river right in
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.760]  the same vicinity that did have signs posted restricted access there's a map
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.080]  on screen where should they blow it up you're saying restricted access area you
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:50.040]  saw I would say just there's a low water crossing right by that just to the
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:04:00.200]  northwest of Redbud Isle I'm sorry just to the south southwest move the cursor
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:07.920]  says it's one of the oldest oldest university reactors to I'm sorry go
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:14.120]  farther go farther upriver upriver you can move quicker much farther upriver
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.080]  yep we'll just do it during them it's that block over it's the furthest over

[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.920]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.240]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:10.840]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:29.360]  radio network we have a lot of massive news coming up today you know a drone
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.320]  crashed a few days ago in Maryland now they're reporting that all over the
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.560]  country but also the big report is again out of Fox News on the east coast
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:44.200]  people think it's UFOs now as Pentagon drones fly over the highways they think
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.740]  it's aliens and like the big surveillance blimps I've seen ABC News
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:52.240]  say it must be an alien and it's a big blimp with no markings on it with
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.920]  propellers and cameras hanging off the bottom because government wouldn't be
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.240]  spying on you with big blimps no it must actually be ET you know visiting
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:09.400]  for Reese's pieces or something I mean it's truly over the top ridiculous that
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:14.720]  stuff like this is going on we're gonna be breaking that down we're also
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.640]  researching right now the nuclear reactors there's three of them in Austin
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.000]  there's almost no news coverage of this and a big story we're working on of
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.080]  where they've been dumping the waste we're also going to be getting into the
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.160]  bizarre White House reaction to John Bryson's three hit-and-runs well two
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.040]  hit-and-runs on one one group and then another hit-and-run a lot of bizarre
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.040]  behavior on that front we're gonna look at the ongoing meltdown in Europe and
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.640]  the incredible announcements that they're gonna restrict ATM withdrawals and
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.480]  impose border checks so people can come into the euro but when you try to leave
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.800]  they're gonna impose capital controls TSA is already doing this trying to take
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.240]  people silver and gold asking about wedding rings this is in the news
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.920]  downloading what's on your laptop computers everything we've seen in
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.480]  third-world dictatorships are Nazi Germany it's amazing now in a moment
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.520]  we're going to a man who needs no introduction Lou Rockwell of Lou Rockwell
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.400]  dot-com head of the Austrian School of Economics group the von Mies Institute
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.400]  just an amazing intellectual mind when it comes to research former chief of
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.040]  staff Iran Paul a great patriot I want to get him on to look at everything
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.080]  happening in the world the big news issues the wars the euro the banker
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:33.280]  bailouts and obviously out of the gates get his take on Rand Paul's endorsement
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.600]  of Mitt Romney and why that's created such a firestorm and get his his view on
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:43.360]  a but but before we do that I wanted to play just about a minute clip of Ron
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.920]  Paul and and and I think Ron Paul when thinking if he should endorse Romney or
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.680]  not and Tom Woods has talked about how dangerous that would be I had the guy
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.000]  that Ron Paul endorsed four years ago they had the Constitution Party at the
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.960]  time that candidate I had him on last night Chuck Baldwin to discuss it he
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.640]  said really bad move again ran can do what he wants still a great guys fighting
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.560]  drones and the police state and all this other stuff but if Ron Paul does that
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.160]  wow it would be like a nuclear bomb going off in the words of Chuck Baldwin I
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.240]  agree so I want to get the inside intel if he's been talking to Ron on on on
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.560]  what's happening where all this is going in a moment but first here is a short
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:32.760]  clip of Ron Paul when he was conceding that he was gonna drop out in 2008 when
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.240]  he talked about endorsing the Constitution Party here he is explaining
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:43.040]  why when the McCain people called him he didn't take you know even their
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:48.200]  respectful call he didn't take their pleas to endorse McCain as a lesser of
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.120]  two evils and he explains why the full clip is up at infoworks.com the
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:00.080]  headline of the video is Ron Paul should listen Ron Paul of 2012 should
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:08.720]  listen to Ron Paul of 2008 here is a clip of that CNN press conference the
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.400]  majority of the American people even the recent polling shows that 60% of the
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.640]  American people are unhappy with their choices if you take the total number
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.520]  Americans and the percentage that that register and then the percentage that
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.640]  vote and then the percentage that vote for a candidate we end up electing a
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:34.000]  president with 30 32% of the American people and because they have been more
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.640]  less conditioned to believe well the two candidates are different and we have to
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.160]  vote for the lesser of two evils they end up voting half the people who vote
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:50.000]  for the president are voting for the rest of two evils and so therefore 16% of
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.800]  the American people essentially are saying hey I like this candidate and
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.240]  and they they vote for the president you know yesterday I had a phone call the
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.800]  first phone call that I personally received or had had had received from
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:11.320]  anybody in the McCain candidacy in his campaign they called and it was a bit of
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:19.480]  surprise to me because their request was that I endorsed John McCain today and I
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.680]  said well I don't like the idea of getting about two or three million people
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:31.000]  angry at me so but but they're they were serious and it was a respectful call
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:38.200]  and the argument was he would do a little less harm than the other candidate
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:47.040]  and you know we we just don't need to do that anymore you know in 19 I believe
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.800]  it was 1988 okay that's enough and I believe he goes on for seven more
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.800]  minutes explaining why in a down-to-earth common sense fashion so this is
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.120]  why there was horror at Rand we're not saying Rand's bad but then some of the
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.480]  campaign type operatives people that admit they don't want campaign for
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.480]  liberty being involved in foreign affairs or being against foreign
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.600]  intervention well that's the heart of what makes Ron Paul so good is that when
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.040]  everybody's laughing at him and they have an audience set to attack him and
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.120]  they say aren't you for the wars and Giuliani goes after him he says no I'm
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.200]  not that's what's so great about Ron Paul so Rand starts going for sanctions
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.000]  something his dad says is an act of war we turn and look the other way because
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.920]  Rand overall is good then he does this endorsement I understand that Rand is
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.760]  not Ron but the machinery of campaign for liberty is behind Rand and going with
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.080]  the Rand brand so we are saying as the people that brought them to the party
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.840]  because Ron Paul such an amazing person and people like Lou Rockwell as well
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.800]  they're helping him for decades 30 40 years that we're allowed to say hey we
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.400]  don't like the direction things are starting to go in I saw an editorial put
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.600]  about one of their folks saying you know that we're dumb and that we need to
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.720]  learn two things to grow up now I have grown up politically okay now joining us
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.440]  is somebody who grew up a long time ago and that's Lou Rockwell Lou Rockwell
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:10.640]  dot-com thank you for sitting while I went over that video Lou what is your
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.360]  take on all of this and the firestorm that has been created I think overall
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.120]  it's good because it lets some of the forces kind of the mainline Republicans
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.480]  trying to take over campaign for liberty know that we the people aren't gonna let
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.320]  that happen what's your take well first of all the Ron Paul that you with the
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.640]  we see in that and that clip from the last election is the same Ron Paul that
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.560]  I met in 1975 he's the same Ron Paul today he's not changed this is of course
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.880]  one of the things we love about him because he is so consistent and his
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.080]  principles are unchanging he's not going to endorse Mitt Romney any more than he
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.320]  endorsed George W. Bush any more than he endorsed John McCain these guys are all
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:55.640]  fascists they're all you know in favor of all the wars and the police state and
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:59.600]  all the horrible things that were that were seeing come to pass before our eyes
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.800]  right now whether as you say the blimps over Washington and the people think
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.440]  are aliens were and because it's actually the government that is it that's the
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.640]  alien we we and we have you have no worries about Ron Paul sticking to his
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:16.040]  principles I mean I don't understand how anybody could think of otherwise about
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.960]  Ron Paul he's got a very long record he does not he doesn't sell out this is not
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.240]  Ron Paul this is why by the way he's never had a big political career you know
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.680]  you do he he he doesn't take he doesn't do that you scratch my back I'll scratch
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.480]  yours sort of thing of regular politics he's not a regular politician he's
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.240]  unique and for those of people who want to be involved in politics I I make an
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.200]  exception for Ron but otherwise I think politics is a snare and a delusion and
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.360]  corrupt and corrupting and a horrible part of the government after all so
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:51.440]  therefore you know it's evil but Ron Paul's never been part of that he never
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.280]  has played those games I'll vote for your pork barrel project you vote for my
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.200]  pork barrel project all the stuff that goes on in regular politics he has never
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:04.280]  taken part in it he never would take part in it and that's why you know this
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:08.680]  guy Romney who is the toe he's like the the total opposite of Ron I mean he's a
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.920]  guy for all the concentration camps the torture through all the wars more wars
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.600]  he's a neocon he's a fascist he's a corporate status he's a police status
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.840]  every now he's he has a nice suit that's about all you can say about Romney he's
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:27.080]  got a nice hair too of something I appreciate and other people me too but
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.320]  that's about all you can say for Romney Romney is a monster Mitt Romney is a
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.400]  very bad man Ron Paul is not going to endorse a monster it's just not gonna
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.160]  happen and nobody should think that nobody should worry about it I know
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.960]  you're a classy guy and and and don't want to throw stones but I really want
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.680]  to see Rand rethink this idea that we're gonna change the mainline Republicans
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.160]  by compromising with them I mean I understand what he's saying intellectually
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:59.880]  politically but also I understand that that way leads to ruin that's that's
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.200]  how you join the dark side and what you said about Mitt Romney I mean he makes
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:09.000]  Bill Clinton look truthful I mean he is such an incredible not even a flip-flop
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.760]  or he is a total deceiver and again I'm not gonna support Obama or him it's so
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.800]  crazy I mean you understand why people are pretty upset right now because I
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:25.360]  understand Rand is not Ron but but Rand was sold to us like he was well I don't
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.160]  know if you if I think if people have paid attention to what Rand said about
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.800]  himself you know he said from the very beginning I'm not a libertarian he's
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.160]  of course a far more traditional politician than his dad and I'm sure
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.960]  he's the best guy in the Senate and we should compare him to you know Jim
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:46.480]  DeMint or Chuck Schumer or people like that nobody compares there's only one
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:51.120]  Ron Paul Ron Paul is unique in all of American history and all and I notice you
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.360]  know there are other candidates congressional candidates and other
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.000]  people who claim to be another Ron Paul but he is the most famous congressman
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.440]  ever now well of course he is but he's never had a normal political career
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:08.240]  because he doesn't play these games why doesn't Rand see that well Rand's a
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.520]  you know he's a different person but you're asking me why isn't Rand his dad
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.760]  well he's not his dad nobody's his dad and we have to judge Rand on his own
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.360]  well you know I respect my dad I try to be like my father I don't I don't
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.560]  have a great wonderful father why wouldn't you want to be like your
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.000]  father I don't know why I must say I had a great wonderful father too and I do
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.120]  my best to live up to the example he said in fact my first political memory is
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.400]  of my dad putting a taff for president button on my coat so my dad was a
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.440]  strong calf for public and the sort of the Ron Paul of it of an earlier time
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:46.680]  although not as good as Ron but more like Ron well stay there
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:51.680]  Rand does respect his dad okay good Lou Rockwell stay there Lou Rockwell.com

[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.440]  well hardly anybody out there in the world other than like Ron Paul's family
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.000]  knows him better than Lou Rockwell as former chief of staff that is great
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.560]  news Lou that you're saying that Ron Paul will not be endorsing Mitt Romney
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.160]  and also little birds are telling me that there are moves to clean up campaign
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:47.400]  for liberty that has got some people up at the top of it that would like to move
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:52.960]  things more towards the mainline Republican front well Ron you know as
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.760]  you know it's tough to say what issue has been the most important to him
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.640]  obviously the Fed has been very important Austrian economics has been
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.080]  ever been very important but the issue that's closest to his heart is the
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:08.160]  issue of war and peace you know the millions of people murdered in in just
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.960]  these recent wars you know who knows how many have been murdered throughout
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.040]  history and so this is a this is a man of peace he's dedicated to peace he's an
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.480]  undergraduate interventionist in foreign policy he's opposing you know the
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:23.240]  neocons next war and want to murder everybody in Syria and they want to
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.320]  murder everybody in Iran who knows where they want to turn their murder guns
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:32.200]  next so again you can you know we can count on Ron Paul whether it there may
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.800]  be some people who are not interested in these issues I think that's highly
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.480]  unfortunate I agree with Murray Rothbard the question of war and peace is the key
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:44.200]  issue especially when the wars are going on it's what grows the state it was
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.720]  it's what suppresses dissent and of course it builds mountain your mountains
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:54.200]  of corpses so Ron Paul is dedicated to that issue and I think it's unfortunate
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.680]  there are people who aren't foreign policy is so important obviously the
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:03.320]  domestic policy is important all the fascist policies of the government and
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:06.880]  all the other things were on were on fights against but he is a broad
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:11.600]  spectrum guy and he's he's right that you know that all these things are so
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:17.280]  important again the Fed monetary policy what the banksters do to us the growing
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:24.080]  state states rights rights rights absolutely decentralism my own view
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.720]  of course the US government the US the United States is far too big you
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.960]  Aristotle thought that if you had more than 50,000 citizens you would lose your
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.480]  liberty in a in a city-state certainly you can't have a free country the size
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.560]  of the US it can't it can't work when you have a government seeking to control
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:45.560]  and a territory the size of the US then of course it's you know it brings on
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:50.320]  tyranny so yeah the in my view I'm not speaking for Ron Paul of course I think
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.520]  the US broken up I'd like to see the state separate even the states are
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.600]  probably too big I'd like to live in you know in a city-state myself so the
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:04.400]  smaller the governments Hans Hoppe makes this point about Germany before the
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.920]  Treaty of Westphalia when they were like 700 700 little political entities that
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.160]  that comprise Germany they all had the same language and much of the same
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:17.000]  culture and so forth the same sort of national identity but they were but
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.040]  they were politically separate that's freedom I mean that's that's the way it
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:23.760]  ought to be there's a historically it sounds radical but it's not it creates
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:29.360]  firewalls to tyranny and it creates diversity of choice and so I mean look
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.200]  at how New York's trying to get lost past federally where everybody has to
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:37.280]  raise their taxes that's what the UN wants with the OECD that's what the New
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.920]  World Order is is a global government to have total control so there's nowhere
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.400]  to run no that's right that's because what the EU is all about about creating a
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.760]  the horrifying notion of the United States of Europe where everybody's
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:53.640]  conglomerated and then they of course want to combine the America and the
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.400]  United States and the EU and Japan this is of course David Rockefeller's
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.600]  original dream into the nucleus of a world government and then bring
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.040]  everybody else under the the power of this world government sure this is what
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:09.080]  they want this is the exact opposite of liberty it's the opposite of a
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.240]  civilization it's they want worldwide Keynesianism which unfortunately they
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.280]  pretty much gotten this why we have a worldwide depression or recession right
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.720]  now so yeah the fight for states rights which Ron Paul is just great on and
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:27.520]  decentralism is is the fight for is the fight for liberty I totally agree with
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.960]  you we're going to break in a few minutes here but I think it's good we're
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.920]  having this debate with Rand and Ron and all this because it really is a
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.480]  about the people in the final equation and if we're not there telling Ron Paul
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.860]  and ran what we believe in especially with Rand it's going to let other
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:49.560]  influences come in so I see all of this is healthy well sure I mean of course we
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:55.080]  want to tell tell our the people that we like what we like and if we
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:58.560]  disagree with something and Ron has always been very open to hearing from
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.560]  people who disagree with them it's one of the reasons you know this is an odd
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.240]  say to think of a thing to say about Ron Paul he's a great politician in this
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:11.740]  sense in the old days when he ran for Congress he would wear out three or
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:16.080]  four pairs of shoes walking door-to-door meeting people he loves talking to
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.920]  people he loves hearing objections and answering them he loves hearing cuz
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.120]  where people agree with them but where they don't agree with them too so you
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.440]  know it's important of course we have to let people know what we think you and I
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.720]  hear from people who agree with us and don't agree with us too and we like
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.960]  that as well this is exactly it's a government that doesn't want to have
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.960]  that feedback long segment coming up we're gonna cover a host of issues with

[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.480]  that's how they operate we're not ever supposed to in the free market build our
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:30.200]  own system and vote with our dollars but that's a side issue the point is is
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.240]  that go to info wars.com because Ron Paul talked about why you don't vote for
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:40.120]  the lesser two evils and how Bill Clinton's mentor Herald Quigley at
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.800]  Georgetown wrote a book about the elite that he endorsed they let him in the
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.400]  Bilderberg archives 1,400 pages long I've actually read almost the whole thing
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.000]  be honest there's a few pages I skipped a little boring history lessons
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.560]  tragedy and hope it's back in print he's believing that he's dead he's not
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.120]  glad it's back in print because they didn't want the public reading this
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:04.120]  available at info wars.com discounted it gets a free citizen rulebook with
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.360]  every order and back in print as they sold out all the ones that were printed
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.640]  back in the 70s none dare call it conspiracy the book that crystallized
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:18.000]  my awakening at about 13 years old when a couple these were on the bookshelf
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.520]  because one of my dad's John Burt society buddies was always bringing them by and I
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.960]  pulled it off the shelf and read it and already read so much history I was a
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:30.600]  kind of a bookworm slash jock but the point is that it all made sense and
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.040]  that's what created much of what who Alex Jones is today it's back in print a

[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.960]  Austin Texas 78760 let's play a minute or so Iran Paul talking about tragedy and
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.800]  hope and what Carol quickly said about the lesser of two evils and how the
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:08.600]  system tries to control the left and the right and then we'll get the take on
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:14.600]  that from iconic libertarian and I guess anarchic capitalist you could call
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:19.800]  him Lou Rockwell here in just a moment but here's Ron Paul from his concession
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.360]  speech or what have you talking about would he join a third party back in
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:32.400]  2008 he didn't endorse John McCain here it is you know quite a few years ago when
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:37.680]  I think it was when Bill Clinton was inaugurated was it one of his speeches
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:43.760]  he recognized one single individual as being very important to him
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:49.520]  philosophically and that was a bit of surprise because I knew about the
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:53.720]  individual and some of you may know about him but it's worth looking into
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:59.160]  and his name was Carol quickly he wrote the book tragedy and hope now the
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:05.800]  important part of tragedy and hope and Carol quickly is that he claims that he
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:13.160]  was on the inside and part of the group that you know did the planning but why
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:18.360]  do you write tragedy and hope to expose these people behind the scenes because
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.760]  he believed they were far enough advanced it didn't have to be secret
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:27.360]  they could be out in the open and this is the way it works it's a tragedy if you
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.200]  don't accept this and there's hope if you know who runs the show that's this
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.920]  that's my interpretation but I believe it's correct but let me read a quote from
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:42.640]  him and thinking about where he's coming from he says the argument that the two
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:48.000]  parties should represent opposed ideals and policies one perhaps the right of
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.920]  the right and the other of the left is a foolish idea acceptable only to the
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.320]  doctrinaire on academic thinkers instead the two parties should be almost
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.360]  identical so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:07.200]  without leading to any profound or extensive shift in policy I mean I
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:14.240]  think that is profound statement because it tells us what's going on and why
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:21.120]  things don't change all right there you go well here today again your take on
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.000]  what Ron Paul said four years ago I mean that says it all and what's your view on
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.800]  this whole global corporate monopoly man system of course Carol Quigley was
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.480]  exactly right very influential professor at Georgetown University for many years
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:42.120]  and as Ron mentioned Clinton cited him and thanked him in his acceptance speech
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.920]  of the Democratic Convention but it's absolutely true and we just have to look
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.520]  at the two parties the two parties are identical as Butler Schaefer says two
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.920]  wings of the same bird of prey they're both part of the government that's why
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.920]  they can't be taken over by the way it's not any more possible to take over
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.400]  the Republican Party than you take over the Department of Justice and they're
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.600]  part of their evil they're part of the government but yes they're both set up to
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:09.000]  be slightly different rhetorically but in policies exactly the same Mitt Romney
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.240]  is a Goldman Sachs guy Barack Obama is a Goldman Sachs guy Barack Obama's for
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.040]  all these wars Mitt Romney's for all these words are both for the police state
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.600]  and so forth so this is why we have a two-party system it's why they don't want
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.360]  multiple parties and it's why there's you know there's no except in style
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:29.120]  there's no difference this is not this is not an accident it's deliberate it's
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:33.280]  the it's why they love democracy one of the many reasons they love democracy
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:39.360]  been a great thing for the for the growth of the state that everybody thinks
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:46.040]  Hans Hoppe's great book on democracy the God that failed is the key guide to why
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.240]  democracy as it's developed is just an instrument for the state to use against
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:54.440]  the rest of us and quickly of course is very important to read I'm so glad you
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:58.600]  bring Gary Allen's book back into print Gary Allen was a very great man great
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:04.800]  writer and this is a good this is a wonderful book out Alex so these are
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.640]  all things worth reading and as usual as you point out in this in this in this
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.760]  YouTube from Ron he's always worth listening to that's true today it was
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:18.360]  true 30 or 40 years ago was true when he first got into public life in reaction
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.760]  to Richard Nixon's closing of the gold window and imposing price and wage
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:30.000]  controls on the economy in 1971 he's the same guy and he's a sure guide to all
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.400]  this sort of thing and you look him up on YouTube of all these he's got many
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.040]  many YouTube's from all his earlier campaigns from his congressional
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:44.760]  speeches they're all worth listening to and he's just a very but again don't
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:49.000]  expect anybody else to be Ron Paul there's only been one Ron Paul and I
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.880]  would say that even though I support Ron Paul in all his and everything he does
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.960]  in terms of his political races politics is a snare and a delusion I mean it's
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.600]  there's only one Ron Paul there's gonna not maybe there will be somebody else in
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.200]  the future we can't rule it out but there's but only one of these guys in
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.240]  200 years so they don't come along very often and we should appreciate what we've
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:13.160]  got we should support him read him author of many important books it's also a
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:16.800]  great intellectual I mean this again set that separates him he's a reader
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.520]  separates him from the people in politics who aren't readers who aren't
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:23.640]  it'll I gotta tell you I've interviewed Ron tells him to do I mean I've
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.040]  interviewed Ron more than 150 times or so it might even be 200 recount on the
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:32.920]  road my crew asking him questions and and and my report is probably more than
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.240]  200 you can ask him something that just broke that day that's pretty obscure and
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.120]  he knows about it I don't think I've ever brought anything up to him that he
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.360]  didn't already know about and then he'll know about stuff I don't know about I
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.880]  mean I he's just such a voracious researcher it's like even in that piece
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.800]  where the Sasha bear a cone and tries to corner him in there in the room Ron
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.200]  Paul sitting there reading the newspaper I mean I guess that's all he's doing is
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.640]  researching he reads all the time he's got a huge person a library he's read it
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:10.120]  all I mean he's he's read the our enemies he's read all the good guys it's
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.560]  why he's actual and he doesn't you know he's a he's a medical doctor but he
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.240]  might as well be an Austrian economist who he's read everything he's read the
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.920]  thoroughly in history and in in the political philosophy and many many
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:27.280]  different areas investments and so forth I mean he really is he's he really is a
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.800]  Renaissance man and he's he's so different from the other people in the
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.280]  Congress I mean you can't he's he's he stands out like a healthy thumb not a
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:42.000]  sore thumb among all those boobs and creeps and crooks and morons and
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.200]  criminals that compose the US government I mean he really is you know
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.640]  he's and he's the minister in the whore house or something I mean he just so
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.880]  different from the rest of them and so there's just just one run
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.920]  Lou I want to shift gears into a bunch of subjects and also ask you which number
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:07.120]  one on your plate your radar right now but you know I get this from people who
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.000]  are on the left they understand the corruption of government but they
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  always think they can fix it they talk about the American system but you go
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.040]  real you go research it you know a lot of that government involved that is
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:22.080]  actually what ends up causing the civil war you actually go back and look at
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:26.040]  some of the people that were involved in it I mean you just ask for it the bigger
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.480]  the government the worse the society and then I see the criticism oh Ron Paul
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:35.360]  wants you to be high he wants you to be on drugs because of drug decriminalization
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.040]  but every drug dealer I've seen interviewed says don't ever legalize them
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.640]  because that would drive down the price probably 500 to a thousand percent I
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.000]  mean this is two-year-old level information to understand and Republicans
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.600]  attacking and say he wants you to be on drugs Democrats attacking but you see
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.080]  the American people I mean even Pat Robertson says decriminalized marijuana
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:00.160]  now I mean it really seems that people are starting to get it and that some of
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:03.760]  the European countries as you know that have decriminalized it have seen more
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:09.360]  than 50% reductions in drug use it takes the money it takes the glamor out of it
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:13.680]  it takes the poisonous stuff that gets mixed with the street garbage look at
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.200]  alcohol tripled in use corruption bloomed during nine years of prohibition
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.400]  I mean isn't this an idea whose time has come and what do you see the critics
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.480]  doing trying to demonize Ron Paul yourself myself and others that that
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.040]  want decriminalization well of course that demonization is the word and you
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.920]  know if if there's anybody anybody should be able to tell about Ron Paul he's
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:40.600]  Mr. Straight I mean he's not he doesn't use drugs it's very in he only started
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.240]  to have an occasional glass of wine when he was no longer in medical practice I
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:50.160]  mean this is this guy is so straight and so normal and so regular and and so
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:54.320]  principle he's never used drugs in fact he he's done a lot of work in his
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:58.880]  medical career to try to help people get off drugs if they want to but he
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.120]  understands that first of all as Mises pointed out we have the right to decide
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:06.680]  what we put in our bodies this is not somebody else's decision to make we as
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.880]  adults have this right and we know that a lot of stuff that the government
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.560]  promotes as wonderful for us high fructose corn syrup and go right down the
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.200]  list of all the horrible things that they promote are actually very bad for us
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:22.240]  probably far worse than smoking a marijuana cigarette and things like
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.760]  marijuana are actually very good for many medical conditions but that again
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:29.840]  people as a matter of the control of their own bodies control of their own
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:33.200]  lives have the right to do what they want to do but because the government we
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.560]  always have to remember the government is never I don't want to shock anybody
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.440]  the government's not a charitable organization the government doesn't
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.480]  actually care about you they want your money and they want power over you so
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.000]  this is why they want the drug war they also make vast amounts from all the
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  bribes they get from from from the drug dealers but I think more and more
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.200]  Americans are realizing especially on the medicinal marijuana question but on
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:58.320]  many other related issues that they don't want the government running this
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:02.240]  it's made things far worse look at the destroying mexico right now with the
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:08.440]  bush in force drug war and obama and forced drug war and in mexico fifty
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:11.880]  thousand people dead the whole country being wrecked our country has been
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.720]  largely wrecked and because it doesn't keep drugs out the people who are love
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.200]  the drug world say well what you want to have drugs they can't keep drugs out of
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:23.760]  the federal prisons let alone let alone excuse me let alone out of any other
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.600]  place well exactly I mean they're they promote drugs use they promote drug use
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:34.920]  yeah they're the ones making it in more valuable than gold I mean it's it's it's
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:40.560]  just a no-brainer you decriminalize it takes the money out of it and crime
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:47.800]  rates just absolutely plunge expanding on this Lou has it ever been more obvious
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.560]  that government is gearing up for war with the people I want to get your take
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:55.280]  on admitted reeducation camps the army admitted the document we got a month
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:58.600]  ago was accurate they said it's classified we you know getting trouble
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:03.200]  we're bad to have it they're admitting that torture obama says he'll kill
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:08.700]  whoever he wants they're announcing local police to have the army the the
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:13.080]  secretary of the army has put on a CFR report saying we want to have army to
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:19.240]  respond as SWAT teams in every town regular army we're seeing 30,000 armed
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.040]  drones we're seeing the head of the CIA come out two months ago and say yes all
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:27.400]  the new tech has back doors we're watching and listening to you without
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:33.240]  warrants I mean it's even blowing me away just how criminal it's like they're
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.880]  going crazy is this an attempt to intimidate us because they know we're
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:40.720]  waking up or is this just an orgy of control freaks that think they're
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.760]  unstoppable I want your expert opinion on that Lou Rockwell well I think they
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:48.680]  are you know they are control freaks of course everybody who goes into government
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.120]  especially the people who rise in government are like this they like
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.800]  hurting people they like controlling people and they want of course our money
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:00.120]  but they they're mostly they have what sent a gustin called the lust for power
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:06.120]  the libido dominante they want to rule others they they lust to rule others
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.920]  they they lust to kill these are bad people these are not like your next-door
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:15.640]  neighbor people in government are bad people but unfortunately every good
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:18.960]  what we point out every government would like to be a totalitarian government
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.160]  if they could get away with it it's only the people's opposition that prevents
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.800]  it and after the the whole business of nine eleven the american people's
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.560]  opposition to government tyranny dramatically reduced because they became
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.280]  terrified of the muslims under the bed and all the rest of the baloney so when
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.640]  they when that happened the government just expands like an evil balloon to
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:44.840]  take over everything and at the big of the government gets more torturers and
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.640]  people who just love feeling up at the airport i mean the that this is the
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.280]  government and so we're in a fight for our lives of course on the other hand i
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:55.960]  think and ron paul shows us with the millions of kids that he's brought into
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:00.760]  our movement more more opposition is springing up to this so there's the
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.760]  normal battle which goes on through all of history between what murray roth bar
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.920]  called power and market between the private society and the violence the
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:13.400]  violent violence promoters we have the vibe the people who use violence some of
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:17.240]  them we call criminals the muggers murderers rapists and burglars and so
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.480]  forth others we call the government although they have exactly the same
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:25.640]  moral compass as the murderers the rapists and the burglars and so this is
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.520]  the great fight so this is the fight we're engaged in we have to first of all
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.200]  learn learn from people like you alex there to read the great books books of
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:38.480]  mesis and roth barred and all the great the great austrian economists the great
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:43.000]  libertarians and understand why the government is our enemy what we can do
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.680]  about it but the first thing is we have to change ourselves to become opponents
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.240]  of all of this intellectual opponents withdraw our consent don't you know
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:54.800]  laugh at the government explain to others about government lies and of course
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.000]  every word that comes out of them their mouths is a lie so these people these
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.120]  people are our enemy not some alleged a terrorist in yemen people in washington
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.200]  are enemies they want us they want every bit of control over our lives we see
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:13.600]  1984 orwell's novel coming true right before our eyes all the stuff that I
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.800]  fought all my life you too alex we see it happening at just an unbelievable pace
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:23.920]  right now but still they need the people's consent but why is it going
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.040]  into overdrive I mean I know historically corruption gets to a point
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.080]  always does this and generally that's when you get liberty back if you're not
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:35.880]  totally destroyed but I mean this is cartoon level the ridiculous lying in
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:41.440]  city after city it turns out they hire the head TSA person is convicted
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:46.280]  pedophiles are deep rocked priests and and and just the crimes and the
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:51.040]  trillions every year stolen at the Pentagon and and and CIA aircraft they
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.840]  have the troops line up and admit they're growing the opium to desensitize
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:58.280]  people you know because they had to kill Pat Tillman because he spoke out I mean
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:03.280]  it's it's so ridiculous and I wonder what's coming next I mean they've gone
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:09.960]  crazy well one thing we can be sure of there is nothing beyond them if they
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:13.240]  decide not to do some horrendous thing to us it's only because they haven't
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.840]  thought of it or they can't get it organized because they're the government
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:19.520]  or they think it's not in their interest but this bunch would never say oh
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.000]  we can't do that because it would be wrong that is never that is never a
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.400]  consideration so we can expect the worst from them it's why we have to be the
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.520]  best why we have to arm ourselves why we have to you know what as I said laugh
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:39.640]  at them deny them undermine them subvert them and every way we can funny you
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.360]  say that because every time we put up a TSA video making fun of them YouTube
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:48.400]  bans it but they'll let us put up anything else against them but but
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.040]  literally they do not like being made fun of no no and this is a this is an
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:57.720]  ancient point that the prince can take almost anything except being laughed at
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:01.680]  when they laugh at the government you know they that's why they ban jokes at
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:05.880]  the airport you can you know you can actually go to jail for telling a joke
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:11.360]  in the land of the First Amendment so yeah we but again you have to you have
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:15.520]  to first educate yourself as Albert J. Knox said about the one thing you can do
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:19.320]  for the human race is presented with one improved unit you have to make
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.000]  yourself better you make yourself better by learning more not what you get in the
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.880]  government schools or from the government media or the government
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.120]  press releases all the the columnists and so what they're doing the other but
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:33.120]  promoting the government line you have to be radically different you have to
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:37.520]  understand what Murray Rothbard said that the state is a gang of thieves writ
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:42.000]  large if you understand that if you understand if you understand the nature
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.880]  of government you understand that it not only doesn't have your best interest
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:48.440]  at heart it's your enemy it's the enemy of your children it's the enemy of your
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:52.040]  future see any of all your descendants it's the enemy of everything you believe
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:56.120]  in see any of your religion it's the enemy of your community your home your
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:01.800]  business it is the enemy so not these guys overseas not the alleged terrorists
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:06.160]  the the actual the people who were terrorizing you well I was about to say
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:09.480]  let you know your money it's the government sure I mean let's just say
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:14.520]  Al Qaeda related 9-11 all Easter bunnies are you know real all of this okay let's
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:18.600]  say it's real you got a better chance of a honeybee killing you that they've done
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:23.360]  national news stories on that then then these people but then it's in the LA
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:27.400]  Times and it's in the Associated Press in the back of the paper that Al Qaeda in
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:33.080]  Al Qaeda uniforms with Al Qaeda patches and flags took over Libya murdered people
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:38.000]  in mass Obama said bombing is a peace operation not war you know the peace
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:43.600]  prize winner again it's like dark satire it's like a Kurt Vonnegut novel and now
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:49.160]  they're using Al Qaeda to go in and bomb Syria blow-up police stations Hillary
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:52.360]  lies and says Russia's sending them helicopters turns out that's a lie I
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:58.560]  mean it's crazy that the government is using Al Qaeda as their jihadi brigade
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:02.880]  as they did against the Russians back in the 80s and then I'm told give my
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:06.760]  rights up let them grope my wife and children at the airport for people that
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:10.680]  work for them publicly well sure and of course and as you mentioned the whole
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:15.280]  Syria thing is a trick I mean it's it's the CIA and the Mossad funding these
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:21.200]  various so-called rebels who were trying to you know overthrow the last non
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:26.400]  Islamic if fundamentalist government in the Arab world the last secular Arab
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:31.960]  government they did in Iraq and Al Qaeda is coming in the U.S. like any Empire
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:37.280]  you know as the Romans used to say divide and rule divide and conquer so they
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.000]  want to happen in Libya the U.S. supported Al Qaeda in the in the war
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.440]  against the Russians in Afghanistan supported as some have been locked and
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.600]  so they're using them again in Syria but there's a there's a similar group
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.000]  they're funding in Iran to cause various terrorists incident I know you know this
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.960]  but people can even see in the Washington Post from like 15 years ago it's so
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:03.800]  amazing that on top of all this the billions were spent over the decades
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.840]  paying for the textbook saying kill Americans jihad this they our government
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:12.440]  funded the radical madrasas because they don't want the Arabs who invented
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.440]  mathematics and science to become industrialized to compete they want a
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:20.400]  bunch of crazy guys you know the bad guys in Team America running around I
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.960]  mean imagine the magnitude of that well and then you know they want to do the
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:27.440]  Arabs what they want to do the rest of us this this and so they want the Arabs
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:31.520]  backward they want them ill-educated they want them economically backward and
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:36.080]  so that you know in order to control them control the oil and and to break up
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:40.080]  all the countries in the Middle East this is the open neocon plan and the
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:45.080]  there was issued before the year before the before Bush's first Iraq war they
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:47.640]  want to break up all these Muslim countries the better to control them
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.240]  and again to control all the oil this is what the U.S. would like to do
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:54.000]  everywhere the Romans pull the same thing this is nothing new I'm sure the
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.600]  Assyrians or the Babylonians and the Egyptians and all the other empires did
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:01.680]  it and America of course is not a republic it's an empire we're not a
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.240]  free country anymore we're a semi free country we're not the richest country in
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.320]  the world or you know they can all raise the foam finger number one all they
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.520]  want we're not the we're not we're not exceptional we're regular people this is
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:18.360]  not the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the human race and all
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:21.080]  the rest of that nonsense Switzerland I mean there are a lot of other great
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.720]  countries in the world there have been many great countries every civilization
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:27.600]  has got good things about it every civilization good bad things about it
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.960]  but the the notion that all this you know constant all this tyranny is what
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.760]  America were the greatest and we can kill everybody because we're the best and
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:41.240]  God has blessed us and you know all that sort of stuff has been an unfortunate
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:44.800]  unfortunate thread throughout of American history kill all the Indians
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.960]  because you know they were savages and so forth so this is this is they've been
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:52.400]  bad this bad stuff in every country including in America we're not the best
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:56.800]  people in the world it's it's just pride right it's it's a it's a sin of pride
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:00.800]  it's and it's very dangerous and if the typical American feels we can kill
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:03.560]  everybody all over the world and then there are there are astonished that
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:06.800]  maybe people don't like that don't like having their families their children
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.640]  butchered and this is why we're hated we as a country I shouldn't say we the US
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:16.880]  government is hated all over the world hated no American realizes this we're
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:21.640]  hated and this is why when the dollar goes down we're gonna see some I'm
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:24.920]  so we're gonna see some interesting developments in terms of other countries
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:29.760]  you know but he hates being under the US yoke they don't like it and and every
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:33.760]  decent American should hate being under the yoke of DC himself or herself as
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:37.480]  well and DC itself has been captured by the mega bankers I'm gonna put you on
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:41.040]  the spot we've got a little bit late today we got a one-minute break I want
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.520]  to come back with five final minutes on what you think is happening in Europe
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:48.640]  where you think that's gonna go how we don't let them use the crisis that's
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.280]  coming is Ron Paul said a decade ago as you said over a decade ago from becoming
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.840]  total government in you know instead of using it to reduce all this tyranny but
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:01.040]  we're going to break in a minute what else is important on your radar screen
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:05.440]  Lou Rockwell a little Rockwell.com well it's of course all the stuff you know
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:11.440]  Alex that you talk about I mean about the police state the drones I was glad to
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:15.240]  see I was glad to see Rand Paul introduce a bill but if they're gonna have
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:18.440]  to send a drone to spy on you they got to have a search warrant because there are
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:22.760]  no search warrants there aren't you know they did we live in a we live in an
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:27.360]  authoritarian society we're moving towards totalitarianism but nevertheless we
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.460]  can object to it it's actually possible to stop it we don't have to become
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:35.640]  slaves although that's of course the way things are headed. Stay there back in one
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:41.800]  minute with five more minutes of Lou Rockwell then Gary Johnson you are

[01:59:53.480 --> 02:00:00.920]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:12.920]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:21.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:29.920]  Alright, we got Lou Rockwell of LouRockwell.com with us for five more minutes and he was bringing up what's happening in Europe.
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:33.920]  I mean, I was reading. They're saying you can come into Europe, but you can't leave.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:38.920]  We're going to search you. We're going to take your money. ATM withdrawals will be restricted.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:42.920]  And I heard this from sources. Well, Bob Chapman, State Department sources.
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:49.920]  You're in a half ago. The TSA is acting like this now on the highways. They admit that's going to be their mission.
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.920]  I mean, at a certain point, I avoid the airports now with my family, but I mean, if they try to pull me over and
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:02.920]  grope my family as a symbol of my submission to them, my prisoner training, I don't know what I'm going to do at this point, Lou.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:06.920]  What's your take on what's happening in Europe and anything else on your radar?
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:14.920]  Pick up on your last point. We've already had a number of cases where people's cash has been confiscated from them.
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:20.920]  The cops stop them and this is their own cash. They've earned it, honestly.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:26.920]  But yeah, the government doesn't want you to have it. I would say always do the opposite of what the government wants you to do.
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:33.920]  And whether you're a European or an American, I hope to goodness everybody has got some significant amount of cash outside of the banks.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:40.920]  Of course, you ought to have gold and silver as well as the key part of your investments, but you ought to have some cash.
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:45.920]  It's always fun to take cash out of the bank. They hate it. It's a fun thing to go and take it.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.920]  They don't want you to do it and it's because they pyramid on it. They inflate on top of it.
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:55.920]  So you're helping all of society as well as yourself when you take some money out of the bank.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:02.920]  And I hope people in Europe are doing this. And of course, we've seen this in Argentina and other places where ATM withdrawals have indeed been restricted.
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:11.920]  And so take that as a signal. What's happening in Europe? Well, everybody is being crucified for the sake of the banks.
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:16.920]  They talk about bailing out Greece. You know, they're not bailing out Greece. Spain is not being bailed out.
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:21.920]  I was glad at least Spain did things a little more honestly this time. The money went directly to the banks.
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:27.920]  It didn't even go through the government. So all this is about bailing out the banks and not Greece being bailed out or whatever.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:34.920]  And the higher taxes and so forth being forced on these countries, it's to pay off the banks, all the banks that hold the government debt.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:45.920]  And there's no way to do it, by the way. There's going to have to be a default. There's not enough productivity in the whole world to undo what these rotten banks have done,
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:52.920]  these fractional reserve banksters who are in league with the government, same in our own country. They're very, very powerful.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:03:00.920]  Europe and the United States are sort of bankocracies. We saw when Jamie Dimon was testifying before the Senate committee the other day,
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:10.920]  and they're all bowing and scraping before him. The Senators were slamming Jamie Dimon because, of course, it is the big banks that are in control.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:18.920]  But one thing, first of all, you need to educate yourself about banking. Murray Rothbard's great book, The Mystery of Banking, I can't recommend.
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:24.920]  You don't need to be an economist. It's so well written, so easily, oh, so easy to read and so informative.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:30.920]  You'll understand for the first time in your life what banking is about and what's wrong with the current state of banking.
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:37.920]  But again, take your money out of the bank. Deal as much as you can in cash. You know they hate it.
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:45.920]  Oh, they want the cashless society so they can like Bank of America force fees on $5 every time you use your own bank card.
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:55.920]  We just lost Lou's Skype there for just a moment. We'll see if he's able to come back up. If not, that was a powerful interview with Lou Rockwell,
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:03.920]  bluerockwell.com, and I totally agree with him on the Ron Paul thing. There's no way he's going to be endorsing Mitt Romney.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:09.920]  And people that say, hey, get behind the Republicans, Obama's bad. Look, the whole system's a fraud. We got to stop playing games.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:16.920]  The reason I supported Ron Paul is because, okay, he's back. We got one minute to say bye. Thank you so much, Lou Rockwell.
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:19.920]  What, how do we support Lou Rockwell.com?

[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:49.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:05:08.920]  All right, we'll be back with Governor Gary Johnson running for president as a libertarian. Hopefully Ron Paul will endorse him. We'll be right back.

[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:04.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:10.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are,
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:19.920]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:28.920]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:35.920]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:40.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:45.920]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:51.920]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:59.920]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.920]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:14.920]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:18.920]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:30.920]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:39.920]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:45.920]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:52.920]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:08:21.920]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:27.920]  Well, Governor Gary Johnson joins us for the next 52 minutes.
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:39.920]  We will take a few calls starting at the bottom of the hour if you'd like to talk to Governor Johnson specifically on policies, issues, election 2012, how you can support him.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:46.920]  He is the Libertarian Presidential Nominee and Candidate for 2012 for President.
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:52.920]  And Governor Johnson has been referred to as the most fiscally conservative governor in the country.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:57.920]  He was the Republican Governor of New Mexico from 95 to 2003.
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:01.920]  He is best known for his veto record, which includes over 750 vetoes.
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:04.920]  So he's kind of like a Ron Paul-style governor.
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:09.920]  But he's also for decriminalization of marijuana, a lot of other issues.
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:28.920]  He is a true Libertarian in every sense of the word and I hope Ron Paul endorses him because Ron Paul endorsed Chuck Baldwin for the Constitution Party four years ago when it was clear Ron Paul couldn't win because of media demonization and cheating and things like that.
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:32.920]  Same thing happened this time, but he had even more support.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:44.920]  Rand has created a firestorm by supporting Mitt Romney and let me tell you that is again the night and day compared to somebody like Governor Johnson.
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:54.920]  It's not just that he endorsed some Republican ladies and gentlemen, it's Mitt Romney who changes like a weather vane who constantly flip-flops, who wrote what became Obamacare.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:57.920]  I don't want to get into a rant.
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:10.920]  The point is, is that you'll never build a third party, you'll never break the stranglehold of the Crips and the Bloods, the Republicans and the Democrats as Ventura calls them, if we don't start changing things.
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:12.920]  And he should be in the national debates.
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:23.920]  It shouldn't just be Mitt Romney and Obama, both paid for by Goldman Sachs, who have different rhetoric, ones against gay marriage, ones for it.
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:29.920]  Total football issue that they just bring up to distract people, regardless of which side of that you're on.
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:39.920]  And we're going to get Governor Johnson's take on all this, his policies and more, joining us via video Skype if you're watching at prisonplanet.tv or listening on XM-166 or other systems.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:54.920]  Sir, obviously I want to get into your campaign, but what do you make and what have your supporters made of Rand Paul coming out and endorsing Mitt Romney?
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:03.920]  And are you obviously hoping that Ron Paul will endorse you and swing his huge, huge grassroots of tens of millions towards you?
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:12.920]  Well, Alex, I was asked for Ron Paul's endorsement by Ron Paul in 2008.
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:15.920]  I readily gave that endorsement.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:24.920]  And when I dropped out of the Republican Party, a Republican process here running for president, I asked all my supporters, hey, support Ron Paul.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:30.920]  So I'm a Ron Paul fan, I think by his own admission, he's not going to get the nomination.
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:33.920]  So where does his support go?
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:35.920]  I'd love to have his support.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:38.920]  I think that what he and I are saying are the same.
[02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:44.920]  Look, I think it's important that I am in the national debates against Romney and Obama.
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:48.920]  I'm going to be the only candidate that doesn't want to bomb Iran.
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.920]  I'm going to be the only candidate that wants to get out of Afghanistan now, bring home the troops.
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:12:04.920]  I'm the only candidate that's advocating, I'm promising to submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013, believing that if we don't fix our budget,
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:09.920]  that if we don't spend within our means, we're going to find ourselves in the midst of a monetary collapse.
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:13.920]  And what that is, is that the money that we have doesn't buy a thing.
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.920]  And I don't see life in America as very pleasant when the money that we have doesn't buy a thing.
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:25.920]  And Ron Paul needs to endorse you sooner rather than later.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.920]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I'm not expecting his endorsement.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:31.920]  So we're not asking for it.
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:33.920]  I'm not expecting it.
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:37.920]  But that said, it's about his supporter.
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:43.920]  It's about everybody listening, I think, and everybody listening having a voice.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:46.920]  And I'm presenting myself as that voice.
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:48.920]  But it's a no brainer.
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:53.920]  He didn't endorse John McCain that he can't endorse Mitt Romney.
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:59.920]  He's got to, he was a libertarian presidential candidate in 88, as you know.
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:01.920]  Well, I know that.
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:06.920]  And I think there's a rand coming out and endorsing Romney.
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:12.920]  I mean, that's all about politics and somehow staying part of the Republican Party.
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:19.920]  I talked to Republican supporters of Ron Paul in Fort Worth just the other night.
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:24.920]  And they were imploring me to stay within the Republican Party and to work within the Republican Party
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:28.920]  that they had worked really hard to make changes within the Republican Party
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.920]  and wanted those changes to stick.
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.920]  Look, I completely agree with that.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.920]  I applaud all the Ron Paul supporters that have worked so hard to really try and change
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:39.920]  and continue to try and change the Republican Party.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:42.920]  But I'm over the libertarian party.
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:45.920]  There aren't any changes that are going to have to be made.
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:50.920]  Well, if anybody thinks Mitt Romney is going to turn against Goldman Sachs
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:54.920]  and the globalist and all the rest of it, they've got another thing coming.
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:57.920]  I mean, Mitt Romney is going to do what the special interests wanting to do.
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:01.920]  And that's why I'm worried about Rand down the road, because Romney probably will get in.
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:03.920]  You know, you're there basically to inject real issues.
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:06.920]  I wish you would win, but people should get behind you.
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:11.920]  And everybody's turning against Obama right now, barring some big crisis
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:13.920]  or war or staged event.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.920]  I think Obama's toast.
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:15.920]  The writing's on the wall.
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:17.920]  The left is turning against him.
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:19.920]  The establishment's turning against him.
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:22.920]  It's starting to look like a route here of the shark's smell blood.
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:25.920]  And then it's going to be Mitt Romney.
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:28.920]  And Rand Paul now has hitched his wagon to that.
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:31.920]  What's he going to do when Mitt Romney says torture is good,
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:34.920]  NDAA is good, attack Iran is good.
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.920]  I mean, that's what Mitt Romney stands for.
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:39.920]  It is what Mitt Romney stands for.
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:42.920]  Mitt Romney says, hey, let's balance the federal budget.
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:43.920]  But you know what?
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.920]  We need to grow defense spending a little bit.
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:48.920]  And we need to hold Medicare harmless.
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:50.920]  Well, you can't do that.
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.920]  I finished the second grade.
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:55.920]  The mathematics doesn't add up.
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.920]  Look, we need to cut $1.4 trillion from the federal budget now.
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:03.920]  That is a 43% reduction in federal spending.
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.920]  I would be the only candidate if I'm in the debates.
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:12.920]  You know, a libertarian candidate for president, me,
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.920]  I'm going to be on the ballot in all 50 states.
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:17.920]  I think that that is very significant.
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:18.920]  No, I agree.
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:19.920]  I agree.
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:21.920]  Governor, people should get behind you.
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:24.920]  And then the argument, well, that'll just put Obama in.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:26.920]  I don't think that squares with it.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:29.920]  I mean, I think you're going to have a lot of Democrats who are mad
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:32.920]  at Obama as well voting for you.
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:37.920]  Well, really, I come at libertarian candidates and I being a libertarian
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:40.920]  nominee, libertarian nominee for president, me,
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.920]  I'm going to come at Obama hard from the left from a standpoint
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:45.920]  of civil liberties.
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:48.920]  And I'm going to come at Romney hard from the right from the standpoint
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:53.920]  of dollars and cents and balancing the federal budget.
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:57.920]  In the few states where they've actually done an analysis of who
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:00.920]  I take more votes from, I actually take more votes from Obama,
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:06.920]  which doesn't surprise me, but the analysis is somewhat mixed,
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:11.920]  which holds to my belief that I end up taking equally from both parties
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.920]  and I take from a group independence that wouldn't ordinarily vote.
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:19.920]  Well, I think maybe I'm going to give independence a reason to vote
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:22.920]  or I'm going to give a lot of people a reason to vote,
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:27.920]  that their vote would actually be cast in an ideological way that says,
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:32.920]  look, we care about civil liberties and look, we care about a balanced budget.
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:33.920]  Where do you stand?
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.920]  Because Rand Paul is doing some good work saying he's proposing a bill
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:41.920]  protecting Americans from drone surveillance without warrants.
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:42.920]  Well, what about the Pentagon?
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:44.920]  They're not supposed to be domestically involved.
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.920]  And now the head of the army came out in the CFR report two weeks ago
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:52.920]  and said, hey, we want to put troops, armed troops in every city
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:53.920]  to aid the police.
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:59.920]  I mean, this is, I might as well move to Guatemala or Nigeria or Saudi Arabia
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:03.920]  or get the teleport back to Nazi Germany or North Korea right now.
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:07.920]  I mean, just the racing of the CIA director saying,
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:10.920]  we're listening to you without warrants, ha ha ha.
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:13.920]  Why do you think they're going so crazy right now?
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:17.920]  Both political parties like a cancer metastasizing.
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:19.920]  I mean, what's your take on all that?
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:23.920]  Well, it's about electing leaders that aren't standing up to this.
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:26.920]  We need to have a leader stand up against this.
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.920]  I'm going to be the only candidate for president that wants to abolish
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:32.920]  the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:37.920]  This stuff, as you point out, every single day is getting worse, not better.
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:42.920]  And if you think it's going to change electing Romney, you know, you're crazy.
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:46.920]  And of course, this has gotten worse under Obama.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.920]  It's going to continue to get worse under Obama.
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:51.920]  It is absolutely.
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:54.920]  Again, Gary Johnson 2012.com.
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:56.920]  Is that the best website for folks to visit?
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:58.920]  That is the best website to visit.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:17:59.920]  Thank you.
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:00.920]  Oh, you bet.
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.920]  Gary Johnson 2012.com folks.
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.920]  And you win, win, win a protest vote, injecting ideas.
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.920]  He could win.
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.920]  I mean, things have happened like this.
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:16.920]  Regardless, we've got to support somebody from outside the power structure.
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:17.920]  I'm sorry.
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:20.920]  I'm not endorsing Mitt Romney folks, the author of Obamacare, Mr.
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:21.920]  Anti-Gun, any of it.
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.920]  It's not going to happen.
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:24.920]  He loves the drug war.
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:26.920]  He loves, you know, all of it.
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:28.920]  We've got to support somebody else.
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:30.920]  Now, I know they fought to keep you out of debates.
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:31.920]  They fought to keep you.
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:34.920]  The system's scared of you because they know you're a real constitutional
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:38.920]  libertarian, you know, slash old line conservative common sense.
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:39.920]  So they're very, very afraid of you.
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:42.920]  They've tried to really suppress you like they did Ron Paul four years ago.
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:43.920]  What do we do?
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:47.920]  Because you're on an all 50 states to make sure you're in the debate when they,
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:49.920]  the two parties have hijacked that.
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.920]  What do we do to make sure that they can't blacklist you?
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:55.920]  Well, it's getting online.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:58.920]  Gary Johnson 2012.com to get the following information.
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:02.920]  And that is contact all the polling organizations so that I'm in the polls.
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:05.920]  That was really the issue with the debates and the Republican Party.
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:09.920]  I wasn't in the polls that determined who got in the debates.
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.920]  When I'm in the polls right now,
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:15.920]  I'm polling anywhere between seven and nine percent nationally.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:21.920]  I think most, the biggest contributor to the fact that I'm seven to nine percent
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.920]  is the fact that I'm the third name.
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:27.920]  But as this goes forward, it's more than just a third name.
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:31.920]  It is someone who is stronger than Obama on civil liberties.
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.920]  And it's someone who's stronger than Mitt Romney when it comes to dollars and cents.
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:38.920]  Governor, stay there. Stay there. We gotta go to break.
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:39.920]  You got it. You got it.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:41.920]  But I mean, what a great point.
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:45.920]  They won't even let him get his name in the polls.
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:49.920]  Or like when Ron Paul would win a debate and win in the poll, they just wouldn't show him.
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:50.920]  Incredible.
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:51.920]  Look at the fraud.
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:54.920]  The system does not want us supporting Gary Johnson.
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:59.920]  We need to, libertarian or president, not supporting Mitt Romney.
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:03.920]  Would it save you time to get the best quality water filters
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:06.920]  and the best quality storable foods from one company?

[02:23:56.920 --> 02:24:25.920]  T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X. Life's getting better.
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:33.920]  For Gary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico, very successful out there sticking to his promises.
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:38.920]  And he is running a libertarian candidate.
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:44.920]  And in the past, Ron Paul would have endorsed the libertarian candidate or the Constitution Party candidate.
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:51.920]  And I'm telling you, it will be a departure from what Ron Paul normally does and the Ron Paul we love if he doesn't endorse somebody.
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:54.920]  And Gary Johnson is who he needs to endorse.
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.920]  I know some people are working for Ron Paul.
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:59.920]  The Politico types want to be big stars in the Republican Party.
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:01.920]  But this isn't about that.
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:08.920]  It isn't about, you know, just going into the Republican Party and being taken over.
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:10.920]  And I know a lot of Ron Paul people think that's happening.
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:12.920]  And that's good.
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:15.920]  But we've had a great Republican Party platform here in Texas for a long time.
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:17.920]  They never follow it.
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:22.920]  So the ideas of, well, maybe Ron Paul should endorse Romney so he gets a speaking slot.
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:24.920]  That almost no one watches now.
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:26.920]  I mean, these things are a joke.
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.920]  These things are a joke.
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.920]  And there's a real disenchantment.
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:32.920]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:38.920]  Governor Johnson, it took people only six months to start waking up to Obama that he'd condom.
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:41.920]  Used to it to people three, four years to wake up to a politician.
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:45.920]  Are voters starting to get more savvy?
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:49.920]  I mean, why do you think the American people are buying millions of guns a month?
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:52.920]  No, I think that that's exactly the case.
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:57.920]  And I would like to point out that so much is made about working together.
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:01.920]  Working together is just code in Washington to spend more money.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:05.920]  I'd like to point out that when it comes to Obama and Romney,
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:10.920]  that I have more governmental executive experience than the two of them combined.
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:15.920]  And if your initial knee jerk is we don't need people with more government experience.
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:22.920]  And government is saying no to government spending is saying no to the attacks on our civil liberties.
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:28.920]  I may have vetoed more legislation than the other 49 governors in the country combined.
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:30.920]  That's my experience.
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:34.920]  I am promising to submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013.
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:40.920]  I am promising to veto any legislation where expenses exceed revenue.
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:42.920]  Are they going to override my veto?
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:44.920]  Yeah, they sure are.
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:50.920]  But I'm going to argue that spending will be lower in that scenario than any other scenario possible.
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.920]  Imagine a libertarian president challenging Obama to repeal,
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:59.920]  or excuse me, challenging Democrats in Congress to repeal the Patriot Act
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:03.920]  to abolish the Department of Homeland Security, to let's not bomb Iran,
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:05.920]  to get out of Afghanistan.
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:11.920]  Imagine a libertarian president challenging Republicans in Congress to get some stark.
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:18.920]  Imagine a libertarian president vetoing a Republican spending bill that spends too much.
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:22.920]  Get some stark. Let's save the country.
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:23.920]  I agree with you.
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:25.920]  But I mean, you've gone over the numbers.
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:27.920]  We had Lou Rockwell on earlier talking about it.
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:30.920]  Even if they hyperinflate, we're going to go bankrupt.
[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:36.920]  And government, it looks like, has decided like a cancer to just eat everything to totally take over.
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:40.920]  Don't the defense contractors, don't the welfare people, don't the unions,
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:45.920]  don't they all know that the course we're going on will wreck everything?
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:46.920]  Don't they get it?
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:48.920]  Don't they understand?
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:53.920]  Or is it just the special interests just don't care they're in there snatching for whatever they can get right now?
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:55.920]  Well, I think people do understand.
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:28:00.920]  And unless they have a clear choice, and I don't mean Obama and Romney,
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:05.920]  where Romney says, let's slash spending, but you just scratch the surface a little bit,
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:09.920]  and he wants to increase spending for defense.
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:15.920]  And I cringe every time I call the Department of War, the Department of Defense,
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:19.920]  but we should increase spending for the Department of Defense,
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:21.920]  and we should hold Medicare harmless.
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.920]  Well, and for those listening, for everyone in this country,
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:32.920]  look, if we don't spend within our means, if we don't cut Medicare spending by 43%,
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:35.920]  we're going to find ourselves without a health care system at all.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.920]  And that's what's at stake here.
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:42.920]  If we don't fix this, we're all going down together, all of us.
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:45.920]  And that would be mutual sacrifice on all of our parts.
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:48.920]  And I think really key to this too is mutual.
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:52.920]  This needs to be fair, and the country is anything but fair.
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:53.920]  It's up for sale.
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:55.920]  Both parties sell it.
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:29:00.920]  They've got their hands out and corporations, individuals, groups, they're out to pay for it,
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:05.920]  and they do, and they get their special, they get their special place in line in this country.
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:08.920]  We're going to break here and come back with more points you've got to make.
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:11.920]  And because I've been asking the questions, I want to hear what's most important on your plate,
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:13.920]  but also take some calls.
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:16.920]  But think about this question when we come back first.
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:19.920]  Why are they announcing TSA checkpoints on the highways?
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:24.920]  Why are they ordering 450 million rounds of hollow point 40 cal?
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:27.920]  Why are they announcing armored pill boxes?
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:32.920]  Why is the head of the army announcing they want to put armed troops stationed in every city
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:36.920]  and admitting that it's for domestic groups, not al-Qaeda now?
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:39.920]  I mean, this is like a science fiction movie.
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:42.920]  And in Europe, they're announcing currency controls.
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:44.920]  They may not let you leave the country.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.920]  I mean, this world is going into tyranny.
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:48.920]  It's really scary.
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:49.920]  We'll get your take on that.
[02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:53.920]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:30:20.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:38.920]  We're on the march.
[02:30:38.920 --> 02:31:01.920]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:08.920]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:12.920]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:16.920]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country,
[02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:18.920]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:23.920]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:10.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:18.920]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:25.920]  Look, the McMega corporations that are monopoly men, they want a giant dependent welfare class.
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:27.920]  They don't want a middle class.
[02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:29.920]  The system wants big government.
[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:33.920]  You can have people that come out and say, oh no, they want libertarianism.
[02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:39.920]  Yeah, there are some globalists who want to call it libertarianism and privatize things that are already public,
[02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:42.920]  but then just operate as government ripping you off.
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:52.920]  Don't confuse that Bilderberg, you know, Peter Thiel type idea as real constitutionalism or what you call libertarianism.
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:59.920]  You know, the ideas of drug decriminalization, the ideas of states' rights, the idea of not having a nanny state.
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:06.920]  I want to get the governor's take on the police state question I brought up with the proliferation of the military,
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:08.920]  the checkpoints all of it here in a moment.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:12.920]  Then your phone calls, they'll also ask you about the nanny state.
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:21.920]  California is moving into New York, a city saying no soft drinks above 16 ounces, milk products will be banned, popcorn.
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:23.920]  I mean, we're actually saying this.
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.920]  I mean, I feel crazy when I say it.
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:26.920]  I feel like I'm lying.
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:29.920]  Even though it's in the news, my brain says that can't be true.
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:32.920]  It feels like I'm saying Martians landed in the Central Park.
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:34.920]  I mean, it sounds crazy.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:37.920]  30,000 armed drones sounds crazy.
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:42.920]  The head of the Army saying, Secretary of the Army two weeks ago in the CFR saying,
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:45.920]  we're going to have armed troops in every city to take on the Americans.
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:47.920]  I mean, I'm running.
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:49.920]  We're going back to the governor here in a moment.
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:54.920]  I want to tell you about one of the ways we fund our operation, and that is selling products that I believe in.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:35:00.920]  Probe here is the best gravity-fed filter side-by-side against all the other major competitors.
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:05.920]  You can check it out at infowarshop.com or infowarstore.com.
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:07.920]  We'll also get you there.
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:16.920]  We already had the lowest prices on the Probe here, but you can get an additional 10% off at checkout by entering the code water, W-A-T-E-R,
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:21.920]  if you're public school educated, like I am.
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:27.920]  And then last but not least, I have found the best field filter that makes even, you know,
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:37.920]  scummy swamp water safe to drink. We had the lowest price on the Lifestraw and you get a free citizen rulebook and bumper stickers when you order it at infowars.com.
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:45.920]  So Probe here, the lowest price at infowars.com or infowarshop.com and Lifestraw, the best field filter out there,
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:47.920]  an amazing technology.
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:55.920]  Lifestraw, Probe here, both available at infowarshop.com or by calling 888-25-33139.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:59.920]  We also, as it's back in print, we sold these about a decade ago, but they went out of print.
[02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:05.920]  Now they've been reprinted, a new, you know, bigger edition. It's a wider, wider page, bigger font.
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.920]  Gary Allen, none dare call it conspiracy.
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:12.920]  Very, very powerful book available at infowars.com.
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:18.920]  Discounted as well, along with tragedy and hope that Ron Paul was talking about in the last hour.
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:20.920]  All at infowarshop.com.
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:30.920]  We are a listener. Support it. Okay, going back to the governor. Governor, you heard my question, my diatribe about the accelerating,
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:38.920]  not even federalization, but militarization of everything and shifting from it's for Al Qaeda to it's for libertarian right-wing extremists.
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:45.920]  What do you make of this and what would you do as president? What will you say in the debates about this issue?
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:59.920]  Well, the root of all evil are politicians that want to get elected to save you and I from all of the what's bad in the world,
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:08.920]  whether that be drugs, whether that be the illegal immigrant, whether that be poor health care, whether that be the terrorist threat.
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:21.920]  So we need to bomb Iran and we need to get in an endless war in Afghanistan and so it's politicians at the root of all evil creating with the executive,
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:29.920]  with the president, new agencies to address all these fears and then the bureaucrats that run amok to go along with this.
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  Look, I will tell you, as governor of New Mexico, my experience, good government was easy. It wasn't hard and it started with looking at issues first and politics last.
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:53.920]  Don't discount electing a president of the United States beholden to no one that goes in and if no laws change,
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:59.920]  being able to control all these agencies because the president of the United States appoints the heads of all these agencies,
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:06.920]  because the president of the United States appoints the heads of all and the membership of all boards and commissions,
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:09.920]  the president of the United States controls rules and regulations.
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:20.920]  The president of the United States controls exactly what it is that you are talking about right now because these are all being driven through the various bureaucracies.
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:33.920]  That can come to an end electing a president of the United States that's actually going to bring leadership as opposed to status quo and being bought and paid for.
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:44.920]  Very well said. Now again, getting back to Ron Paul here briefly, Ron Paul says let the states handle it with abortion and things,
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:51.920]  but then you get off into other issues that are national sovereignty issues. You mentioned illegal aliens.
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.920]  Well, they use the illegals as an excuse to put in biometrics, but then don't even use it against them.
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:01.920]  Bank of America wants three forms of ID for my crew members. We've been in there and shot video of it.
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:06.920]  One of my guys who had a bank account there, but an illegal can come in with a fake consulate matricula.
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:16.920]  You can almost get out of cracker jack boxes. I understand immigrants are hardworking. Many of them are actually do help the economy.
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:29.920]  My issue is not with them. It's that the government Republicans as well, give them welfare, get them on the system, teach them victimology and all of this liberation theology.
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:39.920]  When I was in high school at Anderson High, they were teaching us that America was evil and Mexico is going to take over and this was white teachers doing this, by the way.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:44.920]  This is what the government wants is to kind of break things up, have us at each other's throats.
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:52.920]  I understand you represented a border state there in New Mexico, but you can't have the illegals here and you got to kick them out because of the welfare.
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:40:03.920]  I mean, you know, they come across the border. They have their kids. They immediately I have to pay for it. And then the illegals end up becoming Democrats who vote 90% of the time to try to ban my guns.
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:08.920]  So that's why I have the problem with the illegal alien show. So how do you deal with that as president?
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:15.920]  Well, I think we make it as easy as possible for someone that wants to come into this country and work to get a work visa.
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:26.920]  I'm not talking about citizenship. I'm not talking about a green card. I'm talking about a work visa that would entail a background check because we don't want criminals working in this country.
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:36.920]  With regard to the 11 million illegal immigrants that are here in this country right now, I think we need to set up a grace period where we can get them a work visa.
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:43.920]  And you're absolutely right about welfare. We do not want this to be about welfare. It needs to be about work.
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:57.920]  The third promise I'm making when it comes to the economy besides submitting a balanced budget and vetoing expenditures that exceed revenue is I am advocating a throwing out the entire federal tax system,
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:08.920]  throwing out the income tax, throwing out corporate tax withholdings, abolishing the IRS and replacing it with one federal consumption tax.
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:19.920]  In this case, the fair tax, if we implement the fair tax, taxes will not be an issue, whether it's illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, U.S. citizens, visitors.
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:21.920]  No one is going to be able to do that.
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:24.920]  I understand that that would, I understand that would turbo charge the economy.
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:34.920]  Here's the problem that I was told by insiders 18 years ago and turned out to be very accurate, that they were going to always come out and have people push a fair tax or a flat tax,
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:46.920]  a sales tax, VAT, whatever the case is, and then bait and switch and call the income tax your social security at 10% and then have basically 9999.
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.920]  The real plan that he was pushing was four nines.
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:54.920]  And so then they can always jack the nines up later.
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:42:01.920]  And it's just a way to get total federal surveillance of now all the sales happening at the point of sale.
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:04.920]  I mean, what is your fair tax plan?
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:07.920]  Well, my fair tax plan is the fair tax.
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:09.920]  It's the consumption.
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:13.920]  So for those listening, watching, get online, fairtax.org.
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:21.920]  It does away with the 16th Amendment, no more income tax and no more withholdings from your payroll checks.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:28.920]  So Alex, social security, Medicare, unemployment comes out of the proceeds of the fair tax.
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:35.920]  No, no, I understand, but I mean, you're pledging that this would not happen unless we did get rid of the income tax.
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:43.920]  That is part of the fair tax package, which 90 congressmen and women have signed on to to this point.
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:47.920]  So the discussion or the template is there.
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.920]  I know, but notice Neil Boerts even pushed that.
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:55.920]  But then as soon as it got down to the point, it was 999 and they left out the other nine.
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:00.920]  And it just, it just makes my head hurt to think this 999 is something completely.
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:01.920]  No, no, no, I know it is.
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:05.920]  But I'm saying, I'm saying that's what they're going to end up pushing is, oh, we're going to cut.
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:09.920]  We're not going to call it the income tax, but we're going to call it a social security tax.
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:16.920]  Well, it wouldn't be a social security tax because the proceeds of social security come out of the proceeds of the fair tax.
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:30.920]  Now, you're right to criticize the finer points of all this, but to go to a one federal consumption tax is really a vast improvement over what we currently have.
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:41.920]  And imagine abolishment of the IRS and the ramifications that will have on the economy that all of us don't end up spending months out of the year dealing with our taxes.
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.920]  Now, I hear you. Let's go to some phone calls. Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson is our guest.
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:52.920]  He's the Libertarian Presidential Candidate 2012, GaryJohnson2012.com.
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:56.920]  Or you can do the big boy thing and support Mitt Romney or Obama.
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:02.920]  You can grow up like one editorialist said of people that wouldn't compromise.
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:04.920]  Folks, compromising has gotten us here.
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:08.920]  And if it was real compromise, I might be for compromise occasionally.
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:13.920]  But all we hear is compromise, compromise, like Gary was saying, work together.
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:17.920]  Now, that means you give up ground to big government regulations, nanny state.
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:20.920]  That was my last question. I promise we're going to calls, Governor.
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:23.920]  What is your take on the orgy of nanny state?
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:28.920]  Dogs have got to be in seatbelts or have or licenses for a paddleboard in Minnesota.
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:30.920]  Jesse Ventura's and Forbes talking about that.
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:33.920]  Talked about it two days ago here, Governor Ventura.
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:37.920]  We've got can't have popcorn, want to ban milk products in New York.
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:39.920]  Banning soft drinks.
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:44.920]  So hopefully I'm speaking the obvious here.
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:49.920]  Bloomberg comes out, talks about sodas and the fact that they're unhealthy,
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.920]  drinking a soda over 16 ounces.
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:53.920]  Well, he's absolutely right.
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:55.920]  But he's going to make this government policy.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:57.920]  Okay, so let's just look at this for a second.
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:59.920]  He makes this government policy.
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:00.920]  He makes it a law.
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:04.920]  You can't sell sodas over 16 ounces.
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:06.920]  You just buy two 12 ounces.
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:09.920]  But the point is, let's say he implements this.
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:12.920]  It's very, you know, what it brings about awareness.
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:14.920]  People actually do get healthier.
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:16.920]  They're able to measure this somehow.
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:18.920]  But that's Bloomberg.
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:20.920]  He puts it into play.
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:23.920]  But then his successor, because it actually is showing,
[02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:26.920]  and I don't think it would have anything to do with his law,
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:29.920]  would just have to do with the awareness that went along with it.
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:35.920]  But then his successor comes along and criminalizes a 32 ounce container.
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:39.920]  Criminalizes activities that otherwise wouldn't be criminal.
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:43.920]  You know, this buckling up the dog.
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:47.920]  The fine for not buckling up your dog is higher than the fine
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:49.920]  for not buckling up your child.
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:50.920]  Exactly.
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:51.920]  That's where it goes to.
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:53.920]  It isn't the initial thought.
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:55.920]  The initial thought is well intended.
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:00.920]  And it really does have a basis in better human behavior,
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:02.920]  healthier human behavior.
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:07.920]  But you can't have the government telling you what size drink you can have.
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:12.920]  Exactly, because the ramifications of this is you end up criminalizing
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:14.920]  the 32 ounce container.
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:18.920]  And then you end up with a bureaucracy that's going to roam the streets
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:21.920]  to make sure that, oh, there's somebody with a really big cup.
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:24.920]  Is there water in the cup, or is there coke in the cup?
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:25.920]  Absolutely, Governor.
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:26.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:29.920]  It's going to give the police total excuses to get involved in our lives.
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:30.920]  It's a nightmare.
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:33.920]  Let's talk to, there's so many callers here.
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:36.920]  Let's talk to Keith in Pennsylvania.
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:37.920]  You're on here with Governor Johnson.
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:38.920]  Go ahead.
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:39.920]  How are you guys doing?
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:40.920]  Pretty good.
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:42.920]  Real quick, I wanted to let you know how I woke up.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:46.920]  I was laid off from my job in 2009, and I all of a sudden had all this time
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:49.920]  on my hands to do research and find things out.
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:53.920]  And it also led me to a hobby of mine which turned into my career of playing poker
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:55.920]  online, and that's how I made my living.
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:58.920]  I'm sure you guys are aware of everything that's going on with that now.
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:02.920]  So I was just curious to know where Gary Johnson stands on, you know,
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:05.920]  me being able to make a living with online poker.
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:09.920]  Where are you on online gaming, Sherb?
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:15.920]  Well, I reached out to the poker players, this was well over a year ago,
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:18.920]  and said, this is crazy.
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:24.920]  This should be a U.S. enterprise, and that the government bans it,
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:31.920]  and then so all poker players have to play poker online with offshore
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:34.920]  enterprises dictating it.
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.920]  Well, then the Justice Department cracks down on that.
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:43.920]  So what we've done is we've taken away 10 million Americans,
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:47.920]  a passion for playing poker online, and we've taken that away.
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:49.920]  We're going to allow them to go into a casino, though,
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:51.920]  where they have to lose hundreds of dollars.
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:52.920]  Well, that's what it's about.
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:56.920]  It's about going into rig slot machines that are having fun playing poker.
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:48:00.920]  And it's the same Justice Department caught shipping guns into Mexico
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:01.920]  to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:02.920]  Thank you, caller.
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:04.920]  Governor, what's your turn?
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:05.920]  And then here's another thing.
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:06.920]  Oh, right.
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:07.920]  I'm a mountain biker.
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:08.920]  That's my passion.
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:12.920]  So I am riding my mountain bike on public trails that are now being
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:15.920]  subject to being closed to my mountain bike,
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:18.920]  but horses are allowed on those same trails.
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:22.920]  Horse excrement OK, but mountain bike tires not OK.
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:23.920]  That's the government.
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:26.920]  And this is online poker.
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:30.920]  Look, online poker, I should be able to play poker in this country.
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:34.920]  And I should be able to play poker in this country on a site that's owned
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:38.920]  by Americans, generating tens of thousands of jobs nationwide
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:42.920]  to accommodate the demand that goes along with online poker.
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:46.920]  But no, I can't do that, but I can go into a casino and don't you know
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:50.920]  that the basis of all that legislation was a special interest,
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:51.920]  casino interest?
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:54.920]  Of course, it's the real mafia not wanting you to be able to play poker
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:55.920]  with somebody amazing.
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:59.920]  Let's talk to Steve in Michigan on water fluoridation.
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:00.920]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:06.920]  Steve in Michigan, you're on the air with Gary Johnson.
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:08.920]  You have a water fluoridation question?
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:11.920]  I really wanted to hear that question.
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:12.920]  I can hear the guy breathing.
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:13.920]  We'll put him on hold.
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:18.920]  Kevin, Kevin, you're on the air with Governor Gary Johnson.
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:19.920]  Go ahead.
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:20.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.920]  I'm a former proud liberal Democrat who in 08 became, you know, Ron Paul
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:29.920]  supporter, you know, big government was being used not to
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:31.920]  felt the money was never getting to where it was promised.
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:36.920]  And then, you know, I really responded to Ron Paul's answer to corruption.
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:38.920]  I've supported him in 12.
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:44.920]  I do not feel any anguish about the, you know, Ron Paul endorsement.
[02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:46.920]  He can do what he wants.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:50.920]  I feel grateful that we have a libertarian candidate that's on the
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:52.920]  ballot in all 50 states.
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:56.920]  I'm hopeful that the other people libertarians and constitutionalists
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:02.920]  join and can switch over in mass and support Johnson's campaign.
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:06.920]  It would be just as if Ron Paul did switch over and do the third party.
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:11.920]  Yeah, we need to turbo charge that and really work to make sure he gets coverage.
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:12.920]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:15.920]  Governor Johnson comments on what he just said.
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:17.920]  Oh, just, just, just right on.
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:22.920]  All I'm getting on today, all I'm asking is give me a look.
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:24.920]  Gary Johnson, 2012, give me a look.
[02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:28.920]  See if anything that I have done suggests that I am anything about big
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:33.920]  government, if I am anything about taking away civil liberties.
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:38.920]  Arguably, I've done a better job of someone who's been in office of
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:41.920]  of taking these interests on than anybody else.
[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:44.920]  And that's what I'm putting myself out there at.
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:47.920]  Well, you certainly did what you said you would do as governor,
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:49.920]  even though I disagree with you on a few issues.
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:51.920]  The fact that you do what you say you're going to do.
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:58.920]  I mean, that is such a rare political resource that I'm going to support you.
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:00.920]  I'm not going to support Mitt Romney.
[02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:04.920]  Emergency Essentials has Mountain House deals in June.

[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:18.920]  Tom Woods, Ron Paul, Don't Endorsement Romney,
[02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:19.920]  the video of that.
[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:22.920]  Ron Paul 2012 should listen to Ron Paul 2008,
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:23.920]  that full video.
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:25.920]  Chuck Baldwin, Warrens, Ron Paul.
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:29.920]  U.S. Congressman demand justification for drone strikes.
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:31.920]  So is Rand Paul doing a good job there.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:34.920]  Transhumanism agenda enforced with nano weapons.
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:36.920]  The nanny state is here.
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:38.920]  Life and Occupied America with a Cade.
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:41.920]  Nigel Farage, remember the EU Parliament.
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:44.920]  The Euro-Titanic has now hit an iceberg.

[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:48.920]  Okay.
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:50.920]  Stephen Michigan, you were away from the phone,
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:52.920]  but I want to hear your forwardation question.
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:53.920]  Go ahead for Gary Johnson.
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:55.920]  You're on the air with the governor.
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:56.920]  Hey, Gary.
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:59.920]  You know, first of all, I want to say I know you mean well,
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:01.920]  and you have an acute understanding of fiscal policy
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:04.920]  and the financial debacle we face as a nation.
[02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:07.920]  However, when you visited Michigan State University last year,
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:09.920]  you were hosted by the Young Americans for Liberty Student
[02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:10.920]  Organization.
[02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:12.920]  And I asked you a couple of questions.
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:15.920]  One had to deal with fluoridation and municipal water supplies
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:17.920]  to which you responded without hesitation
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:19.920]  and shrugging your shoulders saying,
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:23.920]  well, my dentist said it's good, so it can't be that bad.
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:26.920]  And then also I asked you about Janet Napolitano's
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:28.920]  See Something, Say Something campaign,
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:30.920]  to which you kind of likened it to a neighborhood watch.
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:32.920]  And you said maybe it's not a bad thing.
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:33.920]  So I know you're not a bad guy,
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:35.920]  but I want to hear your butthole maybe flush it out.
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:36.920]  Yeah, okay.
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:37.920]  Thank you, Collar.
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:39.920]  Yeah, the issue of See Something, Say Something,
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:40.920]  let's take that first.
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:43.920]  Their point is they want to get us all tattletailing on each other
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:45.920]  and it creates this fear that terrorists
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:48.920]  are hiding under the table.
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:55.920]  Well, look, if See Something, Say Something is reporting
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:58.920]  to the authorities that your parents are smoking pot
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:00.920]  and then your parents end up in jail,
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:05.920]  which is, we've seen instances of this all the time.
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:07.920]  No, that's not a good thing.
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:12.920]  So Steve, I really always want to be honest and forthright
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:20.920]  and see something, say something in terms of no TSA,
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:24.920]  in terms of no Homeland Security.
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:28.920]  And gee, if you really do see something that you should report it.
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:29.920]  Exactly.
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:31.920]  If I see somebody doing something illegal,
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:33.920]  I will call the police or do something myself.
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:35.920]  You're forgetting rid of Homeland Security.
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:37.920]  I mean, that answers, you said that before he came on.
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:41.920]  Well, so my point is, is that this is the kind of thing
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:42.920]  without government.
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:45.920]  This is the kind of a thing that we can rely on.
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:46.920]  Fluoridation.
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:49.920]  Look, I don't want to make it a federal government program
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:51.920]  to fluoridate the water.
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:53.920]  But if your city is fluoridating the water
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:57.920]  and it's something that you're absolutely opposed to,
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:00.920]  then that's where that issue should reside,
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:02.920]  not certainly with the federal government.
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:03.920]  Sure, I think those are good answers
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:06.920]  and we can further educate you on those things real fast.
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:08.920]  Let's talk to Dan in New Mexico.
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:09.920]  Last caller we have time for.
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:10.920]  Sorry to the other callers.
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:12.920]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:15.920]  Hello, Governor Johnson, calling from Albuquerque here.
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:18.920]  And we definitely support you.
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.920]  Definitely no doubt about it here in Vantana Ranch.
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:24.920]  I got my sign up.
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:25.920]  A couple of things.
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:29.920]  First is I'd like you to address how you would get
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:32.920]  homeschoolers better supported.
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:33.920]  We only got about a minute and a half.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:35.920]  Okay, homeschoolers, what else?
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:39.920]  And number two is that I do think that you can win.
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:41.920]  I think it's the money issue.
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:43.920]  I'd like to help with that.
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:45.920]  I'd like to call the Utah office.
[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:48.920]  Can you give me a name to talk to?
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:51.920]  Get online, GaryJohnson2012.com.
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:53.920]  Talk to Grant.
[02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:54.920]  Okay, thank you.
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:58.920]  We got a jump, but folks, even if the point of supporting
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:00.920]  is to get the word out, bottom line,
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:02.920]  you only lose by not trying.
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:05.920]  Governor, real quick, what's your view on homeschooling
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:07.920]  and the assaults on that?
[02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:09.920]  Well, I'm an absolute supporter of homeschooling,
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:11.920]  so when it comes to the federal government
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:14.920]  and what should the federal government do regarding education,
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:16.920]  abolish the federal department of education,
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:18.920]  give all this back to the states,
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:21.920]  50 laboratories of innovation and best practice,
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:23.920]  and that's exactly what we'll have,
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:25.920]  but get the federal government out of education.
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:28.920]  Established in 1978, look at educational performance
[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:30.920]  from 1970 until now.
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:32.920]  Go on straight down, governor.
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:34.920]  Nothing to suggest value added.
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:36.920]  Absolutely, candidate for president.
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:38.920]  Thank you very much, GaryJohnson.
