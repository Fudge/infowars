[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:40.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:42.400 --> 00:48.880]  thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen for this worldwide transmission it is the 26th day of
[00:49.680 --> 01:00.400]  June 2009 we're going to be live here for the next four hours and no i'm not going to be talking
[01:00.400 --> 01:09.760]  about michael jackson i will be talking about the mob psychology though of the hysteria i
[01:09.760 --> 01:20.400]  witnessed last night concerning the death of 50 year old michael jackson and i will do that later
[01:20.400 --> 01:29.600]  coming up in the hour i wish that the people would get as concerned about michael jackson
[01:30.720 --> 01:39.200]  and his death or ferra faucet and her death or ed mcman's death this week as they are about the
[01:39.200 --> 01:47.520]  death of the republic the open takeover by the private federal reserve and the offshore banks
[01:47.520 --> 01:57.040]  through the carbon tax that by the way was up to 1200 plus pages and now they're reporting in the
[01:57.040 --> 02:11.120]  wall street journal they added 300 more secretly last night and no one has read the bill and the
[02:11.120 --> 02:15.440]  worst bills of the bills no one ever reads but then they become law they stay law like the patriot act
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.000]  saying there's no more bill rise or constitution even in non-terror related cases
[02:22.000 --> 02:32.800]  we have a rogue government here on our hands i heard jason bermus last night doing his show
[02:32.800 --> 02:41.200]  nine at midnight and i heard him talk about how he pulled through a popular uh smoothie drive through
[02:41.200 --> 02:49.600]  to get a palm granite smoothie and the young lady said i'll give you a discount on your smoothie
[02:49.600 --> 02:59.760]  if you can name a michael jackson's song and he said bad and then she said sing it and he said no
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.040]  just just charge me the full amount i'm not going to sing it and she was basically doing that to
[03:05.040 --> 03:13.280]  everybody that drove through there i was at the gym getting ready to come down here last night at
[03:13.280 --> 03:21.200]  about seven o'clock running on the treadmill to get warmed up before i lift weights and they have
[03:21.200 --> 03:27.600]  tv screens in there and everybody stopped working out everyone was talking it was as if an alien
[03:27.600 --> 03:35.360]  spacecraft had landed in central park and they were just mouth open the workout stopped the staff
[03:35.360 --> 03:43.280]  stopped this personal trainer stopped training people it was as if a new dawn or a new dark age
[03:43.280 --> 03:50.800]  or something new of earth shattering import had just transpired and i'll be honest with you i then
[03:50.800 --> 03:56.800]  went home got to doing research working on a book i'm doing and stopped thinking about it had bermus
[03:56.800 --> 04:02.400]  on the background heard him talking about the palm granite smoothie lady and this morning i was all
[04:02.400 --> 04:08.800]  freaking out over all this legislation about to pass today just all the incredible news in front
[04:08.800 --> 04:14.640]  of me the amazing developments in the banking committee yesterday and i'm driving into work
[04:15.200 --> 04:18.720]  and it hits me michael jackson i've got to talk about that guy
[04:23.360 --> 04:26.240]  plus i had another discussion with psychology today
[04:28.320 --> 04:31.440]  and you know what i got to do with these big national news publications when they're wanting
[04:31.440 --> 04:35.200]  to do hit pieces on me it's just limit the amount of information because i'll let them talk to me
[04:35.200 --> 04:40.000]  off and on for hours and they can snip and twist however they want but you know that's who they
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.240]  are that's what they are let them that's why they're all discredited i'm not even worried about it
[04:44.240 --> 04:50.240]  good just send us more listeners you tell them your distorted view of who i am you put that out
[04:50.240 --> 04:58.080]  and people will come see the real thing and know the truth no weapon formed against this so prosper

[07:56.400 --> 07:59.340]  4-να-4-0-9-5-6-3-3
[07:59.340 --> 08:06.340]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:30.340 --> 08:39.340]  Okay, they are voting today on the climate change bill that is completely secret and now rumored to be over 1,500 pages.
[08:39.340 --> 08:45.340]  Last time they reported it yesterday, it was 1,300. But they admittedly are adding hundreds of pages as we speak.
[08:45.340 --> 08:55.340]  No one is allowed to see it. The 200 page version we saw, it is estimated, they even admit a $2,500 a year increase in taxes.
[08:55.340 --> 09:02.340]  The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times all admit it is the largest tax increase in history, but it's not just that.
[09:02.340 --> 09:13.340]  It's a total takeover of every facet of society with bureaucracy and something akin to zoning, home inspections, inspections of your trash.
[09:13.340 --> 09:20.340]  It's all being announced. That's in the 200 pages that we saw last week and on Monday.
[09:20.340 --> 09:28.340]  It is now over 1,300. It is now over 1,300 pages.
[09:28.340 --> 09:35.340]  And get this, no one is allowed to read it. In fact, I meant to print last night, guys, a CBS News headline.
[09:35.340 --> 09:41.340]  Will Congress read the climate bill? Print that for me because I want to later on TV when we go live next hour.
[09:41.340 --> 09:47.340]  Hold that up because we have a lot of new viewers that are watching and I want them to see CBS because they won't believe me.
[09:47.340 --> 09:58.340]  But when they see their God, CBS, the same one that tells them about Michael Jackson's latest nose surgery, they will then understand it's not even being read.
[09:58.340 --> 10:06.340]  Special interests are writing the entire thing and big corporations, big energy, they're all behind it.
[10:06.340 --> 10:11.340]  The control left always says the big oil doesn't believe in global warming. They're trying to shut it down.
[10:11.340 --> 10:20.340]  Oh, now even mainstream news has to admit that the big oil companies, energy companies wrote this. This is a tax.
[10:20.340 --> 10:27.340]  Who do you think owns those energy companies, the big banks? This will be a tax directly to offshore banks and Al Gore.
[10:27.340 --> 10:38.340]  Now, that little creature was going to get up on the hill and give a speech yesterday, but he's so unpopular that they have made the decision to not have him up there
[10:38.340 --> 10:46.340]  and to try to not cover the bill. See, when they thought they had the momentum, they were hyping that the earth was going to die and the ice caps were melting
[10:46.340 --> 11:01.340]  and polar bears were about to go extinct and were drowning. Actual mainstream news is teaching everybody that polar bears can't swim and now all those lies are coming out.
[11:01.340 --> 11:08.340]  Now it's coming out when they show a polar bear on an ice floe going, look, he can't find his family. He's going to die when the ice melts. He'll die.
[11:08.340 --> 11:21.340]  He can't swim. That they swim out to the ice flows that are in the spring and summer every year and that they then hunt seal and smaller whale beluga from the flows
[11:21.340 --> 11:33.340]  and then they swim back and that polar bear populations in North America have gone up from 34,000 in the last survey to over 44,000.
[11:33.340 --> 11:45.340]  You can pull that number up. Just Google polar bear numbers explode because the warming trend, and they've also done the archaeological analysis with a zoologist
[11:45.340 --> 11:53.340]  and found that during warming trends, their numbers go up. When it gets cold, their numbers go down because when the Arctic warms, there's more life.
[11:53.340 --> 12:00.340]  But unfortunately, it's cooling now, so the numbers will go down and they'll no doubt tell you that global warming did that in 10 years when you find out there's less of them.
[12:00.340 --> 12:04.340]  So their numbers go up and down, up and down, up and down. A lot of polar bears don't make it to the winter.
[12:04.340 --> 12:13.340]  In fact, a lot of polar bears don't get hardly any food during the winter, if any. That's why they blubber up eating whales and seal in the spring and summer,
[12:13.340 --> 12:25.340]  sometimes increasing their body weight by 40%. They get real fat in the summer and then they go and are basically in semi-hybernation out there just laying there in the frozen waste during the winter.
[12:25.340 --> 12:32.340]  I'm already digressing. To say that polar bears can't swim is a lie of biblical proportions.
[12:32.340 --> 12:43.340]  But the issue here is they're making their move today. And later in the hour, I'm going to give you the toll-free number.
[12:43.340 --> 12:51.340]  Why? Al Gore admittedly is at his home manning the phones. They have every big think tank, every big tax-free foundation.
[12:51.340 --> 13:04.340]  They have every large paid-off, acorn-type government group. They have the NFL promoting it. They have all the companies owned by Rupert Murdoch.
[13:04.340 --> 13:12.340]  He admittedly has given teleconferences saying he is trying to push in TV and movies that global warming is really the global tax.
[13:12.340 --> 13:16.340]  Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil saying it's real. We've got to have a global tax.
[13:16.340 --> 13:22.340]  This is their final push to micromanage and regulate every facet of your life selectively.
[13:22.340 --> 13:33.340]  This is the neo-servatim and feudalism where they can come in and shut down whoever they want and only those that are given the letter of Mark by the Global Imperium are able to operate and live.
[13:33.340 --> 13:41.340]  Now, this is the managed economy. This is the new global Soviet Union basically run by private banks.
[13:41.340 --> 14:00.340]  This is total control. I'm going to break it all down today and then just off the charts news dealing with Bernanke before Congress saying Congress has no authority to regulate the issuance of currency and credit.
[14:00.340 --> 14:05.340]  Though Article 1, Section 8 expressly states that in the U.S. Constitution.
[14:05.340 --> 14:11.340]  It's a total insult to Congress, to the American people, but it's an insult the American people deserve.
[14:11.340 --> 14:16.340]  I would imagine one out of a hundred people knows that Congress is over money.
[14:16.340 --> 14:34.340]  So we're going to go over that today and he calls it a seizure of power, a dictatorial martial law ransacking of America to have Congress ought at the Fed and then he threatens financial terrorism and our society is going to collapse if this happens.
[14:34.340 --> 14:38.340]  Now listen, I'm going to go over this.
[14:38.340 --> 14:46.340]  The Michael Jackson thing of him reportedly dying from a opiate, a painkiller injection.
[14:46.340 --> 14:56.340]  This is the biggest diversion, the biggest distraction I have seen in a while on top of Farrah Fawcett and the governor and his lover.
[14:56.340 --> 14:58.340]  I mean, that was clearly staged.
[14:58.340 --> 15:04.340]  There's no doubt they knew where he was, TSA knew where he was, Feds knew where he was, the Feds were like for days.
[15:04.340 --> 15:08.340]  We don't know where he is as if they didn't know his passport and he left the country, which is now on record.
[15:08.340 --> 15:17.340]  And then suddenly the newspaper has all his lovey-dove emails just like the FBI had been following and watching Elliott Spitzer for years.
[15:17.340 --> 15:23.340]  And in the minute he said he was going to go after the banks for the takeover, you know, they bring out his hooker liaisons.
[15:23.340 --> 15:30.340]  They got dirt on basically everybody and if you are as pure as a driven snow, they'll manufacture it.
[15:30.340 --> 15:36.340]  If you do live some pious life, like I got to say I do, they can make something up if they wanted to.
[15:36.340 --> 15:40.340]  They got endless informants and people that will just lie on the stand.
[15:40.340 --> 15:42.340]  This is how they operate.
[15:42.340 --> 15:44.340]  So they can't get dirt on you, they make it up.
[15:44.340 --> 15:46.340]  They tell Ron Paul, oh, we're going to interview you.
[15:46.340 --> 15:53.340]  Ron Paul has come to this hotel suite and he walks in and Sasha Barrico and drops his pants and says, have sex with me and goes chasing him out the door.
[15:53.340 --> 15:55.340]  And the media says, Ron Paul's bad.
[15:55.340 --> 15:57.340]  Doesn't matter they tricked him and he ran out of the room.
[15:57.340 --> 15:59.340]  He's still bad.
[15:59.340 --> 16:03.340]  See how that works and the public loves seeing big people torn down.
[16:03.340 --> 16:05.340]  So they say, yeah, Ron Paul's evil.
[16:05.340 --> 16:08.340]  Doesn't matter if he got set up and ran out of the room.
[16:08.340 --> 16:11.340]  When Sasha Barrico and drops his pants and says, I want to have sex with you.
[16:11.340 --> 16:13.340]  This is how they operate.
[16:13.340 --> 16:15.340]  This is what they do.
[16:15.340 --> 16:17.340]  She'll understand this.
[16:17.340 --> 16:24.340]  There is almost no news coverage on CNN and Fox about what's really in this climate belt.
[16:24.340 --> 16:27.340]  And instead, everything is now Michael Jackson.
[16:27.340 --> 16:34.340]  And Jaren at 1005 Central Standard Time was watching TV here in the office coffee room.
[16:34.340 --> 16:43.340]  And I want Jaren Nyhart who works here running the show doing a great job to relay to you what he saw today.
[16:43.340 --> 16:47.340]  But we're going to desperately, because we have millions of listeners.
[16:47.340 --> 16:50.340]  Give the phone numbers out and try to counter Al Gore and all the big foundation.
[16:50.340 --> 16:55.340]  Now the phones are busy most of the time, but you can also call the regional office of your congressman
[16:55.340 --> 17:00.340]  and ask them to call the back lines and tell them you should go to the Capitol today.
[17:00.340 --> 17:01.340]  It's that desperate.
[17:01.340 --> 17:02.340]  I should have done this days ago.
[17:02.340 --> 17:04.340]  Jaren, tell folks what you witnessed this morning.
[17:04.340 --> 17:05.340]  Yeah, about 1005.
[17:05.340 --> 17:07.340]  I believe the show is called CNN newsroom.
[17:07.340 --> 17:12.340]  I was flipping around and I landed on that to see any information on this bill.
[17:12.340 --> 17:15.340]  I was actually looking and it was Michael Jackson all the time.
[17:15.340 --> 17:18.340]  Well, they had Michael Jackson scrolls, Michael Jackson thirds.
[17:18.340 --> 17:19.340]  Everything was Michael Jackson.
[17:19.340 --> 17:31.340]  And as soon as I got there, I heard the news anchor say, we're going to cut to the House of Representatives where a congressperson from California was going to observe a moment of silence for Michael Jackson.
[17:31.340 --> 17:38.340]  They then cut to live coverage of the House of Representatives, but they had missed a moment of silence.
[17:38.340 --> 17:42.340]  The person that they aired was actually talking about and they say the bill name.
[17:42.340 --> 17:48.340]  They say, we're going to discuss HR 2454, whatever the title, climate change and secure.
[17:48.340 --> 17:54.340]  And when they said security, they cut it off, went back to the newsroom and goes, oh, I guess we missed the moment of silence for Michael Jackson.
[17:54.340 --> 17:58.340]  But it was, it was out there as a blurb just to complete miss edit.
[17:58.340 --> 18:07.340]  Well, Burma's Burma's made the point that when he was driving through that and finished the story earlier, when he was driving through a big smoothie chain to get a palm granite smoothie.
[18:07.340 --> 18:14.340]  The lady was saying a discount of you can basically sing a Michael Jackson song to me and Burma's wouldn't do it.
[18:14.340 --> 18:21.340]  But he said, imagine if the people at the checkout windows were saying, hey, what about HR 2454 bringing us into bondage?
[18:21.340 --> 18:26.340]  I mean, the people pushing the bill say it's going to cost 2500 bucks a year.
[18:26.340 --> 18:28.340]  But that was when it was 200 pages long.
[18:28.340 --> 18:29.340]  It's over 1300.
[18:29.340 --> 18:30.340]  They said they've added hundreds more.
[18:30.340 --> 18:32.340]  No one can see it.
[18:32.340 --> 18:36.340]  That in and of itself, they're rushing it through saying no one can see it.
[18:36.340 --> 18:40.340]  They're trying to pass bills for the feds to take over the whole water supply.
[18:40.340 --> 18:47.340]  But you can't get the slaves to stop letting the mainstream media set the agenda and set what's being discussed.
[18:47.340 --> 18:51.340]  Not only that, it took me a half an hour last night to get the bill number.
[18:51.340 --> 18:57.340]  I searched headline after headline article after article saying biggest tax on the American people read the full article.
[18:57.340 --> 18:58.340]  It's not anywhere.
[18:58.340 --> 19:03.340]  It took about 10 articles to find the bill number buried in one article.
[19:03.340 --> 19:04.340]  You can't find information on it.
[19:04.340 --> 19:05.340]  They're just not giving it.
[19:05.340 --> 19:09.340]  And they're always changing it because it came out of conference what earlier this week.
[19:09.340 --> 19:15.340]  And now suddenly they're about to pass this says, will Congress read bills before voting CBS news?
[19:15.340 --> 19:20.340]  And it goes on to say that that nobody's going to read it.
[19:20.340 --> 19:28.340]  I mean, this folks, they're going to turn millions of the new youth brigades, their new paid job.
[19:28.340 --> 19:32.340]  They admit this is mainstream news to inspect your house.
[19:32.340 --> 19:35.340]  And there are people that are on board with it, too.
[19:35.340 --> 19:40.340]  I have some liberal family members that truly believe that green energy and all that's the way to go.
[19:40.340 --> 19:42.340]  It has nothing to do with green energy, though.
[19:42.340 --> 19:46.340]  See, they always mention all these reasonable things and then tag on the tax.
[19:46.340 --> 19:51.340]  Every nature show says all the animals on earth are going to die unless we have a carbon tax.
[19:51.340 --> 19:54.340]  And so people go, well, I want to save the puppy dogs.
[19:54.340 --> 19:56.340]  I want to save the otters.
[19:56.340 --> 19:58.340]  I want to save the polar bears.
[19:58.340 --> 20:00.340]  They can't swim.
[20:00.340 --> 20:02.340]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[20:02.340 --> 20:07.340]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[20:07.340 --> 20:09.340]  But the symptoms are there.
[20:09.340 --> 20:14.340]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[20:14.340 --> 20:17.340]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[20:17.340 --> 20:23.340]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[20:23.340 --> 20:25.340]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[20:25.340 --> 20:27.340]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[20:27.340 --> 20:32.340]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[20:32.340 --> 20:34.340]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[20:34.340 --> 20:42.340]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[20:42.340 --> 20:47.340]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[20:47.340 --> 20:50.340]  That's 866-295-5305.

[21:00.340 --> 21:06.340]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[21:06.340 --> 21:12.340]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[21:12.340 --> 21:19.340]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[21:19.340 --> 21:21.340]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[21:21.340 --> 21:23.340]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[21:23.340 --> 21:36.340]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[21:36.340 --> 21:38.340]  It's not about left or right.
[21:38.340 --> 21:40.340]  It's about a one-world government.
[21:40.340 --> 21:47.340]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[21:47.340 --> 21:55.340]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[21:55.340 --> 22:21.340]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[22:21.340 --> 22:25.340]  The capitalist package is working. A bailout is coming your way.
[22:25.340 --> 22:29.340]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[22:29.340 --> 22:30.340]  Pardon me.
[22:30.340 --> 22:32.340]  Back to the real world.
[22:32.340 --> 22:36.340]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[22:36.340 --> 22:38.340]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[22:38.340 --> 22:40.340]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[22:40.340 --> 23:07.340]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[23:07.340 --> 23:09.340]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[23:09.340 --> 23:12.340]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[23:12.340 --> 23:15.340]  It's true. Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[23:15.340 --> 23:17.340]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[23:17.340 --> 23:22.340]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[23:22.340 --> 23:25.340]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[23:25.340 --> 23:30.340]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[23:30.340 --> 23:34.340]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[23:34.340 --> 23:38.340]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[23:38.340 --> 23:41.340]  Visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[23:41.340 --> 23:48.340]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[23:48.340 --> 23:52.340]  That's 877-327-0365.
[23:52.340 --> 23:57.340]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[23:57.340 --> 24:00.340]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[24:00.340 --> 24:09.340]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all.
[24:09.340 --> 24:23.340]  The names in the middle, the places where you used to play.
[24:23.340 --> 24:32.340]  It wasn't in time, Jones. By the will connected. Your little protest.
[24:32.340 --> 24:35.340]  So merrily rejected.
[24:35.340 --> 24:41.340]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[24:41.340 --> 24:46.340]  Chocolate to businesses.
[24:46.340 --> 24:50.340]  But we can't just accept that business as usual is a bunch of criminals robbing us,
[24:50.340 --> 24:53.340]  where the crimes will get bigger and bigger and they'll go for everything,
[24:53.340 --> 24:55.340]  which they're now doing.
[24:55.340 --> 24:58.340]  And then after they get total power over us,
[24:58.340 --> 25:00.340]  they still have to keep squeezing and pushing.
[25:00.340 --> 25:03.340]  They're competitive. They're ruthless. They're control freaks.
[25:03.340 --> 25:05.340]  So what are they going to do?
[25:05.340 --> 25:09.340]  Well, I'll tell you what they do time and time again in history.
[25:09.340 --> 25:12.340]  They engage in hardcore tyranny.
[25:12.340 --> 25:14.340]  They start engaging in mass extermination.
[25:14.340 --> 25:19.340]  That's the final extension of all of this.
[25:19.340 --> 25:26.340]  What these people do over and over and over and over again.
[25:26.340 --> 25:32.340]  HR 2454.
[25:32.340 --> 25:39.340]  We're going to be giving those numbers out on air throughout the show today
[25:39.340 --> 25:48.340]  because Al Gore is in the Associated Press saying he's running a nationwide phone campaign
[25:48.340 --> 25:53.340]  to have people call the U.S. Congress.
[25:53.340 --> 25:59.340]  Call them and you tell those crooks that even if they support global taxation
[25:59.340 --> 26:03.340]  to the private offshore banks and support bureaucrats being on our everyday lives
[26:03.340 --> 26:07.340]  and satellite tracker boxes and all cars to taxes by the mile
[26:07.340 --> 26:11.340]  and taxes on all coal plants and power plants and home inspections
[26:11.340 --> 26:17.340]  and business inspections and taxes on beef and poultry and anything that generates carbon,
[26:17.340 --> 26:20.340]  taxes on breathing as the New York Times says it
[26:20.340 --> 26:25.340]  that even if they're for this evil, they can't vote on something they haven't read
[26:25.340 --> 26:29.340]  that the people haven't had one hour to look at.
[26:29.340 --> 26:33.340]  They're set to vote in the next few hours, ladies and gentlemen, call them now
[26:33.340 --> 26:38.340]  because if it goes to the Senate, it's going to be a done deal.
[26:38.340 --> 26:41.340]  And then they're going to slowly and incrementally implement it
[26:41.340 --> 26:43.340]  because if they come down and implement it overnight, people will rebel
[26:43.340 --> 26:45.340]  so they'll slowly bring in the taxes.
[26:45.340 --> 26:48.340]  Oh, it's only a 1% tax on your car by the mile.
[26:48.340 --> 26:50.340]  Oh, it's only a home inspection.
[26:50.340 --> 26:51.340]  Come on, it's for the earth.
[26:51.340 --> 26:53.340]  It's going to save you money anyways.
[26:53.340 --> 26:58.340]  It's green technology, but it's the power for them to control what you do,
[26:58.340 --> 27:02.340]  what you buy, what you build, everything.
[27:02.340 --> 27:04.340]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[27:04.340 --> 27:15.340]  So the Congress is in session right now.
[27:15.340 --> 27:19.340]  100th and 11th Congress first session.
[27:19.340 --> 27:20.340]  Got to stop this right now.
[27:20.340 --> 27:24.340]  202-224-3124.
[27:24.340 --> 27:29.340]  202-224-3124.
[27:29.340 --> 27:32.340]  And you mainly need to focus on the Democrats, though they've got some Republican
[27:32.340 --> 27:34.340]  saying they're going with it.
[27:34.340 --> 27:37.340]  And notice all of this is happening as the economy implodes,
[27:37.340 --> 27:41.340]  as GM goes under, as Chrysler goes under, is hacked up in pieces,
[27:41.340 --> 27:46.340]  handed off to foreign corporations with bailout money on top,
[27:46.340 --> 27:50.340]  just as a sweetener.
[27:50.340 --> 27:51.340]  Oh, yeah, they rape you.
[27:51.340 --> 27:53.340]  They make you pay the bill to be raped.
[27:53.340 --> 28:01.340]  202-224-3124, 202-225-1904, 202-225-1904.
[28:01.340 --> 28:03.340]  Call it.
[28:03.340 --> 28:05.340]  Pick a Democrat congressman in your area.
[28:05.340 --> 28:06.340]  Go to the campaign for liberty.
[28:06.340 --> 28:13.340]  They've got a good map on there for your state and who the congresspeople are.
[28:13.340 --> 28:15.340]  Call the media, too.
[28:15.340 --> 28:19.340]  Call the local talk radio and say, look, the climate bill.
[28:19.340 --> 28:20.340]  Call Congress.
[28:20.340 --> 28:27.340]  Not Michael Jackson, some sad, abused child with his demonic family,
[28:27.340 --> 28:33.340]  who then clearly became a pervert, who got away with it because of his incredible money,
[28:33.340 --> 28:38.340]  who bought into Madison Avenue's insecurity and into image so much
[28:38.340 --> 28:41.340]  that his nose was literally falling off of him.
[28:41.340 --> 28:46.340]  He's now died, reportedly, from a narcotics overdose.
[28:46.340 --> 28:49.340]  And they let him sit there, even though they knew he couldn't breathe
[28:49.340 --> 28:52.340]  until they called 911 until he'd stopped breathing.
[28:52.340 --> 28:54.340]  It does look very shady.
[28:54.340 --> 28:57.340]  And that'll be endlessly debated, and they'll throw that out.
[28:57.340 --> 29:02.340]  While the Iran overthrow continues, while the police state continues,
[29:02.340 --> 29:05.340]  while the depression continues, the next three months as they pass
[29:05.340 --> 29:08.340]  the total banker takeover, the federal takeover of all water supplies
[29:08.340 --> 29:12.340]  above ground and below ground, total federalization of the entire United States,
[29:12.340 --> 29:18.340]  total global taxation, hate crimes, speech crimes, banning free speech,
[29:18.340 --> 29:22.340]  federal felonies of the feds so you hurt somebody's feelings, cyberbullying,
[29:22.340 --> 29:26.340]  all of it racing through and passing because all we're going to hear
[29:26.340 --> 29:29.340]  is every facet of Michael Jackson.
[29:29.340 --> 29:34.340]  It is such a sick joke, and the police landing with a helicopter
[29:34.340 --> 29:37.340]  to get his dead body, oh my goodness.
[29:37.340 --> 29:44.340]  Some guy who dressed up in a clown outfit who liked to
[29:44.340 --> 29:50.340]  mess with little kids that he'd adopted that CPS had grabbed from other people.
[29:50.340 --> 29:54.340]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.340 --> 30:00.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.340 --> 30:03.340]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant
[30:03.340 --> 30:06.340]  new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[30:31.340 --> 30:33.340]  and keep the area sanitized for up to four hours.

[31:00.340 --> 31:05.340]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[31:05.340 --> 31:10.340]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:10.340 --> 31:15.340]  As known as the Bilderberg group, couldn't their objective be world domination?
[31:15.340 --> 31:18.340]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:18.340 --> 31:21.340]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[31:21.340 --> 31:26.340]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:29.340 --> 31:34.340]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:34.340 --> 31:38.340]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[31:38.340 --> 31:41.340]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[31:41.340 --> 31:43.340]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[31:43.340 --> 31:46.340]  They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[31:55.340 --> 31:59.340]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[31:59.340 --> 32:02.340]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California
[32:02.340 --> 32:04.340]  who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[32:04.340 --> 32:07.340]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[32:07.340 --> 32:10.340]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life
[32:10.340 --> 32:12.340]  that even when you do a great job for someone
[32:12.340 --> 32:15.340]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[32:15.340 --> 32:17.340]  there is no job security.
[32:17.340 --> 32:19.340]  You are always in danger of losing your job
[32:19.340 --> 32:23.340]  unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[32:23.340 --> 32:26.340]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[32:26.340 --> 32:29.340]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years
[32:29.340 --> 32:33.340]  and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits
[32:33.340 --> 32:36.340]  of working for themselves and not for others.
[32:36.340 --> 32:39.340]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity
[32:39.340 --> 32:41.340]  involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate
[32:41.340 --> 32:43.340]  that can help people lose weight
[32:43.340 --> 32:46.340]  and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[32:46.340 --> 32:50.340]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[32:50.340 --> 32:53.340]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[32:53.340 --> 32:55.340]  It takes very little money and if you're interested,
[32:55.340 --> 32:57.340]  MZ wants to talk to you.
[32:57.340 --> 33:00.340]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[33:00.340 --> 33:15.340]  Music
[33:15.340 --> 33:19.340]  A new dark age of micromanagement and tyranny
[33:19.340 --> 33:23.340]  where all life forms are taxed as criminals,
[33:23.340 --> 33:25.340]  where all human respiration,
[33:25.340 --> 33:29.340]  all biological activity is a crime against the earth,
[33:29.340 --> 33:32.340]  such a sick joke to the New World Order.
[33:32.340 --> 33:36.340]  In our carbon-starved planet, carbon dioxide levels,
[33:36.340 --> 33:38.340]  14 times lower than they've been in the past,
[33:38.340 --> 33:40.340]  but they don't care.
[33:40.340 --> 33:43.340]  It just figures that we'd be giving wrong phone numbers out all last night.
[33:43.340 --> 33:45.340]  That's just how we roll around here.
[33:45.340 --> 33:49.340]  But thank God listeners called and told us
[33:49.340 --> 33:51.340]  that we were giving out old congressional numbers
[33:51.340 --> 33:53.340]  because they're constantly changing them and switching them
[33:53.340 --> 33:55.340]  and rotating through them.
[33:55.340 --> 34:01.340]  We're going to have the latest numbers from the House of Representatives.
[34:01.340 --> 34:06.340]  And I'm going to get cartonimo to post these numbers
[34:06.340 --> 34:10.340]  and I want them tested.
[34:10.340 --> 34:12.340]  Maybe I should just go off air.
[34:12.340 --> 34:14.340]  Maybe I shouldn't even do it.
[34:14.340 --> 34:16.340]  Maybe I shouldn't even try to attempt to give regular numbers out on air.
[34:16.340 --> 34:19.340]  Maybe that's too much for us to do.
[34:19.340 --> 34:22.340]  Because it's like sitting here in a batting cage
[34:22.340 --> 34:29.340]  described with not five or six mechanical pitchers
[34:29.340 --> 34:37.340]  turned up on high speed pitching at me.
[34:37.340 --> 34:39.340]  It's like 10 or 15 now.
[34:39.340 --> 34:44.340]  I mean, it's just all off the charts.
[34:44.340 --> 34:47.340]  It's all off the charts.
[34:47.340 --> 34:52.340]  It's all out numbers to the Washington switchboard.
[34:52.340 --> 34:57.340]  This one, reportedly, we've tested and it's good.
[34:57.340 --> 35:03.340]  202-224-3121-202-224-3121.
[35:03.340 --> 35:07.340]  Hell, I'll just test it myself right now on air.
[35:07.340 --> 35:12.340]  There's only way to do it around here.
[35:12.340 --> 35:17.340]  Okay, I'm testing the phone number out for myself right now.
[35:17.340 --> 35:19.340]  Okay, that's a disconnected number.
[35:19.340 --> 35:21.340]  I'm going to go ahead and go to rebroadcast myself
[35:21.340 --> 35:23.340]  and get the proper numbers.
[35:23.340 --> 35:25.340]  This is too important.
[35:25.340 --> 35:54.340]  Music.
[35:55.340 --> 35:59.340]  We'll be turned around.
[35:59.340 --> 36:04.340]  And I'll keep this world from dragging me down.
[36:04.340 --> 36:08.340]  Gonna stand my ground.
[36:08.340 --> 36:12.340]  And I won't back down.
[36:12.340 --> 36:17.340]  Hey, baby.
[36:17.340 --> 36:21.340]  There ain't no easy way out.
[36:21.340 --> 36:29.340]  Hey, I will stand my ground.
[36:29.340 --> 36:33.340]  And I won't back down.
[36:33.340 --> 36:37.340]  Well, I know what's right.
[36:37.340 --> 36:41.340]  I got just one line.
[36:41.340 --> 36:46.340]  In a world that keeps on pushing me around.
[36:46.340 --> 36:50.340]  But I'll stand my ground.
[36:50.340 --> 36:54.340]  And I won't back down.
[36:54.340 --> 36:59.340]  Hey, baby.
[36:59.340 --> 37:03.340]  There ain't no easy way out.
[37:03.340 --> 37:11.340]  Hey, I will stand my ground.
[37:11.340 --> 37:15.340]  And I won't back down.
[37:15.340 --> 37:29.340]  Music.
[37:29.340 --> 37:36.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, we take this radio show very, very seriously.
[37:36.340 --> 37:40.340]  My family's going into total bondage right now.
[37:40.340 --> 37:44.340]  The New World Order that they've been setting up for decades is now upon us.
[37:44.340 --> 37:48.340]  No control of our wives, absolute tyranny, no bill of rights, no constitution,
[37:48.340 --> 37:51.340]  world dictatorship run by bankers.
[37:51.340 --> 37:54.340]  And I can't help it than I am on the verge of exploding.
[37:54.340 --> 38:00.340]  And I am disgusted by the bug-eyed, moronic, idiotic public
[38:00.340 --> 38:06.340]  who are running around talking about Michael Jackson all day when it doesn't mean anything.
[38:06.340 --> 38:12.340]  The guy is a disgusting, pathetic, weirdo clown with a bunch of foster kids
[38:12.340 --> 38:18.340]  that he got from, that were jacked from their families by the CPS.
[38:18.340 --> 38:20.340]  I mean, this is a demon-run government.
[38:20.340 --> 38:24.340]  And just everything about Michael Jackson makes me sick.
[38:24.340 --> 38:30.340]  And I can't stand the New World Order changing the subject off of Iran and the police state
[38:30.340 --> 38:36.340]  and the collapsing economy and the depression and the banker takeover of the carbon cycle
[38:36.340 --> 38:39.340]  and them telling the idiot public polar bears can't swim.
[38:39.340 --> 38:40.340]  I mean, I'm just sick of it.
[38:40.340 --> 38:42.340]  I've got the government's own reports.
[38:42.340 --> 38:45.340]  The ice sheet got the biggest it's ever gotten in 150 years.
[38:45.340 --> 38:48.340]  Coldest winter on record in 100-plus years.
[38:48.340 --> 38:50.340]  Giant ice sheet thickening.
[38:50.340 --> 38:53.340]  They're saying it's all melting and we're all going to die.
[38:53.340 --> 38:58.340]  I'm just sick of it.
[38:58.340 --> 39:01.340]  And there's no way I can't take this as serious as I do.
[39:01.340 --> 39:05.340]  Last night, I was just so upset last night, working until like one in the morning.
[39:05.340 --> 39:08.340]  And I tried to go to bed and I had to get up and start working again.
[39:08.340 --> 39:10.340]  And I can't stop it.
[39:10.340 --> 39:11.340]  I hate these people.
[39:11.340 --> 39:14.340]  I hate con artist criminals winning and having their way with us.
[39:14.340 --> 39:23.340]  Now, the reason I was flipping out earlier is all these numbers I've given out are good.
[39:23.340 --> 39:24.340]  They were good last night.
[39:24.340 --> 39:26.340]  They were tested last night.
[39:26.340 --> 39:28.340]  They did work last night.
[39:28.340 --> 39:31.340]  Numbers I was given today were working just a few minutes ago.
[39:31.340 --> 39:37.340]  So what they're doing is they are, I guess, getting so many calls that the lines are so busy.
[39:37.340 --> 39:41.340]  It says disconnected or they're playing some games or they flipped them over to other numbers.
[39:41.340 --> 39:47.340]  But as of three minutes ago, as we went down the line with four people calling all these congressional numbers,
[39:47.340 --> 39:50.340]  we found one that works.
[39:50.340 --> 39:53.340]  Now, I don't know if this is going to work in five minutes.
[39:53.340 --> 39:55.340]  It was working three minutes ago.
[39:55.340 --> 40:01.340]  This is the main capital switchboard for your representative and senator or others you want to call.
[40:01.340 --> 40:03.340]  Now, this is working three minutes ago.
[40:03.340 --> 40:05.340]  I don't know if this is going to work now.
[40:05.340 --> 40:07.340]  I have to do everything.
[40:07.340 --> 40:12.340]  Go find the numbers and keep yourselves from being enslaved by these parasites.
[40:12.340 --> 40:13.340]  I'm sorry.
[40:13.340 --> 40:14.340]  I got to settle down.
[40:14.340 --> 40:21.340]  I just, it'd be like if you come out in your garage and somebody's in it stealing all your tools,
[40:21.340 --> 40:23.340]  wouldn't you get mad?
[40:23.340 --> 40:27.340]  They were stealing a couple thousand dollars in tools.
[40:27.340 --> 40:31.340]  If somebody knocked your window out and stole your stereo, a couple hundred bucks, would you get mad?
[40:31.340 --> 40:33.340]  It's the violation.
[40:33.340 --> 40:34.340]  It's the raping.
[40:34.340 --> 40:36.340]  It's the being pushed around.
[40:36.340 --> 40:40.340]  It's that scumbag is getting in your business, in your territory.
[40:40.340 --> 40:42.340]  Well, this is light years worse.
[40:42.340 --> 40:47.340]  This is swarms of bureaucrats sent out to eat out our substance.
[40:47.340 --> 40:56.340]  It's so outrageously corrupt, so outrageously evil, and on top of it, it was 1,300 pages yesterday.
[40:56.340 --> 41:00.340]  Mainstream news is saying they've added 200 to 300 pages more.
[41:00.340 --> 41:02.340]  No one's allowed to see the thing.
[41:02.340 --> 41:08.340]  They're calling Congress and they're saying they can't give us the bill, and they're about to vote on it.
[41:08.340 --> 41:12.340]  That complete absolute criminal trash.
[41:12.340 --> 41:14.340]  And I try to quote, follow all their baloney laws.
[41:14.340 --> 41:20.340]  I try to be civil, but man, I can't take much more of your crap, you criminal filth.
[41:20.340 --> 41:22.340]  A bunch of Michael Jackson's up there.
[41:22.340 --> 41:23.340]  Most of them are pedophiles.
[41:23.340 --> 41:24.340]  It's come out in the news.
[41:24.340 --> 41:26.340]  Always trying to rape the pages.
[41:26.340 --> 41:30.340]  All the anti-pedophile groups constantly get caught raping kids.
[41:30.340 --> 41:34.340]  I just can't believe how scum filled this country and world is.
[41:34.340 --> 41:42.340]  I just want to live my life and be a decent person and be left alone by you criminal freaks.
[41:42.340 --> 41:45.340]  We just, okay, okay, all right.
[41:45.340 --> 41:52.340]  I try not to get mad, folks, and I, because I mean, I just really feel like turning over the desk, smashing windows out.
[41:52.340 --> 41:56.340]  You know, there's a reason I quit working out 10 years ago.
[41:56.340 --> 42:02.340]  Because back when I was running six miles every other day and lifting weights for two hours, four or five days a week,
[42:02.340 --> 42:08.340]  and when I could bench press 330 pounds, when I weighed 180 pounds and I could squat 600 pounds,
[42:08.340 --> 42:12.340]  I constantly wanted to tear people's heads off.
[42:12.340 --> 42:15.340]  And then when I just started eating a lot and drinking a few beers at night,
[42:15.340 --> 42:19.340]  it was like self-medication and I kind of burned out so I could operate.
[42:19.340 --> 42:22.340]  Now I've been running every day, lifting weights every other day,
[42:22.340 --> 42:27.340]  and on top of all this tyranny, I may have to stop working out because it boosts your testosterone level
[42:27.340 --> 42:33.340]  and I just am absolutely about to blow my stack, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:33.340 --> 42:36.340]  Ah, I just crushed.
[42:36.340 --> 42:39.340]  I just can't stand the new world order.
[42:39.340 --> 42:43.340]  Make me sick.
[42:43.340 --> 42:51.340]  Make me want to throw up.
[42:51.340 --> 42:54.340]  Oh, man, I just...
[42:54.340 --> 42:56.340]  This is a normal response.
[42:56.340 --> 43:01.340]  You freaks out there that are tuning in to me on AM&F and want to hear about that freak, Michael Jackson,
[43:01.340 --> 43:08.340]  that pedophile freak with all his foster kids he had with hoods over their heads.
[43:08.340 --> 43:14.340]  They didn't keep the kids because if you're a big fat pedophile, they leave you alone.
[43:14.340 --> 43:19.340]  So sick of them kidnapping good people's kids, Christian people's kids to hand them over to monsters like him.
[43:19.340 --> 43:22.340]  That shack of garbage.
[43:22.340 --> 43:24.340]  There, you want to know what I think about him?
[43:24.340 --> 43:26.340]  It makes me sick to look at him.
[43:26.340 --> 43:28.340]  It's a demon.
[43:28.340 --> 43:30.340]  It's a little clown outfit.
[43:30.340 --> 43:36.340]  Oh, he's in hell now.
[43:36.340 --> 43:40.340]  You don't want to know what I really think about things, folks.
[43:40.340 --> 43:46.340]  All you idiots out there that shoot your mouths off about how you want violence but never engage in it.
[43:46.340 --> 43:51.340]  You talk the talk, do you walk the walk, you little wimps?
[43:51.340 --> 43:55.340]  When this stuff really starts, it ain't gonna be fun.
[43:55.340 --> 43:58.340]  But God knows it'll probably be better than a bunch of pedophiles reeling us,
[43:58.340 --> 44:03.340]  a bunch of drooling, weak, chicken-necked scum that run everything,
[44:03.340 --> 44:07.340]  a bunch of people that don't know what wholesomeness is, they don't know what goodness is,
[44:07.340 --> 44:09.340]  that think evil's good.
[44:09.340 --> 44:15.340]  You can all go to hell.
[44:15.340 --> 44:25.340]  Just total tyranny taking over everything.
[44:25.340 --> 44:27.340]  And a bunch of slack-jawed idiots just everywhere.
[44:27.340 --> 44:35.340]  I'm in the gym, I'm on the treadmill, 7 o'clock, CNN's reporting Michael Jackson's dead helicopter picking up his dead body
[44:35.340 --> 44:46.340]  like it's the prophets retrieving the body of Moses or something from the mountaintop.
[44:46.340 --> 44:49.340]  Like it was Elijah.
[44:49.340 --> 44:51.340]  It's unbelievable.
[44:51.340 --> 45:03.340]  All the fanfare, just the ridiculousness of it were made to worship this weak, pathetic, bleached childraper.
[45:03.340 --> 45:06.340]  Everything's gotta be bombarded with him.
[45:06.340 --> 45:07.340]  All the hype.
[45:07.340 --> 45:10.340]  The whole New World Order is about setting the agenda.
[45:10.340 --> 45:14.340]  It's about setting the agenda instead of talking about real issues.
[45:14.340 --> 45:19.340]  I've talked about Ann Nicole Smith and O.J. Simpson and Michael Space Alien Jackson
[45:19.340 --> 45:24.340]  with his little elf nose and all the rest of it.
[45:24.340 --> 45:28.340]  I don't want to hear about him.
[45:28.340 --> 45:34.340]  When you drive through, drive through and the woman wants you to get a free smoothie if you'll sing a Michael Jackson song.
[45:34.340 --> 45:39.340]  She'd sit there and break the rules and cheat the company she works for just obsessing on Michael Jackson.
[45:39.340 --> 45:41.340]  You know why? Everybody was so happy.
[45:41.340 --> 45:43.340]  I was watching everybody at the gym.
[45:43.340 --> 45:44.340]  They were all so happy.
[45:44.340 --> 45:48.340]  They were all twittering around and talking and watching the TV and stop working out.
[45:48.340 --> 45:50.340]  I just worked out harder.
[45:50.340 --> 45:52.340]  You know why they were happy?
[45:52.340 --> 45:54.340]  Because they like thinking of somebody rich dying.
[45:54.340 --> 46:05.340]  Because they like thinking of other people dying and makes them at a petty subconscious level feel psychologically dominant.
[46:05.340 --> 46:08.340]  Bunch of sick freaks.
[46:08.340 --> 46:09.340]  You like that spectacle?
[46:09.340 --> 46:14.340]  Well, you're really going to like the spectacle of the social engineers regulating every facet of your life
[46:14.340 --> 46:25.340]  with the climate change takeover bill.
[46:25.340 --> 46:28.340]  So I'm going to give you a number that's been working.
[46:28.340 --> 46:32.340]  It's 800-833-6354.
[46:32.340 --> 46:35.340]  800-833-6354.
[46:35.340 --> 46:39.340]  800-833-6354.
[46:39.340 --> 46:44.340]  It's a good number to call the hijacking criminals that have hijacked the United States
[46:44.340 --> 46:49.340]  and are engaging in mass raping of the Republic and bringing you and your whole family
[46:49.340 --> 46:54.340]  and our entire history into a high-tech scientific dictatorship
[46:54.340 --> 47:00.340]  of forced inoculations, forced drugging, micromanagement of every facet and every detail of your life,
[47:00.340 --> 47:03.340]  chronicling and tracking everything you do.
[47:03.340 --> 47:05.340]  That's what I told you that for years.
[47:05.340 --> 47:12.340]  I'm not saying from their own documents, but now Pelosi goes to China and gives speeches about it.
[47:12.340 --> 47:15.340]  800-833-6354.
[47:15.340 --> 47:18.340]  800-833-6354.
[47:18.340 --> 47:30.340]  800-833-6354.
[47:30.340 --> 47:33.340]  And they're constantly changing the bill numbers.
[47:33.340 --> 47:37.340]  Now, reportedly, they've got different bill numbers with the climate change stuff in it.
[47:37.340 --> 47:39.340]  Desperate to race it through.
[47:39.340 --> 47:41.340]  Desperate to make sure nobody can stop it.
[47:41.340 --> 47:47.340]  Desperate to make sure nobody can read it, like that little bastard state senator Kirk Watson
[47:47.340 --> 47:52.340]  who's busy stealing everybody's property around Austin introduces and puts on a rider,
[47:52.340 --> 47:58.340]  a bill out of committee to kidnap your kids without Judge Jury warrant anything.
[47:58.340 --> 48:07.340]  Well, we found out about that and we had tens of thousands of calls to the governor's office and he vetoed it.
[48:07.340 --> 48:09.340]  All of you need to be arrested.
[48:09.340 --> 48:11.340]  Kirk Watson needs to be arrested.
[48:11.340 --> 48:13.340]  That's high treason.
[48:13.340 --> 48:17.340]  Piece of stink and filth.
[48:17.340 --> 48:22.340]  Ugh, God give me the control not to blow up, please.
[48:22.340 --> 48:27.340]  Ugh.
[48:27.340 --> 48:31.340]  And I just want to say that Matt was right.
[48:31.340 --> 48:33.340]  They've been in there frothing around.
[48:33.340 --> 48:45.340]  They changed the bill what last night, Representative Henry Waxman.
[48:45.340 --> 48:48.340]  And this is America Clean Energy and Security Act 2009.
[48:48.340 --> 48:50.340]  It's HR 2454.
[48:50.340 --> 48:56.340]  They've changed the bill.
[48:56.340 --> 49:00.340]  And it's now HR 2998.
[49:00.340 --> 49:03.340]  See all the bait and switches are changing numbers, killing numbers.
[49:03.340 --> 49:06.340]  So you can't even call them trying to avoid we the people.
[49:06.340 --> 49:09.340]  So only Al Gore's people have the numbers.
[49:09.340 --> 49:12.340]  I mean, when they do this lobbying, they've been caught, it's been in the news.
[49:12.340 --> 49:16.340]  They'll have dozens of numbers and they just turn some on, turn some off,
[49:16.340 --> 49:22.340]  rotate others over to dead ends where you can't leave a message.
[49:22.340 --> 49:26.340]  We found one of the numbers that's working as of 10 minutes ago,
[49:26.340 --> 49:39.340]  1-800-833-6354, 1-800-833-6354, 1-800-833-6354 to call the demonic degenerate criminals
[49:39.340 --> 49:43.340]  that have allowed the private Federal Reserve to steal $14.8 trillion in seven months.
[49:43.340 --> 49:48.340]  The demonic sickening filth that have overturned the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[49:48.340 --> 49:53.340]  and said the government can spy on you without a Fourth Amendment right, even in non-terror related.
[49:53.340 --> 49:58.340]  The demonic pieces of filth who are constantly getting caught having sex with their pages.
[49:58.340 --> 50:03.340]  The demonic pieces of filth that have engaged in every crime under the sun.
[50:03.340 --> 50:13.340]  You can call these scallywags, these treacherous, verminous, viperous, lecherous, scruffula-covered,
[50:13.340 --> 50:24.340]  leperous, maggot-headed, demonic, shell-out, effeminate, weak, cowardly, degenerate, predatory.
[50:24.340 --> 50:35.340]  Oh, I swear eternal resistance on the altar of Almighty God against all farms of tyranny
[50:35.340 --> 50:37.340]  over the minds of men.
[50:37.340 --> 50:40.340]  I swear total commitment against you.
[50:40.340 --> 50:46.340]  I swear to bring you to justice. I swear that one day you will be defeated
[50:46.340 --> 50:52.340]  and all of you need to commit 110% to righteously rise up, cut their all their spin,
[50:52.340 --> 50:58.340]  all their flim flam, all their rhinestone glory and bring them down.
[50:58.340 --> 51:11.340]  Noooo!

[54:07.620 --> 54:09.620]  I hurt myself today.
[54:09.620 --> 54:30.620]  I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel, I focused, I focused on the pain, the only
[54:30.620 --> 54:43.440]  thing that's real, the needle tears the hole, the old familiar stain.
[54:43.440 --> 54:54.160]  I never knew what focusing on the pain meant, until I started having migraines, cause it's
[54:54.160 --> 55:00.600]  in your brain, you can't get away from it, so the way I've gotten out of them is focused
[55:00.600 --> 55:09.600]  on them, and the pain rises to a level so great, that ceases to hurt.
[55:30.600 --> 55:37.600]  I will make you hurt, I will make you hurt.
[55:37.600 --> 55:44.200]  Alright, let me try to get focused, I got a lot of news to cover, a lot of vital information
[55:44.200 --> 55:45.200]  right now.
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.880]  The enemy moves in big jumps, and they always try to rush everything through, so you can't
[55:49.880 --> 55:50.880]  read it.
[55:50.880 --> 55:57.280]  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, there wasn't even a quorum present, there were 11 members
[55:57.280 --> 56:02.000]  the night before Christmas, when all through the house none a creature was stirring, not
[56:02.000 --> 56:09.320]  even a mouse, when along came a little goblin called the Private Federal Reserve, and stole
[56:09.320 --> 56:14.320]  all the presence of liberty and freedom, the great jewel.
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.080]  Same thing with the Patriot Acts, same thing with the Gun Control Acts, it's always the
[56:18.080 --> 56:24.240]  same with these crux, and then the willing accomplice media covers it up for them, so
[56:24.240 --> 56:29.800]  there's no coverage of the Energy Independence Global Warming Committee Chairman, Representative
[56:29.800 --> 56:36.320]  Edward Myke up there, pushing his propaganda on C-SPAN, by the way, are we recording that
[56:36.320 --> 56:44.440]  in the coffee room, thanks guys, great job crew.
[56:44.440 --> 56:48.240]  I mean I am on the edge of a red rage, I almost taught my desk over in here, because I mean
[56:48.240 --> 56:57.560]  this is war folks, this is so diabolical to regulate, I cover it in the Obama deception,
[56:57.560 --> 57:03.040]  they say every form of meat, fish, everything has a carbon footprint, all carbon is bad,
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.040]  there'll be taxes, regulations, national ID cards, national sales taxes, gas taxes, fuel
[57:08.040 --> 57:13.960]  oil taxes, plastic taxes, house inspections taxes, kids being brainwashed, forest compulsory
[57:13.960 --> 57:17.860]  service, I mean it's all, and folks this is the 200 page bill.
[57:17.860 --> 57:27.120]  They will not release the full text of HR 2454 that suddenly the American Clean Energy
[57:27.120 --> 57:50.820]  and Security Act of 2009, they've suddenly baited and switched the number to a new bill
[57:50.820 --> 57:53.940]  number, and it's just incredible, fade up C-SPAN, let's hear what this creature has
[57:53.940 --> 57:54.940]  to say.
[57:54.940 --> 58:02.200]  It's a drive competition in the energy marketplace, it sets ambitious and achievable standards
[58:02.200 --> 58:09.220]  for energy efficiency and renewable energy, they always call it solar wind and energy
[58:09.220 --> 58:12.780]  efficiency and not being wasteful, it has nothing to do with that, it's about steering
[58:12.780 --> 58:21.620]  and controlling the economy, it's about putting taxes on all of our businesses, it's about
[58:21.620 --> 58:27.540]  controlling our society, they always make it about innovation, it has nothing to do
[58:27.540 --> 58:33.180]  with that, I mean just everything is pure lies out of these people, well you'll find
[58:33.180 --> 58:38.180]  out all these Michael Jackson people obsessed with it, you're just born to be slaves weren't
[58:38.180 --> 58:54.300]  you, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported
[58:54.300 --> 58:59.100]  us in the truth movement for years, InterHealth Botanicals, this company produces the highest
[58:59.100 --> 59:04.340]  quality superfood around called Inner Food, my wife just loves the stuff, and now the
[59:04.340 --> 59:09.940]  health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food, his editor's choice award for best superfood
[59:09.940 --> 59:15.860]  of 2009, Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners,
[59:15.860 --> 59:20.620]  it would be impossible to blend this up for a better price and their formula really works,
[59:20.620 --> 59:25.300]  this is the real thing for the great healthy you need, try the Nutra Cafe, their great
[59:25.300 --> 59:30.500]  organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system, a truly healthy
[59:30.500 --> 59:34.700]  coffee that tastes great, and take it from me folks, it really does taste great, don't
[59:34.700 --> 59:46.900]  forget to try their other great products, go to www.enerfod.com, that's www.enerfod.com

[1:00:12.900 --> 1:00:23.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.780 --> 1:00:30.180]  I'm watching C-SPAN right now, House Debate on Scientific Dictatorship, the Micro-Management
[1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:36.740]  Taxation of Every Facet of Your Life, those pushing it say $2,500 more a year, that's
[1:00:36.740 --> 1:00:42.140]  only the beginning, this is the mandate to control every facet of your life, I'm gonna
[1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:47.260]  break down the bill, get into the Federal Reserve, the other attack fronts on our liberty,
[1:00:47.260 --> 1:00:53.500]  and take your phone calls, but let's turn that representative Bob Goodlotti, Republican
[1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:57.340]  Virginia's sixth district from C-SPAN, just randomly see what he's saying.
[1:00:57.340 --> 1:01:04.380]  The most CO2 free emission that we have, and this bill does nothing to promote it, it stifles
[1:01:04.380 --> 1:01:09.300]  the ability of the people of this country to have the kind of competitiveness they need
[1:01:09.300 --> 1:01:13.500]  in the world, to be able to get inexpensive sources of energy.
[1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:19.420]  So I strongly oppose this legislation, you know, we, Republicans and Democrats, offered
[1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:25.420]  over 200 amendments to try to improve this bill, they made in order one.
[1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:29.380]  In shutting down this democratic process, the Speaker of the House has taken away the voice
[1:01:29.380 --> 1:01:30.980]  of the American people.
[1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:36.220]  The simple truth behind this legislation is, it raises taxes, kills jobs, and will lead
[1:01:36.220 --> 1:01:38.780]  to more government intrusion.
[1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:46.060]  It is estimated this bill will raise electricity rates 90%, gasoline prices 74%, natural gas
[1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:53.060]  prices 55%, and that's in addition to the expected rise in all of those sources of energy because
[1:01:53.060 --> 1:01:58.380]  this Congress for the last two and a half years has refused to take up a real American
[1:01:58.380 --> 1:02:04.060]  energy plan to devote more to producing domestic sources of all of our traditional sources
[1:02:04.060 --> 1:02:06.780]  of energy and developing new sources.
[1:02:06.780 --> 1:02:09.860]  We support the effort for energy efficiency.
[1:02:09.860 --> 1:02:13.660]  We support the effort to promote new and alternative forms of energy.
[1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:18.220]  We do not support this kind of suicide for the American economy.
[1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:21.060]  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
[1:02:21.060 --> 1:02:22.060]  The gentleman's time has expired.
[1:02:22.060 --> 1:02:23.060]  The gentleman from California.
[1:02:23.060 --> 1:02:28.940]  Madam Speaker, I want to yield now to the gentleman who had been the chairman of the
[1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:29.940]  Energy Subcommittee.
[1:02:29.940 --> 1:02:32.060]  Lastman is the ugliest man on earth.
[1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:41.540]  He looks like a character of a demonic ferret, like a minion of Satan.
[1:02:41.540 --> 1:02:47.860]  I never go off of a book by its cover, but in this case, it fits.
[1:02:47.860 --> 1:02:51.660]  If I was an artist trying to create a demonic character that kidnaps children, it would be
[1:02:51.660 --> 1:02:52.660]  Henry Waxman.
[1:02:52.660 --> 1:02:53.660]  Hypothetically.
[1:02:53.660 --> 1:02:59.620]  Just look at that demonic ferret, like some kind of blood drinking bat or something.
[1:02:59.620 --> 1:03:03.100]  That's what it looks like, a vampire bat, how the vampire bats nose, you know, their
[1:03:03.100 --> 1:03:04.780]  nose is pointing straight up.
[1:03:04.780 --> 1:03:09.340]  They have those same kind of skull face nose, like his nose has been chopped off and the
[1:03:09.340 --> 1:03:13.380]  cartilage is kind of swollen and sticking out the front.
[1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:16.900]  They just took Bat Boy down off the screen, makes me want to throw up every time I look
[1:03:16.900 --> 1:03:17.900]  at him.
[1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:20.660]  You got the ones to rape our economy in America.
[1:03:20.660 --> 1:03:25.780]  This is the end of the Republic.
[1:03:25.780 --> 1:03:31.020]  This allows the bureaucrats to take over whatever they want and selectively do it.
[1:03:31.020 --> 1:03:33.900]  And I'm sick of these criminals.
[1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:34.900]  Let's hear it.
[1:03:34.900 --> 1:03:37.460]  Representative Rick Botcher has to say.
[1:03:37.460 --> 1:03:43.780]  Unleash investments in clean energy technologies that will create millions of new American
[1:03:43.780 --> 1:03:44.780]  jobs.
[1:03:44.780 --> 1:03:45.780]  Turn him off.
[1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:47.220]  It's always the same.
[1:03:47.220 --> 1:03:53.140]  It creates millions of jobs, yes, that you control, that your people control.
[1:03:53.140 --> 1:03:56.980]  Money's being given to Al Gore to build his new car company.
[1:03:56.980 --> 1:04:00.380]  That little criminal that says he invented the Internet.
[1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:05.140]  I mean, I've had it with you people trying to have managed economies that you sit over.
[1:04:05.140 --> 1:04:07.560]  You're nothing but looting parasites.
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:08.560]  You little bastard.
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:09.560]  All right.
[1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:12.380]  See, I probably shouldn't be on air today, folks.
[1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:13.940]  I'm trying to get control.
[1:04:13.940 --> 1:04:17.060]  Maybe maybe you guys should take those guys, like their audio is fine.
[1:04:17.060 --> 1:04:21.780]  Maybe I shouldn't be seeing the screen because looking at these guys getting off in their
[1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:27.260]  little suits, their little outfits and loving deceiving people and just the weak little
[1:04:27.260 --> 1:04:30.260]  smiley piggy faces they always have.
[1:04:30.260 --> 1:04:32.340]  They're just little cowardly pieces of garbage.
[1:04:32.340 --> 1:04:34.580]  I'm going to try to settle down.
[1:04:34.580 --> 1:04:35.580]  We've got Bob Chapman.
[1:04:35.580 --> 1:04:36.580]  Come on.
[1:04:36.580 --> 1:04:37.580]  Talk about the global warming takeover.
[1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:39.580]  A bunch of other bills.
[1:04:39.580 --> 1:04:42.780]  In fact, my pocket Constitution's not in here.
[1:04:42.780 --> 1:04:48.420]  I want to read Clause 5, 6, 7, 8 right through about the Federal Reserve saying Congress
[1:04:48.420 --> 1:04:53.580]  has no authority to regulate currency and credit.
[1:04:53.580 --> 1:04:57.420]  That's what it's expressly supposed to do, you lying piece of trash, Bernanke.
[1:04:57.420 --> 1:04:58.420]  You piece of filth.
[1:04:58.420 --> 1:05:00.780]  You piece of garbage.
[1:05:00.780 --> 1:05:05.180]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:05:05.180 --> 1:05:06.180]  this summer.
[1:05:06.180 --> 1:05:10.060]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:05:10.060 --> 1:05:14.660]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:15.900]  allows you to have.
[1:05:15.900 --> 1:05:21.060]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:05:21.060 --> 1:05:25.180]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:05:25.180 --> 1:05:27.580]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:05:27.580 --> 1:05:31.140]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:05:31.140 --> 1:05:34.820]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:05:34.820 --> 1:05:39.380]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:43.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:05:43.500 --> 1:05:45.180]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[1:05:45.180 --> 1:05:51.620]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:06:01.820 --> 1:06:03.820]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:04.820]  Well, you should.
[1:06:04.820 --> 1:06:09.340]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:10.340]  That's right.
[1:06:10.340 --> 1:06:15.860]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at FrontSight Firearms Training Institute
[1:06:15.860 --> 1:06:19.980]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[1:06:19.980 --> 1:06:24.900]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV
[1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:27.300]  pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:31.380]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:34.260]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:06:34.260 --> 1:06:38.860]  FrontSight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[1:06:38.860 --> 1:06:39.940]  attitudes.
[1:06:39.940 --> 1:06:41.420]  This is real.
[1:06:41.420 --> 1:06:42.420]  Don't miss out.
[1:06:42.420 --> 1:06:48.140]  Secure a FrontSight defensive handgun course, plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit or

[1:07:00.860 --> 1:07:06.020]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:08.220]  high energy and vibrant health.
[1:07:08.220 --> 1:07:13.100]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:18.380]  Alkavision Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[1:07:18.380 --> 1:07:22.860]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get
[1:07:22.860 --> 1:07:25.980]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[1:07:25.980 --> 1:07:31.580]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[1:07:31.580 --> 1:07:35.980]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[1:07:35.980 --> 1:07:37.300]  of your body.
[1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:42.860]  These organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:48.860]  Order your bottle of Alkavision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to Alkavision.com.

[1:08:00.860 --> 1:08:06.780]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:08:06.780 --> 1:08:08.780]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:08.780 --> 1:08:13.460]  We're going to have open phones in the shower.
[1:08:13.460 --> 1:08:15.460]  We're about to go to Bob Chapman.
[1:08:15.460 --> 1:08:23.180]  We'll talk some about the economy, but mainly the incredible activities of the Federal Reserve,
[1:08:23.180 --> 1:08:25.300]  big new developments there.
[1:08:25.300 --> 1:08:29.340]  Congress is not allowed to read the 13 to 1600 page.
[1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:31.700]  They won't let anybody see the final version.
[1:08:31.700 --> 1:08:33.340]  It's being written.
[1:08:33.340 --> 1:08:38.180]  Three hours of debate began 20 minutes ago, so they're only going to allow three hours
[1:08:38.180 --> 1:08:42.260]  of debate on an unread bill with hundreds of pages being added as we speak.
[1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:44.980]  It'll probably end up being 800 pages.
[1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:46.580]  That's normally how they operate.
[1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:50.180]  So they'll be writing it as they pass it, and then they know nobody's read it.
[1:08:50.180 --> 1:08:52.820]  They're also been caught slipping in and after it passes.
[1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:55.460]  Because nobody's read it, why not?
[1:08:55.460 --> 1:08:56.460]  Just total criminality.
[1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:58.020]  It's like the Texas Legislature.
[1:08:58.020 --> 1:09:03.340]  In fact, guys, queue up the video, it'll be on YouTube, Texas legislators vote more than
[1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:04.340]  once.
[1:09:04.340 --> 1:09:05.980]  It's a felony, but they just do it.
[1:09:05.980 --> 1:09:09.620]  They just sit there voting repeatedly and voting for others, and they just do it on camera
[1:09:09.620 --> 1:09:11.420]  and say, yeah, it's criminal, but we do it.
[1:09:11.420 --> 1:09:16.300]  If you don't like it, we'll have SWAT teams come slaughter you, because we rule you now.
[1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:19.300]  Government is nothing but a giant stealing machine, and they want to take your private
[1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:20.300]  property.
[1:09:20.300 --> 1:09:26.340]  They're going to do it with the Wetlands Clean Water Restoration Act, all water puddles, wells,
[1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:27.340]  underground water.
[1:09:27.340 --> 1:09:31.140]  All property in the U.S., total federalization, takeover, whatever they want.
[1:09:31.140 --> 1:09:35.420]  I already washed them with this model, still 20 plus thousand acres from people, and from
[1:09:35.420 --> 1:09:40.700]  94 to 2000 here, just where I live.
[1:09:40.700 --> 1:09:45.180]  The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, they're baiting and switching with
[1:09:45.180 --> 1:09:46.180]  two bill numbers.
[1:09:46.180 --> 1:09:52.460]  Now, HR 2998 is the one they added hundreds of pages to now.
[1:09:52.460 --> 1:09:57.300]  It was another bill number, so they're engaging in every form of trick, every form of legislation,
[1:09:57.300 --> 1:10:03.100]  legislative maneuver and manipulation of deception.
[1:10:03.100 --> 1:10:07.420]  The main switchboard for the Senate and the House is busy.
[1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:08.980]  You want to go to Campaign to Liberty.
[1:10:08.980 --> 1:10:10.780]  In fact, they've got a good list.
[1:10:10.780 --> 1:10:15.700]  Go to Campaign to Liberty, Ron Paul's site, guys, guys, go to Campaign for Liberty and
[1:10:15.700 --> 1:10:18.940]  just print me the numbers they've got, because every number we give out is good at first
[1:10:18.940 --> 1:10:20.540]  and then gets busy.
[1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:27.780]  800-833-6354, 800-833-6354, call, call, call.
[1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:36.020]  They're supposed to vote at six to seven in that hour, so six to seven eastern.
[1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:39.860]  That's five to six central.
[1:10:39.860 --> 1:10:44.780]  That's what, three to four Pacific, four to five mountain.
[1:10:44.780 --> 1:10:51.620]  These criminals, it's coming out that Bernanke ordered people fired, ordered people to do
[1:10:51.620 --> 1:10:56.620]  criminal buys with Bank of America ordered people to do, I mean, they're just a bunch
[1:10:56.620 --> 1:11:00.540]  of criminals, then he lied about it.
[1:11:00.540 --> 1:11:05.620]  That's coming out, and I know I'm hyperventilating and frothing because this is the greatest
[1:11:05.620 --> 1:11:09.860]  level of tyranny we've ever seen, and I've become so accustomed to it that I've been
[1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:13.860]  fighting it the last few months, but mentioning the bill a bit, but then it snuck up on me
[1:11:13.860 --> 1:11:16.740]  and now here it is, and nobody's talking about that.
[1:11:16.740 --> 1:11:20.140]  They're talking about Michael Jackson, who I'm going to talk about next hour, and the
[1:11:20.140 --> 1:11:21.580]  sickness of society.
[1:11:21.580 --> 1:11:27.340]  Bob Schaben, the international forecaster.com, the 200-page version we saw on Monday of this
[1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:32.540]  bill was bad enough, total takeover of any facet of society, any business, all carbon
[1:11:32.540 --> 1:11:38.780]  to be regulated and taxed by the feds and much of the carbon trading and carbon tax
[1:11:38.780 --> 1:11:45.140]  to be paid to private IMF World Bank Consortium, I mean, this is total bondage, total new
[1:11:45.140 --> 1:11:50.580]  form of government, just absolutely, Hitler didn't think of something this bad, Stalin
[1:11:50.580 --> 1:11:56.140]  and Mao didn't, this is just off the charts, Eugenics taking over Bob Schaben.
[1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:59.700]  Well, you certainly have covered it.
[1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:07.340]  I think the attack on the house is where we should go with this right now, and getting
[1:12:07.340 --> 1:12:14.700]  those numbers because of the busy signals is important to just rain down on these people,
[1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:20.420]  because you do have a section of Democrats there who are still in industrial areas that
[1:12:20.420 --> 1:12:25.020]  you might be able to corral.
[1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:35.540]  The bill will probably cost about a trillion dollars a year in taxes, and will probably
[1:12:35.540 --> 1:12:46.820]  lose about five million jobs, and how I know that is this has been tried and used in Spain
[1:12:46.820 --> 1:12:52.260]  over the last several years, and the report was just written on it, I don't happen to
[1:12:52.260 --> 1:13:03.380]  have it in front of me, and Spain said all of the jobs made from energy saving were lost,
[1:13:03.380 --> 1:13:10.340]  with the exception of a handful, and they lost millions of jobs because they did that,
[1:13:10.340 --> 1:13:16.100]  and this is what the plan that is being voted on was based upon, and as you said, they are
[1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:21.780]  throwing in everything but the kitchen sink to add to this bill, I mean, they're adding
[1:13:21.780 --> 1:13:30.540]  as the debate goes on, and there will be nobody who has read this bill, because it's impossible,
[1:13:30.540 --> 1:13:36.020]  I mean, it hasn't been completed, they're voting on it, and as you say, Alex, it's
[1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:40.500]  a ramrod special.
[1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:45.100]  It is, I'm just speechless, this is a post-industrial world, what Club of Rome Bilderberg have called
[1:13:45.100 --> 1:13:51.620]  for, I was poking around a few days ago, and found published speeches by David Rockefeller,
[1:13:51.620 --> 1:13:57.020]  published by him, I mean, this is direct from their sources, when he was in the 60s saying
[1:13:57.020 --> 1:14:00.940]  how they would have globalization where no nation was self-sufficient, where only the
[1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:05.820]  internationalists could control nations by making everyone interdependent, and how they
[1:14:05.820 --> 1:14:12.140]  would use environmentalism and global taxation and global regulatory systems to do it, and
[1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:18.180]  this is their plan on record, and all these foolish yuppies and people that want to feel
[1:14:18.180 --> 1:14:21.500]  good and feel like they're part of a team and the government's good, this has nothing
[1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:26.260]  to do with the environment, all the toxic waste dumping continues in the water, all
[1:14:26.260 --> 1:14:31.340]  the unchecked genetic engineering, the GMO crops, all the real threats to life on this
[1:14:31.340 --> 1:14:37.940]  planet, and it's just a cynical joke on taxing all carbon that's part of the life cycle,
[1:14:37.940 --> 1:14:45.020]  sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and they brag what idiots we are, that they're
[1:14:45.020 --> 1:14:51.100]  laughing that they're going to tax all carbon, I mean, this is unbelievable, and just two
[1:14:51.100 --> 1:14:54.500]  years ago I made in-game, and people would send me emails going, there's no plan for
[1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:59.820]  global tax, there's just global warming laws, even when Al Gore said it was a global tax,
[1:14:59.820 --> 1:15:03.740]  now they admit it's a tax, but then you tune in to C-SPAN, the Democratic congressman
[1:15:03.740 --> 1:15:08.940]  is saying, no, this is going to make jobs, it's a complete lie, Bob!
[1:15:08.940 --> 1:15:15.540]  It certainly is, and you know about the same time in the late 60s in the formation of the
[1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:24.820]  Trilateral Commission by David Rockefeller and Zabigno Brzezinski, he also said that
[1:15:24.820 --> 1:15:31.060]  the way we're going to go about this, and he described what we know today, is free-trading
[1:15:31.060 --> 1:15:38.460]  globalization, and I read what he had written, in fact I think it appeared in foreign affairs,
[1:15:38.460 --> 1:15:39.460]  but I'm not sure.
[1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:43.900]  Now that's where it's from, that son of a bitch, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I have children,
[1:15:43.900 --> 1:15:49.500]  I live here, these are criminals, Bob, how are you staying calm?
[1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:53.540]  I guess it's because I have older children, not younger children, but I have younger
[1:15:53.540 --> 1:15:54.540]  children.
[1:15:54.540 --> 1:15:58.220]  It's just so that Bob to really know we're going into bondage to the disgusting pot-bellied
[1:15:58.220 --> 1:16:02.820]  bureaucrats, the control freaks, I mean, it's not even the elites, I'm worried about the
[1:16:02.820 --> 1:16:07.340]  elites, but I'm worried about all their minions on power trips, because I'm worried that I
[1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:12.460]  won't be able to put up with them prodding me and poking me and inspecting me.
[1:16:12.460 --> 1:16:23.060]  Well, I think what it's going to do is, with this passage, if in fact it passed, it's going
[1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:31.460]  to, if we don't get the auditing of the Federal Reserve Act 1207, you can may as well kiss
[1:16:31.460 --> 1:16:35.900]  it all goodbye, and you either get ready to fight in the streets and get out of the country,
[1:16:35.900 --> 1:16:36.900]  one or the other.
[1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:41.500]  Yeah, let me just shut up, I interrupted you because I really am upset, folks, but what
[1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:47.020]  I'm upset by is, everybody cares about Michael Jackson and not America going to a completely
[1:16:47.020 --> 1:16:52.380]  engineered society run by a bunch of eugenicists in a managed economy.
[1:16:52.380 --> 1:16:53.380]  It's very upset.
[1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:56.100]  You were trying to get into Rockefeller and foreign affairs bragging how he was going
[1:16:56.100 --> 1:17:00.180]  to shut us down, and folks, you think the devastation is bad in the economy now.
[1:17:00.180 --> 1:17:01.780]  This was just the beginning.
[1:17:01.780 --> 1:17:08.220]  Now, our liberty, our economy, our free market is like a fire that's burned down to almost
[1:17:08.220 --> 1:17:11.580]  nothing that's about to go out, but we can rekindle it.
[1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:16.300]  Rockefeller and the New World Order, this carbon tax is nothing but a wet blanket over
[1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:22.580]  it ensuring a sterile environment where we're economically destitute so they can have their
[1:17:22.580 --> 1:17:23.580]  way with us.
[1:17:23.580 --> 1:17:24.700]  It's financial change.
[1:17:24.700 --> 1:17:28.300]  So explain to people what's happening, Bob.
[1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:36.980]  Well, it's hard to, in as much as you've covered so much of it, and it is what you say it is,
[1:17:36.980 --> 1:17:39.700]  and it'll probably grow from there.
[1:17:39.700 --> 1:17:46.860]  I mean, they've already ripped probably 80% of our industrial capacity out of the heart
[1:17:46.860 --> 1:17:51.980]  of the country, and now they're following up with a carbon tax, and you heard the man
[1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:58.660]  on the floor, one of the representatives, I forget his name, he was talking taxes of
[1:17:58.660 --> 1:18:04.940]  between 50 and 100% on all the things that we buy and we use.
[1:18:04.940 --> 1:18:13.060]  Now, if they were to get, this is another dimension of this, if they were to get this
[1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:20.060]  health bill passed, that would add another 20% because they want to put in a VAT.
[1:18:20.060 --> 1:18:21.660]  And you know it'll go up from there.
[1:18:21.660 --> 1:18:23.460]  They're just saying 20% to begin with.
[1:18:23.460 --> 1:18:24.460]  I mean, exactly.
[1:18:24.460 --> 1:18:26.660]  They're bum rushing us, Bob.
[1:18:26.660 --> 1:18:35.780]  Well, if you add 20, and let's say another 10, and you're already in for 35, you're in
[1:18:35.780 --> 1:18:38.740]  for 65% taxation.
[1:18:38.740 --> 1:18:45.020]  I mean, I'm talking about the little guys who are in the 22% tax bracket.
[1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:53.340]  I mean, if you're making good money, you and your wife, and you're in, say, the 32% federal
[1:18:53.340 --> 1:18:58.340]  tax bracket, and then you add the state, if you do have that, most states do, and then
[1:18:58.340 --> 1:19:02.780]  add these two taxes, then you're probably up to 70, 75%.
[1:19:02.780 --> 1:19:10.260]  You know, there's an old adage in history, once a country pays, its citizens pay more
[1:19:10.260 --> 1:19:14.620]  than 50% in taxation, it's ripe for revolution.
[1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:18.780]  We'll take the OECD, the private banking consortium, for those that don't know that in the Marshall
[1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:24.300]  Plan, they have stated they want world taxes at above 80%, 87%, they say, is their final
[1:19:24.300 --> 1:19:25.300]  goal.
[1:19:25.300 --> 1:19:29.580]  This is all on record, and you look at this, for somebody in a 40% tax rate, they're going
[1:19:29.580 --> 1:19:35.220]  to be right up at 80, Bob, but then all the real money is all offshore and allowed to
[1:19:35.220 --> 1:19:36.780]  not even pay any taxes.
[1:19:36.780 --> 1:19:37.780]  That's right.
[1:19:37.780 --> 1:19:40.460]  Special set of rules for them.
[1:19:40.460 --> 1:19:46.820]  Bastards, bastards, bastards, folks, if you're not, everybody, I want you to commit to defeat
[1:19:46.820 --> 1:19:47.820]  these people.
[1:19:47.820 --> 1:19:53.420]  I can break down, as an economist, with the international forecaster.com, as a historian.
[1:19:53.420 --> 1:19:58.500]  Well, where you see all this going, my God, then I'm going to get into the fellow deserves.
[1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:02.380]  Stay with us.
[1:20:02.380 --> 1:20:10.220]  The New World Order beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals,
[1:20:10.220 --> 1:20:13.820]  and now experimenting with viruses.
[1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:22.500]  Without a long term food solution, you will have just two options, starves, or surrender.
[1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:28.500]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:29.500]  What then?
[1:20:29.500 --> 1:20:30.500]  Then.
[1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:33.820]  Go your own healthy food and feed your family forever.

[1:20:45.420 --> 1:20:48.860]  carrots or tomatoes, for a little more than a penny each.

[1:21:01.140 --> 1:21:04.820]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:09.820]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:21:09.820 --> 1:21:15.980]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[1:21:15.980 --> 1:21:19.140]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:25.060]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:21:25.060 --> 1:21:29.500]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:21:29.500 --> 1:21:34.540]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:21:34.540 --> 1:21:38.860]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:21:38.860 --> 1:21:41.180]  The Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:21:41.180 --> 1:21:44.620]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:21:44.620 --> 1:21:45.620]  They're after power.
[1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:46.620]  That's what happened to you.

[1:21:54.260 --> 1:22:00.540]  In game, blueprint for global enslaved, you have been warned.
[1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:04.020]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:07.900]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:09.500]  than when drinking the water?
[1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:13.300]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[1:22:13.300 --> 1:22:14.300]  into the skin.
[1:22:14.300 --> 1:22:18.980]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to
[1:22:18.980 --> 1:22:21.820]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[1:22:21.820 --> 1:22:25.540]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[1:22:25.540 --> 1:22:30.420]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[1:22:30.420 --> 1:22:31.420]  comes first.
[1:22:31.420 --> 1:22:35.620]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:37.620]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[1:23:01.940 --> 1:23:02.940]  Recognize that sound?
[1:23:02.940 --> 1:23:07.620]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending
[1:23:07.620 --> 1:23:08.620]  up.
[1:23:08.620 --> 1:23:10.660]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[1:23:10.660 --> 1:23:15.740]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed, so
[1:23:15.740 --> 1:23:21.100]  for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[1:23:21.100 --> 1:23:24.740]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:26.940]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[1:23:57.260 --> 1:24:04.060]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[1:24:04.060 --> 1:24:12.060]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew, would you stand up but you?
[1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:14.060]  What would you turn away to?
[1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:19.060]  What would you do if you saw all of the things that sprung?
[1:24:19.060 --> 1:24:22.060]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:27.060]  What would you do if you knew all the things that sprung?
[1:24:27.060 --> 1:24:33.060]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew, would you stand up but you?
[1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:36.060]  What would you turn away to?
[1:24:36.060 --> 1:24:40.460]  1-800-833-6354, the main switchboard.
[1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:45.060]  Call these criminals and tell them you're aware of what they're doing, mainly Democrats.
[1:24:45.060 --> 1:24:51.060]  I see a message from the government, like every day, I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:56.060]  They wanted me about a sama or whatever, picture me buying a scam, I said never.
[1:24:56.060 --> 1:25:01.060]  I'm going to a hard truth, soldier spitting, I stay committed, give up, decide I lose commission.
[1:25:01.060 --> 1:25:06.060]  It's all a part of fighting, devil state, mind control, and all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:09.060]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[1:25:09.060 --> 1:25:11.060]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us a thieving rapist.
[1:25:11.060 --> 1:25:16.060]  Another push, season, mean another war for profit, all in secret so the public never fit to stop it.
[1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:22.060]  The Illuminati triple six all connected, stole the votes, they controlled the race and take elections.
[1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:27.060]  It's the skull and bones, freemakes and kill committee, see the dragon get in every city.
[1:25:27.060 --> 1:25:30.060]  All right, that is Paris, going back to Bob Chapman.
[1:25:30.060 --> 1:25:35.060]  Bob is trying to shut up during this segment and get into the new Federal Reserve Outrage in the next segment.
[1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:41.060]  That's a top story at infowars.com, but continuing, this is not just us saying this.
[1:25:41.060 --> 1:25:49.060]  The UN, the rest of them, they admit that they're going to cut carbon by about 30% in the next 10 years
[1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:52.060]  and then fade the rest of it in, but that's not even the issue.
[1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:57.060]  It's the regulatory power to selectively regulate whoever they want.
[1:25:57.060 --> 1:26:01.060]  You add that with a water grab bill or anything that has water above or below ground.
[1:26:01.060 --> 1:26:03.060]  That's the whole country has water underground.
[1:26:03.060 --> 1:26:06.060]  It's under total federal jurisdiction, no bill of rights, no constitution.
[1:26:06.060 --> 1:26:08.060]  I've read the bill on air.
[1:26:08.060 --> 1:26:10.060]  I mean, you cannot make up the magnitude.
[1:26:10.060 --> 1:26:18.060]  The healthcare takeover, all these anti-free speech bills, all these anti-gun forced inoculation bills,
[1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:21.060]  saying, yeah, we're getting ready to forcibly inject you.
[1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:25.060]  Arkansas state health officials saying, yes, mandatory vaccines are the law.
[1:26:25.060 --> 1:26:26.060]  They're going to force you to do it.
[1:26:26.060 --> 1:26:28.060]  I got the audio coming up.
[1:26:28.060 --> 1:26:31.060]  I mean, Bob, it's Mayday level here.
[1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:41.060]  What certainly is, way to the people find out that the gasoline prices are going to go up between 75 cents and a dollar a gallon.
[1:26:41.060 --> 1:26:45.060]  Not going to make them quite happy.
[1:26:45.060 --> 1:26:48.060]  Never mind all of the things that we've talked about.
[1:26:48.060 --> 1:27:05.060]  And you're going to see, because of the way this thing is structured, about at least 15% of the oil and refining companies are going to move out of the United States.
[1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:12.060]  And because of the tax that they're putting in place here for domestic producers.
[1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:26.060]  And no money will be invested in any further facilities in the United States in regard to the production of gasoline and byproducts.
[1:27:26.060 --> 1:27:33.060]  And by the way, Bob, by the way, Bob, we told everybody back in the mid-1990s, you remember reading your newsletter then,
[1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:43.060]  that NAFTA and GATT was going to deindustrialize this, it has, now you're telling them, and the oil companies are already saying they're leaving, and it's going to happen.
[1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:45.060]  So I hope all of you enjoy losing your jobs.
[1:27:45.060 --> 1:27:46.060]  Go ahead.
[1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:50.060]  Well, that's really the bottom line on it.
[1:27:50.060 --> 1:28:11.060]  You know, job losses, it again, as you pointed out earlier, is a method of bringing the United States and Europe and Canada financially and economically to their knees so that the people can be forced into accepting world government.
[1:28:11.060 --> 1:28:14.060]  This is the last and final move.
[1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:33.060]  And quite frankly, if this legislation is passed and we do not get 1207 and a bill behind it to do away with the Fed, plus we do not, if we do not get tariffs on goods and services,
[1:28:33.060 --> 1:28:45.060]  there is no other avenue for us legally to take in the United States, and we will have to take whatever action we think is necessary to change those things.
[1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:49.060]  This is up against the wall.
[1:28:49.060 --> 1:28:50.060]  This is crunch time.
[1:28:50.060 --> 1:28:56.060]  This is everything we've talked about now coming to a head, entering the final phase.
[1:28:56.060 --> 1:29:08.060]  I mean, I just hope listeners understand that this, we're fighting for our lives right now, our financial lives, our liberty, our culture, our future.
[1:29:08.060 --> 1:29:11.060]  It's just hellish, Bob.
[1:29:11.060 --> 1:29:12.060]  It certainly is.
[1:29:12.060 --> 1:29:15.060]  It's all of the things that we've been afraid of.
[1:29:15.060 --> 1:29:26.060]  In fact, the articles that you mentioned earlier on by Rockefeller, I use them as a model to write an article in 1967 for American Mercury,
[1:29:26.060 --> 1:29:31.060]  warning people that this is what was going to happen and this is the route they were going to take.
[1:29:31.060 --> 1:29:34.060]  And unfortunately, it all has come true.
[1:29:34.060 --> 1:29:36.060]  Now, here you are, Bob.
[1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:37.060]  Tell us about that article when we get back.
[1:29:37.060 --> 1:29:46.060]  Then we'll get into the head of the snake, the private Federal Reserve and how we can beat this and take some phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:50.060]  Stay with us.
[1:29:50.060 --> 1:29:52.060]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.060 --> 1:29:54.060]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.060 --> 1:30:00.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.060 --> 1:30:01.060]  Hello, friends.
[1:30:01.060 --> 1:30:02.060]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:30:02.060 --> 1:30:05.060]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[1:30:05.060 --> 1:30:07.060]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[1:30:07.060 --> 1:30:08.060]  We need to be independent.
[1:30:08.060 --> 1:30:10.060]  And food and water is the key.
[1:30:10.060 --> 1:30:13.060]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[1:30:13.060 --> 1:30:19.060]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[1:30:19.060 --> 1:30:22.060]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.

[1:33:26.060 --> 1:33:46.060]  All right Bob Shatman is our guest. Thank you for joining us today.
[1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:59.060]  InfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.com are the websites. His site is internationalforecaster.com. Your call is coming up here in a few minutes.
[1:33:59.060 --> 1:34:10.060]  But I wanted to get into another subject other than the big bill before us to allow the government to take over every facet of society
[1:34:10.060 --> 1:34:18.060]  and everything involving carbon, all carbon gases, a complete life cycle on this planet, Terraferma,
[1:34:18.060 --> 1:34:29.060]  third planet out on a standard number star system orbiting two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.
[1:34:29.060 --> 1:34:36.060]  Yes, carbon on a carbon-based planet is evil. The plants breathe it. It must be banned.
[1:34:36.060 --> 1:34:46.060]  800-833-6354, 800-833-6354 is the main switchboard number. It's busy off and on.
[1:34:46.060 --> 1:34:52.060]  Got a bunch of other numbers posted on the front page of infowars.com. Backup numbers, alternative numbers,
[1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:58.060]  big giant banner right there in the middle of the page. You cannot miss it. Please, your calls do matter.
[1:34:58.060 --> 1:35:08.060]  But also call, talk radio, call local news stations. You know, our alternative media power is getting to where we can cause a buzz.
[1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:14.060]  We can force stories out into the mainstream. We didn't have that before, but we still don't have what the big national media can do,
[1:35:14.060 --> 1:35:20.060]  even though they're dying. They can still, when somebody like Michael Jackson or Farrah Fawcett or Ed McMahon dies,
[1:35:20.060 --> 1:35:24.060]  they can hype that up and distract and cover up the news.
[1:35:24.060 --> 1:35:33.060]  Who cares about O.J. Simpson trying to steal back some of his own memorabilia at the Las Vegas hotel room compared to the rest of the world?
[1:35:33.060 --> 1:35:44.060]  Who cares about Michael Jackson dying? Who cares about Ann and Nicole Smith from Mahaya, Texas?
[1:35:44.060 --> 1:35:50.060]  I mean, it doesn't matter. This affects you. This affects your children.
[1:35:50.060 --> 1:35:55.060]  So Bob, finish up with their master plan to destroy the economy. What this managed economy is about,
[1:35:55.060 --> 1:35:58.060]  getting full control of us so they can then carry out eugenics.
[1:35:58.060 --> 1:36:12.060]  Got to get your bankrupt so they can control you. And then I want to get into this incredible behavior of Bernanke and the Federal Reserve.
[1:36:12.060 --> 1:36:14.060]  We got Bob there.
[1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:15.060]  Hello.
[1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:18.060]  Okay. They didn't have you faded up. Sorry. Go ahead, Bob.
[1:36:18.060 --> 1:36:23.060]  You're going to have this tremendous increase in taxes if this bill is passed.
[1:36:23.060 --> 1:36:30.060]  You also have your industrial heartland ripped to pieces.
[1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:40.060]  It's sort of like a giant ditch, but dig right down, dug right down the middle of the country vertically.
[1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:48.060]  And so they're going to pursue the economic and financial humbling of America.
[1:36:48.060 --> 1:36:53.060]  And that process has been underway for some time, and now we're seeing the fruits of it.
[1:36:53.060 --> 1:37:02.060]  And we're seeing the best Congress that money can buy laying down for anything that these one world is want.
[1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:16.060]  And you can expect more of the same. In fact, I still can't figure out why 258 congressmen co-sponsored Ron Paul's bill.
[1:37:16.060 --> 1:37:21.060]  You know, you keep on thinking, is it going to get out of committee?
[1:37:21.060 --> 1:37:27.060]  Maybe they know it's not going to. Or maybe they're going to change their votes.
[1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:32.060]  Or maybe the Fed really doesn't want to be around anymore.
[1:37:32.060 --> 1:37:36.060]  Maybe they want to turn everything over to the IMF.
[1:37:36.060 --> 1:37:41.060]  I mean, there's so many ifs here, you know, trying to figure out which way that's going to go.
[1:37:41.060 --> 1:37:48.060]  But no matter which way it goes, it's not going to be good unless we can cut them off at the pass in the House and the Senate.
[1:37:48.060 --> 1:37:53.060]  And by the looks of things, we're not doing so hot.
[1:37:53.060 --> 1:38:03.060]  I think the difference in the original vote was about 17 votes in order to allow debate.
[1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:08.060]  They weren't going to allow anything. And they were just going to shove it through without anybody even seeing the bill.
[1:38:08.060 --> 1:38:13.060]  It's incredible. It's just like a dictatorship.
[1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:19.060]  And so this is serious, serious, serious trouble.
[1:38:19.060 --> 1:38:27.060]  And I hope that all the people who are listening pass this information on about this cap and trade legislation.
[1:38:27.060 --> 1:38:33.060]  I did a lot of radio programs on this about over the last few months.
[1:38:33.060 --> 1:38:37.060]  And I never thought that it would get to this.
[1:38:37.060 --> 1:38:48.060]  I thought the whole thing would get shot down, which shows you the enormous power that these bankers in Wall Street and these other internationalist types
[1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:51.060]  have over our Congress.
[1:38:51.060 --> 1:38:53.060]  Yeah, they're not, they're not moving on every front.
[1:38:53.060 --> 1:38:58.060]  As I said, bum rushing us because they don't intend to pass it all.
[1:38:58.060 --> 1:39:09.060]  They are going for broke on totally taking over healthcare, federalizing that, totally taking over all industry, all activity, human respiration, plant respiration,
[1:39:09.060 --> 1:39:16.060]  listing it as a toxic waste, carbon, carbon dioxide, plants breathe, humans exhale, the plankton breathe.
[1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:23.060]  They are passing the total federal reserve takeover of society, not just unlimited money, but unlimited financial power.
[1:39:23.060 --> 1:39:27.060]  It's just, it looks like they're going to pass the Cyber Bullying Act.
[1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:33.060]  States are passing versions of it that says they arrest you, not even if somebody falls a complaint,
[1:39:33.060 --> 1:39:41.060]  if the government says what you said could hurt someone's feelings, you're charged with a federal felony for your speech.
[1:39:41.060 --> 1:39:48.060]  I mean, Bob, this is all the 180 degrees polar opposite of freedom.
[1:39:48.060 --> 1:39:54.060]  And they're going to end up shutting all the churches down too.
[1:39:54.060 --> 1:39:57.060]  And the synagogues.
[1:39:57.060 --> 1:40:03.060]  Except for a few 501C3 openly run by FEMA, clergy response teams.
[1:40:03.060 --> 1:40:13.060]  People just don't, they don't understand what's being done to them and, you know, thank goodness for your program.
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:19.060]  Because in a handful like it, the public would never know.
[1:40:19.060 --> 1:40:24.060]  I mean, you heard the speeches that were being made, how this was going to be so wonderful.
[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:28.060]  And we know it's nothing but a terrible lie.
[1:40:28.060 --> 1:40:33.060]  All we hear is, oh, we're going to have a depression if you don't give us unlimited money in October,
[1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:38.060]  and then things get worse, and they won't say where the money went, and then, oh, pass the bank or takeover bill completely,
[1:40:38.060 --> 1:40:42.060]  where everything will fall apart, or, oh, don't worry, the economy's going to be revived.
[1:40:42.060 --> 1:40:46.060]  We're going to put a giant tax on everything and selectively decide who can have businesses
[1:40:46.060 --> 1:40:53.060]  and federally fund Al Gore's new car company, and you'll pay your carbon taxes to a consortium run by Al Gore.
[1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:57.060]  I mean, they know this is going to shut things down, but when you watch CNN and everything else,
[1:40:57.060 --> 1:41:02.060]  they're saying help is on the way. This will rescue the economy.
[1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:07.060]  So the average yuppie out there thinks this is a stimulus package, this greenhouse gas tax.
[1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:13.060]  I mean, my God, Bob, this is talk about false packaging.
[1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:23.060]  Well, it is false packaging, and you get the diversions that you talk about that they play up the deaths of three celebrities,
[1:41:23.060 --> 1:41:33.060]  one of whom I knew fairly well, and I, you know, I just, you know, it's so complicated for most people.
[1:41:33.060 --> 1:41:43.060]  If we weren't able to come on the air and simply describe what's going on, they wouldn't understand it all.
[1:41:43.060 --> 1:41:53.060]  Hey, separately, I bet you 75% of Americans, maybe as much as 90% have never heard of cap and trade.
[1:41:53.060 --> 1:41:56.060]  Well, they're going to find out, aren't they, Bob?
[1:41:56.060 --> 1:42:06.060]  Unfortunately, yes. And I just, I don't know what people are going to do as they lose their jobs, they lose their homes,
[1:42:06.060 --> 1:42:12.060]  they lose their vehicles, they'll become street people, they'll end up in internment camps,
[1:42:12.060 --> 1:42:16.060]  and you talked about eugenics, which I studied very deeply.
[1:42:16.060 --> 1:42:23.060]  I had a library going back into the early 1800s, which I gave away to UCLA and USC some years ago,
[1:42:23.060 --> 1:42:26.060]  because I was the only one who wanted to read this stuff.
[1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:33.060]  And that's when eugenics were, in modern times, really born during the 1800s.
[1:42:33.060 --> 1:42:46.060]  And it is their goal to decide who is going to get married, who is going to be allowed to breed, how many children you can have,
[1:42:46.060 --> 1:42:51.060]  and then they will be tested to see what vocations that they will follow,
[1:42:51.060 --> 1:42:56.060]  and they will be put in appropriate government-run schools to do that.
[1:42:56.060 --> 1:43:03.060]  And the husband may work in New York, and the wife may work in Los Angeles,
[1:43:03.060 --> 1:43:07.060]  and the children may go to school in Illinois in a government school.
[1:43:07.060 --> 1:43:10.060]  The only way government, go ahead.
[1:43:10.060 --> 1:43:15.060]  They'll get together once a year for breeding purposes if they're allowed to.
[1:43:15.060 --> 1:43:24.060]  And this is all stated on record, and for those that don't know, I've heard NPR, National Petroleum Radio, many times.
[1:43:24.060 --> 1:43:28.060]  That's a joke. It's National Public Radio, but it's funded by the foundations posing as liberals.
[1:43:28.060 --> 1:43:32.060]  I've listened to eugenics radio, and they brag over the years.
[1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:37.060]  My wife, because it is, you know, better than a lot of talk radio, at least it's smooth and has a news background,
[1:43:37.060 --> 1:43:41.060]  so she listens to it while she cooks dinner every night for now eight years.
[1:43:41.060 --> 1:43:51.060]  And I mean, I hear them every week or two bragging, oh, this globalization will teach us not to live so well and not be so greedy,
[1:43:51.060 --> 1:43:54.060]  it will humble us, and they snicker and laugh.
[1:43:54.060 --> 1:44:02.060]  They, even the minions of this are like priesthood acolytes who enjoy the destruction of the Republic,
[1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:07.060]  because the only way the parasites can run everything is to bring it down and bankrupt everybody,
[1:44:07.060 --> 1:44:12.060]  and they know that they'll be in power in the new controlled paradigm,
[1:44:12.060 --> 1:44:15.060]  and they'll get the women, and they'll get the houses, and they'll get the new wealth.
[1:44:15.060 --> 1:44:21.060]  It's a system for criminal parasite, chicken neck, power tripping, scum.
[1:44:21.060 --> 1:44:29.060]  And that's exactly what it's been, and civilizations have tried this over and over again,
[1:44:29.060 --> 1:44:39.060]  and some partially successful, but overall almost totally unsuccessful, and so this is big for them,
[1:44:39.060 --> 1:44:46.060]  and we've got to stop them, and we've got to try that in the House and in the Senate,
[1:44:46.060 --> 1:44:54.060]  and if it doesn't work, then we're going to have no alternative, and there's going to be so many people unemployed.
[1:44:54.060 --> 1:45:02.060]  You know, we're looking at 20.4% right now, and John Williams has it at 20.8%,
[1:45:02.060 --> 1:45:09.060]  and we're looking easily a year and a half to two from now at 35%.
[1:45:09.060 --> 1:45:18.060]  This is all part of this syndrome that's being deliberately created, although I know they are concerned about it getting out of control,
[1:45:18.060 --> 1:45:23.060]  because they fear it might, and it might be in the process of doing so.
[1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:28.060]  The public is catching on because of your program and others as well,
[1:45:28.060 --> 1:45:39.060]  and I think the people are going to come to a realization that the only thing that they can do is overthrow the government.
[1:45:39.060 --> 1:45:41.060]  They're not going to have any choice.
[1:45:41.060 --> 1:45:43.060]  But Bob, next we make this point.
[1:45:43.060 --> 1:45:49.060]  That's why Northcom set up, that's why they have, that's why we know it's premeditated, not just their own documents,
[1:45:49.060 --> 1:45:51.060]  but all of what they've developed.
[1:45:51.060 --> 1:45:56.060]  They've got the youth brigades, they're saying the FEMA centers as we predicted will be your job centers,
[1:45:56.060 --> 1:45:59.060]  but you will be locked up at night because we can't have crime,
[1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:01.060]  and people will be begging to be led into these.
[1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:06.060]  They set up an economic implosion they designed to force you into their arms,
[1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:12.060]  then only the government stipend, only the government national ID with your credits can pay you,
[1:46:12.060 --> 1:46:17.060]  and then the government, you can only use those cards at certain government approved facilities,
[1:46:17.060 --> 1:46:21.060]  which are also owned by the private people that own the government and run the government,
[1:46:21.060 --> 1:46:27.060]  so they make the profits off of vertically integrating our economy and converting it from a free market,
[1:46:27.060 --> 1:46:32.060]  laissez-faire mega-engine of liberty and wealth,
[1:46:32.060 --> 1:46:41.060]  into a control freak amalgamation of kind of a Soviet slash fascist model with a fascist corporate combine
[1:46:41.060 --> 1:46:46.060]  sitting on top of the drive shaft, you know, down into the suboid mass,
[1:46:46.060 --> 1:46:50.060]  and it's just all integrated.
[1:46:50.060 --> 1:46:55.060]  The whole society is being integrated into their controlled paradigm,
[1:46:55.060 --> 1:46:59.060]  and they brainwash the general public to go along with this,
[1:46:59.060 --> 1:47:03.060]  and then they'll pose in the next phase as, oh look, we've got to have a total government takeover,
[1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:08.060]  because it'll provide the jobs now, and it's just, and then they're going to use class warfare envy
[1:47:08.060 --> 1:47:14.060]  with a giant mass of blue collar and yuppies that lost their money,
[1:47:14.060 --> 1:47:20.060]  which will then go join more devilish cores of enforcers to be able to get their wealth back.
[1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:25.060]  They'll now murk as social workers and everything else to really squeeze us.
[1:47:25.060 --> 1:47:28.060]  It's going to just completely blow up and be a giant bloodbath.
[1:47:28.060 --> 1:47:31.060]  I mean, look, people aren't going to put up with it.
[1:47:31.060 --> 1:47:36.060]  None of us who are real men and have actually seen a little bit of violence want this, believe me,
[1:47:36.060 --> 1:47:41.060]  but we cannot have chicken necks urinating all over our backs.
[1:47:41.060 --> 1:47:45.060]  Well, I'll tell you this, if these people, if it comes to that,
[1:47:45.060 --> 1:47:49.060]  if these people think they're going to get away, they're mistaken.
[1:47:49.060 --> 1:47:51.060]  They are not going to get away.
[1:47:51.060 --> 1:47:58.060]  So this is going to be a fight to the very end, and we may lose half the population in the world.
[1:47:58.060 --> 1:48:07.060]  It could be involved even with nuclear war, but it's going to happen.
[1:48:07.060 --> 1:48:11.060]  But, you know, so many times with a bully or a control freak or a thug,
[1:48:11.060 --> 1:48:13.060]  they think they're going to win.
[1:48:13.060 --> 1:48:17.060]  They got hubris until you finally start slaying back and don't stop.
[1:48:17.060 --> 1:48:20.060]  And they're just going to go ahead and push it right over the edge.
[1:48:20.060 --> 1:48:23.060]  It's just unbelievable, Bob.
[1:48:23.060 --> 1:48:25.060]  Well, you're right about that.
[1:48:25.060 --> 1:48:30.060]  They are going for all the marbles, and they're not going to get them,
[1:48:30.060 --> 1:48:36.060]  but we're going to have to pay a heck of a price to keep assemblance of freedom
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:42.060]  and perhaps total freedom after that, but it's not going to be good.
[1:48:42.060 --> 1:48:47.060]  What is this exercise they're having in July in the United States with foreign troops?
[1:48:47.060 --> 1:48:50.060]  Of course, we've had foreign troops here for many years,
[1:48:50.060 --> 1:48:53.060]  and they even have bases here in the United States,
[1:48:53.060 --> 1:49:00.060]  but they're having those maneuvers, and that's just a prelude to bringing foreign troops in.
[1:49:00.060 --> 1:49:03.060]  And of course, that's a two-edged sword.
[1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:08.060]  You know, let's say Argentina decides to set 100,000 troops in
[1:49:08.060 --> 1:49:13.060]  to help the U.S. government quell the wild beasts that inhabit the country.
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:19.060]  And once those people are on planes traveling to the United States,
[1:49:19.060 --> 1:49:23.060]  the government in Argentina is going to get overthrown.
[1:49:23.060 --> 1:49:26.060]  I mean, they don't get it.
[1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:28.060]  They're not going to be able to win that battle.
[1:49:28.060 --> 1:49:33.060]  Well, for those that don't know... Listen, any foreign troop that comes in the United States,
[1:49:33.060 --> 1:49:37.060]  they're toast.
[1:49:37.060 --> 1:49:44.060]  I mean, they will be the number one target just for the heck of it.
[1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:46.060]  Yeah, that's throwing the gauntlet down.
[1:49:46.060 --> 1:49:49.060]  For those that don't know, it's official policy.
[1:49:49.060 --> 1:49:53.060]  Baltimore News, Toronto Star,
[1:49:53.060 --> 1:49:58.060]  Mexican and Canadian troops will be used here.
[1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:03.060]  Then, what, two months ago, they had a drill in Florida with troops from 11 Latin American nations
[1:50:03.060 --> 1:50:08.060]  to assist the U.S. during a terror attack, doing beach landing drills.
[1:50:08.060 --> 1:50:15.060]  And Colonel Craig Roberts, his nephew, was at West Point,
[1:50:15.060 --> 1:50:19.060]  and the general came through, former General Wesley Clark.
[1:50:19.060 --> 1:50:23.060]  He was at McAfrey and said,
[1:50:23.060 --> 1:50:25.060]  we're going to use foreign troops to quell Americans,
[1:50:25.060 --> 1:50:29.060]  and now it's mainstream news, and they're having ardent sentry in these others,
[1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:34.060]  and it says troops from 10 other nations on the ground in the U.S.
[1:50:34.060 --> 1:50:37.060]  practicing putting down insurrection.
[1:50:37.060 --> 1:50:39.060]  And the Army Times admits it.
[1:50:39.060 --> 1:50:42.060]  I mean, Bob, this is out in the open.
[1:50:42.060 --> 1:50:48.060]  That's fine. They're not going to go home. I'll tell you that.
[1:50:48.060 --> 1:50:50.060]  They're just going to acclimate us, though.
[1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:55.060]  Oh, look, the Chilean troops are here to help in a car wreck or help with a soup kitchen.
[1:50:55.060 --> 1:50:58.060]  Remember the Mexican troops at Katrina with a soup kitchen?
[1:50:58.060 --> 1:51:27.060]  It's all part of PR.

[1:52:01.060 --> 1:52:07.060]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.060 --> 1:52:13.060]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:52:13.060 --> 1:52:20.060]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:22.060]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[1:52:22.060 --> 1:52:24.060]  Yeah, fudged since D1 in this election.
[1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:28.060]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:52:28.060 --> 1:52:34.060]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[1:52:34.060 --> 1:53:01.060]  that's fascist.
[1:53:01.060 --> 1:53:06.060]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.

[1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:12.060]  I said I'd take calls from Bob Chapman, but we just ran out of time, so Mark, Stuart, Craig, Jim, Regina, Tim, Dave.
[1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:15.060]  I'm going to just get to all your calls when we start the next hour.
[1:54:15.060 --> 1:54:19.060]  We'll start the Prison Planet.tv transmission today with your phone calls.
[1:54:19.060 --> 1:54:31.060]  And then I'm going to get into other huge news of the day, like the Private Federal Reserve.
[1:54:31.060 --> 1:54:34.060]  I want to ask Bob about this before he leaves us so we can get his take on it,
[1:54:34.060 --> 1:54:37.060]  and then I'll cover it more coming up in the next hour.
[1:54:37.060 --> 1:54:42.060]  He's getting questioned yesterday before the House Banking Committee,
[1:54:42.060 --> 1:54:46.060]  and Ron Paul couldn't be there for some reason.
[1:54:46.060 --> 1:54:50.060]  Neither could Cassinage and others that asked pretty good questions.
[1:54:50.060 --> 1:54:57.060]  But it gets brought up that Congress investigates the Fed, and the Federal Reserve says,
[1:54:57.060 --> 1:55:01.060]  well, that'd be a takeover, a hijacking, like a coup d'etat by Congress,
[1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:05.060]  and also would make the economy collapse, so financial terrorism.
[1:55:05.060 --> 1:55:07.060]  If you do this, everything will collapse.
[1:55:07.060 --> 1:55:12.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, when I saw that, we played it on Jason's show last night.
[1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:18.060]  I instantly called Aaron, and he posted the video and a quick article we wrote together,
[1:55:18.060 --> 1:55:22.060]  and it's up on infowars.com right now.
[1:55:22.060 --> 1:55:28.060]  Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution states to coin money,
[1:55:28.060 --> 1:55:34.060]  regulate the value thereof, and a foreign coin, and to fix the standard of weights and measures.
[1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:36.060]  That's Article 1.
[1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:39.060]  All legislative powers here in granted shall be vested in Congress of the United States,
[1:55:39.060 --> 1:55:42.060]  which shall consist of all Senate and House representatives.
[1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:48.060]  And it goes on to say they're the sole power of this, of coining, issuing money, banking,
[1:55:48.060 --> 1:55:53.060]  to provide for the punishment of counterfeiters the securities and current coin of the United States.
[1:55:53.060 --> 1:55:57.060]  That means, in a real world, they would arrest the Federal Reserve,
[1:55:57.060 --> 1:56:02.060]  to constitute tribunals in fear to the Supreme Court, so they set up the courts,
[1:56:02.060 --> 1:56:06.060]  to define and punish pirates and felonies committed on the high seas,
[1:56:06.060 --> 1:56:09.060]  and offenses against the law of nations, so they should arrest the Federal Reserve on that,
[1:56:09.060 --> 1:56:16.060]  to declare war, grant letters of marquee, and reprisals, and make rules concerning captures on land and water.
[1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:22.060]  Congress runs the President and everybody else, but they're told by the private Fed to sit down and shut up.
[1:56:22.060 --> 1:56:28.060]  In closing, Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com, how asinine is it to have Bernanke get up there
[1:56:28.060 --> 1:56:34.060]  and say Congress cannot be involved in any way in the issuance and control of currency and credit?
[1:56:34.060 --> 1:56:42.060]  Well, it's a outright, as you just expressed, via the Constitution, an outright lie.
[1:56:42.060 --> 1:56:50.060]  And it's another one of their threats. Bernanke lied when he was up there yesterday. Everybody knows it.
[1:56:50.060 --> 1:56:57.060]  And hopefully that will tell upon taking the bill out of the committee onto the House floor.
[1:56:57.060 --> 1:57:07.060]  In tomorrow's issue, and also a week from tomorrow, and that issue, I'll have a lot about the Federal Reserve.
[1:57:07.060 --> 1:57:18.060]  But what they're trying to give to the Fed here, which is ridiculous, is for the Fed to regulate everything in finance in the United States
[1:57:18.060 --> 1:57:28.060]  and be in partnership with Europe for starters in regulating all of the things that are done financially.
[1:57:28.060 --> 1:57:29.060]  Yeah, global.
[1:57:29.060 --> 1:57:39.060]  Right. And it's just nothing but a dictatorial power move right in the middle of the time when they're being attacked
[1:57:39.060 --> 1:57:50.060]  and people want to investigate them. And if people could only understand, I could only spend so much time in the air,
[1:57:50.060 --> 1:57:56.060]  but if people could only understand what these people are doing to them, I mean, we just went through this cap-and-trade thing,
[1:57:56.060 --> 1:58:04.060]  and now we're onto the Fed thing. And these are monstrous things that are being done to the American people.
[1:58:04.060 --> 1:58:13.060]  I mean, right now, between now and September the 30th, the Fed is going to buy in the market from money made out of thin air
[1:58:13.060 --> 1:58:21.060]  $3 trillion worth of U.S. Treasuries, agency securities, and toxic waste.
[1:58:21.060 --> 1:58:25.060]  I mean, inflation's got to go absolutely ballistic.
[1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:30.060]  And our tax money's be paying for all that. Bob Chapman will see you next Friday at internationalforecaster.com.
[1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:33.060]  Have a great weekend. Godspeed.
[1:58:33.060 --> 1:58:35.060]  Thank you. Same to you, Alex.
[1:58:35.060 --> 1:59:04.060]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the Truth Movement for years.

[2:00:13.060 --> 2:00:24.060]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.060 --> 2:00:31.060]  All right, we're halfway into this Friday Transmission 26 day of June 2009.
[2:00:31.060 --> 2:00:37.060]  All freedom lovers should be in attack formation because we've got incoming big capital ships.
[2:00:37.060 --> 2:00:44.060]  You can order or bombarding the Republic. Open giant, complete takeover of all industry, your homes, private property.
[2:00:44.060 --> 2:00:50.060]  The carbon takeover, the carbon tax takeover is in full swing. The debate ends in about one hour.
[2:00:50.060 --> 2:00:56.060]  They're set to vote on it coming up at six o'clock central this evening.
[2:00:56.060 --> 2:01:04.060]  They say six to seven coming up tonight. So we'll be watching this nightmare as it unfolds.
[2:01:04.060 --> 2:01:09.060]  So the next big attack salvo, we got that torpedo cruiser coming in firing at us.
[2:01:09.060 --> 2:01:13.060]  It's self a totaled martial law takeover, but the enemy's doing overkill.
[2:01:13.060 --> 2:01:18.060]  All these new bureaucracies and new powers so they can slice it up between themselves.
[2:01:18.060 --> 2:01:23.060]  And so it's not just one, one dragon we got a slave, but a multi-headed hydra.
[2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:26.060]  Total Federal Reserve dictatorship admitted by the news.
[2:01:26.060 --> 2:01:32.060]  They say it's good, ruling everything from a hot dog stand to a beauty salon, to a car dealership,
[2:01:32.060 --> 2:01:35.060]  to a shopping mall, to a factory. I'm going to go over that.
[2:01:35.060 --> 2:01:43.060]  And Ed Bernanke, Ben Bernanke up on C-SPAN saying Congress has no authority to regulate money.
[2:01:43.060 --> 2:01:49.060]  Well, that's Article 1, Section 8. You're congenital, degenerate, criminal, and you need to be arrested.
[2:01:49.060 --> 2:01:53.060]  You're a liar as well. So we're taking your calls right now.
[2:01:53.060 --> 2:01:59.060]  I appreciate everybody holding. I'll cut calls for 20, 30 minutes and then I'm getting back into this big Bernanke thing.
[2:01:59.060 --> 2:02:03.060]  You want me to hear me talk about Michael Jackson? Okay, I'll talk about Michael Jackson for you.
[2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:05.060]  You don't care your whole birthright's being stolen.
[2:02:05.060 --> 2:02:08.060]  You want to worry about some drug addict pedophile? Fine.
[2:02:08.060 --> 2:02:12.060]  We'll talk about drug addict pedophiles coming up as well. But you're not going to like what you hear.
[2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:14.060]  I know a lot of you are fans of him.
[2:02:14.060 --> 2:02:18.060]  And I'm not saying the guy didn't have some music. It was, I guess, okay.
[2:02:18.060 --> 2:02:21.060]  Kind of retarded, but the point is, I'm sorry.
[2:02:21.060 --> 2:02:25.060]  I mean, the point is, I knew this guy was a nerve when I was eight years old.
[2:02:25.060 --> 2:02:27.060]  All the other kids were running out with gloves on their hands.
[2:02:27.060 --> 2:02:30.060]  They were dead with one of those. Does anybody have any style out there anymore?
[2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:34.060]  But anyways, the point is, and some James Brown, baby, that's some good stuff.
[2:02:34.060 --> 2:02:38.060]  No, but I feel good. All right.
[2:02:38.060 --> 2:02:45.060]  Living in America with bureaucrats ruling over you, baby.
[2:02:45.060 --> 2:02:51.060]  So I can play some James Brown. I can sing to it for you like I did last week.
[2:02:51.060 --> 2:02:56.060]  All right, let's go ahead and or how about some Jimi Hendrix?
[2:02:56.060 --> 2:03:01.060]  Hey, Jude, I shot my woman down. Shot it down.
[2:03:01.060 --> 2:03:04.060]  Cue that up. Let's play some of that later.
[2:03:04.060 --> 2:03:08.060]  All right. Listen, the battle is now call these criminals in Congress.
[2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:14.060]  Tell them no, 800-833-6354, 800-833-6354.
[2:03:14.060 --> 2:03:16.060]  I'll give you more detail. No one can read the bill.
[2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:21.060]  We only have an earlier version that was one tenth as long.
[2:03:21.060 --> 2:03:25.060]  I don't know. That'd be, I don't know.
[2:03:25.060 --> 2:03:27.060]  Now it's over 1,300 pages. Now it's over 1,300.
[2:03:27.060 --> 2:03:33.060]  So yeah, basically, basically a tiny fraction, and it was bad enough.
[2:03:33.060 --> 2:03:36.060]  And now it's just unbelievable. Let's talk to Mark in Oregon.
[2:03:36.060 --> 2:03:38.060]  Mark here on the air.
[2:03:38.060 --> 2:03:39.060]  Well, good morning, Alex.
[2:03:39.060 --> 2:03:40.060]  Hey, buddy.
[2:03:40.060 --> 2:03:44.060]  Alex, you know, toward hitting these bastards where it really hurts,
[2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:50.060]  a movie totally exposing and ripping the cover off of pedophilia in the United States
[2:03:50.060 --> 2:03:55.060]  as it's practiced by much or most of these higher echelons of the New World Order,
[2:03:55.060 --> 2:03:59.060]  as well as throughout the world, this is a practice.
[2:03:59.060 --> 2:04:04.060]  It only gives power and more power to evil, and evil grows through it,
[2:04:04.060 --> 2:04:06.060]  and that's kind of an involved process.
[2:04:06.060 --> 2:04:08.060]  But that's the way that it turns out.
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:11.060]  Yeah, hurting the innocence better, you tie a millstone around your neck
[2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:13.060]  than hurt one of these little ones.
[2:04:13.060 --> 2:04:15.060]  Yeah, I think it would be a...
[2:04:15.060 --> 2:04:18.060]  How volunteer to tie the millstones around their neck all day long?
[2:04:18.060 --> 2:04:23.060]  I really think it would be a multi-megaton blast of truth and exposure
[2:04:23.060 --> 2:04:28.060]  upon this highly evil practice, which, you know, like I say,
[2:04:28.060 --> 2:04:31.060]  it just is one of their main energizers.
[2:04:31.060 --> 2:04:36.060]  It's what really gives them that demonic ability of having no problems.
[2:04:36.060 --> 2:04:37.060]  It's their treat.
[2:04:37.060 --> 2:04:39.060]  It's their treat.
[2:04:39.060 --> 2:04:41.060]  Yeah, it's their treat. It's their dessert.
[2:04:41.060 --> 2:04:42.060]  It's their sacrament.
[2:04:42.060 --> 2:04:43.060]  That's right.
[2:04:43.060 --> 2:04:46.060]  I like to give them a sacrament of a bullet between the eyes.
[2:04:46.060 --> 2:04:49.060]  After they have a jury of their peers, of course,
[2:04:49.060 --> 2:04:52.060]  we can just hang them.
[2:04:52.060 --> 2:04:54.060]  We'll be right back. Thank you, Mark.
[2:04:54.060 --> 2:05:17.060]  Hurry through your calls. We'll get back. Stay with us.
[2:05:24.060 --> 2:05:31.060]  We'll be right back.
[2:05:54.060 --> 2:06:01.060]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:34.060]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:06:54.060 --> 2:07:01.060]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[2:07:24.060 --> 2:07:34.060]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:07:54.060 --> 2:08:04.060]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:29.060]  This is Alex Jones, your host. We have got to defeat the New World Order.
[2:08:29.060 --> 2:08:33.060]  We've got to get angry.
[2:08:33.060 --> 2:08:35.060]  We've got to get focused.
[2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:42.060]  We've got to decide that it's good and wholesome to hate tyranny and corruption
[2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:45.060]  and people telling you how to live and what to do.
[2:08:45.060 --> 2:08:47.060]  They've got all these excuses, all these reasons.
[2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:53.060]  They're a pack of criminal degenerate liars.
[2:08:53.060 --> 2:08:57.060]  And, man, folks, you can't be decadent and slack-jawed and giggle and snicker anymore.
[2:08:57.060 --> 2:09:00.060]  You're already losing your jobs and everything's going to hell in a handbasket,
[2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:04.060]  and they've got carbon taxes to shut down everything further.
[2:09:04.060 --> 2:09:08.060]  And federal reserve takeovers and federal takeovers of all water in all the states.
[2:09:08.060 --> 2:09:11.060]  I mean, this is happening.
[2:09:11.060 --> 2:09:15.060]  A tax on the Fourth Amendment, the second, the first.
[2:09:15.060 --> 2:09:20.060]  Let's blitz through calls. I'm getting into the other outrages and back into the climate bill.
[2:09:20.060 --> 2:09:23.060]  Being debated, debate closes down to the next hour,
[2:09:23.060 --> 2:09:26.060]  and a vote on it then the next three hours after that.
[2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:32.060]  Sometime they sit between six and seven eastern, so I guess five and six central.
[2:09:32.060 --> 2:09:35.060]  To be technical, but you never know with their chicanery.
[2:09:35.060 --> 2:09:38.060]  They've been changing bill numbers. Nobody's read the bill.
[2:09:38.060 --> 2:09:41.060]  It was 200 pages a week ago.
[2:09:41.060 --> 2:09:45.060]  It's 1300 yesterday. They said they added 300 more last night.
[2:09:45.060 --> 2:09:47.060]  Nobody can see the thing.
[2:09:47.060 --> 2:09:51.060]  That is, but there's been miracles before it's set.
[2:09:51.060 --> 2:09:53.060]  They say it's very close, but probably going to pass.
[2:09:53.060 --> 2:09:56.060]  But there's such liars who knows what that means.
[2:09:56.060 --> 2:10:00.060]  It's just like they put three years ago.
[2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:03.060]  They started trying to pass amnesty bills for the next year and a half.
[2:10:03.060 --> 2:10:06.060]  And the third time they said it's not an amnesty bill, but the bill's secret.
[2:10:06.060 --> 2:10:08.060]  You can't see it. And God bless him.
[2:10:08.060 --> 2:10:12.060]  Senator Sessions. He's not perfect, but he did release the bill.
[2:10:12.060 --> 2:10:14.060]  He got in trouble for it under Senate rules.
[2:10:14.060 --> 2:10:17.060]  Supposed to keep that secret from the slaves. And it wasn't just amnesty.
[2:10:17.060 --> 2:10:20.060]  It was legalizing all illegal alien felons.
[2:10:20.060 --> 2:10:23.060]  They could bring in limited members of their family.
[2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:28.060]  Just total amnesty pardons.
[2:10:28.060 --> 2:10:32.060]  Clemency, whatever you want to call it, worse than, than, than, than amnesty.
[2:10:32.060 --> 2:10:34.060]  And then we barely beat that.
[2:10:34.060 --> 2:10:37.060]  So see, they wanted to get the border broken.
[2:10:37.060 --> 2:10:40.060]  So before the economy imploded, because they knew once it imploded,
[2:10:40.060 --> 2:10:42.060]  it'd be harder to go ahead and get rid of the border.
[2:10:42.060 --> 2:10:45.060]  Now that's in trouble for them.
[2:10:45.060 --> 2:10:48.060]  They got their gun bills and they got it controlled by the Democrats.
[2:10:48.060 --> 2:10:53.060]  And they're trying to pass bills to let the Attorney General ban any guns he wants, whatever he wants.
[2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:58.060]  And bills to shut down gun manufacturers and gun stores and private transfer to your friends.
[2:10:58.060 --> 2:11:04.060]  And to put you on a no fly list, no gun by list, no judge, no jury, no record.
[2:11:04.060 --> 2:11:07.060]  I mean, cyber bullying bills to openly ban free speech.
[2:11:07.060 --> 2:11:10.060]  I mean, we're just getting hit here. They're making their move, man.
[2:11:10.060 --> 2:11:14.060]  We're at the LMO. The enemy's coming up over the walls.
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:18.060]  It's, it's musk. It's time to be swinging your rifle, folks.
[2:11:18.060 --> 2:11:21.060]  It's time to be swinging that Kentucky long rifle.
[2:11:21.060 --> 2:11:24.060]  I mean, this is it. We're not even in gunshot range anymore.
[2:11:24.060 --> 2:11:29.060]  It's paying it. It's, it's swords. It's, I mean, I mean, they're, I mean, they're in among us.
[2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:33.060]  It's it. I mean, they're saying secret police, foreign troops,
[2:11:33.060 --> 2:11:36.060]  North com openly to use troops on the U.S. citizens.
[2:11:36.060 --> 2:11:38.060]  They're coming in at every angle. This is it.
[2:11:38.060 --> 2:11:42.060]  And this is just beginning. You think the battle is heated up now with their ships up against us,
[2:11:42.060 --> 2:11:45.060]  with their cannons blasting full range at us.
[2:11:45.060 --> 2:11:52.060]  And we're sitting here and half our people don't even know we're in a fight of our lives.
[2:11:52.060 --> 2:11:57.060]  They want to know about Michael Jackson, some freak, some drug addict freak.
[2:11:57.060 --> 2:11:59.060]  It's been obvious that guy's been in a daze.
[2:11:59.060 --> 2:12:10.060]  Like Jaren Nyhart said, it's like the last 20 years he's been on heroin or opium on his ferris wheel.
[2:12:10.060 --> 2:12:14.060]  He's a sad, pathetic person. It doesn't matter.
[2:12:14.060 --> 2:12:19.060]  It's a perfect distraction right now.
[2:12:19.060 --> 2:12:26.060]  He was shooting up a variant of opium, a variant of morphine.
[2:12:26.060 --> 2:12:29.060]  I mean, you can tell that guy's on TV.
[2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:36.060]  Hi. Oh, yes. Oh, oh, oh.
[2:12:36.060 --> 2:12:41.060]  And you'd see him on TV with his nose, with like plastic on it, like flapping in the wind.
[2:12:41.060 --> 2:12:43.060]  I mean, that's power. That's the world.
[2:12:43.060 --> 2:12:47.060]  That's being so insecure you have your face chopped up 100 times.
[2:12:47.060 --> 2:12:49.060]  Probably more.
[2:12:49.060 --> 2:12:55.060]  All you women, all you men that feel inadequate and by all the media hype, all of it, it's all lies.
[2:12:55.060 --> 2:13:02.060]  It's all builds. It's all soul killing garbage to neutralize you so you don't have a desire to control your own destiny.
[2:13:02.060 --> 2:13:05.060]  You think I care. I got sunspots or my hair is falling out.
[2:13:05.060 --> 2:13:08.060]  I'm tempted to just cut my hair off and walk around in sackcloth.
[2:13:08.060 --> 2:13:10.060]  I never do what that meant when I was reading out the Old Testament.
[2:13:10.060 --> 2:13:17.060]  It's about getting humble and stop caring about the crap.
[2:13:17.060 --> 2:13:32.060]  Because I don't want to turn into Michael Jackson and all cultures turning into him.
[2:13:32.060 --> 2:13:36.060]  You know, all these decadent Hollywood people that aren't centered.
[2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:41.060]  It's a blessing that they rot. It's a blessing they die because their decadence and evil is finally brought to an end.
[2:13:41.060 --> 2:13:43.060]  Death's the great equalizer.
[2:13:43.060 --> 2:13:45.060]  Those of us that love God and honor and decency.
[2:13:45.060 --> 2:13:50.060]  We're not afraid of death because we're beyond all your worldly crap.
[2:13:50.060 --> 2:13:55.060]  The only reason I don't want to die is I want to continue fighting you as long as I can stay here.
[2:13:55.060 --> 2:13:59.060]  Whatever the cost. I'm committed and God knows I'm committed.
[2:13:59.060 --> 2:14:01.060]  That's why I'm protected to some extent.
[2:14:01.060 --> 2:14:04.060]  But it may become God's will at some time that I water the tree of liberty.
[2:14:04.060 --> 2:14:07.060]  And that is the will of God. It will happen.
[2:14:07.060 --> 2:14:14.060]  And the new order hates it that we're committed and they hate it that we don't believe in their God of destruction and tyranny and disease and pain.
[2:14:14.060 --> 2:14:20.060]  We believe in the God of strength and will and honor and wholesomeness and goodness.
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:23.060]  Greenfields and the stars in the night.
[2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:25.060]  Evidence of his handiwork.
[2:14:25.060 --> 2:14:28.060]  The God of creation and of living water.
[2:14:28.060 --> 2:14:31.060]  Not your God of weakness.
[2:14:31.060 --> 2:14:34.060]  We're not afraid of death because we're so alive.
[2:14:34.060 --> 2:14:40.060]  We are allies that it's all part of God's plan and we go on and you fear death and you should because for you.
[2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:45.060]  There is eternity. Your soul, your spirit, your essence will be with yourself.
[2:14:45.060 --> 2:14:47.060]  And that is hell.
[2:14:47.060 --> 2:14:54.060]  Hell is what you love and it's what you get.
[2:14:54.060 --> 2:14:56.060]  All right. I said I'd take calls. I'm out of control today.
[2:14:56.060 --> 2:14:59.060]  Stuart and Mass, you're on the air.
[2:14:59.060 --> 2:15:01.060]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[2:15:01.060 --> 2:15:02.060]  Hey, buddy.
[2:15:02.060 --> 2:15:05.060]  The absurdity is a killer, isn't it?
[2:15:05.060 --> 2:15:09.060]  Everything is so absurd, man. It's crazy.
[2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:24.060]  Now, I was going to say, you hide the fact that you are a Zionistic, Jew-hating, Vatican assassin, bigoted, C.I.A. MI5 reptile assassin pretty well.
[2:15:24.060 --> 2:15:29.060]  I just wanted to bring some humor in.
[2:15:29.060 --> 2:15:31.060]  No, no. And I'm also from Planet Pop-Tart.
[2:15:31.060 --> 2:15:35.060]  But the issue is, the issue is that's all a worldly diversion.
[2:15:35.060 --> 2:15:40.060]  Let's say I'm the worst person in the world. I'm not. I'm for real and people know that's why we've been successful.
[2:15:40.060 --> 2:15:47.060]  Some of those that are deceived can't see it and they get actually upset by me because they've got their own issues that they need to rectify.
[2:15:47.060 --> 2:15:49.060]  And I actually feel sorry for my enemies more and more.
[2:15:49.060 --> 2:15:56.060]  But the issue is, is that none of us are perfect but having guts is good and guts is enough, as they say.
[2:15:56.060 --> 2:15:58.060]  And I agree with that in full metal jacket.
[2:15:58.060 --> 2:16:05.060]  Taking action, getting out of the lukewarm into the hot or cold, choosing a side. But regardless, my fruits are good.
[2:16:05.060 --> 2:16:08.060]  And I'm here awakening people to the false reality.
[2:16:08.060 --> 2:16:17.060]  Now, what they find or what they see, you know, after they've been awakened, is another thing.
[2:16:17.060 --> 2:16:27.060]  And people lead down rabbit trails. They wake up but only for a time and then die, you know, in their awakening.
[2:16:27.060 --> 2:16:35.060]  Other people, you know, wake up but then get seduced and decide to join evil.
[2:16:35.060 --> 2:16:39.060]  And some people wake up and then just get more and more knowledge and more and more understanding.
[2:16:39.060 --> 2:16:41.060]  But I'll go ahead.
[2:16:41.060 --> 2:16:44.060]  You talk, or you use parables a lot.
[2:16:44.060 --> 2:16:46.060]  Well, what I was doing was...
[2:16:46.060 --> 2:16:49.060]  I got a bit of a parable. This is for the police.
[2:16:49.060 --> 2:16:54.060]  Because, you know, I'm sick of the whole, some of the police are good and maybe some of them are.
[2:16:54.060 --> 2:16:59.060]  But, you know, what if I were to say, you know, I'm going to join the mafia.
[2:16:59.060 --> 2:17:02.060]  And the mafia's bad, but I'm going to take some of that money.
[2:17:02.060 --> 2:17:06.060]  I'm going to take that money that I get from robbing and stealing and killing.
[2:17:06.060 --> 2:17:09.060]  And I'm going to give it to the poor and help some old ladies out.
[2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:13.060]  You know what I'm saying? That's almost what it's like to me.
[2:17:13.060 --> 2:17:18.060]  And, you know, all these police out there, you know, and even the congressmen that are now waking up.
[2:17:18.060 --> 2:17:21.060]  I mean, you know, like you said, we're at the brink now.
[2:17:21.060 --> 2:17:25.060]  So, all these congressmen that, yeah, they're finally waking up.
[2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:27.060]  You know what I got to say to them?
[2:17:27.060 --> 2:17:29.060]  And I'm sorry, maybe I sounded a bit pessimistic.
[2:17:29.060 --> 2:17:31.060]  But thanks for nothing, man.
[2:17:31.060 --> 2:17:34.060]  Because there's a lot of people like me out here, you know.
[2:17:34.060 --> 2:17:36.060]  I'm not famous or anything.
[2:17:36.060 --> 2:17:38.060]  But there's a lot of people like me out here.
[2:17:38.060 --> 2:17:40.060]  Our lives are ruined.
[2:17:40.060 --> 2:17:42.060]  My future is shot.
[2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:45.060]  And the thing that kills me is I see...
[2:17:45.060 --> 2:17:50.060]  You know, when I calculate in my brain everything that you talk about, all these issues.
[2:17:50.060 --> 2:17:55.060]  So much damage has been done that even if the people stand up right now today,
[2:17:55.060 --> 2:17:59.060]  this very second, which we're not going to, and turn things around.
[2:17:59.060 --> 2:18:04.060]  The damage that has been done to this country is so bad that I believe that
[2:18:04.060 --> 2:18:08.060]  it's going to be a long time before things get better.
[2:18:08.060 --> 2:18:14.060]  You know, with one in 150 kids, you said it's probably closer to one in 75 being autistic now.
[2:18:14.060 --> 2:18:19.060]  What kind of a future do we have with a generation like that that's going to go up and take over?
[2:18:19.060 --> 2:18:24.060]  When I was in high school, I knew when my generation took over, we were going to be in big trouble.
[2:18:24.060 --> 2:18:28.060]  I can't even imagine when the kids growing up now take over.
[2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:31.060]  But I guess that's all I have to say, and I have a good day out.
[2:18:31.060 --> 2:18:33.060]  God bless you, my friend.
[2:18:33.060 --> 2:18:36.060]  I appreciate your call.
[2:18:36.060 --> 2:18:43.060]  Yeah, we have to learn to recognize evil and be able to deal with it and face it down.
[2:18:43.060 --> 2:18:45.060]  We have to be able to do that.
[2:18:45.060 --> 2:18:48.060]  I'm going to come back and take more calls, and then I've got that fellow reserve news.
[2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:55.060]  In the video, we're going to be playing for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers coming up here in just a few minutes.
[2:18:55.060 --> 2:19:01.060]  You know, and every time I have success reaching out to people, that's then proof that I'm bad.
[2:19:01.060 --> 2:19:04.060]  Well, the fact is what matters is my fruits.
[2:19:04.060 --> 2:19:09.060]  The fact is I'm here not compromising telling the truth, fighting the New World Order.
[2:19:09.060 --> 2:19:16.060]  And I believe what I'm saying, and I do the best job I can to fight these forms of tyranny over the minds and souls of men and women.
[2:19:16.060 --> 2:19:25.060]  But every time I mention that we're on XM three hours on Saturdays, people go, oh, my God, you're evil.
[2:19:25.060 --> 2:19:26.060]  Oh, my God, that means you're bad.
[2:19:26.060 --> 2:19:29.060]  No, that means that they know I have a giant audience.
[2:19:29.060 --> 2:19:34.060]  So they're kind of putting their toe in the water, putting me on because even a lot of the people that are in that company,
[2:19:34.060 --> 2:19:39.060]  though it's owned by globalist, I'm sure, realize what's going on because I've talked to some of them.
[2:19:39.060 --> 2:19:41.060]  So they're taking a risk to put me on.
[2:19:41.060 --> 2:19:47.060]  And then even me talking about it may even get us kicked off and then that'll please people out there, of course, who don't want to beat the New World Order.
[2:19:47.060 --> 2:19:51.060]  But we're on XM Channel 165 Saturdays, 5 to 8 p.m. Central.
[2:19:51.060 --> 2:19:55.060]  XM Channel 165 Saturdays, 5 to 8 p.m. Central.
[2:19:55.060 --> 2:19:58.060]  And they might be putting us on five days a week in their future.

[2:21:02.060 --> 2:21:04.060]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:21:04.060 --> 2:21:10.060]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[2:21:10.060 --> 2:21:15.060]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[2:21:15.060 --> 2:21:21.060]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[2:21:21.060 --> 2:21:29.060]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[2:21:29.060 --> 2:21:34.060]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[2:21:34.060 --> 2:21:40.060]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[2:22:20.060 --> 2:22:24.060]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:22:24.060 --> 2:22:37.060]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:22:37.060 --> 2:22:41.060]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:22:41.060 --> 2:22:48.060]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:23:49.060 --> 2:24:05.060]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception.
[2:24:05.060 --> 2:24:34.060]  Don't want no shackles on me. I sit down with Big Brother and the National ID. Yeah, they got their casualist society control grid going into place, their carbon tax grid, their Patriot Act compliance grid, total bondage, and private interest own the whole police state and environmental grid as they force the whole economy through bureaucracy into their hands.
[2:24:34.060 --> 2:24:46.060]  This is 21st century tyranny. Let's go back to your calls. Let's talk to Craig in New York. Craig, go ahead.
[2:24:46.060 --> 2:25:04.060]  Hey, Alex, just one little thing. You were talking about the lifted profits body. It was Joseph that was lifted out of Egypt during the Exodus. But anyway, I work in the office right now that I'm done teaching, and I noticed through an international shipping, they're starting to put SDR value in all the packages on the U.S. Postal Service.
[2:25:04.060 --> 2:25:13.060]  It has an exchange rate of about 4 to 1 to $1, and I've never seen that before. Too bad Chapman isn't on. I have no idea when they started that.
[2:25:13.060 --> 2:25:26.060]  Well, for those that don't know, they're not just issuing SDRs. They've created a bunch of other special global currencies that are above physical or paper money level that are just exchanged between banks.
[2:25:26.060 --> 2:25:42.060]  So they've already made the world currency, and that's already operating, and they admit they are. Now they're setting up the new bank of the world that will regulate every facet of our lives through the carbon tax, through the regional Federal Reserve banks, and through the other systems.
[2:25:42.060 --> 2:25:52.060]  But I didn't know that they were already on international shipping. You're saying they've already stopped having it in dollar denominations, and it's in SDRs?
[2:25:52.060 --> 2:26:10.060]  I think it's an exchange rate. Obviously, if you were, let's say, the prison plan and store would send something to Canada, and you use the U.S. Postal Service for shipping, you would pay with your credit card or whatever you use, let's say, $18, and it's for $80 value, the value being converted for SDRs, I assume, for accounting purposes.
[2:26:10.060 --> 2:26:30.060]  Amazing. Wait a minute. You're telling me they're already officially converting not to euros or not to loonies or not to pounds, like it'll say on the back of a paperback book, or a hardbook, hardcover, $12 U.S., $14 Canadian. You're saying now it's got SDR?
[2:26:30.060 --> 2:26:47.060]  Well, as of a week ago, $80 equaled exactly $25.04 at SDRs, and anyone could do it. I have to send out these packages, and anyone could go to USPS and send something to Canada, and that's what you're dealing with. It's right there on the front.
[2:26:47.060 --> 2:27:10.060]  Hey, do me a favor. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. Call Tim in here, please. Go get him right now. Look, I remember two years ago, because I'm an employer, and I have the Texas Employment Commission, they come and arrest you if you don't fill out all these forms on your employees and be tracked by them, and then they report to the Department of Labor.
[2:27:10.060 --> 2:27:22.060]  And it said you don't report to the Department of Labor anymore. It said you report to this North American Union agency, and the state said no longer report to us, you report to this. It's a quasi-governmental group.
[2:27:22.060 --> 2:27:42.060]  So, and then Jerome Corsi had a story on it, World Net Daily, and in human events. So, it's really happening. But I'm going to ask our shipping guy if right now on air, you know, the other day I called my wife in here to talk to Webster Tarpley in Italian and French.
[2:27:42.060 --> 2:27:57.060]  She was going, I can't hear him. I can't hear him. And I wonder why she was talking over him, and her headset wasn't plugged in. So, my wife's sitting there, not even able to talk to Tarpley, but I think they still had somewhat of a conversation with me saying, how do you say this? How do you say that?
[2:27:57.060 --> 2:28:13.060]  Hey, Tim, we just had a caller saying that when he ships UPS to Canada, it's no longer saying a Looney conversion or a Pound conversion. It is a SDR. That's those new international bank special reserve drawing rights.
[2:28:13.060 --> 2:28:29.060]  It's this new made-up global currency. See, because they're going to skip right past world currencies to directly to biometrics. You thumbprint, you face scan, and then it's whatever your regional currency is. It can even be a mastercard. That's why they're now having Wells Fargo get the illegal aliens without IDs.
[2:28:29.060 --> 2:28:42.060]  They give them a card, and the government accepts that to get a driver's license. So, it's just everything will be a card. Private corporations can issue cards. Everything will be money because it'll all be tied to your face scan thumbprint.
[2:28:42.060 --> 2:28:46.060]  So, it won't matter, but can you check into what he was saying? Do you know anything about that, Tim?
[2:28:46.060 --> 2:28:49.060]  No, I've not heard about that. I will check into it right now.
[2:28:49.060 --> 2:29:00.060]  Well, I mean, just see what he's saying on the printout. There's the conversion that when he's shipping something to Canada, there's the cost. Maybe I should have kept him on, and that it's now saying SDR.
[2:29:00.060 --> 2:29:07.060]  I will look into that. On ours, it shows, I'm pretty sure it's US dollars, but...
[2:29:07.060 --> 2:29:15.060]  But I don't understand, or maybe he's talking about the postal service, not check our postals, because we just pay UPS here in dollars, and then it goes up there.
[2:29:15.060 --> 2:29:23.060]  Right, exactly. Yeah, because I know when we ship to Canada, they go to the... Canada is one of the countries that they go to two central hubs.
[2:29:23.060 --> 2:29:24.060]  Yeah, because they search everything.
[2:29:24.060 --> 2:29:25.060]  Exactly.
[2:29:25.060 --> 2:29:26.060]  So, it's such a free country.
[2:29:26.060 --> 2:29:27.060]  Yeah.
[2:29:27.060 --> 2:29:34.060]  So, free. They tear through every package with pleasure and smash the goods half the time. They wear little black Nazi outfits. I just freed them everywhere. Thank you.
[2:29:34.060 --> 2:29:35.060]  Not a problem.
[2:29:35.060 --> 2:29:51.060]  Thank you so much, Tim. There goes Tim Bruget, here in the office. He had not enough fluoride. He soon, though, will love the new order. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:29:51.060 --> 2:30:01.060]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:31:00.060 --> 2:31:06.060]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the Truth Movement for years.
[2:31:06.060 --> 2:31:21.060]  Inner Health Botanicals, this company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food. My wife just loves the stuff, and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food, his editor's choice award, or best superfood of 2009.
[2:31:21.060 --> 2:31:30.060]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners. It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[2:31:30.060 --> 2:31:39.060]  This is the real thing for the great health you need. Try the Nutra Cafe. They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[2:31:39.060 --> 2:31:46.060]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great. And take it from me, folks. It really does taste great. Don't forget to try their other great products.

[2:32:00.060 --> 2:32:06.060]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:32:06.060 --> 2:32:16.060]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:32:16.060 --> 2:32:21.060]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:32:21.060 --> 2:32:28.060]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:35.060]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:32:35.060 --> 2:32:45.060]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.
[2:32:45.060 --> 2:33:10.060]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[2:33:10.060 --> 2:33:26.060]  People come and go. Our lives are out, out like a candle. And may you bury me under the old apple tree, son. They touch your sweet lips again.
[2:33:26.060 --> 2:33:42.060]  Yeah, the seasons don't fear the reboot. But to see a republic fall, and to see it fall, the scientific tearing.
[2:33:42.060 --> 2:33:54.060]  To see the lending and tearing, the drawn cornering of my beloved nation is very, very painful.
[2:33:54.060 --> 2:33:59.060]  All right, thank you for joining us.
[2:33:59.060 --> 2:34:22.060]  I want to go back to your phone calls, but I need to go ahead and get into the news dealing with the outlandish criminal behavior of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve and then a recap of the global climate bill, because when I say global, it's to pay taxes internationally to a private new bank of the world.
[2:34:22.060 --> 2:34:28.060]  In fact, let's see that debate right now going on in C-SPAN for a moment.
[2:34:28.060 --> 2:34:30.060]  Here's a Democrat saying how great it is.
[2:34:30.060 --> 2:34:42.060]  You and I have had discussions, and I'd certainly like to know how that has done, particularly in view of the fact that 94% of the 500 largest global corporations use derivatives for risk management.
[2:34:42.060 --> 2:35:00.060]  Gentlemen, to reclaim my time, you and others have expressed concern about this issue, and this matter will be determined by the work of the financial services committee and the agricultural committee.
[2:35:00.060 --> 2:35:02.060]  That's weasel waxman.
[2:35:02.060 --> 2:35:06.060]  Once they agree on the issue that's within their jurisdiction.
[2:35:06.060 --> 2:35:08.060]  You know, that's another good point.
[2:35:08.060 --> 2:35:12.060]  We're going to be popping in throughout the next hour and a half. We have a left in transmission.
[2:35:12.060 --> 2:35:18.060]  I may even go into overdrive today talking about this because there's only a few talking points that Democrats have.
[2:35:18.060 --> 2:35:20.060]  It's this will give us millions of jobs.
[2:35:20.060 --> 2:35:22.060]  This will kickstart the economy.
[2:35:22.060 --> 2:35:26.060]  No, it's a managed economy, 25 to 2800 per person to start with.
[2:35:26.060 --> 2:35:28.060]  We can't see the whole bill.
[2:35:28.060 --> 2:35:30.060]  That's the old bill.
[2:35:30.060 --> 2:35:32.060]  It's five, six times and growing longer.
[2:35:32.060 --> 2:35:34.060]  Hundreds of pages being added today secretly.
[2:35:34.060 --> 2:35:36.060]  Nobody can see it.
[2:35:36.060 --> 2:35:46.060]  What's in there is a global carbon tax satellite tracker boxes in the cars, the taxi by the mile, huge taxes on electricity, gasoline, oil, plastics, everything made from it.
[2:35:46.060 --> 2:35:57.060]  Home inspections, federally, other bills racing through like the clean water restoration act, total federal jurisdiction over every square foot of the US for above or below ground water.
[2:35:57.060 --> 2:35:59.060]  Everything's got water under the ground.
[2:35:59.060 --> 2:36:00.060]  Total control.
[2:36:00.060 --> 2:36:01.060]  No more bill of rights.
[2:36:01.060 --> 2:36:03.060]  Come on your property without warrants.
[2:36:03.060 --> 2:36:05.060]  New bureaucracies being set up.
[2:36:05.060 --> 2:36:09.060]  And don't forget who invented all of this.
[2:36:09.060 --> 2:36:10.060]  It was Enron.
[2:36:10.060 --> 2:36:13.060]  Enron came up with a carbon trading scheme.
[2:36:13.060 --> 2:36:29.060]  Enron were the money laundering drug dealing scam artist fronts who would in California set up a fake energy trading company and give the state reps tours that came out in the news of computers hooked up to fake algorithms with fake trading.
[2:36:29.060 --> 2:36:42.060]  They just set the prices every day and would rip people off during that one summer what back in 2001, 2002 for a couple billion dollars a week extra money they were stealing just in California and it came out in their memos.
[2:36:42.060 --> 2:36:49.060]  They would turn the power off for a few hours because their memos said not having power creates the perception of artificial scarcity.
[2:36:49.060 --> 2:36:57.060]  So then when we turn the power back on and tell them it's going to cost three or four times, they'll believe it.
[2:36:57.060 --> 2:37:07.060]  This is the criminals just like diamonds are actually semi precious but they control where they're dug out and governments control them with payoffs through the deburres and Oppenheimers.
[2:37:07.060 --> 2:37:14.060]  And so they are truly scarce in the main street but in the real world they're not.
[2:37:14.060 --> 2:37:15.060]  Same fraud.
[2:37:15.060 --> 2:37:16.060]  Turn their power off.
[2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:17.060]  They'll accept our prices.
[2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:21.060]  Same thing the Ironman from World Bank have been caught doing in their own memos.
[2:37:21.060 --> 2:37:32.060]  BBC reported back in 2002 all over the world when they take over third world country, they turn the water, turn the power off for a while to jack up prices and then also cause rioting.
[2:37:32.060 --> 2:37:41.060]  So the people will accept higher prices because if they triple prices then when they cut them back by half they've still been accepted an increase.
[2:37:41.060 --> 2:37:45.060]  It's all psychological games that are being played with you.
[2:37:45.060 --> 2:37:53.060]  So you tune in randomly, they're talking about carbon taxes and these are derivatives.
[2:37:53.060 --> 2:38:04.060]  I seek clarification of two provisions in section 788 of the bill relative to the forest lands and forestry sector.
[2:38:04.060 --> 2:38:15.060]  Specifically on page 198, line 14 of the bill, I'd like to know if the agricultural sector language includes forest lands and forestry sector.
[2:38:15.060 --> 2:38:28.060]  Also on page 199, line 22 of the bill, I'd like to know does the term projects include sustainable forest practices such as avoided deforestation agreement?
[2:38:28.060 --> 2:38:43.060]  I want to thank the gentleman for his work in improving the definition of biomass in this bill and ensure him that just as with many USDA conservation programs forest land fully qualifies for this energy incentive program and it's our intent to be included in this section.
[2:38:43.060 --> 2:38:45.060]  That's enough from that punk.
[2:38:45.060 --> 2:38:54.060]  And again, you've seen them grab GM, grab Chrysler and then they openly on the open market say give campaign contributions to the Democratic Party.
[2:38:54.060 --> 2:38:59.060]  This is on record and you might get to keep your dealership open.
[2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:02.060]  You got a $15 million or $5 million dealership.
[2:39:02.060 --> 2:39:06.060]  Those are two cases that have been covered in Congress in Minnesota.
[2:39:06.060 --> 2:39:10.060]  Two different dealerships and they said, no, you're Republicans, you don't get to keep them open.
[2:39:10.060 --> 2:39:14.060]  Give us your list, move out, we own it, you're done.
[2:39:14.060 --> 2:39:17.060]  90 year old dealership in one case.
[2:39:17.060 --> 2:39:19.060]  This is just mafia.
[2:39:19.060 --> 2:39:23.060]  And if you're a globalist company, you can do whatever you want.
[2:39:23.060 --> 2:39:25.060]  But if you're not, it's over for you.
[2:39:25.060 --> 2:39:29.060]  And so it's 1300 plus pages and they say they added 300 more.
[2:39:29.060 --> 2:39:31.060]  So we're not the bills.
[2:39:31.060 --> 2:39:34.060]  They're just now seeing and getting because they're about to vote on it.
[2:39:34.060 --> 2:39:40.060]  We're not even allowed to see this and Congress no way can read all of it and they're adding more every minute.
[2:39:40.060 --> 2:39:44.060]  And notice, I've been watching this and I've seen Congress watch Congress a lot.
[2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:46.060]  Republicans aren't even being given the copies.
[2:39:46.060 --> 2:39:47.060]  They're going, what's in it?
[2:39:47.060 --> 2:39:58.060]  No, and the Democrats who are about to vote for it, they say, well, let me check my district because it's all sorts of scams and control where you got to go to the imperial lords locally and make payoffs to be able to do business.
[2:39:58.060 --> 2:40:00.060]  This is just mafia control.
[2:40:00.060 --> 2:40:03.060]  So the Democrats are the few getting up going, well, I'm gonna vote for it.
[2:40:03.060 --> 2:40:06.060]  But does this take all the land in my district for you?
[2:40:06.060 --> 2:40:08.060]  Well, only a little bit of it.
[2:40:08.060 --> 2:40:10.060]  Bob, we're going to leave you alone for now.
[2:40:10.060 --> 2:40:12.060]  Just let us skin these bastards.
[2:40:12.060 --> 2:40:15.060]  All right.
[2:40:15.060 --> 2:40:17.060]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[2:40:17.060 --> 2:40:30.060]  Give these creatures a call right now, 1-800-833-6354, 1-800-833-6354.
[2:40:30.060 --> 2:40:31.060]  Call these criminals.
[2:40:31.060 --> 2:40:33.060]  Call their home districts as well.
[2:40:33.060 --> 2:40:38.060]  And tell their secretaries and people just say, I'm going to come do whatever it takes to get you out of office, you criminal.
[2:40:38.060 --> 2:40:41.060]  And mainly the Democrats call the Democrats.
[2:40:41.060 --> 2:40:43.060]  They got a lot of horror Republicans.
[2:40:43.060 --> 2:40:48.060]  You can Google Republicans as he's going to vote for climate bill, greenhouse bill.
[2:40:48.060 --> 2:40:51.060]  And you'll find that, you know, you'll see all bunch of articles with the ones that are out there pushing it.
[2:40:51.060 --> 2:40:58.060]  Call those little creatures up and stand up to them up on infowars.com up on screen.
[2:40:58.060 --> 2:41:04.060]  We'll put up the numbers for everybody for you as well.
[2:41:04.060 --> 2:41:09.060]  So, all right, let me go ahead and get into this now and then I'm going to get back into that.
[2:41:09.060 --> 2:41:11.060]  And I'm going to take calls for the rest of the show after this.
[2:41:11.060 --> 2:41:19.060]  But I hope listeners want to talk about the climate bill, which you find out is 1,300 we know, 3,000 added, but not the exact number.
[2:41:19.060 --> 2:41:24.060]  But it's probably going to be 1,600-800 pages.
[2:41:24.060 --> 2:41:27.060]  Just like they didn't read the Page Read Act before passage.
[2:41:27.060 --> 2:41:28.060]  They wouldn't allow it.
[2:41:28.060 --> 2:41:30.060]  One hour before passage, they released the full bill.
[2:41:30.060 --> 2:41:33.060]  And then the next day on the Internet released it.
[2:41:33.060 --> 2:41:35.060]  I mean, that right there, they can't pass this.
[2:41:35.060 --> 2:41:40.060]  Well, we got to do it or the earth is going to, the polar bears are all going to drown and the cities, I mean, I've seen the newscast.
[2:41:40.060 --> 2:41:46.060]  I've seen you guys at Discovery Channel Monday, but we never played it where they're going, Houston will flood.
[2:41:46.060 --> 2:41:47.060]  Everyone will die.
[2:41:47.060 --> 2:41:52.060]  They've got to build a dome city over Houston or we're all dead.
[2:41:52.060 --> 2:41:53.060]  People don't believe me.
[2:41:53.060 --> 2:41:57.060]  Just Google Dome City over Houston for global warming and we can at least put it on screen.
[2:41:57.060 --> 2:42:01.060]  We don't have time to play the newscast because I've got too much to cover.
[2:42:01.060 --> 2:42:03.060]  I mean, it's like we're all going to die.
[2:42:03.060 --> 2:42:04.060]  They're teaching the kids.
[2:42:04.060 --> 2:42:05.060]  We're all going to die.
[2:42:05.060 --> 2:42:06.060]  We've got to reduce world population.
[2:42:06.060 --> 2:42:08.060]  We've got to pay 80% taxes.
[2:42:08.060 --> 2:42:13.060]  We've got to work as slaves for the government where the kids are learning to grow gardens during one hour of school.
[2:42:13.060 --> 2:42:16.060]  And then that's sold by the school for money for the school.
[2:42:16.060 --> 2:42:19.060]  The service is for service to the state.
[2:42:19.060 --> 2:42:21.060]  And it all sounds reasonable.
[2:42:21.060 --> 2:42:23.060]  Oh, how sweet the kids are growing tomatoes.
[2:42:23.060 --> 2:42:29.060]  I mean, this is getting so sick.
[2:42:29.060 --> 2:42:31.060]  And I know why people get fooled by Glenn Beck.
[2:42:31.060 --> 2:42:37.060]  I was watching him yesterday here in the office and he was admitting that the big oil companies, energy companies and big banks are behind the global warming.
[2:42:37.060 --> 2:42:39.060]  That it's a big Enron scam.
[2:42:39.060 --> 2:42:40.060]  Totally true.
[2:42:40.060 --> 2:42:42.060]  Great guy.
[2:42:42.060 --> 2:42:47.060]  Until you realize he also says arrest 911 truthers, ban free speech, arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[2:42:47.060 --> 2:42:48.060]  There's no FEMA camp.
[2:42:48.060 --> 2:42:51.060]  See, they tell him what he can and can't say.
[2:42:51.060 --> 2:42:52.060]  I guess they're like, it's going to pass.
[2:42:52.060 --> 2:42:53.060]  Don't worry.
[2:42:53.060 --> 2:42:56.060]  Go ahead and act like you're against it.
[2:42:56.060 --> 2:43:02.060]  And then because what I hate is his, his, his going back and forth and him laughing at us.
[2:43:02.060 --> 2:43:03.060]  I'd love to love going back.
[2:43:03.060 --> 2:43:05.060]  I'd love to love these guys.
[2:43:05.060 --> 2:43:11.060]  I just know it's a load of baloney because all of Rupert Murdoch's other companies were Murdoch admits.
[2:43:11.060 --> 2:43:12.060]  We played the video here.
[2:43:12.060 --> 2:43:19.060]  He put out a corporate press release showing all his movies and all his TV shows and all his news articles saying global warming is real.
[2:43:19.060 --> 2:43:22.060]  And it's going, hi, I'm Rupert Murdoch.
[2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:24.060]  We're going to have a global tax and I believe in it.
[2:43:24.060 --> 2:43:26.060]  And here's what I've been doing to make sure that happens.
[2:43:26.060 --> 2:43:28.060]  And then at Davos, he admits he tries to manipulate.
[2:43:28.060 --> 2:43:35.060]  So then there's one guy back doing it to kind of just grab the audience of patriots.
[2:43:35.060 --> 2:43:37.060]  Oh, it's just sick.
[2:43:37.060 --> 2:43:39.060]  Okay.
[2:43:39.060 --> 2:43:48.060]  Let me go ahead and kind of prepare myself and get into this because I know this, this needs to go mega viral.
[2:43:48.060 --> 2:43:54.060]  This video is not everything we do on this TV show ends up going mega viral, but I want this to go particularly mega viral.
[2:43:54.060 --> 2:44:03.060]  Let me focus for one moment and then launch into it, shifting gears mentally.
[2:44:03.060 --> 2:44:07.060]  Ron Paul has over 245 sponsors.
[2:44:07.060 --> 2:44:22.060]  If he gets 290, that is a absolute majority in the house that will pass a bill to audit the private run for profit Federal Reserve that we didn't have till 1913.
[2:44:22.060 --> 2:44:27.060]  When Ron Paul and other congressman are on TV saying audit the Fed or get rid of the Fed, he also has a bill to abolish it.
[2:44:27.060 --> 2:44:29.060]  They always say, well, who will we have taxes?
[2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:31.060]  How will America operate?
[2:44:31.060 --> 2:44:33.060]  How will we have money?
[2:44:33.060 --> 2:44:36.060]  How will the country survive?
[2:44:36.060 --> 2:44:38.060]  How will we be able to do anything?
[2:44:38.060 --> 2:44:44.060]  And Ron Paul is always at the capital and he says, well, the capital I'm sitting in was built before we had the Federal Reserve.
[2:44:44.060 --> 2:44:48.060]  We didn't have an income tax till 1913 with the Federal Reserve to pay the private bank.
[2:44:48.060 --> 2:44:54.060]  And income tax wasn't but 1% until the 1950s.
[2:44:54.060 --> 2:45:00.060]  Not one red cent of the money paid to the IRS goes to run the country.
[2:45:00.060 --> 2:45:02.060]  That's all the other taxes.
[2:45:02.060 --> 2:45:09.060]  This is all taxes on the debt to the private banks that issue it through their holding company, the Federal Reserve.
[2:45:09.060 --> 2:45:11.060]  And the news just kind of moves on knowing the public.
[2:45:11.060 --> 2:45:13.060]  That's too complex for them.
[2:45:13.060 --> 2:45:21.060]  But the issue is, even if the Federal Reserve is good, which it's obviously not, it's not above the law.
[2:45:21.060 --> 2:45:22.060]  Congress isn't above the law.
[2:45:22.060 --> 2:45:24.060]  The courts aren't above the law.
[2:45:24.060 --> 2:45:25.060]  The president is above the law.
[2:45:25.060 --> 2:45:32.060]  The Congress is supposed to have oversight over the courts, over the president, and over the coining and issuance of money and finance.
[2:45:32.060 --> 2:45:36.060]  Now, Congress has given up its authority over trade, the World Trade Organization.
[2:45:36.060 --> 2:45:39.060]  It's giving up its authority to the Federal Reserve right now.
[2:45:39.060 --> 2:45:46.060]  It did that first part of that with the October Banker bailout that gave them secrecy and unlimited funds.
[2:45:46.060 --> 2:45:48.060]  And they're still in $14.8 trillion, according to Bloomberg.
[2:45:48.060 --> 2:45:52.060]  Now they want to set up a new bank of the world, the Federal Reserve, the local governorship.
[2:45:52.060 --> 2:45:55.060]  Same legislation, word for word, being passed in Europe right now.
[2:45:55.060 --> 2:45:58.060]  And so we're trying to audit the Fed.
[2:45:58.060 --> 2:46:03.060]  They're trying to fully take over anything connected to finance or that affects the economy.
[2:46:03.060 --> 2:46:10.060]  And they say in their own words, from a restaurant, to a car dealership, from a factory, to a private school.
[2:46:10.060 --> 2:46:18.060]  Total martial law, total control, just as the executive order state where the federal government can reorganize people into youth brigades,
[2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:22.060]  or work brigades, take over land, take over transportation, take over manufacturing.
[2:46:22.060 --> 2:46:30.060]  All those illegitimate executive powers concentrated illegitimately in the presidency since the National Security Act of 47
[2:46:30.060 --> 2:46:33.060]  expanded by each subsequent president.
[2:46:33.060 --> 2:46:35.060]  The forced inoculation law is all of it.
[2:46:35.060 --> 2:46:37.060]  That's coming up next hour.
[2:46:37.060 --> 2:46:40.060]  Big news there.
[2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:45.060]  That has all been taken from the Congress and the courts, transferred illegitimately into the presidency.
[2:46:45.060 --> 2:46:49.060]  And now through the National Security Council and banking committees transferred to the private Fed.
[2:46:49.060 --> 2:46:53.060]  And now they just want to make it official.
[2:46:53.060 --> 2:46:59.060]  Now Bernanke got up yesterday before the House Banking Committee and was being questioned.
[2:46:59.060 --> 2:47:03.060]  And he said, look, you can't audit us, you can't look at us, or there will be a depression.
[2:47:03.060 --> 2:47:06.060]  So that's financial terrorism, just like in October.
[2:47:06.060 --> 2:47:09.060]  Pass my banker takeover bill or there'll be a depression.
[2:47:09.060 --> 2:47:11.060]  And then they went into behind closed committee.
[2:47:11.060 --> 2:47:18.060]  Senator Inhofe said, and also other members of the House have come out and said, Brad Sherman on this show,
[2:47:18.060 --> 2:47:28.060]  not just on the House floor, and said that Paulson came in with a threat taking orders directly
[2:47:28.060 --> 2:47:33.060]  from Ben Bernanke, but he had been Bernanke with him, but it's come out in the memos that the threats are made by Paulson
[2:47:33.060 --> 2:47:38.060]  on behalf of Bernanke and former New York Fed Chairman Geithner, now Treasury Secretary,
[2:47:38.060 --> 2:47:43.060]  that there will be physical martial law if you don't do this.
[2:47:43.060 --> 2:47:46.060]  And that's why you're now seeing antagonism by the House towards him,
[2:47:46.060 --> 2:47:48.060]  even though there are a bunch of crooks and thugs on average.
[2:47:48.060 --> 2:47:52.060]  They didn't like him coming in and saying, look, we'll just throw your butts out or arrest you.
[2:47:52.060 --> 2:47:58.060]  Just like the New York governor just said he'll arrest members of the legislature if they don't go vote the way he wants.
[2:47:58.060 --> 2:48:00.060]  That was in ABC News.
[2:48:00.060 --> 2:48:01.060]  Just, oh, he'll arrest them.
[2:48:01.060 --> 2:48:05.060]  See, everything is becoming crime world.
[2:48:05.060 --> 2:48:13.060]  You know, the velvet gloves tearing off the iron fish and we're really seeing what it is now, right out in the open for everybody.
[2:48:13.060 --> 2:48:23.060]  So to continue here to the key, we're saying, hey, the Congress has the right to coin, print the money, control the currency,
[2:48:23.060 --> 2:48:25.060]  the issuance of currency credit, control the banks.
[2:48:25.060 --> 2:48:28.060]  That's its job to regulate that.
[2:48:28.060 --> 2:48:36.060]  And the Fed says, no, that would be Congress seizing power dictatorially when it's the private Federal Reserve that sees power.
[2:48:36.060 --> 2:48:44.060]  It was Congress that got bought off in 1913 with 11 senators voting on Christmas Eve at midnight, right before midnight when nobody's there.
[2:48:44.060 --> 2:48:47.060]  They come in and criminally pass the Federal Reserve Act.
[2:48:47.060 --> 2:48:48.060]  They're criminals.
[2:48:48.060 --> 2:48:50.060]  This was a coup.
[2:48:50.060 --> 2:48:57.060]  And that coup stayed in place, but kind of sat back so people wouldn't notice the takeover and then crept out and took over.
[2:48:57.060 --> 2:48:58.060]  And they've done that now.
[2:48:58.060 --> 2:49:00.060]  And now they're mopping up.
[2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:11.060]  So when we come back after this quick break, I am going to play Bernacke saying Congress has no authority over the bank and saying nobody can audit them.
[2:49:11.060 --> 2:49:17.060]  You know, green spans on record saying the feds above the law, nobody can audit it.
[2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:27.060]  And then I'm going to read to you from the Constitution, the Congress shall have the power to coin money regulate the value thereof.
[2:49:27.060 --> 2:49:30.060]  Foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures.
[2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:32.060]  And then it goes on over the banks and everything else.
[2:49:32.060 --> 2:49:54.060]  So this little con artist, this little flim flam man, this sleight of hand carnival magician sits up there like he's fooling five year old school kids with his, with his, with his shoddy, shoddy magic trick saying, oh, you're not allowed to look at me.
[2:49:54.060 --> 2:49:57.060]  You're not allowed to audit me. You're not allowed to investigate me.
[2:49:57.060 --> 2:49:59.060]  You're not allowed to look into what I'm doing.
[2:49:59.060 --> 2:50:01.060]  It'll destroy America.
[2:50:01.060 --> 2:50:02.060]  Financial terrorism.
[2:50:02.060 --> 2:50:04.060]  It's going to destroy the economy.
[2:50:04.060 --> 2:50:06.060]  If you don't give us an after and get destroys the economy.
[2:50:06.060 --> 2:50:07.060]  It's going to destroy the economy.
[2:50:07.060 --> 2:50:12.060]  If you don't give us all these tax increases, then they get the tax increases, destroys it further to destroy the economy.
[2:50:12.060 --> 2:50:15.060]  If you don't give us unlimited power, we're going to be nuked by Iraq.
[2:50:15.060 --> 2:50:22.060]  They have WMDs if we don't invade always conning, always lying, always scamming, always terrorizing the public.
[2:50:22.060 --> 2:50:28.060]  We're going to play this amazing video, the audio for radio listeners, the video for prisonplanet.tv viewers right now.
[2:50:28.060 --> 2:50:33.060]  When we get back, and if you're not a prisonplanet.tv member, it's 15 cents a day, folks.
[2:50:33.060 --> 2:50:41.060]  You get all my films, super high quality, the live TV show every day, the Sunday show we're about to be doing out of this studio, and a lot more.
[2:50:41.060 --> 2:50:45.060]  By the way, Jason's going to be doing a Sunday show soon after me, so that's interesting.
[2:50:45.060 --> 2:50:55.060]  It's all coming up, I'll break down, the Hutzpah, the Bovada, the arrogance, the hubris, the corruption, the in your face arrogance of this creature.
[2:50:55.060 --> 2:51:24.060]  When we get back, telling you he's God over Congress.
[2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:28.060]  The number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:33.060]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[2:51:33.060 --> 2:51:38.060]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[2:51:38.060 --> 2:51:47.060]  American tax settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[2:51:47.060 --> 2:51:56.060]  If you owe 10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[2:51:56.060 --> 2:52:00.060]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[2:52:00.060 --> 2:52:18.060]  All today, I'm sitting on a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[2:52:18.060 --> 2:52:33.060]  This program has already settled over $100 million of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.

[2:52:48.060 --> 2:52:52.060]  Let the bailout group bail you out of debt, reduce your payments by up to 60% and save you thousands of dollars today.
[2:52:52.060 --> 2:53:00.060]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554.
[2:53:00.060 --> 2:53:10.060]  Call the bailout group.
[2:53:10.060 --> 2:53:30.060]  Call the bailout group.
[2:53:30.060 --> 2:53:58.060]  Call the bailout group.
[2:53:58.060 --> 2:54:24.060]  Call the bailout group.
[2:54:24.060 --> 2:54:28.060]  Thank you for joining us, continuing with Bernanke's arrogance.
[2:54:28.060 --> 2:54:34.060]  Think about it, offshore banks openly running everything, hijacking the whole economy, engineering the collapse.
[2:54:34.060 --> 2:54:44.060]  They're pushing and paying off the Congress openly to have the new global carbon tax paid to them and how dare the Congress talk about some transparency.
[2:54:44.060 --> 2:54:48.060]  Oh, if anybody knew what we were doing, we would go bankrupt.
[2:54:48.060 --> 2:54:54.060]  The president says, oh, we have a website, everything's on record at the website, just like Senator Sanders.
[2:54:54.060 --> 2:54:58.060]  He told Senator Sanders that a few months ago, it's in the new Obama film.
[2:54:58.060 --> 2:55:04.060]  And Sanders said, no, it's not. Tell me where the money went. He goes, oh, well, that part isn't there. That's a secret.
[2:55:04.060 --> 2:55:08.060]  So he lies and says, it's all public. And you go, okay, well, where's the money? I won't tell you that.
[2:55:08.060 --> 2:55:13.060]  It's all public. We're the Federal Reserve and what our address is. Never been an audit.
[2:55:13.060 --> 2:55:25.060]  They have a joke audit of chairs and pencils, but not where the money goes. I'm not kidding of refrigerators and pencils and desk and chairs and water coolers and light fixtures.
[2:55:25.060 --> 2:55:34.060]  But it's just a holding company for the private banks and then Bernanke gets up and well, here's the video clip.
[2:55:34.060 --> 2:55:44.060]  Fed officials purposely declined to consult with other federal financial regulators and one email expressed concern. The NCC employee quote, knows something is up.
[2:55:44.060 --> 2:56:02.060]  The Wall Street Journal reported that you and Mr. Paulson attended two weekly meetings of the financial stability oversight board and refused or declined to disclose the seriousness of the problems that were being faced by the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch at that time.
[2:56:02.060 --> 2:56:13.060]  What would you say to the majority of this Congress who has now cosponsored, who have now cosponsored the bill to require audits of the Federal Reserve?
[2:56:13.060 --> 2:56:27.060]  Do you feel that the Federal Reserve is operating with too much secrecy and too much refusal to disclose information that you have to other federal banking regulators?
[2:56:27.060 --> 2:56:35.060]  The Federal Reserve has made enormous strides in the last year under my chairmanship to expand the information that we release.
[2:56:35.060 --> 2:56:44.060]  We release monthly information on all the various programs that we have. We've developed a website and a monthly report that involves all kinds of information.
[2:56:44.060 --> 2:56:52.060]  We think we are quite transparent. We are happy to work with Congress if they have further concerns about any of our programs.
[2:56:52.060 --> 2:56:59.060]  We are more than happy to work with you to make sure that you are comfortable, that they are well managed and are serving a public purpose.
[2:56:59.060 --> 2:57:07.060]  Do you think it would cause problems for the Fed or for the economy if that legislation was to pass?
[2:57:07.060 --> 2:57:16.060]  My concern about the legislation is that if the GAO is auditing not only the operational aspects of our programs and the details of the programs,
[2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:23.060]  but it is making judgments about our policy decisions that would effectively be a takeover of monetary policy by the Congress,
[2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:34.060]  a repudiation of the independence of the Federal Reserve, which would be highly destructive to the stability of the financial system, the dollar, and our national economic situation.
[2:57:34.060 --> 2:57:37.060]  Thank you.
[2:57:37.060 --> 2:57:42.060]  The Fed's independence could forbid Congress' control of monetary policy.
[2:57:42.060 --> 2:57:49.060]  In the pocket constitutions, we send out free with all the orders. Article 1, U.S. Constitution.
[2:57:49.060 --> 2:57:58.060]  Article 1, United States Constitution. Article 1, We the People. Ever heard of that?
[2:57:58.060 --> 2:58:05.060]  And then you've got Section 8 right here. I'm going to read Section 8 to everybody here on air.
[2:58:05.060 --> 2:58:15.060]  The powers of Congress. To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and a foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.
[2:58:15.060 --> 2:58:23.060]  To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting, that'd be Bernanke, the securities and current coin of the United States.
[2:58:23.060 --> 2:58:25.060]  And it goes on.
[2:58:25.060 --> 2:58:31.060]  I mean, Congress has the power of the purse. That's why they vote for the bills and the funding.
[2:58:31.060 --> 2:58:35.060]  Oh, but God forbid anybody do that. We'll have a depression if we do.
[2:58:35.060 --> 2:59:01.060]  Bernanke, everybody's learning. You run a criminal group.
[2:59:01.060 --> 2:59:09.060]  10, 5 days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[2:59:09.060 --> 2:59:18.060]  All for pennies on the dollar. Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XT pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[2:59:18.060 --> 2:59:25.060]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[2:59:25.060 --> 2:59:30.060]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[2:59:30.060 --> 2:59:40.060]  This is real. Don't miss out. Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course. Plus, a 30-state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[2:59:40.060 --> 3:00:01.060]  To get your free handgun, go to FrontSight.com today. That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com. Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[3:00:10.060 --> 3:00:28.060]  For now into the final hour of this very important radio show, they're going to end debate in the next 30 minutes or so.
[3:00:28.060 --> 3:00:41.060]  It's almost already ended, but they're going over for the bill to take over the entire economy of the United States.
[3:00:41.060 --> 3:00:53.060]  And if you want to call and say no to HR 2998 and to the American Clean Water Restoration Act and the rest of it,
[3:00:53.060 --> 3:00:59.060]  that's an open federal takeover of all water, waterways, below groundwater, the above-surface land.
[3:00:59.060 --> 3:01:09.060]  Now that bill is going on as well. I mean, it's just unbelievable. Give them a call and say no to the American Clean Energy and Security Act 2009.
[3:01:09.060 --> 3:01:14.060]  What a nice name, like the Patriot Act, totally unpatriotic, so they call it patriotic, ends the bill of rights.
[3:01:14.060 --> 3:01:22.060]  Well, this thing allows the bureaucrats to run and tax and control and have in-ron-style carbon credits ripping everybody off.
[3:01:22.060 --> 3:01:28.060]  I got some other news, too. H1N1 swine flu has infected an estimated one million in the U.S.
[3:01:28.060 --> 3:01:50.060]  And up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, it is in the executive order that Bush signed that Obama has continued for forced inoculations nationwide under Level 6 pandemic.
[3:01:50.060 --> 3:01:57.060]  Well, they say we're under Level 6, so now they want to forcefully inject. They claim they have the law to do it, an executive order.
[3:01:57.060 --> 3:02:04.060]  And a popular website actually called up an Arkansas official. The lawyer sat there citing him this case and that case.
[3:02:04.060 --> 3:02:13.060]  So we're going to go over that as well. Arkansas State Health Department, mandatory vaccines are constitutional.
[3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:20.060]  And then I actually went and printed up the CBS news story, DHS gets guidelines for possible swine flu outbreaks.
[3:02:20.060 --> 3:02:27.060]  And it says in this article, forced inoculations nationwide. And now the Canadian papers are saying, oh, a million Americans have it.
[3:02:27.060 --> 3:02:34.060]  It means you have a virus that's harmless. But that we're going to have to forcefully inoculate the Canadians and the Americans and the Europeans.
[3:02:34.060 --> 3:02:42.060]  DHS sets guidelines for possible swine flu quarantines. They'll probably start the next wave of fear in the fall, then try to forcibly inject people.
[3:02:42.060 --> 3:02:50.060]  Most of the idiots are going to line up and accept it. So that is coming up as well this hour.
[3:02:50.060 --> 3:02:54.060]  But I do want to take calls, but I've got to go to them quickly.
[3:02:54.060 --> 3:02:57.060]  Dave in California, go ahead. You're on the air.
[3:02:57.060 --> 3:02:58.060]  Hi, Alex.
[3:02:58.060 --> 3:02:59.060]  Yes, sir.
[3:02:59.060 --> 3:03:02.060]  Long live free Pop Tardia, brother.
[3:03:02.060 --> 3:03:04.060]  You put up a video.
[3:03:04.060 --> 3:03:06.060]  My whole planet, Pop Tardia. Go ahead.
[3:03:06.060 --> 3:03:08.060]  Yeah, exactly. That's exactly where we are.
[3:03:08.060 --> 3:03:13.060]  Anyway, you put up a video on Info Wars yesterday that just did my heart good.
[3:03:13.060 --> 3:03:17.060]  The one that attends the thousands of Chinese fight the police in Sinshu.
[3:03:17.060 --> 3:03:20.060]  Yeah, they haven't had their water fluoridated though.
[3:03:20.060 --> 3:03:23.060]  Sean is now starting that, so they'll be behaving now.
[3:03:23.060 --> 3:03:25.060]  Well, yeah, I suppose so.
[3:03:25.060 --> 3:03:28.060]  But Mark Kornke talks about moose hunting.
[3:03:28.060 --> 3:03:34.060]  And to me, that's the perfect example of it, except all the Chinese needed were rocks to make the moose panic and flee.
[3:03:34.060 --> 3:03:39.060]  And imagine if they had firearms like we do.
[3:03:39.060 --> 3:03:45.060]  But you understand the globalists plan to let us have a war here, break down.
[3:03:45.060 --> 3:03:50.060]  Then without food and water later, six months later, we'll beg for the I-4 troops.
[3:03:50.060 --> 3:03:56.060]  We've just got to realize that we're trying to wake up as many people as we can so we can try to avert this.
[3:03:56.060 --> 3:04:00.060]  But yes, it's going to, we don't, I mean, it's going to turn into that.
[3:04:00.060 --> 3:04:01.060]  They're not going to stop.
[3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:07.060]  They're taking everybody's land, everybody's kids, everybody's jobs, and just laughing at us and hiring more cops.
[3:04:07.060 --> 3:04:12.060]  The economy's imploding, they're hiring more cops to squeeze us.
[3:04:12.060 --> 3:04:16.060]  Well, if possible, sir, would you please have Mark back on sometime soon?
[3:04:16.060 --> 3:04:21.060]  Everything's tending toward armed conflict and he is the expert on it.
[3:04:21.060 --> 3:04:23.060]  You know, I'll think about doing that.
[3:04:23.060 --> 3:04:24.060]  I appreciate your call.
[3:04:24.060 --> 3:04:37.060]  You know, I never been invited on any of the things he does, but I mean, I'm not here to go out and sit there.
[3:04:37.060 --> 3:04:40.060]  And the main role of me is no more Mr. Nice Guy.
[3:04:40.060 --> 3:04:42.060]  I've always been friendly and nice to everybody.
[3:04:42.060 --> 3:04:46.060]  But when that doesn't happen back to me, then the door shuts.
[3:04:46.060 --> 3:04:48.060]  But Mark's a nice guy, smart guy.
[3:04:48.060 --> 3:04:53.060]  It's just that he can call for armed rebellion on his own website and stuff.
[3:04:53.060 --> 3:04:56.060]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[3:05:23.060 --> 3:05:30.060]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from e-coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[3:07:01.060 --> 3:07:04.060]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.

[3:07:09.060 --> 3:07:14.060]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver,
[3:07:14.060 --> 3:07:20.060]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[3:07:20.060 --> 3:07:26.060]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nanosized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level,
[3:07:26.060 --> 3:07:31.060]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[3:07:31.060 --> 3:07:36.060]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold, and copper,
[3:07:36.060 --> 3:07:39.060]  with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[3:07:39.060 --> 3:07:44.060]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal

[3:08:01.060 --> 3:08:10.060]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

[3:08:28.060 --> 3:08:32.060]  and then I'm going to get into the other news because there's a lot of it and it's important
[3:08:32.060 --> 3:08:34.060]  the time we have 11 this Friday edition.
[3:08:34.060 --> 3:08:40.060]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. in the aftermath of Will Congress even be able to read the bill?
[3:08:40.060 --> 3:08:42.060]  They weren't allowed to read the stimulus package.
[3:08:42.060 --> 3:08:44.060]  They weren't allowed to read the Patriot Act.
[3:08:44.060 --> 3:08:46.060]  They won't be allowed to read the banking reform bill.
[3:08:46.060 --> 3:08:51.060]  It's gone from 200 pages to 500 to 600 to 800 to 1,100 to 1,200 to 1,300.
[3:08:51.060 --> 3:08:55.060]  They say 1,300 more pages were added last night, hundreds more today.
[3:08:55.060 --> 3:08:58.060]  Other pages being pulled out, stuck in.
[3:08:58.060 --> 3:09:00.060]  They won't publish what it is.
[3:09:00.060 --> 3:09:08.060]  But yes, we posted a lot of these of Chinese with sticks and stones when the police get caught killing citizens.
[3:09:08.060 --> 3:09:13.060]  They go out, attack the police, burn down the police stations, and I say they have a lot of spirit.
[3:09:13.060 --> 3:09:16.060]  And the Chinese government's corrupt wicked government.
[3:09:16.060 --> 3:09:18.060]  There are people who have a right to fight back against it.
[3:09:18.060 --> 3:09:24.060]  And when that caller calls in and says, have this guy on or have that guy on, the caller was Dave.
[3:09:24.060 --> 3:09:28.060]  You know, I like the people you're talking about and I like the work they do.
[3:09:28.060 --> 3:09:32.060]  But then people are always jabbing me saying Alex doesn't call for armed revolt.
[3:09:32.060 --> 3:09:33.060]  Alex is bad.
[3:09:33.060 --> 3:09:34.060]  Alex doesn't, you know, do this.
[3:09:34.060 --> 3:09:36.060]  And I'm not talking about the person you were mentioning.
[3:09:36.060 --> 3:09:43.060]  I'm talking about overall people calling for armed revolt or getting close to calling for it.
[3:09:43.060 --> 3:09:50.060]  Within two hours of Ploplowski killing those cops.
[3:09:50.060 --> 3:09:53.060]  Within hours of that happening.
[3:09:53.060 --> 3:09:58.060]  Southern Poverty Law Center had fed one person's name out of the hundreds of sites.
[3:09:58.060 --> 3:10:01.060]  It turned out he visited Fox News, CNN, Stormfront.
[3:10:01.060 --> 3:10:07.060]  One name was fed to the police and the news media by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[3:10:07.060 --> 3:10:08.060]  Me.
[3:10:08.060 --> 3:10:11.060]  They want to come after me.
[3:10:11.060 --> 3:10:19.060]  And I got all these big newspapers calling me up going, what about Richard McCastlin that went in the Bohemian Grove with guns and set things on fire?
[3:10:19.060 --> 3:10:22.060]  When nobody was there, by the way, it looks like a setup to me, this Marine.
[3:10:22.060 --> 3:10:24.060]  What about Ploplowski?
[3:10:24.060 --> 3:10:25.060]  What about this?
[3:10:25.060 --> 3:10:27.060]  Oh, do you need to be arrested?
[3:10:27.060 --> 3:10:29.060]  You know, basically.
[3:10:29.060 --> 3:10:31.060]  And they are circling me.
[3:10:31.060 --> 3:10:34.060]  I'm at a level nobody's ever gotten into in the patriot movement.
[3:10:34.060 --> 3:10:36.060]  And let me tell you, it didn't fun.
[3:10:36.060 --> 3:10:43.060]  And I've always supported everybody else when they get set up or sent to jail and told people to support and send money to people and stuff.
[3:10:43.060 --> 3:10:46.060]  And then not even by that individual, by people around them, I get criticized.
[3:10:46.060 --> 3:10:50.060]  That I don't like when I just give and give and give and give.
[3:10:50.060 --> 3:11:03.060]  And then always the people and separate, not Marty, we're talking about, but other talk shows, people say, Alex, that Alex Jones needs to call for war and death and shooting war and moose hunting.
[3:11:03.060 --> 3:11:11.060]  And I always quote Mark on that, you know, about how there's tens of millions of patriots, only a few million police and military.
[3:11:11.060 --> 3:11:13.060]  And most of them are actually on our side now.
[3:11:13.060 --> 3:11:17.060]  And it's like moose hunting up north, you know, in New York and Michigan and places.
[3:11:17.060 --> 3:11:20.060]  There's so few moose per hunters.
[3:11:20.060 --> 3:11:21.060]  They have a lottery.
[3:11:21.060 --> 3:11:24.060]  Maybe one out of 20 people gets a moose hunting ticket.
[3:11:24.060 --> 3:11:32.060]  And it tells you if it's a sow or if it's a buck or whatever they call the male and female moose.
[3:11:32.060 --> 3:11:33.060]  I think it's sound.
[3:11:33.060 --> 3:11:35.060]  Look up female moose.
[3:11:35.060 --> 3:11:47.060]  But the point is, you know, it's a in foxes, the males called a dog and the females called a vixen.
[3:11:47.060 --> 3:11:49.060]  I mean, every species has got different names.
[3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:51.060]  A gaggle is a certain number of crows.
[3:11:51.060 --> 3:11:53.060]  A murder is another number.
[3:11:53.060 --> 3:11:55.060]  What is it?
[3:11:55.060 --> 3:11:56.060]  It's a cow.
[3:11:56.060 --> 3:11:58.060]  Okay, the cow.
[3:11:58.060 --> 3:12:04.060]  I know there is a whole bunch of mammal species with the females called a sow, like whales.
[3:12:04.060 --> 3:12:07.060]  Some species of whale are called, the mother's called a sow.
[3:12:07.060 --> 3:12:10.060]  Other species of whale, in fact, look at female whales.
[3:12:10.060 --> 3:12:12.060]  It's only certain species are called sows.
[3:12:12.060 --> 3:12:13.060]  I can't keep track of it.
[3:12:13.060 --> 3:12:17.060]  I know that people think of a female pig as a sow.
[3:12:17.060 --> 3:12:22.060]  And I've got important news to cover, and I'm covering sows here, but I guess that's kind of a...
[3:12:22.060 --> 3:12:28.060]  The issue is there's only maybe one out of 10 guys, depending on the lottery, what the fish and wildlife people come up with every year,
[3:12:28.060 --> 3:12:33.060]  might be one out of five people gets to hunt a moose that goes into the lottery, one out of 100, whatever.
[3:12:33.060 --> 3:12:39.060]  Sometimes when the deer numbers are down in Texas, in certain counties, they have a lottery.
[3:12:39.060 --> 3:12:48.060]  And not everybody gets a, you know, per-meat on the wildlife management, as they call it.
[3:12:48.060 --> 3:12:53.060]  So the analogy here is there's 10 million patriots at least.
[3:12:53.060 --> 3:12:59.060]  If each patriot goes out in bags, just one moose, there'll be no more moose left.
[3:12:59.060 --> 3:13:01.060]  There's more patriots than there are moose.
[3:13:01.060 --> 3:13:04.060]  And a moose being the police.
[3:13:04.060 --> 3:13:07.060]  I don't want that to happen.
[3:13:07.060 --> 3:13:09.060]  I don't want that to go to that point.
[3:13:09.060 --> 3:13:12.060]  Plus, I'm on the year waking people up about the general knowledge.
[3:13:12.060 --> 3:13:14.060]  I get the folks woken up.
[3:13:14.060 --> 3:13:15.060]  I get them energized.
[3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:16.060]  I get them awake.
[3:13:16.060 --> 3:13:20.060]  I get them to be aware of what's going on and happening.
[3:13:20.060 --> 3:13:25.060]  And everybody ought to be happy in the Liberty, Patriot, 9-11 Truth movement, anti-New World War movement, Libertarian movement,
[3:13:25.060 --> 3:13:30.060]  because everybody I talk to says 80% of the folks getting woke up are from this show.
[3:13:30.060 --> 3:13:33.060]  By the grace of God, we've hit the zeitgeist.
[3:13:33.060 --> 3:13:35.060]  And so I wake the people up.
[3:13:35.060 --> 3:13:37.060]  My listeners spread the word and wake people up.
[3:13:37.060 --> 3:13:38.060]  This is the engine.
[3:13:38.060 --> 3:13:42.060]  And then that increases the movement overall.
[3:13:42.060 --> 3:13:49.060]  But then there's kind of this paradoxical thing of a lot of the people, you know, the common folks love me,
[3:13:49.060 --> 3:13:54.060]  but then a lot of people in the movement itself kind of get envious and jealous of me,
[3:13:54.060 --> 3:13:57.060]  because some of them aren't in it for the right reasons.
[3:13:57.060 --> 3:14:00.060]  And then others don't agree with me politically or this idea or that idea.
[3:14:00.060 --> 3:14:04.060]  We got to keep the ammunition going downrange at the New World Order.
[3:14:04.060 --> 3:14:05.060]  That's the issue.
[3:14:05.060 --> 3:14:06.060]  That's the target.
[3:14:06.060 --> 3:14:08.060]  That's who's got to be dealt with.
[3:14:08.060 --> 3:14:10.060]  And a lot of us just flat out business.
[3:14:10.060 --> 3:14:14.060]  I mean, I've had other little networks and stuff call up all my sponsors and try to get them.
[3:14:14.060 --> 3:14:17.060]  And if I just tell the sponsor when they're asking me, well, is there any listeners?
[3:14:17.060 --> 3:14:20.060]  I go, no, but, you know, on this other thing, but do what you want.
[3:14:20.060 --> 3:14:23.060]  That turns into me doing this or that.
[3:14:23.060 --> 3:14:25.060]  You know, that's a lot of people.
[3:14:25.060 --> 3:14:26.060]  This is a business.
[3:14:26.060 --> 3:14:28.060]  This is a total mission, a total commitment.
[3:14:28.060 --> 3:14:29.060]  I realize my life's in the line.
[3:14:29.060 --> 3:14:35.060]  I passed the point of return a long time ago and I'm committed come hell or high water to beat this New World Order.
[3:14:35.060 --> 3:14:36.060]  Okay.
[3:14:36.060 --> 3:14:39.060]  Let's shift gears since I got off into sounds.
[3:14:39.060 --> 3:14:46.060]  Well, let me just finish by saying I genuinely believe in keeping this peaceful as long as we can to grow our numbers.
[3:14:46.060 --> 3:14:52.060]  We're actually building strength every day as the enemy gets more and more exposed and unveiled as criminal and out of control.
[3:14:52.060 --> 3:14:59.060]  Now, maybe people can intellectually argue and debate with me about those facts, but some of the founding fathers, we can still be friends about that.
[3:14:59.060 --> 3:15:08.060]  About whether this is the time, whether this is the place when you start seeing more government massacres and massacres of people rioting and demonstrating.
[3:15:08.060 --> 3:15:13.060]  And when you see more abuses and more Waco's, that's when it's going to happen.
[3:15:13.060 --> 3:15:17.060]  And a lot of people that wanted war once it starts, aren't going to like it.
[3:15:17.060 --> 3:15:28.060]  I'm doing everything I can so that if ever comes to the point where I got to go out and lead people or whatever it takes.
[3:15:28.060 --> 3:15:43.060]  And I'm ready to line up at Bunker Hill, ladies and gentlemen, I'm ready to vote with my muskets, but I got to do everything before I get to that point.
[3:15:43.060 --> 3:15:53.060]  This is like a jujitsu match and we're grappling, we're wrestling and we're starting to get the momentum in the fight.
[3:15:53.060 --> 3:15:59.060]  And the enemy wants to get out of our grapple and stand up straight and go ahead and have a full on battle right now.
[3:15:59.060 --> 3:16:03.060]  We're the one time is on our side like the Rolling Stones songs.
[3:16:03.060 --> 3:16:07.060]  You have to pull that up on YouTube, play a clip of it. Time is on our side.
[3:16:07.060 --> 3:16:10.060]  Well, that's some really good singing in it.
[3:16:10.060 --> 3:16:13.060]  Call your representatives, shoot down the bill.
[3:16:13.060 --> 3:16:14.060]  We've had many victories.
[3:16:14.060 --> 3:16:16.060]  It may pass and it goes to the Senate.
[3:16:16.060 --> 3:16:20.060]  But by the time it gets in there, we'll find out then all the unpopular provisions.
[3:16:20.060 --> 3:16:26.060]  But that'll take a week or so for folks to fare it through 1600 plus pages or whatever it is.
[3:16:26.060 --> 3:16:28.060]  And they say it's growing.
[3:16:28.060 --> 3:16:38.060]  And then we've got to look at those provisions, try to make the Senate strip them out.
[3:16:38.060 --> 3:16:41.060]  Most of it won't be stripped out, but at least we're trying to beat it today.
[3:16:41.060 --> 3:16:43.060]  We're doing the best job we can.
[3:16:43.060 --> 3:16:47.060]  People thought this wouldn't pass because in polls, 80 plus percent of Americans are against it.
[3:16:47.060 --> 3:16:48.060]  They don't care.
[3:16:48.060 --> 3:16:53.060]  99 percent, depending on the poll, 98 percent were against the banker bailout.
[3:16:53.060 --> 3:16:54.060]  It happened.
[3:16:54.060 --> 3:16:57.060]  You know, they just don't care their criminals.
[3:16:57.060 --> 3:17:00.060]  But let them show everybody their dictators.
[3:17:00.060 --> 3:17:01.060]  Let everybody see it.
[3:17:01.060 --> 3:17:06.060]  Now these bastards are getting so bold, they're openly announcing foreign troops.
[3:17:06.060 --> 3:17:08.060]  Educate people about this.
[3:17:08.060 --> 3:17:10.060]  Tell them, speak out now.
[3:17:10.060 --> 3:17:14.060]  They're going to shut down the communications once this goes hot.
[3:17:14.060 --> 3:17:22.060]  We need to, whether you want to come fast or slow, spend the time you got to warn as many people as you can.
[3:17:22.060 --> 3:17:27.060]  You know, I'm not spending time trying to move out of Austin to the country to protect myself for all of this.
[3:17:27.060 --> 3:17:31.060]  I'm just staying here because I don't have the time and energy to even move or find a place or get out of here.
[3:17:31.060 --> 3:17:38.060]  And I'm hopefully we can expose them and they'll kind of back off and this thing won't go in all out war.
[3:17:38.060 --> 3:17:46.060]  There's a lot of people who've got a kind of like a Rambo complex where they want to want to see this conflict in the U.S.
[3:17:46.060 --> 3:17:48.060]  and the globalist think they're ready for it.
[3:17:48.060 --> 3:17:50.060]  I believe they're going to lose.
[3:17:50.060 --> 3:17:55.060]  But I just can't believe it's going to happen.
[3:17:55.060 --> 3:17:56.060]  I mean, it's pretty much going to happen.
[3:17:56.060 --> 3:17:59.060]  The more I look at things, it's going to be hellish.
[3:17:59.060 --> 3:18:04.060]  Well, we do post things like that from China to show you these fools email me and say,
[3:18:04.060 --> 3:18:06.060]  if we have war with the government, they got better equipment.
[3:18:06.060 --> 3:18:10.060]  Nothing can stop guerrilla warfare, ladies and gentlemen in a nation disarmed.
[3:18:10.060 --> 3:18:12.060]  The issue is they want to put their cashless grid in.
[3:18:12.060 --> 3:18:14.060]  That's five to 10 years.
[3:18:14.060 --> 3:18:18.060]  Once that's in, it'll be even harder.
[3:18:18.060 --> 3:18:19.060]  So it's an equilibrium.
[3:18:19.060 --> 3:18:21.060]  So I'm fighting them putting the grid in.
[3:18:21.060 --> 3:18:23.060]  We're trying to slow that down.
[3:18:23.060 --> 3:18:25.060]  So there's some arguments for the longer we wait.
[3:18:25.060 --> 3:18:26.060]  The worst it is.
[3:18:26.060 --> 3:18:28.060]  There's other arguments for the longer.
[3:18:28.060 --> 3:18:29.060]  They wait.
[3:18:29.060 --> 3:18:30.060]  The worst it is for them.
[3:18:30.060 --> 3:18:33.060]  I've seen their own white papers and a lot of their own statements.
[3:18:33.060 --> 3:18:35.060]  They believe the longer they wait, the harder it is on them.
[3:18:35.060 --> 3:18:40.060]  That's why they want to go ahead and get it on in a combat situation now.
[3:18:40.060 --> 3:18:41.060]  These are important subjects.
[3:18:41.060 --> 3:18:45.060]  Maybe I should have folks like Mark and people on about that.
[3:18:45.060 --> 3:18:49.060]  It's just I need to continue to broadcast.
[3:18:49.060 --> 3:18:52.060]  I need to continue to put the information out here.
[3:18:52.060 --> 3:18:55.060]  I've already had the FBI and Secret Service here at my offices and I told people that
[3:18:55.060 --> 3:18:56.060]  and they didn't believe it.
[3:18:56.060 --> 3:18:57.060]  Now it's been all of the newspapers.
[3:18:57.060 --> 3:18:59.060]  I mean, I've been physically attacked.
[3:18:59.060 --> 3:19:03.060]  I mean, I am at the very tip of the spear here and I'm trying.
[3:19:03.060 --> 3:19:06.060]  I'm not a George Washington folks.
[3:19:06.060 --> 3:19:09.060]  Okay.
[3:19:09.060 --> 3:19:14.060]  I'm one of the political minds about how to wake the people up.
[3:19:14.060 --> 3:19:17.060]  I'm more of a, and I'm not trying to parallel myself with these people,
[3:19:17.060 --> 3:19:23.060]  but in the modern age of resistance, I'm more of a Sam Adams type in that I'm out there
[3:19:23.060 --> 3:19:25.060]  setting bushfires in the minds of men.
[3:19:25.060 --> 3:19:29.060]  I'm out there running a media operation, getting broad sheets out to people.
[3:19:29.060 --> 3:19:31.060]  You understand?
[3:19:31.060 --> 3:19:35.060]  And so I'm just there trying to wake up as many people as I can to build our numbers
[3:19:35.060 --> 3:19:38.060]  while I watch the enemy getting ready to move on us.
[3:19:38.060 --> 3:19:39.060]  Wake up, wake up.
[3:19:39.060 --> 3:19:40.060]  Come on.
[3:19:40.060 --> 3:19:41.060]  The enemy's coming.
[3:19:41.060 --> 3:19:42.060]  The enemy's coming.
[3:19:42.060 --> 3:19:43.060]  The enemy's coming.
[3:19:43.060 --> 3:19:44.060]  I'm up here on the parapet, warning the enemy's coming.
[3:19:44.060 --> 3:19:47.060]  People are saying, well, soldier climb down the wall and run out and fight the enemy out there.
[3:19:47.060 --> 3:19:49.060]  Hell, we know the enemy's coming.
[3:19:49.060 --> 3:19:52.060]  I'm here trying to get, and all these people that call for war and bloodshed,
[3:19:52.060 --> 3:19:55.060]  you never see them out shooting anybody.
[3:19:55.060 --> 3:19:56.060]  You ever notice that?
[3:19:56.060 --> 3:19:58.060]  It's kill, kill, war, war, death, death.
[3:19:58.060 --> 3:19:59.060]  You need to do it, Alex.
[3:19:59.060 --> 3:20:01.060]  You need to go out and do it.
[3:20:01.060 --> 3:20:06.060]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China
[3:20:06.060 --> 3:20:08.060]  have now penetrated our power grid.
[3:20:08.060 --> 3:20:14.060]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid.
[3:20:14.060 --> 3:20:19.060]  Some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge,
[3:20:19.060 --> 3:20:24.060]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[3:20:24.060 --> 3:20:30.060]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[3:20:30.060 --> 3:20:36.060]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[3:20:36.060 --> 3:20:40.060]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[3:20:40.060 --> 3:20:43.060]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[3:20:43.060 --> 3:20:49.060]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[3:20:49.060 --> 3:20:54.060]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to MySolarBackup.com.
[3:20:54.060 --> 3:20:56.060]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[3:20:56.060 --> 3:21:01.060]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[3:21:01.060 --> 3:21:04.060]  It is a big idea.
[3:21:04.060 --> 3:21:06.060]  A new world order.
[3:21:06.060 --> 3:21:11.060]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:21:11.060 --> 3:21:14.060]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[3:21:14.060 --> 3:21:17.060]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:21:17.060 --> 3:21:20.060]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:21:20.060 --> 3:21:30.060]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:21:30.060 --> 3:21:36.060]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[3:21:42.060 --> 3:21:44.060]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[3:21:44.060 --> 3:21:45.060]  They have all the money they need.
[3:21:45.060 --> 3:21:46.060]  They're after power.
[3:21:46.060 --> 3:22:11.060]  Gold. It's like nothing else on Earth.
[3:22:11.060 --> 3:22:18.060]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[3:22:18.060 --> 3:22:26.060]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[3:22:26.060 --> 3:22:35.060]  Mitus Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[3:23:00.060 --> 3:23:09.060]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:23:09.060 --> 3:23:14.060]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:23:14.060 --> 3:23:25.060]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[3:23:25.060 --> 3:23:31.060]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[3:23:31.060 --> 3:23:37.060]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[3:23:59.060 --> 3:24:15.060]  Okay, the LA Times is reporting right now H1N1 swine flu has infected an estimated 1 million in U.S.
[3:24:15.060 --> 3:24:24.060]  See, I saw them pre-hyping flu and I said two months before they launched that staged attack, I said I believe they're going to use flu.
[3:24:24.060 --> 3:24:31.060]  And then Baxter Pharmaceutical was involved mixing live weaponized bird flu with regular vaccines but got caught.
[3:24:31.060 --> 3:24:36.060]  That was in Bloomberg and I said I see flu as their main attack coming up.
[3:24:36.060 --> 3:24:39.060]  And then that's when they announced pandemic into the world.
[3:24:39.060 --> 3:24:40.060]  I said this could be it.
[3:24:40.060 --> 3:24:44.060]  It could be a hoax or it could be a cover story for something down the road for martial law.
[3:24:44.060 --> 3:24:47.060]  The troops were on the streets because of the flu.
[3:24:47.060 --> 3:24:49.060]  Five guys have died coming up in the fall.
[3:24:49.060 --> 3:24:52.060]  If one died, they acted like it was into the world.
[3:24:52.060 --> 3:24:53.060]  What happened if five died?
[3:24:53.060 --> 3:24:55.060]  We got this fear thing going.
[3:24:55.060 --> 3:24:59.060]  One million have it but it isn't hurting us.
[3:24:59.060 --> 3:25:01.060]  It's just a no big deal flu.
[3:25:01.060 --> 3:25:04.060]  See, this is mind control.
[3:25:04.060 --> 3:25:12.060]  And I wanted to read to you from CBS News, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a memo to some health care providers
[3:25:12.060 --> 3:25:17.060]  noting procedures to following the swine flu outbreak eventually makes quarantines necessary.
[3:25:17.060 --> 3:25:26.060]  DHS Secretary Bridger McGraw circulated the swine flu memo which was obtained by CBS News.
[3:25:26.060 --> 3:25:33.060]  On Monday night it says the Department of Justice established legal federal authorities pertaining to the implementation of a quarantine
[3:25:33.060 --> 3:25:38.060]  and enforcement under approval from HHS and Surgeon General as the authority to issue quarantines.
[3:25:38.060 --> 3:25:50.060]  And it goes on to say force inoculations and the executive order 13-375, 13-375.
[3:25:50.060 --> 3:25:56.060]  And their argument is that you've got to take the shots because you'll make other people sick
[3:25:56.060 --> 3:25:59.060]  but if the other idiots have taken it, then they can't get it.
[3:25:59.060 --> 3:26:08.060]  But this is in Arkansas, Arkansas State Health Department mandatory vaccines are constitutional which of course they're not.
[3:26:08.060 --> 3:26:13.060]  And Paul goes through with the Supreme Court said blacks weren't humans and stuff like that in the past.
[3:26:13.060 --> 3:26:15.060]  There's a lot of other court rulings saying they can't make you take shots.
[3:26:15.060 --> 3:26:17.060]  There is no mandatory shot.
[3:26:17.060 --> 3:26:19.060]  It's recommended but they do it through fraud.
[3:26:19.060 --> 3:26:29.060]  So here is the news website of former Democrat is what it's called.
[3:26:29.060 --> 3:26:37.060]  They sent out vaccines contaminated with H5N1 avian flu is also in the article talking about baxter pharmaceutical involved in making the vaccine they're going to force you to take.
[3:26:37.060 --> 3:26:40.060]  And this all happened the months before the outbreak.
[3:26:40.060 --> 3:26:45.060]  So here he is calling up a government official will play it for this segment part of the next.
[3:26:45.060 --> 3:26:48.060]  Here it is.
[3:26:48.060 --> 3:26:50.060]  Oh, hi.
[3:26:50.060 --> 3:26:53.060]  I was given your number by Alicia.
[3:26:53.060 --> 3:26:54.060]  I had some questions.
[3:26:54.060 --> 3:26:55.060]  I left you a message.
[3:26:55.060 --> 3:26:57.060]  I think I called Friday.
[3:26:57.060 --> 3:27:00.060]  I left you a message but just that I'd call you back.
[3:27:00.060 --> 3:27:05.060]  I'm looking into the the vaccination refusal forms.
[3:27:05.060 --> 3:27:16.060]  And I'm trying to find out what the I talked to a lawyer and it seems that that is an application for a waiver.
[3:27:16.060 --> 3:27:18.060]  Is that correct?
[3:27:18.060 --> 3:27:20.060]  Do you know about these forms?
[3:27:20.060 --> 3:27:23.060]  Well, I don't know that it's an application for a waiver.
[3:27:23.060 --> 3:27:26.060]  The waiver will be granted if you just fill it out correctly.
[3:27:26.060 --> 3:27:27.060]  Yeah.
[3:27:27.060 --> 3:27:28.060]  Okay.
[3:27:28.060 --> 3:27:29.060]  Yeah, but it's basically pause.
[3:27:29.060 --> 3:27:30.060]  It's not it.
[3:27:30.060 --> 3:27:31.060]  Pause.
[3:27:31.060 --> 3:27:32.060]  There is no law.
[3:27:32.060 --> 3:27:33.060]  You've got to take vaccines.
[3:27:33.060 --> 3:27:37.060]  It becomes the policy of the state health department lobbied by the feds.
[3:27:37.060 --> 3:27:41.060]  So you heard Rick Perry said all girls got to take HPV shot that's killing a bunch of them.
[3:27:41.060 --> 3:27:42.060]  Admittedly.
[3:27:42.060 --> 3:27:46.060]  There's Google girls killed by Gardasil.
[3:27:46.060 --> 3:27:49.060]  He just made it list of recommended.
[3:27:49.060 --> 3:27:52.060]  Then the school lies and says it's mandatory.
[3:27:52.060 --> 3:27:56.060]  Because oh, we will grant you the waiver.
[3:27:56.060 --> 3:27:58.060]  If you fill out the form right.
[3:27:58.060 --> 3:28:00.060]  Because they have to.
[3:28:00.060 --> 3:28:03.060]  But that's to get a waiver for something there isn't a law for.
[3:28:03.060 --> 3:28:06.060]  This is all lawyer tricks like 501c3 with churches.
[3:28:06.060 --> 3:28:08.060]  They don't have to have that 50 years ago.
[3:28:08.060 --> 3:28:11.060]  But they got people tricked into signing them, waving their rights.
[3:28:11.060 --> 3:28:13.060]  Keep rolling it.
[3:28:13.060 --> 3:28:15.060]  And to get it sent to me.
[3:28:15.060 --> 3:28:17.060]  And then the way it reads.
[3:28:17.060 --> 3:28:19.060]  If you read it, it says I then fill it out.
[3:28:19.060 --> 3:28:21.060]  But and then I send it in.
[3:28:21.060 --> 3:28:22.060]  Yes.
[3:28:22.060 --> 3:28:24.060]  As a request for the waiver.
[3:28:24.060 --> 3:28:26.060]  And I'm not quite understanding that.
[3:28:26.060 --> 3:28:33.060]  That's what I think what you're saying it will always be.
[3:28:33.060 --> 3:28:39.060]  Well, if you've done it correctly, and if it's done, I'll give you a little history on that.
[3:28:39.060 --> 3:28:42.060]  Sure, if you got if you got time, I'd like to hear it because.
[3:28:42.060 --> 3:28:43.060]  Sure.
[3:28:43.060 --> 3:28:45.060]  I'm getting some feedback that.
[3:28:45.060 --> 3:28:47.060]  Like it's cumbersome or.
[3:28:47.060 --> 3:28:50.060]  It shouldn't be that difficult.
[3:28:50.060 --> 3:28:52.060]  What happened.
[3:28:52.060 --> 3:28:58.060]  Prior to the passage of that law, which I believe took one into effect in 2003.
[3:28:58.060 --> 3:29:04.060]  Prior to that, the only exemptions that were available in Arkansas.
[3:29:04.060 --> 3:29:11.060]  Were religious exemption that was very constricted as far as who had applied to.
[3:29:11.060 --> 3:29:14.060]  And you could have a medical exemption.
[3:29:14.060 --> 3:29:17.060]  And the only people that it that were could get.
[3:29:17.060 --> 3:29:19.060]  Are you talking for children?
[3:29:19.060 --> 3:29:20.060]  Yes.
[3:29:20.060 --> 3:29:22.060]  Okay, well, I'm talking for adults to here.
[3:29:22.060 --> 3:29:24.060]  Well, I'm not just limited to children.
[3:29:24.060 --> 3:29:25.060]  It didn't matter.
[3:29:25.060 --> 3:29:26.060]  I mean, it's worth it.
[3:29:26.060 --> 3:29:28.060]  Yeah, see, see, see a hit pause.
[3:29:28.060 --> 3:29:29.060]  It doesn't matter.
[3:29:29.060 --> 3:29:33.060]  According to this lawyer, and this is these legal counsel spokesman for the Arkansas State Health Department.
[3:29:33.060 --> 3:29:38.060]  All of us have to take whatever shots they say, see.
[3:29:38.060 --> 3:29:40.060]  But there's no law.
[3:29:40.060 --> 3:29:46.060]  But then he claims and cites eugenics cases for racial hygiene coming up.
[3:29:46.060 --> 3:29:48.060]  These special family courts.
[3:29:48.060 --> 3:29:51.060]  That's the fraudulent new system of law.
[3:29:51.060 --> 3:29:53.060]  We're on the march.
[3:29:53.060 --> 3:29:55.060]  The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.060 --> 3:30:01.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.060 --> 3:30:03.060]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:30:03.060 --> 3:30:07.060]  And I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[3:30:07.060 --> 3:30:08.060]  Inner health botanicals.

[3:31:01.060 --> 3:31:06.060]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[3:31:06.060 --> 3:31:10.060]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:31:10.060 --> 3:31:16.060]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:31:16.060 --> 3:31:21.060]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:31:21.060 --> 3:31:25.060]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:31:25.060 --> 3:31:28.060]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:31:28.060 --> 3:31:31.060]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:31:31.060 --> 3:31:35.060]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:31:35.060 --> 3:31:40.060]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:31:40.060 --> 3:31:44.060]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:31:44.060 --> 3:31:45.060]  a longtime sponsor of ours.

[3:33:01.060 --> 3:33:18.060]  Hey, side issue, San Antonio newspaper, the current great paper, they've moved the new cybersecurity NSA snooping hub for the American people.
[3:33:18.060 --> 3:33:25.060]  One of the big ones to a giant facility in San Antonio and it's got bar bar around it and all that.
[3:33:25.060 --> 3:33:32.060]  If you take a picture, the NSA will run out without warrants on city property outside, grab you, steal your stuff.
[3:33:32.060 --> 3:33:34.060]  I think I'm going to go down there.
[3:33:34.060 --> 3:33:37.060]  Listen, you dirty crooks that work for offshore banks.
[3:33:37.060 --> 3:33:41.060]  We know you spy on every email, every fax, everything.
[3:33:41.060 --> 3:33:47.060]  You're engaging in crimes, you surveil us, you look through your walls, you're putting up your high altitude blimps,
[3:33:47.060 --> 3:33:56.060]  you work for offshore banks, the National Reconnaissance Office, CIA, Defense Intelligence, your data mining, your total information awareness network,
[3:33:56.060 --> 3:33:58.060]  run by the criminal Admiral Poindexter.
[3:33:58.060 --> 3:34:01.060]  When Congress said shut it down, he illegally kept it open.
[3:34:01.060 --> 3:34:04.060]  You make us sick.
[3:34:04.060 --> 3:34:10.060]  And the...
[3:34:10.060 --> 3:34:12.060]  Oh, it just makes my head spin.
[3:34:12.060 --> 3:34:18.060]  This government is so illegitimate and so criminal, land of the free, home of the cowards, land of the cowards, home of the slaves,
[3:34:18.060 --> 3:34:25.060]  until we stand up and say, no, this is a big data mining giant facility to read all your emails and everything without warrants.
[3:34:25.060 --> 3:34:29.060]  And then they admit, NSA people admit they sit around listening to you having phone sex with your wife,
[3:34:29.060 --> 3:34:32.060]  or they dial in using the phone even when it's on the receiver.
[3:34:32.060 --> 3:34:37.060]  They dial in and listen to you having sex, listen to you on the toilet, and they just sit around laughing all day.
[3:34:37.060 --> 3:34:39.060]  It's a bunch of criminals.
[3:34:39.060 --> 3:34:42.060]  They're going to then lie all these years saying they're not listening to you.
[3:34:42.060 --> 3:34:44.060]  And they're there to make sure America falls to the bankers.
[3:34:44.060 --> 3:34:50.060]  And they've had the cybersecurity run by the Air Force and the NSA say their job is to attack blogs and websites
[3:34:50.060 --> 3:34:55.060]  and go after bloggers that disagree with them and, quote, kill American citizens if need be.
[3:34:55.060 --> 3:34:59.060]  One of their colonels is on record saying they're going to start killing us.
[3:34:59.060 --> 3:35:02.060]  So everybody needs to know where these criminals are at.
[3:35:02.060 --> 3:35:04.060]  And they will send the NSA out if you put this up.
[3:35:04.060 --> 3:35:11.060]  In an optagon economy, the NSA's new data mining facility is one component of a growing local surveillance industry.
[3:35:11.060 --> 3:35:17.060]  We should all go have a protest out there and just sit there with these criminals and force the issue.
[3:35:17.060 --> 3:35:22.060]  Here they are illegally spying on us, engaging in all their crimes.
[3:35:22.060 --> 3:35:24.060]  I was down in San Antonio at gunpoint once.
[3:35:24.060 --> 3:35:27.060]  We were filming Delta Force at Fort Sam Houston.
[3:35:27.060 --> 3:35:29.060]  They just done a big drill there.
[3:35:29.060 --> 3:35:31.060]  They tried to bribe the police chief.
[3:35:31.060 --> 3:35:37.060]  There were total criminals and MPs come up and put a gun to our chest, but we were on base.
[3:35:37.060 --> 3:35:39.060]  This won't be on base.
[3:35:39.060 --> 3:35:42.060]  You're a precious little crime center down there.
[3:35:42.060 --> 3:35:47.060]  Surrounded by bar bar fencing on both sides, don't get in or out.
[3:35:47.060 --> 3:35:52.060]  The anonymous get massive building on West Military Drive in San Antonio's Loop 410 Freeway looms mysteriously,
[3:35:52.060 --> 3:35:54.060]  but no identifying signs of any kind.
[3:35:54.060 --> 3:35:56.060]  Surveillance is tight.
[3:35:56.060 --> 3:36:01.060]  The security cameras surround the under construction building.
[3:36:01.060 --> 3:36:06.060]  Readers are advised not to take photos unless you care to be detained for at least 45 minutes,
[3:36:06.060 --> 3:36:12.060]  interrogated by the national security agency and as this reporter was, you know, offshore criminals.
[3:36:12.060 --> 3:36:14.060]  In fact, go to the actual article, the panoptagon economy.
[3:36:14.060 --> 3:36:16.060]  Let's put it up on screen.
[3:36:16.060 --> 3:36:17.060]  In fact, just Google that building.
[3:36:17.060 --> 3:36:19.060]  We'll give everybody a shot of that.
[3:36:19.060 --> 3:36:21.060]  And it's ridiculous.
[3:36:21.060 --> 3:36:22.060]  They know Google.
[3:36:22.060 --> 3:36:23.060]  They know satellites.
[3:36:23.060 --> 3:36:25.060]  They know anybody can get photos that are hidden.
[3:36:25.060 --> 3:36:27.060]  It's about letting you know.
[3:36:27.060 --> 3:36:30.060]  Like the Washington Post reported, they got a DARPA facility in D.C.
[3:36:30.060 --> 3:36:34.060]  Anybody out taking photos of their kids or dogs, you know, people got cameras.
[3:36:34.060 --> 3:36:41.060]  Oh, taking a picture of their buddy there at the bus stop, cops run up, grab you, drag you off.
[3:36:41.060 --> 3:36:43.060]  It's about letting you know you're a slave.
[3:36:43.060 --> 3:36:46.060]  Letting you know you don't take photos in America.
[3:36:46.060 --> 3:36:51.060]  But they put up cameras and this facility also runs the face scanning cameras on street corners,
[3:36:51.060 --> 3:36:57.060]  the heat resonance that know your heat signature, the cameras that scanner your license plates without warrants.
[3:36:57.060 --> 3:36:59.060]  Just a ball part of the big.
[3:36:59.060 --> 3:37:06.060]  They're also building a level four bio weapons lab to create weapons to kill us down in San Antonio and to release into the vaccines.
[3:37:06.060 --> 3:37:10.060]  And they got a bunch of do good or shaved head morons working there.
[3:37:10.060 --> 3:37:12.060]  I've no idea how criminal this government is.
[3:37:12.060 --> 3:37:13.060]  There it is.
[3:37:13.060 --> 3:37:18.060]  The Panoptagon economy, San Antonio current, they done reports on us.
[3:37:18.060 --> 3:37:19.060]  Yeah, that's it.
[3:37:19.060 --> 3:37:22.060]  There's some time I'm going down there.
[3:37:22.060 --> 3:37:25.060]  NSA is going, oh, look, he says he's coming down here.
[3:37:25.060 --> 3:37:27.060]  That means we can get NSA extra funding on him to run ops.
[3:37:27.060 --> 3:37:29.060]  Hey, I don't care what you criminals do to me.
[3:37:29.060 --> 3:37:30.060]  I'm good.
[3:37:30.060 --> 3:37:31.060]  I'm decent.
[3:37:31.060 --> 3:37:34.060]  I'm not drug dealing child kidnappers like you.
[3:37:34.060 --> 3:37:39.060]  It's come out in congressional hearings that you run giant child kidnapping rings and help cover it up.
[3:37:39.060 --> 3:37:46.060]  The NSA is there to supply little kids for for Arabs and foreigners to rape them and blow their heads off with 45s.
[3:37:46.060 --> 3:37:50.060]  It's been reported in the Italian news with the snuff films our government produces.
[3:37:50.060 --> 3:37:51.060]  That's what you are.
[3:37:51.060 --> 3:37:55.060]  A bunch of murdering criminals here to destroy America.
[3:37:55.060 --> 3:38:03.060]  You work for the illegitimate federal reserve that's announced it's above the law that's preparing to shoot the American people up with more cancer viruses.
[3:38:03.060 --> 3:38:09.060]  And you idiots will go shoot your families up with the cancer viruses and love the fact they flop around and die later because you're cowards.
[3:38:09.060 --> 3:38:18.060]  You're all good patriots, real conservative, all this gun grabbing going on, you're a bunch of felons with Admiral Poindexter.
[3:38:18.060 --> 3:38:20.060]  I just can't handle it.
[3:38:20.060 --> 3:38:25.060]  In America, red, white and blue, you go down in a major giant FEMA camp complex.
[3:38:25.060 --> 3:38:26.060]  That's really what it is.
[3:38:26.060 --> 3:38:36.060]  With a bunch of goons setting up their big data spying data mining criminal operation and they come out like you couldn't drive by with cars with video cameras all day.
[3:38:36.060 --> 3:38:42.060]  Like people don't know where it is, like it hadn't been on the news, like real terrorists exist.
[3:38:42.060 --> 3:38:44.060]  The NSA had all the intercepts on 9-11.
[3:38:44.060 --> 3:38:47.060]  Your bosses staged the attacks.
[3:38:47.060 --> 3:38:52.060]  Don't use the stinking terror attacks in third world countries to go in and out.
[3:38:52.060 --> 3:38:55.060]  We're just overthrowing these dumb brown people.
[3:38:55.060 --> 3:38:59.060]  But now you're doing it here, aren't you, to the republic?
[3:38:59.060 --> 3:39:01.060]  I mean, where does it end?
[3:39:01.060 --> 3:39:04.060]  Did you find the Washington Post article?
[3:39:04.060 --> 3:39:06.060]  Punch that up on screen for folks.
[3:39:06.060 --> 3:39:08.060]  Show them who the facility.
[3:39:08.060 --> 3:39:10.060]  All you got to Google was all over the news last week.
[3:39:10.060 --> 3:39:11.060]  I didn't cover it.
[3:39:11.060 --> 3:39:12.060]  I should have.
[3:39:12.060 --> 3:39:13.060]  I want to get the guy on.
[3:39:13.060 --> 3:39:14.060]  It happened to.
[3:39:14.060 --> 3:39:16.060]  I told the producers.
[3:39:16.060 --> 3:39:22.060]  It takes a photo of this big giant building complex in D.C. and they run out and grab him.
[3:39:22.060 --> 3:39:24.060]  And he's suing them, by the way, now.
[3:39:24.060 --> 3:39:26.060]  And it turns out there's no law.
[3:39:26.060 --> 3:39:28.060]  It's just made up national security.
[3:39:28.060 --> 3:39:31.060]  They'd love to grab you and rip your teeth out with pliers.
[3:39:31.060 --> 3:39:32.060]  That's what they are.
[3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:36.060]  Pedophile criminal murderers join the government so they can do this.
[3:39:36.060 --> 3:39:37.060]  They hate you.
[3:39:37.060 --> 3:39:38.060]  It has nothing to do with security.
[3:39:38.060 --> 3:39:42.060]  It's about letting you know you're a nobody, but somebody to work for them until you're
[3:39:42.060 --> 3:39:46.060]  50 and then die of cancer they injected you with.
[3:39:46.060 --> 3:39:51.060]  It's like man to tame for taking photo of a building.
[3:39:51.060 --> 3:39:53.060]  Washington Post.
[3:39:53.060 --> 3:39:54.060]  That was last week.
[3:39:54.060 --> 3:39:55.060]  I see it every day.
[3:39:55.060 --> 3:39:59.060]  And I've had it happen to me in England and put in their terror databases because they
[3:39:59.060 --> 3:40:04.060]  are terrorist criminals robbing and stealing everything.
[3:40:04.060 --> 3:40:07.060]  Coming up, I'm going to finish the clip.
[3:40:07.060 --> 3:40:14.060]  They're about to pass bills to regulate and tax and do home inspections and tax all carbon.
[3:40:14.060 --> 3:40:18.060]  It's been all over the news.
[3:40:18.060 --> 3:40:23.060]  It's Washington Post, man detained.
[3:40:23.060 --> 3:40:24.060]  Oh, now I'm going crazy.
[3:40:24.060 --> 3:40:26.060]  Let me think of the exact headline.
[3:40:26.060 --> 3:40:37.060]  It is now illegal to take photos of buildings in D.C.
[3:40:37.060 --> 3:40:40.060]  But there's no law, but they have weapons.
[3:40:40.060 --> 3:40:43.060]  And it's their country and they're going to ship the Coke and heroin in and your kids
[3:40:43.060 --> 3:40:45.060]  are going to use it and go to their own prisons.
[3:40:45.060 --> 3:40:47.060]  And they're going to make your kids take Ritalin and Prozac.
[3:40:47.060 --> 3:40:49.060]  And they're going to take your guns and they're going to hurt you.
[3:40:49.060 --> 3:40:52.060]  And they've got a lot of stupid goons who like to push people around and aren't real
[3:40:52.060 --> 3:40:57.060]  warriors that like to pick on innocent people and they enjoy just destroying the Republic,
[3:40:57.060 --> 3:40:58.060]  just filth.
[3:40:58.060 --> 3:40:59.060]  Yes, there it is.
[3:40:59.060 --> 3:41:00.060]  There it is.
[3:41:00.060 --> 3:41:01.060]  Washington Post.
[3:41:01.060 --> 3:41:02.060]  Secret buildings you may not photograph.
[3:41:02.060 --> 3:41:05.060]  There's the Washington Post right there.
[3:41:05.060 --> 3:41:08.060]  Secret buildings you may not photograph.
[3:41:08.060 --> 3:41:09.060]  DARPA.
[3:41:09.060 --> 3:41:18.060]  I am sick of you criminal filth trying to domesticate us and intimidate us and set the president
[3:41:18.060 --> 3:41:23.060]  to wear your slaves so your offshore banker masters can suck us dry.
[3:41:23.060 --> 3:41:25.060]  Stop being traitors.
[3:41:25.060 --> 3:41:27.060]  Stop destroying the United States.
[3:41:27.060 --> 3:41:36.060]  Stop claiming your patriots.
[3:41:36.060 --> 3:41:38.060]  I just see stuff like this and it makes me mad.
[3:41:38.060 --> 3:41:42.060]  And I'm already wound up over the Federal Reserve dictatorship and saying Congress has no authority
[3:41:42.060 --> 3:41:46.060]  over the coining and issuance of currency and money.
[3:41:46.060 --> 3:41:50.060]  I go to events and they have the Army watching us and it's now in the news.
[3:41:50.060 --> 3:41:54.060]  The Army follows us around when we go protest the Federal Reserve in Ron Paul.
[3:41:54.060 --> 3:41:55.060]  You're criminals.
[3:41:55.060 --> 3:41:56.060]  You're in the wrong.
[3:41:56.060 --> 3:41:57.060]  You're bad.
[3:41:57.060 --> 3:41:58.060]  Got it?
[3:41:58.060 --> 3:41:59.060]  Get it through your head.
[3:41:59.060 --> 3:42:04.060]  But see, they hire these little nobody scum bags and people used to torturing people and
[3:42:04.060 --> 3:42:07.060]  spying on people in Iraq and they're bringing them all back here to do it to us.
[3:42:07.060 --> 3:42:08.060]  You are trash.
[3:42:08.060 --> 3:42:09.060]  You are scum.
[3:42:09.060 --> 3:42:10.060]  You're worse than Stalin.
[3:42:10.060 --> 3:42:11.060]  You're as bad as Hitler.
[3:42:11.060 --> 3:42:12.060]  You're as bad as Lenin.
[3:42:12.060 --> 3:42:13.060]  You're trash.
[3:42:13.060 --> 3:42:14.060]  You're filth.
[3:42:14.060 --> 3:42:15.060]  You're malice crap.
[3:42:15.060 --> 3:42:17.060]  You're pieces of un-American trash.
[3:42:17.060 --> 3:42:19.060]  Get the American flags off your car.
[3:42:19.060 --> 3:42:24.060]  Stop putting browning stickers, deer hunting stickers on your car and swagging around.
[3:42:24.060 --> 3:42:25.060]  You're an American.
[3:42:25.060 --> 3:42:27.060]  I know who you people are.
[3:42:27.060 --> 3:42:29.060]  You're a bunch of trash on power trips.
[3:42:29.060 --> 3:42:33.060]  And I swear we're going to bring you to justice when we take this country back.
[3:42:33.060 --> 3:42:36.060]  We got to make sure you all get in trouble for what you've done.
[3:42:36.060 --> 3:42:42.060]  You'll just come right back like cancer.
[3:42:42.060 --> 3:42:46.060]  God, they go on ABC News in Bragg, how they listen to you have sex with your wife and
[3:42:46.060 --> 3:42:47.060]  sit around laughing.
[3:42:47.060 --> 3:42:50.060]  The NSA guys literally just sit there in their offices masturbating.
[3:42:50.060 --> 3:42:53.060]  I mean, that's just a bunch of scum bags masturbating.
[3:42:53.060 --> 3:42:55.060]  It's what the NSA is.
[3:42:55.060 --> 3:42:56.060]  And covering up.
[3:42:56.060 --> 3:43:00.060]  Local cops are about to bust a government child kidnapping ring.
[3:43:00.060 --> 3:43:02.060]  NSA comes in to stop.
[3:43:02.060 --> 3:43:04.060]  Somebody catches government ship and drugs in.
[3:43:04.060 --> 3:43:06.060]  NSA finds out, comes in and blocks the investigation.
[3:43:06.060 --> 3:43:11.060]  It's all to make sure their crimes continue and spying on Congress illegally and running
[3:43:11.060 --> 3:43:15.060]  all their scams and MI6 and MI5 spies on the British Parliament.
[3:43:15.060 --> 3:43:16.060]  You're criminals.
[3:43:16.060 --> 3:43:17.060]  We're going to get you.
[3:43:17.060 --> 3:43:19.060]  You're criminals.
[3:43:19.060 --> 3:43:21.060]  And a lot of you are just compartmentalized.
[3:43:21.060 --> 3:43:26.060]  You just grab the data and pass it up to the sicko eggheads above you.
[3:43:26.060 --> 3:43:28.060]  Okay, now I'm getting mad.
[3:43:28.060 --> 3:43:33.060]  Go ahead and finish the clip where this bastard creature in Arkansas saying it's the law.
[3:43:33.060 --> 3:43:35.060]  We're going to forcibly inject you.
[3:43:35.060 --> 3:43:36.060]  Here it is.
[3:43:36.060 --> 3:43:39.060]  Oh, I can refuse a vaccination whenever I want.
[3:43:39.060 --> 3:43:43.060]  I mean, I assume you're going into college or is this what you're asking?
[3:43:43.060 --> 3:43:49.060]  No, I'm concerned about mandatory vaccinations for the swine flu.
[3:43:49.060 --> 3:43:52.060]  Well, there is no mandatory vaccination for the swine flu.
[3:43:52.060 --> 3:43:56.060]  Well, if you read the CDC, you'd read that differently, I'm afraid.
[3:43:56.060 --> 3:43:58.060]  Well, I'm not saying there couldn't be in the future.
[3:43:58.060 --> 3:43:59.060]  Well, exactly.
[3:43:59.060 --> 3:44:00.060]  That's my point.
[3:44:00.060 --> 3:44:02.060]  There's simply nothing.
[3:44:02.060 --> 3:44:05.060]  And that's very, I mean, that's constitutional.
[3:44:05.060 --> 3:44:06.060]  There's no doubt about it.
[3:44:06.060 --> 3:44:09.060]  Well, there are a lot of things of constitutional that are being undone right now.
[3:44:09.060 --> 3:44:11.060]  So that is why I'm questioning it.
[3:44:11.060 --> 3:44:18.060]  This is the law that goes back, you know, 100 years or maybe more.
[3:44:18.060 --> 3:44:20.060]  Yeah, it costs.
[3:44:20.060 --> 3:44:24.060]  Yeah, there were laws to take black babies and put them in buckets of water saying they
[3:44:24.060 --> 3:44:25.060]  weren't human and kill them.
[3:44:25.060 --> 3:44:27.060]  Is that good?
[3:44:27.060 --> 3:44:29.060]  Just sick all you cowards.
[3:44:29.060 --> 3:44:32.060]  You know this is tyranny, but you're going to roll over and go along with it till this
[3:44:32.060 --> 3:44:35.060]  country turns into a total cesspit because that's what you like.
[3:44:35.060 --> 3:44:36.060]  Because they're not artists.
[3:44:36.060 --> 3:44:37.060]  They're not creators.
[3:44:37.060 --> 3:44:38.060]  They're not business owners.
[3:44:38.060 --> 3:44:39.060]  They're parasites.
[3:44:39.060 --> 3:44:43.060]  It's a world run of scum like you.
[3:44:43.060 --> 3:44:45.060]  Keep playing the filth.
[3:44:45.060 --> 3:44:51.060]  Nations are, they're legal and they're going to the Supreme Court.
[3:44:51.060 --> 3:44:52.060]  There's no doubt about it.
[3:44:52.060 --> 3:44:56.060]  That you're saying there's vaccinations can be made mandatory?
[3:44:56.060 --> 3:44:57.060]  Absolutely.
[3:44:57.060 --> 3:44:58.060]  Absolutely.
[3:44:58.060 --> 3:44:59.060]  Let me stop right there.
[3:44:59.060 --> 3:45:02.060]  See, we have the dummy public thinking I make it up when I give you the executive order.
[3:45:02.060 --> 3:45:06.060]  Let me give you the executive order for forced quarantine and inoculations.
[3:45:06.060 --> 3:45:10.060]  And for five years, they've been secretly hiring tens of thousands of preachers to tell
[3:45:10.060 --> 3:45:14.060]  their flocks to go to FEMA camps, take forced injections and turn the guns in.
[3:45:14.060 --> 3:45:15.060]  It's of God.
[3:45:15.060 --> 3:45:17.060]  That means they're getting ready to try it.
[3:45:17.060 --> 3:45:20.060]  What'd you guys just say?
[3:45:20.060 --> 3:45:21.060]  Oh, thank you.
[3:45:21.060 --> 3:45:24.060]  They're popping my ear up at the network.
[3:45:24.060 --> 3:45:30.060]  DHS sets guidelines for possible swine flu, CBS News, quarantines, forced inoculations.
[3:45:30.060 --> 3:45:33.060]  Executive order 13-3-7-5.
[3:45:33.060 --> 3:45:36.060]  13-3-7-5.
[3:45:36.060 --> 3:45:38.060]  Here, I'll circle it right there for you.
[3:45:38.060 --> 3:45:39.060]  Zoom in on that for them.
[3:45:39.060 --> 3:45:43.060]  We're out there in denial sucking their thumbs and drinking sodium death fluoride because
[3:45:43.060 --> 3:45:45.060]  they love being euthanized.
[3:45:45.060 --> 3:45:47.060]  Why shouldn't the elite steal everything and just take over?
[3:45:47.060 --> 3:45:49.060]  You love drinking their poison water?
[3:45:49.060 --> 3:45:50.060]  Hell, it's a big joke.
[3:45:50.060 --> 3:45:54.060]  I bet the guys at the NSA drink extra fluoride water.
[3:45:54.060 --> 3:45:58.060]  I bet they give it to their babies because it's all about being slaves and being stupid
[3:45:58.060 --> 3:46:01.060]  and being con and being game and being run over.
[3:46:01.060 --> 3:46:03.060]  Finish the clip.
[3:46:03.060 --> 3:46:05.060]  Did I call you back?
[3:46:05.060 --> 3:46:06.060]  Yeah.
[3:46:06.060 --> 3:46:10.060]  I'm looking into the vaccination refusal forms.
[3:46:10.060 --> 3:46:11.060]  Yes, sir.
[3:46:11.060 --> 3:46:14.060]  And I'm trying to find out what the...
[3:46:14.060 --> 3:46:20.060]  I talked to a lawyer and it seems that that is an application for a way out.
[3:46:20.060 --> 3:46:22.060]  You guys just started the clip over.
[3:46:22.060 --> 3:46:23.060]  Forget it.
[3:46:23.060 --> 3:46:24.060]  Forget it.
[3:46:24.060 --> 3:46:26.060]  The whole clip's up on infowars.com.
[3:46:26.060 --> 3:46:28.060]  Stop being in denial about it.
[3:46:28.060 --> 3:46:33.060]  And then the company that's made the vaccine is Baxter, caught putting weaponized bird flu
[3:46:33.060 --> 3:46:36.060]  in the vaccine's Bloomberg news, but you don't care.
[3:46:36.060 --> 3:46:41.060]  And people will take it and they'll die and you'll stick your kids to the ground and you'll go
[3:46:41.060 --> 3:46:47.060]  proud to be an American where at least I know I'm thumb scanned and everything gets listened
[3:46:47.060 --> 3:46:55.060]  to and the police wear black uniforms and I get home inspections for my carbon tax.
[3:46:55.060 --> 3:47:02.060]  And I gladly turn my guns in because I'm proud to be a slave of the bakers.
[3:47:02.060 --> 3:47:09.060]  God bless the slaves and the masters.
[3:47:09.060 --> 3:47:14.060]  The idiot type redneck people, they've got to serve the new order kind of as the enforcer.
[3:47:14.060 --> 3:47:18.060]  It's like guerrillas, like policy.
[3:47:18.060 --> 3:47:22.060]  I mean, you know, I'm kind of ashamed I'm a little bit related to them.
[3:47:22.060 --> 3:47:25.060]  They had a bunch of other scum working for them.
[3:47:25.060 --> 3:47:26.060]  I've seen you.
[3:47:26.060 --> 3:47:27.060]  You're a bunch of trash.
[3:47:27.060 --> 3:47:28.060]  Oh, I hate you.
[3:47:28.060 --> 3:47:29.060]  Liberty folks.
[3:47:29.060 --> 3:47:31.060]  I'm really threatened by all this.
[3:47:31.060 --> 3:47:33.060]  I got a little fired up.
[3:47:33.060 --> 3:47:35.060]  But the spirit of liberty is infectious.
[3:47:35.060 --> 3:47:36.060]  Is it not?
[3:47:36.060 --> 3:47:37.060]  All right.
[3:47:37.060 --> 3:47:39.060]  Let's go ahead and take more.
[3:47:39.060 --> 3:47:41.060]  Take calls from Ted Anderson.
[3:47:41.060 --> 3:47:43.060]  Folks, I can't handle it anymore.
[3:47:43.060 --> 3:47:46.060]  I'm starting to, I'm starting to really have a problem here.
[3:47:46.060 --> 3:47:51.060]  I mean, it's just, I realize what scum the government is, how it's filled with.
[3:47:51.060 --> 3:47:53.060]  What's funny guys?
[3:47:53.060 --> 3:47:55.060]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[3:47:55.060 --> 3:47:57.060]  All right, let's go to Ted Anderson.
[3:47:57.060 --> 3:47:59.060]  They're in there laughing at me.
[3:47:59.060 --> 3:48:01.060]  This ain't funny.
[3:48:01.060 --> 3:48:06.060]  I just blew my voice out earlier screaming.
[3:48:06.060 --> 3:48:08.060]  People ask why my voice is so deep.
[3:48:08.060 --> 3:48:12.060]  I go out and bullhorn the NSA like I'm going to probably go do.
[3:48:12.060 --> 3:48:17.060]  And they'll be army guys in plain clothes and Air Force acting like they're friends.
[3:48:17.060 --> 3:48:19.060]  They'll be all acting all real scared though when you're by.
[3:48:19.060 --> 3:48:22.060]  They'll be going, hi, Alex, I'm here for the protest.
[3:48:22.060 --> 3:48:24.060]  And they actually are scared of God.
[3:48:24.060 --> 3:48:27.060]  It's them patriot people that wear George Washington shirts.
[3:48:27.060 --> 3:48:28.060]  Oh God, it's so scary.
[3:48:28.060 --> 3:48:30.060]  They might get me.
[3:48:30.060 --> 3:48:34.060]  They're showing in a building.
[3:48:34.060 --> 3:48:36.060]  They don't need some water here.
[3:48:36.060 --> 3:48:37.060]  Oh, here's some.
[3:48:37.060 --> 3:48:38.060]  I don't mind.
[3:48:38.060 --> 3:48:39.060]  Somebody bring me a coffee.
[3:48:39.060 --> 3:48:40.060]  Let's go to Ted Anderson.
[3:48:40.060 --> 3:48:44.060]  Ted, I wanted to get you on for a few minutes before I hit some final news here in the last segment.
[3:48:44.060 --> 3:48:47.060]  Because gold and silver is way up and you're about to run out again.
[3:48:47.060 --> 3:48:49.060]  You have it from $25, $30 lower.
[3:48:49.060 --> 3:48:52.060]  It just keeps going up and up the gold and the silver.
[3:48:52.060 --> 3:48:54.060]  You bought and it was a lot lower.
[3:48:54.060 --> 3:48:55.060]  You're passing those savings on.
[3:48:55.060 --> 3:48:57.060]  People shouldn't listen to me though.
[3:48:57.060 --> 3:48:58.060]  They should probably just keep their paper money.
[3:48:58.060 --> 3:48:59.060]  Stay in the stock market.
[3:48:59.060 --> 3:49:00.060]  Trust the government.
[3:49:00.060 --> 3:49:01.060]  Don't get into gold and silver.
[3:49:01.060 --> 3:49:03.060]  That's triple in value the last few years.
[3:49:03.060 --> 3:49:04.060]  Just don't do it.
[3:49:04.060 --> 3:49:05.060]  Right, Ted?
[3:49:05.060 --> 3:49:07.060]  Well, you know, here's what I have to say.
[3:49:07.060 --> 3:49:11.060]  If they pass this cap and trade bill and right now it's about a 50-50 shot.
[3:49:11.060 --> 3:49:16.060]  That is going to be the death to the United States currency because that is what's needed in order to have
[3:49:16.060 --> 3:49:18.060]  a world bank like play.
[3:49:18.060 --> 3:49:22.060]  Hey, that's what the NSA is there to make sure the raping goes well.
[3:49:22.060 --> 3:49:23.060]  The disrupt art.
[3:49:23.060 --> 3:49:26.060]  The Pentagon is a knife splitting our throat.
[3:49:26.060 --> 3:49:27.060]  Traders.
[3:49:27.060 --> 3:49:29.060]  Well, that's exactly what I'm trying to say.
[3:49:29.060 --> 3:49:36.060]  The Federal Reserve Act passed in 1913, Alex, and then the taxes, the federal income taxes passed
[3:49:36.060 --> 3:49:37.060]  past the same year.
[3:49:37.060 --> 3:49:42.060]  You cannot have a central bank in the world with a world currency.
[3:49:42.060 --> 3:49:44.060]  We're doing what America needs, Ted.
[3:49:44.060 --> 3:49:51.060]  The NSA needs to make sure Northcom stops the people from foreign banks ruling, Ted.
[3:49:51.060 --> 3:49:55.060]  Anyways, that's just the point that I'm trying to come up with, Alex.
[3:49:55.060 --> 3:49:56.060]  I mean, we are sitting.
[3:49:56.060 --> 3:49:59.060]  I mean, we lose this one battle today.
[3:49:59.060 --> 3:50:00.060]  It's done.
[3:50:00.060 --> 3:50:01.060]  We're screwed.
[3:50:01.060 --> 3:50:03.060]  This nation is toast.
[3:50:03.060 --> 3:50:05.060]  Well, that's what the NSA wants.
[3:50:05.060 --> 3:50:08.060]  Traders, pieces of trash that openly admit they work for offshore corporations.
[3:50:08.060 --> 3:50:10.060]  Oh, you didn't know your Thomas Barnett.
[3:50:10.060 --> 3:50:12.060]  It's on C-span and Bragg's about it.
[3:50:12.060 --> 3:50:13.060]  Stay there.
[3:50:13.060 --> 3:50:14.060]  Get back.
[3:50:14.060 --> 3:50:15.060]  You know, we're not done.
[3:50:15.060 --> 3:50:19.060]  It just means that these bachelors are going for broke, but I agree.
[3:50:19.060 --> 3:50:20.060]  It's really bad.
[3:50:20.060 --> 3:50:23.060]  And then the slaves let to see what it's like going under a socialist grid with
[3:50:23.060 --> 3:50:26.060]  Obamanoid Nazis running around in red and black uniforms.
[3:50:26.060 --> 3:50:28.060]  Ted, can you believe it?
[3:50:28.060 --> 3:50:33.060]  NSA spy bases everywhere, FEMA camps, Obama brigades marching around.
[3:50:33.060 --> 3:50:35.060]  I mean, it's just insane, Ted.
[3:50:35.060 --> 3:50:38.060]  It sounds more like Nazi Germany than it does the United States of America.
[3:50:38.060 --> 3:50:40.060]  Yeah, well, they're Nazi Germany.
[3:50:40.060 --> 3:50:41.060]  Can just go to hell, Ted.
[3:50:41.060 --> 3:50:43.060]  I mean, I'm just really getting sick of it.
[3:50:43.060 --> 3:50:45.060]  And all you stupid good old boys that work for the system.
[3:50:45.060 --> 3:50:47.060]  Man, what is wrong with you?
[3:50:47.060 --> 3:50:48.060]  You cops and the rest of you.
[3:50:48.060 --> 3:50:50.060]  This is classical tyranny.
[3:50:50.060 --> 3:50:53.060]  I know you're going to sit out and think you're going to be safe because you're
[3:50:53.060 --> 3:50:55.060]  born cowards and trash.
[3:50:55.060 --> 3:50:56.060]  Well, not me.
[3:50:56.060 --> 3:50:57.060]  Not me.
[3:50:57.060 --> 3:50:58.060]  Not me.
[3:50:58.060 --> 3:51:01.060]  I won't urinate all over my forebears.
[3:51:01.060 --> 3:51:06.060]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[3:51:06.060 --> 3:51:09.060]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[3:51:09.060 --> 3:51:13.060]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a
[3:51:13.060 --> 3:51:17.060]  great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[3:51:17.060 --> 3:51:19.060]  there is no job security.
[3:51:19.060 --> 3:51:23.060]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood
[3:51:23.060 --> 3:51:25.060]  and own your own business.
[3:51:25.060 --> 3:51:28.060]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[3:51:28.060 --> 3:51:33.060]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other
[3:51:33.060 --> 3:51:38.060]  people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:51:38.060 --> 3:51:42.060]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing
[3:51:42.060 --> 3:51:46.060]  of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an
[3:51:46.060 --> 3:51:48.060]  impressive compounding monthly income.
[3:51:48.060 --> 3:51:52.060]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[3:51:52.060 --> 3:51:55.060]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:51:55.060 --> 3:51:59.060]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[3:51:59.060 --> 3:52:02.060]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:52:02.060 --> 3:52:08.060]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.060 --> 3:52:13.060]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us
[3:52:13.060 --> 3:52:14.060]  would like to see.
[3:52:14.060 --> 3:52:19.060]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[3:52:19.060 --> 3:52:21.060]  interest of the American people.
[3:52:21.060 --> 3:52:23.060]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:23.060 --> 3:52:25.060]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.060 --> 3:52:30.060]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[3:52:30.060 --> 3:52:37.060]  opposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:37.060 --> 3:52:40.060]  It's not about left to right.
[3:52:40.060 --> 3:52:42.060]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:42.060 --> 3:52:49.060]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:49.060 --> 3:52:55.060]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[3:52:55.060 --> 3:53:02.060]  quality at prismplanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:02.060 --> 3:53:16.060]  Aerial spring, chemtrails, the modified atmosphere, heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens
[3:53:16.060 --> 3:53:19.060]  and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[3:53:19.060 --> 3:53:27.060]  You have a choice to keep your body clean, detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org
[3:53:27.060 --> 3:53:32.060]  or call 908-691-2608.
[3:53:32.060 --> 3:53:37.060]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[3:53:37.060 --> 3:53:44.060]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder, cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[3:53:44.060 --> 3:53:50.060]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[3:53:50.060 --> 3:53:57.060]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today.
[3:53:57.060 --> 3:54:10.060]  All right.
[3:54:10.060 --> 3:54:11.060]  Final segment.
[3:54:11.060 --> 3:54:13.060]  I'd go into overdrive.
[3:54:13.060 --> 3:54:15.060]  Bermas will be back tonight.
[3:54:15.060 --> 3:54:17.060]  I'll be in the studio a little bit.
[3:54:17.060 --> 3:54:22.060]  I'd be on the show the whole time, but I got to work on a book and a film up here.
[3:54:22.060 --> 3:54:26.060]  I got an email here from Ron Paul, the president of the campaign for liberty.
[3:54:26.060 --> 3:54:29.060]  They say they're going to try to sneak it through at 5 o'clock Eastern early.
[3:54:29.060 --> 3:54:36.060]  I just had Aaron Dykes post the direct lines to all of the congressmen and women up on infowars.com.
[3:54:36.060 --> 3:54:40.060]  So call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call, call.
[3:54:40.060 --> 3:54:41.060]  Call the traders.
[3:54:41.060 --> 3:54:42.060]  Tell them they're scum.
[3:54:42.060 --> 3:54:43.060]  Tell them they're filth.
[3:54:43.060 --> 3:54:44.060]  Tell them you know they're criminals.
[3:54:44.060 --> 3:54:45.060]  Tell them you know what they're doing.
[3:54:45.060 --> 3:54:47.060]  Just stop being nice to the punks.
[3:54:47.060 --> 3:54:49.060]  Stop being nice to the filth.
[3:54:49.060 --> 3:54:52.060]  Just let them know that you tired of their treason.
[3:54:52.060 --> 3:54:55.060]  Call Democrats, but a bunch of Republicans are going to sell us out too.
[3:54:55.060 --> 3:55:00.060]  They're going to rob the middle class, give a little bit of it and pro-zac money to the slave class,
[3:55:00.060 --> 3:55:04.060]  and then give the rest of the elites.
[3:55:04.060 --> 3:55:10.060]  Here's the main number, 800-833-6354, 800-833-6354.
[3:55:10.060 --> 3:55:13.060]  We'll report on the aftermath of this nightmare tonight at 9 o'clock.
[3:55:13.060 --> 3:55:15.060]  Ted Anderson, in closing, my friend.
[3:55:15.060 --> 3:55:17.060]  I got a huge headache now.
[3:55:17.060 --> 3:55:20.060]  I joke around about this stuff, but it's actually very upsetting.
[3:55:20.060 --> 3:55:22.060]  I mean, I know how serious this is.
[3:55:22.060 --> 3:55:23.060]  I know how criminal this elite is.
[3:55:23.060 --> 3:55:25.060]  I know how evil this is.
[3:55:25.060 --> 3:55:30.060]  To have Bernaki say that Congress is criminal trying to seize power from the Fed
[3:55:30.060 --> 3:55:34.060]  when Congress is supposed to Article 1, Section 8, run that.
[3:55:34.060 --> 3:55:36.060]  I mean, it's just all off the charts, Ted.
[3:55:36.060 --> 3:55:39.060]  I mean, these bastards are really going wild on us.
[3:55:39.060 --> 3:55:41.060]  We've got to get angry and get in their faces.
[3:55:41.060 --> 3:55:44.060]  But side issue, tell folks about the gold and silver offer.
[3:55:44.060 --> 3:55:49.060]  We can at least try to get good deals on gold and silver and get out of their fiat scumbag money.
[3:55:49.060 --> 3:55:51.060]  So they can't hurt us as bad there, Ted.
[3:55:51.060 --> 3:55:52.060]  Well, here's what I have.
[3:55:52.060 --> 3:55:53.060]  The walking Liberty haves.
[3:55:53.060 --> 3:55:55.060]  They're currently right now at $8.69.
[3:55:55.060 --> 3:56:00.060]  I'm still holding the price on the Lakotas at $19.70 and will through Sunday.
[3:56:00.060 --> 3:56:03.060]  The British sovereign currently right now is at $2.75.
[3:56:03.060 --> 3:56:05.060]  That price will be held as well.
[3:56:05.060 --> 3:56:06.060]  And the Franks.
[3:56:06.060 --> 3:56:08.060]  Now, like Alex said, gold has been going up.
[3:56:08.060 --> 3:56:10.060]  It's been going up all week long.
[3:56:10.060 --> 3:56:13.060]  It's time to move, and the time to move is now.
[3:56:13.060 --> 3:56:15.060]  That cap and trade thing is going to kill the dollar.
[3:56:15.060 --> 3:56:18.060]  If you don't think your investments have been shot up to...
[3:56:18.060 --> 3:56:23.060]  Just wait till that all falls apart after the cap and trade thing comes along.
[3:56:23.060 --> 3:56:24.060]  Ted, aren't you angry?
[3:56:24.060 --> 3:56:25.060]  I mean, are you?
[3:56:25.060 --> 3:56:26.060]  I mean, I'm really mad here.
[3:56:26.060 --> 3:56:31.060]  Alex, if there's ever been a time, if there's a single soul that's listening to this radio...
[3:56:31.060 --> 3:56:32.060]  And I'm sorry.
[3:56:32.060 --> 3:56:37.060]  I'm not talking about that weirdo, drug addict dying, Michael Jackson.
[3:56:37.060 --> 3:56:38.060]  I'm just...
[3:56:38.060 --> 3:56:39.060]  Close to scum public.
[3:56:39.060 --> 3:56:41.060]  You're just talking about that.
[3:56:41.060 --> 3:56:42.060]  I'm sorry.
[3:56:42.060 --> 3:56:43.060]  I'm sorry.
[3:56:43.060 --> 3:56:44.060]  Go ahead.
[3:56:44.060 --> 3:56:45.060]  No, that's all right.
[3:56:45.060 --> 3:56:47.060]  I'm just telling you right now, if they haven't called their congressman yet, man.
[3:56:47.060 --> 3:56:48.060]  I don't know if there's...
[3:56:48.060 --> 3:56:49.060]  You're just...
[3:56:49.060 --> 3:56:50.060]  There's no excuse for you.
[3:56:50.060 --> 3:56:51.060]  You better call.
[3:56:51.060 --> 3:56:53.060]  I want everybody to call.
[3:56:53.060 --> 3:56:54.060]  Everyone.
[3:56:54.060 --> 3:56:55.060]  You have your kids call.
[3:56:55.060 --> 3:56:57.060]  I mean, this is so important.
[3:56:57.060 --> 3:56:58.060]  This is like...
[3:56:58.060 --> 3:56:59.060]  This is like...
[3:56:59.060 --> 3:57:02.060]  The people should at least get out of the fiat bastards money and get gold and silver for
[3:57:02.060 --> 3:57:05.060]  the yuppies, figure it out, and drive it up to $5,000 an ounce.
[3:57:05.060 --> 3:57:06.060]  You got gold, 20, 30.
[3:57:06.060 --> 3:57:09.060]  Well, the gold's $25 up from when you bought it.
[3:57:09.060 --> 3:57:10.060]  Silver's up a lot.
[3:57:10.060 --> 3:57:11.060]  You got great deals.
[3:57:11.060 --> 3:57:12.060]  Tell folks the number, Ted.
[3:57:12.060 --> 3:57:16.060]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:57:16.060 --> 3:57:20.060]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[3:57:20.060 --> 3:57:22.060]  I suggest you move and you move now.
[3:57:22.060 --> 3:57:24.060]  Are you going to be able to hold that deal through the weekend, Ted?
[3:57:24.060 --> 3:57:25.060]  Well, right through Sunday.
[3:57:25.060 --> 3:57:28.060]  800-686-2237.
[3:57:28.060 --> 3:57:33.060]  And so, again, you've got gold at $25 lower than it is currently.
[3:57:33.060 --> 3:57:34.060]  Passing that savings on.
[3:57:34.060 --> 3:57:35.060]  And silver, how much?
[3:57:35.060 --> 3:57:38.060]  Well, silver's up around $14.30.
[3:57:38.060 --> 3:57:41.060]  So, and it was $13.50, something like that.
[3:57:41.060 --> 3:57:43.060]  Those Lakota's should be well over $20.
[3:57:43.060 --> 3:57:46.060]  And I've got 1-800-686-2237.
[3:57:46.060 --> 3:57:48.060]  800-686-2337.
[3:57:48.060 --> 3:57:53.060]  We'll continue to watch the votes of that criminal group of scumbags called Congress,
[3:57:53.060 --> 3:57:59.060]  selling us out to offshore banks into the carbon tax invented by Enron scammer Ken Lay.
[3:57:59.060 --> 3:58:00.060]  God bless you all.
[3:58:00.060 --> 3:58:01.060]  We're out of time.
[3:58:01.060 --> 3:58:02.060]  Fight the criminals.
[3:58:02.060 --> 3:58:03.060]  Fight the scum.
[3:58:03.060 --> 3:58:04.060]  Fight the filth.
[3:58:04.060 --> 3:58:05.060]  God bless.
[3:58:05.060 --> 3:58:06.060]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:06.060 --> 3:58:07.060]  Fight them.
[3:58:07.060 --> 3:58:08.060]  Fight them.
[3:58:08.060 --> 3:58:09.060]  Fight them.
[3:58:09.060 --> 3:58:10.060]  Fight them.
[3:58:10.060 --> 3:58:11.060]  Call now.
[3:58:11.060 --> 3:58:12.060]  Fight the scum.
[3:58:12.060 --> 3:58:13.060]  Fight the scum.
[3:58:13.060 --> 3:58:16.060]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[3:58:16.060 --> 3:58:17.060]  Well, you should.
[3:58:17.060 --> 3:58:21.060]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[3:58:21.060 --> 3:58:22.060]  That's right.
[3:58:22.060 --> 3:58:27.060]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training
[3:58:27.060 --> 3:58:32.060]  Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[3:58:32.060 --> 3:58:37.060]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV
[3:58:37.060 --> 3:58:39.060]  pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[3:58:39.060 --> 3:58:43.560]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[3:58:43.560 --> 3:58:46.620]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[3:58:46.620 --> 3:58:51.060]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[3:58:51.060 --> 3:58:52.060]  attitudes.
[3:58:52.060 --> 3:58:53.620]  This is real.
[3:58:53.620 --> 3:58:54.620]  Don't miss out.
[3:58:54.620 --> 3:59:00.360]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course, plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit or
[3:59:00.360 --> 3:59:03.060]  pennies on the dollar, and get your free handgun.
