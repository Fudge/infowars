[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Coming to you from the United States of America locked in a civil war between globalist forces sworn to create a depression and drive from from office and punish populist Americans for daring to rebel.
[00:26.000 --> 00:39.000]  Caught between them and the American people standing up and saying no, this is history, the greatest threat since our founding, now upon us and very quickly.
[00:39.000 --> 00:51.000]  The public is understanding what's happening, the president is understanding it, the military is understanding it, and you're going to start seeing some real fireworks.
[00:51.000 --> 01:04.000]  And I can also tell you that this country is in a death battle. We've got them in a stranglehold, they've got us in a stranglehold.
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  And so the key to this is not thinking about how to win, winning the fight, and that means opening a can of economic, cultural, spiritual whoop-ash.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  You don't think about winning the fight, you turn it loose, you go off the chain, and you start crushing.
[01:19.000 --> 01:34.000]  And that's the level that we're entering in this fight, every email, every phone call, every time you march, every time you speak out, every time you take action, every time you say no to this tyranny,
[01:34.000 --> 01:43.000]  every time you call it out, every time you tell it for what it is, you're literally winning the fight.
[01:43.000 --> 01:54.000]  That's good. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to do my very, very best to lay all of this out for you today.
[01:54.000 --> 02:06.000]  You notice the big news, AP receives documents, confirms Wuhan was where the weapon leaked from, and the World Health Organization covered it all up.
[02:06.000 --> 02:21.000]  Of course, the CHICOMS run the WHO on record. And so what we told you in early March and early February has all been confirmed now,
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  because you don't just think the guest we have on this show just researched the peer-reviewed papers and knew what was going on.
[02:28.000 --> 02:48.000]  No, they have what's called incredible sources. And info wars is the sources, well, that's why it's very frustrating to me when I see anonymous people on the Internet claiming they have all these sources.
[02:48.000 --> 02:58.000]  The real reason the establishment wants to be off the air is because they know our talking points are accurate, are truthful, and will lead to the defeat of the globalists.
[02:58.000 --> 03:09.000]  And they know I can pick this phone up and I can get a hold of the leader of the free world if I need to. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:09.000 --> 03:23.000]  I can pick that phone up and I can do a lot of other things. But guess what? I don't need to pick that phone up because they're watching right now.
[03:23.000 --> 03:38.000]  And it's not because I have all the answers. It's because this is a zeitgeist at an oracle point. The guest, the listeners, everything that happens here is recognized nine times out of ten as the fount.
[03:38.000 --> 03:48.000]  The headwaters, where it all comes together, where it originates, where it generates, where it pro-generates.
[03:48.000 --> 03:59.000]  And so that's why it's so special that the listeners and viewers understand you're not just part of this and you're not a crowd at the symphony that's watching and listening to the symphony.
[03:59.000 --> 04:13.000]  You are major players on the field. And it's what you do openly that is going to change the world.
[04:13.000 --> 04:22.000]  So we told you that it came out of that bioweapon lab. But here's the rest of the story. As I predicted about a month ago, you're going to start hearing the White House come out and say,
[04:22.000 --> 04:33.000]  OK, it did come out of the lab. But then China is going to come out and say, yeah, but we worked with the deep state and Fauci, you gave it to us.
[04:33.000 --> 04:41.000]  That's how they try to counter. But then we just counter with the truth that the UN covered it all up and we blame it on them.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  That way they don't blame it on American Trump. Plus, they're the ones that are guilty. But you must blame them.
[04:46.000 --> 04:55.000]  We're at war with China. Just get it out the open and the White House agrees. Yes, just get it out in the open and deal with these Democrat traders once and for all.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  It's them or us now.
[04:58.000 --> 05:07.000]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full-worses at your paying attention.
[05:07.000 --> 05:19.000]  You know, we've done together. But I'll tell you this. The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[05:19.000 --> 05:27.000]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance. So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true. So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[05:33.000 --> 05:42.000]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  We have the power. But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[05:48.000 --> 05:59.000]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bears you are.
[05:59.000 --> 06:07.000]  We've got it.
[06:07.000 --> 06:17.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:17.000 --> 06:33.000]  We are go. It is Thursday, April 16th. The year is 2020. We are exactly 200 days out from the election and the federal courts are ruling mail-in ballots.
[06:33.000 --> 06:46.000]  No driver's license proof needed. The secret plan to steal those battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Iowa as well as New Hampshire
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  are now in play.
[06:51.000 --> 06:59.000]  There are so many reasons they launched this bio attack. Great panic, great scare of 2020. And it is a real bio weapon.
[06:59.000 --> 07:12.000]  It is a real novel manufactured virus so that the multinationals can own it and finally have a vaccine for the common cold.
[07:12.000 --> 07:20.000]  I'm going to cover that later. You see, you can't have one for the common cold. Everyone knows. I talked on the street. I go, why isn't there a vaccine for the common cold?
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  I talked to three people this morning at stores. Two women and a man. And they both went to the checkout parks. They both go. All three go.
[07:27.000 --> 07:36.000]  Well, because there's so many thousands of mutations out. And three separate times they knew I really felt good.
[07:36.000 --> 07:44.000]  Well, then how do they have one for this? And see, I'm always next year's news today. We've got huge news breaking right now.
[07:44.000 --> 07:52.000]  But I want to tell you what's coming next. When they come out with their forced inoculation and their antibody tests and all this, it is a giant certified fraud.
[07:52.000 --> 08:01.000]  And I have scientific studies I printed up here in front of me already saying that. The French government's going, well, wait a minute, why are we going to have an antibody passport when they don't test right?
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  It also says you have COVID-19 if you test for the cold. That's why this thing is so perfect, folks.
[08:07.000 --> 08:18.000]  Anybody dying that had cancer or a heart attack or diabetes or was already in a coma, that's most people dying.
[08:18.000 --> 08:32.000]  They are being counted as dying from COVID-19 if they have any type of cold virus in them and people year round have cold viruses in their body at any one time.
[08:32.000 --> 08:41.000]  That's why this is all so scripted, prepared from the start. Just like HIV was a group of viruses they were using in different bio attacks they were doing.
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.000]  They would just claim if you had the HIV virus, that's what did it. But it was really a whole constellation of other things.
[08:47.000 --> 09:07.000]  And I knew this when I was a little kid because my dad was in the medical community and he knew some people that worked for the government and they told him point blank that that's what it was.
[09:07.000 --> 09:17.000]  Not the point here, oh and who was running that Fauci, same guy. By the way, those people that told my dad that were high level CIA.
[09:17.000 --> 09:25.000]  And I was a little kid hearing this because my dad did dental work on some of those people. And I'll just leave it at that.
[09:25.000 --> 09:41.000]  But I grew up knowing all this stuff and that's what's so frustrating sitting here hearing all this today and seeing so much of the public by the end of this when the whole thing is a giant hoax, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:41.000 --> 09:51.000]  The virus is real but the rollout, the deployment, the hysteria, the vaccine, the implantable microchip ink to make that's in the vaccine.
[09:51.000 --> 10:03.000]  This is a nightmare. This is beyond anything you'd see in a science fiction dystopia movie 30 years ago. It's happening. The tyranny is totally real.
[10:03.000 --> 10:20.000]  But the rollout and all of it is a hysteria and a hoax. And notice right as Trump and others begin to try to reopen the economy, the Democrats all announce, sorry, now you've all got to wear masks to leave your house.
[10:20.000 --> 10:32.000]  And then as Trump tries to reopen, they're going to go, no, actually, you're not allowed to go to the grocery store for a week or two. Get your food now, like Michigan's now doing, like California is set to do as soon as Trump tries to reopen.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  And we have that from the state police in California. That's called holding the country hostage.
[10:38.000 --> 10:50.000]  So we didn't just tell you that the Wuhan situation was where the virus came from out of a bio weapons lab, now AP reporting it all, confirming word for word what we said our experts said.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  We told you they would then hold the East and West Coast hostage and say we're never reopening. And we follow what the UN says, the World Health Organization is our boss.
[10:59.000 --> 11:11.000]  And so Trump had to chop the head off of that because that's hijacking our country who made them the leaders of the nation.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  There are real people dying from this virus, just like there are real folks that die from the cold every year and it is souped up.
[11:17.000 --> 11:33.000]  But if you look at the graphs compared to other viruses, it's very weak. It's just communicable. So everybody ends up getting it. So we're all suspect. We're all bad. We're all involved in the hysteria and accept the new way of life, which is the technocracy.
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  I want to go to this very important special report though and think about those that have been sacrificed by this bio weapon.
[11:39.000 --> 11:55.000]  That's right. You are tuned into alternative independent media and you won't hear these questions asked or answered anywhere else. Questions like why did President Trump decide to stop giving the World Health Organization nearly half a billion US taxpayer dollars annually?
[11:55.000 --> 12:10.000]  One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did.
[12:10.000 --> 12:20.000]  Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives. Thousands and thousands of people would have died.
[12:20.000 --> 12:35.000]  The answer, because the World Health Organization is led by an installed Chinese puppet that pushed a weaponized Chinese coronavirus narrative that continues to be paid for with thousands of real American lives.
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  Far more than those that died in 9-11, a fact completely disregarded by the treasonous cancer known as mainstream media.
[12:43.000 --> 12:54.000]  The mockingbird media isn't going to warn Americans that we are already being invaded by gargantuan Asian hornets that could devastate our already dwindling honeybee population.
[12:54.000 --> 13:05.000]  Hornets that were quote, accidentally introduced to France from China in 2004 and have been spreading rapidly throughout Europe and other parts of the world ever since.
[13:05.000 --> 13:15.000]  And quote, bringing added pestilence and costing tens of millions in damage during a time when our food supply has been thrown into total chaos and our economy is in freefall.
[13:15.000 --> 13:30.000]  The controlled narrative won't happen to mention that Nancy Pelosi is actually calling for millions of dollars to benefit her 1% wealthy liberal base by lifting President Trump's 2017 cap on state and local tax deductions.
[13:30.000 --> 13:46.000]  Instead, during a national crisis and with the aid of the New York Times, Pelosi tells average unsuspecting Americans that quote, we could reverse that for 2018 and 2019 so that people could refile their taxes and receive more substantial rebates.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  They'd have more disposable income, which is the lifeblood of our economy, a consumer economy that we are.
[13:52.000 --> 14:06.000]  She doesn't happen to mention that more than half of the proceeds from fully repealing the salt cap would go to the top 1% households making more than about three quarters of a million dollars a year, according to Politico.
[14:06.000 --> 14:28.000]  Meanwhile, the liberal mouthpieces over at Good Morning America and the Democrats are pointing the finger at the Trump administration over the recent stimulus package claiming that the CARES Act quote, allowed taxpayers to use losses from certain businesses to reduce taxes owed on non-business income such as profits from investments.
[14:28.000 --> 14:49.000]  To hell with the small business owners, the Democrats have to politicize everything to maintain their power. The Chinese narrative in your electric slime box won't even begin to explain why the homeless are exempt from wearing masks and are not being quarantined, free to contaminate our cities while we face arrest if we leave our homes.
[14:49.000 --> 15:07.000]  Meanwhile, those homeless are microchipped guinea pigs for the emerging technocracy, or that Democrats are aggressively pushing to give American taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants while small business owners and millions of their employees, the backbone of the American economy, lose their life's work.
[15:07.000 --> 15:35.000]  While health care workers can't even afford their own health care after Obamacare destroyed it, leaving the country completely vulnerable due to the Obama administration's aloof effort to contain the 2009 H1N1 outbreak which from April 2009 to April 2010, the CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  In the United States due to the 2009 H1N1 virus.
[15:39.000 --> 15:58.000]  Meanwhile, those that would bring you this information, these unwavering facts as they truly are, are led to the gallows by a globalist offensive that spent more time and resources focused on controlling these truths than containing a pandemic they suspiciously knew was right around the corner.

[17:15.000 --> 17:23.000]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the US.
[17:23.000 --> 17:31.000]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one acre crisis garden.
[17:31.000 --> 17:38.000]  The truth is growing nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important thing you do.

[17:59.000 --> 18:08.000]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half and the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[18:08.000 --> 18:20.000]  So guess what happened along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half and that means you're going to be poor now and under his control.
[18:20.000 --> 18:33.000]  Of course, with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations, a micro chip that comes with the vaccine and so much more and Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[18:38.000 --> 18:46.000]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long, women on their bodies now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[18:46.000 --> 18:57.000]  If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, market the beast. Oh, and guess what? Jeffery Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  They hate you and your family.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  How do you put a people under house arrest? How do you put them under siege?
[19:03.000 --> 19:17.000]  They tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[19:17.000 --> 19:35.000]  Bill Ma or even admitted it, man, I hope we have a depression. Now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue states all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[19:35.000 --> 19:48.000]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us. But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it. It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keep everybody safe. But that's not what they're doing.
[19:48.000 --> 19:58.000]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death.
[19:58.000 --> 20:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:09.000 --> 20:24.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:24.000 --> 20:32.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we are broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  Let me do this. Let me tell you what's coming next.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  In a possible future that is so nightmare.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  It's almost impossible to illustrate verbally.
[20:48.000 --> 21:02.000]  Versus the future we could have if we simply wake up to the fact that there are very evil forces mixed in to government private corporations and private life that hide behind that and that need to be identified.
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  Now, I'll do that next segment. I want to just mention some of the news here now.
[21:09.000 --> 21:21.000]  And I just want to be clear. We could not be in a more dangerous crossroads. The absolute future of humanity hangs in the balance right now.
[21:21.000 --> 21:33.000]  This isn't just the build up to the new world order and if we don't get mobilized, it's going to take over. It's launching. It's big assault now.
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.000]  And this emergency they're setting up will never end and will only get deeper and darker.
[21:39.000 --> 21:45.000]  You will instantly be poor. You will instantly have less medical care. You will instantly be a prisoner and not have mobility.
[21:45.000 --> 21:58.000]  You will instantly have them medically come force hundreds of vaccines into your body and you will slowly die.
[21:58.000 --> 22:04.000]  You see, when they start giving people vaccines and folks are getting sick and dying from it, they know they can't cover it up.
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.000]  Just like the UN World Health Organization said last December five months ago.
[22:11.000 --> 22:23.000]  Remember what they said. We played the clips there probably 20 times. The head of the World Health Organization over virology, the actual head medical doctor, not the Marxist, Communist, Chai-Kong operative from Ethiopia.
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  She said, we have a front line that's wobbly. They know it's hurting people. There's a cover up.
[22:28.000 --> 22:36.000]  Well, see, the answers just come out and say, you're all dead if you don't take this and, you know, a lot of you are going to die and, by the way, it's going to reduce your fertility.
[22:36.000 --> 22:46.000]  So that's why Gates came out this weekend and said, yeah, 700,000 people have bad side effects. What?
[22:46.000 --> 22:54.000]  It's not one out of 10,000 have bad effects. You divide that into seven and a half billion. Yeah, you get 700,000.
[22:54.000 --> 22:59.000]  It's tens of millions.
[22:59.000 --> 23:10.000]  So I know I cover this stuff and it sounds fantastical, but you know who listens to it and knows it's true.
[23:10.000 --> 23:18.000]  It's the Pentagon because the Pentagon has been tasked in compartmentalization in the last 100 years under this eugenics cult.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  It took over about 100 years ago in the U.S. It's only in power of about 20 years fully.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  Got discredited after Hitler's they had to go underground.
[23:26.000 --> 23:37.000]  The Pentagon's had to carry a lot of this out compartmentalized so the Pentagon knows about it, but I can tell you doesn't like it.
[23:37.000 --> 23:43.000]  Well, Trump and the patriots in our government have been waiting for an awakening to have a chance to turn this around and fix it.
[23:43.000 --> 23:52.000]  But they need us to have courage and they need us to not freak out when Trump comes out and says, OK, traders in our government transferred the weapons to China.
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  They hit us with them. They did this to take us down, but we're arresting all these people and they're going to get tried.
[23:58.000 --> 24:05.000]  But it's OK. We're open for business again. We're not going to go to war with China, but we're going to shut off economic operations with them.
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  And if they want to launch another bio attack, we're going to have to have a war with them because we're already there.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  China is already moving into invade Taiwan right now. They've announced it.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  They're already launched this bio attack with the deep state.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  We look at the timing, the background. I told you it came out of the lab.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  I told you they would shut the economy down in the West and East Coast would hold us hostage.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  I know the enemy folks. I know their operations. I live this. OK.
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  And they're pissed because Trump is quietly arresting the Chinese Communist agents and their collaborators by the hundreds.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  I'm not an authoritarian. This is an authoritarian attack by a foreign government.
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  And an emergency like this, they're trying to have an emergency that takes all of our rights permanently.
[24:48.000 --> 24:57.000]  We need to have quick decisive action to cut off the foreign enemy influences and simply decapitate them instead of playing games with this.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  I'm not the one up here telling patriots to go kill people. I'm not going to go kill anybody.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.000]  I'm saying to Trump and the Pentagon, listen.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  That's the best, quickest move. You can't play patty cake with these people.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  And you know that China is going to move into Taiwan before the end of the year, probably sooner.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  And they've got sleeper cells all over the damn country. We're totally overrun.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  All you can do is decapitate the leadership of the People's Liberation Army and their Communist Party and their operatives.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  That's all you can do. Yeah, it's good to try to fire the head of the World Health Organization.
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  That's a good start. Identify the enemy. But Chinese communists kill our operatives in China.
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  And their argument is this our country don't be here.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  So all I'm saying is that we don't have a lot of time to play games. Let me just stop there.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  I'm just being a realist here, ladies and gentlemen. That's where we are.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  We're under a globalist attack and an axis of evil with chicoms.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  And you take their leadership out.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  And all the media and all the cowards and all their collaborators are going to run for the hills,
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  like cockroaches at 3 a.m. when you turn the light on.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  They are going to haul ash and then the emergency's turned off.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  Bill of Rights is back. Country turns on. We'll export American freedom everywhere. It's great.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  But they're using the fact that they don't believe that we'll make that move
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  or that the media doesn't believe we'll make that move.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  Make that move. It's one of the only. It's the best move we've got.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  And if Trump thinks he can balance this and finagle it and do all this more power to him,
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  but I don't see that. I see every time we defeat their operations,
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  they just launch a bigger attack exponentially.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  Every attack gets logarithmically larger.
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  And so the next attack, a bio weapon 10 times worse.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  A nuke in D.C. during the State of the Union.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  Congress shouldn't be in session in the buildings.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  The president should never be in D.C. now. He should be moving around the country.
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  I mean, we're in a total war, people.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  And that said, I told you the virus will create the depression and the lockdown of the civilization, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  So you better be concerned about that. You better be ready with guns and ammo.
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.000]  If the president doesn't make the right moves and we go into a civil war with the globalist want,
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  you've got to be ready with the Patriot governors and others.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  If the globalists get the federal government, then we'll have another original type of civil war.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  This is even a civil war. This is just idiots that don't know that there's a war going on
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  who join with Chinese globalist propaganda against their own interests in their own country.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  I don't know what you call this. This is a bunch of collaborator morons trying to sabotage their own country
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  for a horrible authoritarian state that's killed 100 million people.
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.000]  They think you're weak. They think you're stupid. They're making a move on you right now.
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  And again, I'll say this. We have swarable food back in stock again, and they're down to four to six weeks to ship new orders.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  If you don't have swarable foods, you're insane. And most of the companies are sold out or they're selling you crap.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  We have the biggest, best company. They had to pause sales for a while to get caught up, get the orders out.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  They're actually ahead of schedule, getting almost all their orders out. Some, they're just on time.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  But now they told me, well, it's really about four weeks on new orders now, but don't say that.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  We're just saying six so people don't get pissed. Well, okay, six weeks, folks.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  Get your orders in infowarstore.com, and you're getting it at about one fifth the cost of the same stuff at the grocery store,
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  and it's getting delivered to you, and it's not for the virus, folks.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's for economic collapse, total insanity, and getting ready.
[28:30.000 --> 28:36.000]  I've actually finally gone out to the farm and, you know, put a trailer on it and a well and got myself together.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  And I procrastinated forever. Things are so bad. I've got to be ready to, they turn the lights out,
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  get with everybody, go out to the countryside and try to, try to, you know, hope somehow we take the government back.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  But we may lose the whole damn thing, folks. We may have to go to the hills ourselves.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  We either make them go to the hills or we go to the hills. It's down to that.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  America is fighting for its damn life right now.
[28:57.000 --> 29:03.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[29:03.000 --> 29:10.000]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[29:58.000 --> 30:07.000]  Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay in your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you to go.
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.000]  It's called martial law. It's called living in the authoritarian country.
[30:11.000 --> 30:18.000]  Everybody knows that. Everybody understands that. And the Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state saying,
[30:18.000 --> 30:25.000]  we're going to listen to Fauci and the World Health Organization who've done nothing but put out all this fakeness information so far.
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  We're not going to listen to the President. We're not going to listen to Congress.
[30:29.000 --> 30:36.000]  But then all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with Big Tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  This is economic warfare and I know everybody understands that. Public, with the President and others,
[30:41.000 --> 30:48.000]  need to develop a plan to understand that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage.
[30:48.000 --> 30:58.000]  And this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces. Only understanding the reality and the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it.
[30:58.000 --> 31:08.000]  The World Health Organization run by the Chai Kong murderers and world citizens are giving you the world at home.
[31:08.000 --> 31:18.000]  Extravagants are all the dried up, pathetic, evil, twisted Hollywood music crap force fed at you and your family.
[31:18.000 --> 31:24.000]  So stay at home, you dirty filthy Americans. China's open for business. You aren't.
[31:24.000 --> 31:32.000]  And watch open satanic rituals with Lady Gaga and all these other losers stumbling around again force fed to you and your family.
[31:32.000 --> 31:41.000]  It's all for one world at home. The carbon tax. You're shut down. Your way of life has been canceled by the globalists.
[31:41.000 --> 31:48.000]  They're coming with forced inoculations, implantable microchips and total medical tyranny to take over your life.
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.000]  You are now non essential. You are now non essential. The new owner got you where they want you.
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  And now they're going to slowly kill you and suck all the money out of you.
[31:58.000 --> 32:05.000]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight. If others human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying,
[32:05.000 --> 32:10.000]  if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[32:10.000 --> 32:17.000]  But you get that. You are patriots. You are people that live and work in the real world or erase color and create and understand what's happening.
[32:17.000 --> 32:22.000]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke. Thank you for what you've done.
[32:22.000 --> 32:28.000]  We're all of this together. We believe in the rights of the unborn. We believe in families. We believe in the right to self-defense.
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  We believe in capitalism, America and Jesus Christ, number one. And we believe in free speech.
[32:33.000 --> 32:40.000]  And so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world.
[32:40.000 --> 32:47.000]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[32:47.000 --> 32:53.000]  They thought they'd be in charge. They thought they would have won. But they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[32:53.000 --> 33:11.000]  So God bless you all.
[33:24.000 --> 33:33.000]  All right. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The only way this dog hunts is when you spread the word about the local radio and TV stations you're watching and listening to
[33:33.000 --> 33:41.000]  and you tell people about man.video and infowars.com or it's on a show. When you do that, it changes the world.
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  So here's what's happening.
[33:44.000 --> 33:55.000]  Communist China, working with the deep state, was losing its trade war. Trump was getting control of the federal government and actually starting to arrest communist Chinese agents like the head of the biology department at Harvard.
[33:55.000 --> 34:07.000]  They shut down the Confucius societies and over 200 major universities including the University of Texas.
[34:07.000 --> 34:17.000]  The communist Chinese were in such incredible control even two years ago that if you were a military veteran even with master's degrees,
[34:17.000 --> 34:29.000]  they would run your background in the database at UT and they would not hire you to even fix the sprinklers.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  That's how controlled we are.
[34:33.000 --> 34:43.000]  The globalists used China to move our industry, our jobs, then to launder money and then to project that power back to buy up Hollywood to get full control to buy up our debt.
[34:43.000 --> 34:52.000]  Trump and America was waking up. We were reversing all of that and so they launched the bio attack.
[34:52.000 --> 35:05.000]  Now remember, we told you it came out of the Wuhan Bioweapons Lab. We told you that Fauci and the NIH in 2012 through 2015 transferred the weapons to them.
[35:05.000 --> 35:18.000]  A Chimera cold virus, highly transmittable with nanotech gain of function viral miniaturization technology.
[35:18.000 --> 35:29.000]  It then had Chimera insertion points on it so that it could be mutated rapidly by the chikoms and mixed in with the bats.
[35:29.000 --> 35:40.000]  They were then ground up and fed to piglets and the piglets that died, meaning they got sick and had a viral bloom, would then be fed to other piglets
[35:40.000 --> 35:52.000]  and then to fed to dogs to create a zoological transfer. It's very hard to get species to species with a new virus, but that's how they were able to do it.
[35:52.000 --> 36:00.000]  And last week I told you it's about to come out. The China launched this. That's why they said, okay, here's documents that China leaked to the Daily Mail.
[36:00.000 --> 36:14.000]  And you see that in my six that it leaked to them. It's the Daily Mail to then come out and say, oh, the U.S. transferred it to them.
[36:14.000 --> 36:21.000]  It's the U.S.'s fault. That was China saying, we're going to come out and admit that Fauci and the NIH and Obama and Hillary did this with us.
[36:21.000 --> 36:31.000]  And Trump's like, great, continue that. And that's what I advise the President and the White House to do is good, fry them, and let it just all start coming out.
[36:31.000 --> 36:46.000]  And that's now what's happened. The only course is the truth here. The only course is leveling with the public. You've got to do it incrementally, but Trump is rapidly leveling with people.
[36:46.000 --> 36:57.000]  And it's a good thing. Trump's for real, folks. But I wouldn't be surprised if they don't put a bullet in him any day now. I mean, this country is in dire straits.
[36:57.000 --> 37:07.000]  You better be on your knees any time you can praying to Jesus and praying for Trump and praying for the country and the world to wake up and praying for M4s, by the way.
[37:07.000 --> 37:17.000]  I mean, the globalists have got a gun to my head if I don't turn against America and turn against Trump and everything. And I told them, pull the trigger.
[37:17.000 --> 37:28.000]  And the point is, is that there's not just evil in this universe. And I guess I've passed a lot of tests, but passing that latest one, let's just say, really got the White House's attention.
[37:28.000 --> 37:38.000]  Because almost everybody else rolls over, folks. And that isn't me after saying, oh, look, I'm tough. I didn't roll over. The country is in a war, people.
[37:38.000 --> 37:45.000]  You don't sell out to occupiers that are bringing tyranny. It'd be one thing if the occupiers had better science and were better than us and we were bad.
[37:45.000 --> 37:52.000]  Like the Russians at first were like, we hate communists. Hey, Nazis, save us. But they found out the Nazis were even worse. They're like, let's kill these Nazis.
[37:52.000 --> 38:04.000]  You know, it'd be one thing if we were getting conquered by something better. I'd be like, yeah, let me join your military. No, no, no, we're not. We're getting conquered by pure evil.
[38:04.000 --> 38:18.000]  So it's not courage to not back down. It's self-preservation. That's why I look at people against Trump and against America and for Communist China and the Washington Post and Bezos praising Xi Jinping and saying, please destroy Trump.
[38:18.000 --> 38:38.000]  That's a close quote. And I just go, America made you $160 billion. And in all this, and then you just side with it, side with evil against America.
[38:38.000 --> 38:49.000]  I'm digressing. The point is that I can, here's what's important.
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  They're now admitting that the weapon came out of Wuhan.
[38:54.000 --> 39:08.000]  Now they're trying to spin it after all the denials and after all the deplatforming and zero hedge being kicked off Twitter for posting Indian and German and other major institutes. Look at the virus. They went, is it fake?
[39:08.000 --> 39:22.000]  It'd be like a pig with a duck's head growing off the back with a ostrich head off the side in a, in, you know, lion's claws or something. I mean, obviously it's a chimera, folks.
[39:22.000 --> 39:30.000]  You know, from Greek mythology and an animal of three different creatures, this thing's five different creatures.
[39:30.000 --> 39:39.000]  It was four. Now they, of course, as I predicted, it just keeps mutating and opening up and doing new things because it's a very sophisticated weapon.
[39:39.000 --> 39:46.000]  And we can speculate about what it's going to do in phase two and phase three and, you know, all the rest of it. But let's just say this.
[39:46.000 --> 39:56.000]  You better be getting your immunity ready. But the main target is the economy and the free world.
[39:56.000 --> 40:10.000]  And so, yes, we have been totally vindicated hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times with what we cover and what we do here because we're dialed into how the real world actually operates.
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.000]  I mean, all you got to do is type in with a prefix in four words.com into a search engine in four words.com will search the site and then you just put
[40:20.000 --> 40:31.000]  COVID-19 is a bio weapon from the Wuhan lab and you'll get dozens of videos and articles from two months ago and nine weeks ago and 10 weeks ago.
[40:31.000 --> 40:44.000]  We're on record. I know you all heard it at nauseam. I'm just explaining that so that folks understand that we're not just up here making this up and that we know what we're talking about.
[40:44.000 --> 41:05.000]  So let me then tell you the rest of the story and what is going to be coming and unfolding after that if we don't make some of the right moves into the future and really recognize what we're facing.
[41:05.000 --> 41:15.000]  Because we're on record. Explaining the Democrats are getting talking points from the United Nations. Big pharma.
[41:15.000 --> 41:25.000]  It's at the heart of the New World Order and the chai comms and the Twitter and Facebook let the chai comms operate however they want as vicious as they want.
[41:25.000 --> 41:41.000]  On Twitter on Facebook on Google on YouTube against the American people and then block out any news or information that's truthful or accurate about how you can prepare yourself how you can protect yourself how you can boost your immune system.
[41:41.000 --> 41:57.000]  About the origin of the virus about the cover up about the World Health Organization being on the payroll of the chai comms and how they had a director of the World Health Organization that worked for Xi Jinping and the huge scandals that have gone on there and all of it.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  That's the big issue.
[42:02.000 --> 42:18.000]  And that's where this is going. And if we don't do that. And if we don't explain that the Democrats are holding the nation hostage with the globalists under their directives we don't have a hope we're up against hardcore
[42:18.000 --> 42:33.000]  Republicans with major countries backing them with a media bought and paid for trained to hate the very country they live in trained to hate their own 401k trained to hate their own children trained to literally just not even operate in reality.
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  But to say and do whatever they're told they are meat puppets.
[42:38.000 --> 42:50.000]  How do we break the globalist blockade. How do we stop them. How do we wake people up. How do we get folks out of their trance. Well evidence shows it's already starting to happen.
[42:50.000 --> 42:59.000]  But quite frankly we need to spend our time exposing the fact that this is a bio weapon.

[43:57.000 --> 44:14.000]  It's staggering to realize that the real COVID target is hiding with you and nobody's pointed out. Even the UN that's hyping all this history admits that half a million people have gone from extreme poverty to borderline starvation just the last two months.
[44:14.000 --> 44:31.000]  And the two million plus people will starve to death extra this year. You know I mentioned it to a colleague who cares but they said oh in an average a whole way starving. That's the reality of what's happened when we fred over a few hundred thousand dead in the west.
[44:31.000 --> 44:48.000]  Millions and millions and millions of the shutdown of this economy are conscripted to a slow agonizing death by starvation and nobody's putting that talking point out because that's reality. Big pharma and big tech are involved in the takeover are using our phobias for control.
[44:48.000 --> 44:58.000]  That's the bottom line anybody signs on this is in the vast death of the population so choose a sign.
[44:58.000 --> 45:13.000]  How do you put a people under house arrest. How do you put them under siege. Well you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the populist president and those
[45:13.000 --> 45:28.000]  pesky American people that have become too upbeat. Bill Maher even admitted it. Man I hope we have a depression. Now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the
[45:28.000 --> 45:43.000]  political parties and blue states all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates. America is that stupid we deserve what happens to us but as for me I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it. It's all the nanny state and the
[45:43.000 --> 45:57.000]  peer pressure that they're the good people keep everybody safe but that's not what they're doing. They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings our health our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death.
[45:57.000 --> 46:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen M4s can now offer high quality storeable food again. Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago and they told people they had food. Most folks never would deliver their food well when our sponsors food began to run short they just
[46:16.000 --> 46:30.000]  didn't sell so they opened more factories and secured more food so the eager orders in right now they can take new orders and get it to you quickly. They'll probably have to suspend orders very very soon again because the lockdown of the
[46:30.000 --> 46:45.000]  economy is killing food distribution farming you name it and now it's mainstream news the food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen. If Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist things
[46:45.000 --> 46:56.000]  may be OK but it looks like it's going to get very very rough so again ladies and gentlemen now is the time to secure the number one thing you need high quality storeable food ready to get to you and your family now if you get your orders in
[46:56.000 --> 47:16.000]  the forestore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.000 --> 47:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen I don't
[47:38.000 --> 47:54.000]  know how in full wars and zero hedge and a few others were the first to break that the COVID-19 bio weapon that's got half the planet on lockdown directed by the U.N. and the chai comms originated from
[47:54.000 --> 48:09.000]  Wuhan. I'm not up here saying we told you this first to go look we're great we know what's coming next the lockdown of the economy the mutiny of the Democrat states directed by the globalist. The total depression the overthrow of
[48:09.000 --> 48:29.000]  the economy. On going unending martial law. You would never put up with the oh it's because of a virus. This is their plan if they just killed Trump up front or crash the economy up front they wouldn't get away with it but if they have a virus as their cover they
[48:29.000 --> 48:41.000]  would get away with it. David night still here I saw him out there in the home if he can I want him to pop in maybe at 1215 come up about 30 minutes for a segment because we just did a little bit of searching this morning and look at these headlines from
[48:41.000 --> 49:03.000]  him full wars dot com. January 29. Coronavirus Chinese espionage behind Wuhan bio weapon. And then he lays out the arrest of the Harvard biology head. Now it's out of the Wuhan level four bio weapons lab earliest report we can find is David night.
[49:03.000 --> 49:16.000]  January 31. Coronavirus contains HIV insertion stoking fears of artificially created bio weapon in full wars dot com zero hedge. A major Indian universities they're just we're just reporting the truth but see the Indian
[49:16.000 --> 49:26.000]  University got threat with all their funding being pulled didn't pull the research just said we've been ordered to. And then now that Indian government says they believe China launched it on purpose.
[49:26.000 --> 49:45.000]  Creator of US by weapons act says coronavirus is biological warfare weapon. That of course is Dr Boyle on the show and other publications February 4. And he specifically laid out the Fauci NIH transfers 2012 2013 1415 16 program ending when
[49:45.000 --> 50:05.000]  Lock got in 2017. White House asked scientists to investigate whether 2019. In covo was bio engineered. That was its earlier name. February 8. In fours dot com zero hedge. And then it just goes through all the interviews with Boyle on the show going back into
[50:05.000 --> 50:16.000]  early February. Full transcript of smoking gun bombshell interview professor Francis Boyle poses the bio weapons origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  You'll be joining us the third hour.
[50:20.000 --> 50:35.000]  And this is only the tip of the iceberg. Oh, months later, Senate Intelligence Committee Pentagon all say word for word we did. Again, why do you think they want us off the air?
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  Because we research and we have the experts on that are silenced.
[50:40.000 --> 50:50.000]  And we have a track record of like 97% accuracy. By the way, you think I like being accurate like this. I don't like this.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  I wish COVID-19 didn't exist. I wish we all live forever.
[50:55.000 --> 51:11.000]  But if it is going to exist, I wish it was naturally occurring. You think I want to go to war with the chicoms? You think I want to have to go up against these people and have the Democrat dug in party, literally harassing my crew, harassing me, trying to put me in prison
[51:11.000 --> 51:16.000]  behind the scenes, running around engaged in every crime you can imagine and never getting in trouble.
[51:16.000 --> 51:25.000]  Because they've still got the media and the banks and most of the Justice Department and they are just wallace trash.
[51:25.000 --> 51:35.000]  Who literally hate America and believe what they're doing and that GG pings good and that Trump's bad and that I'm bad.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  And they publicly say, please destroy Trump.
[51:42.000 --> 51:52.000]  I have crew that one crew members worked here 18 years. His sister will not talk to him because he works here now.
[51:52.000 --> 52:02.000]  And she says she hopes GG pain crushes us. She worships GG pain.
[52:02.000 --> 52:08.000]  These are sick people, folks. These are sick people.
[52:08.000 --> 52:15.000]  You know, I've talked about what's coming next if we don't turn this around and so much of it's already here.
[52:15.000 --> 52:24.000]  When I look at the Democrats openly, when Trump keeps things shut down, they say, okay, you're a good president now. You're a good president now.
[52:24.000 --> 52:34.000]  And the minute he tries to reopen things, they go, oh, you're a horrible person. You're going to kill everybody. COVID-19 is your fault when they were the ones that tried to get it over here.
[52:34.000 --> 52:41.000]  There's a common sense thing is we think a bio weapon's gotten out or something really bad. Well, you block where it comes from. You quarantine that.
[52:41.000 --> 52:51.000]  You don't quarantine everyone. It's the analogy of lowering your drawbridge for enemy army to enter your castle.
[52:51.000 --> 53:01.000]  But then you run around with troops while the drawbridge is open and the troops go to the homes of the villagers and point swords at them and say, stay in your beds.
[53:01.000 --> 53:10.000]  There's barbarians running around, battle-axing people, but they're pointing swords at the people inside the castle.
[53:10.000 --> 53:16.000]  Well, that's because they work with the globalists. They work with the barbarians. They work with those sacking our country.
[53:16.000 --> 53:24.000]  This is a psychological warfare takeover. They couldn't beat us in World War I or World War II. The globalists couldn't do what they wanted.
[53:24.000 --> 53:32.000]  That's what world domination is globalism. They didn't just invent it in the last 60 years.
[53:32.000 --> 53:41.000]  And so when I look at all this and how the mainstream media dutifully covered up when it came out, it was a bio weapon.
[53:41.000 --> 53:48.000]  And good universities were prestigious. Scandant went, wow, this is man-made, conclusive.
[53:48.000 --> 54:01.000]  And others looked at it and said, yeah, peace shuttle genes where they did the gene editing, the RNA editing, 100% conclusive.
[54:01.000 --> 54:07.000]  Even more conclusive than, say, taking your front teeth out in their dentures. Like, are these real teeth? Are they? Well, we take them out in their dentures.
[54:07.000 --> 54:16.000]  Mine aren't dentures. I'm saying it's a malogy. I mean, it's totally fake. Hands down. We've known that for nine weeks.
[54:16.000 --> 54:22.000]  It's not that we're that smart. It's that we'll tell the truth all the rest of the media when they knew it.
[54:22.000 --> 54:29.000]  In fact, that's in the AP report leaked from the World Health Organization to the Associated Press.
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  We're not denying it that they knew and covered it up.
[54:34.000 --> 54:42.000]  And then ahead of the World Health Organization, an admitted communist, his party affiliation, his Communist Party, Ethiopia.
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  He was involved financing bombings on Christian churches. On record, he's proud of it.
[54:47.000 --> 54:54.000]  Look, I'll blow your churches up, okay? Even better just so you can't go in them.
[54:54.000 --> 55:02.000]  This man got in Trump's face and said, do not block flights from China. It's xenophobic.
[55:02.000 --> 55:10.000]  And taking orders from his bosses, crawled a little spiderbiden to repeat it was xenophobia.
[55:10.000 --> 55:18.000]  Remember that just eight weeks ago, nine weeks ago? That's who these people are. And that's what they think of you.
[55:18.000 --> 55:25.000]  It's just flabbergasting. And we're going to sit here. You go outside Austin. That's a blue pit.
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.000]  Nobody's wearing masks. Everyone knows it's a joke. Over 70 counties don't even have one COVID-19 case.
[55:30.000 --> 55:39.000]  There's nine dead in Austin. All of them had preexisting conditions.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  Let's see. People say, well, Alex, you say it's an emergency. We should get ready, prepared.
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  Yeah, because we're already in a depression globally. It's going to get really bad now.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  How bad it gets is up to what we do now, because it's a death sentence to the third world.
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  Tens of millions will starve to death conservatively the next year.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  The numbers they have in Associated Press are like, oh, two million are starving right now.
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.000]  Extra because of this. Those are real people dying.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  So going under the peer pressure of wearing a mask or playing along with this is suicide.
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  That's why we will have demonstrations in Austin for the governor to reopen things immediately.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  And I'll announce them soon. I've just been waiting for the people to be ready and to start having mass demonstrations all over the country.
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  We can roll some B roll footage if you like. This amazing drone footage.
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.000]  It's on infohorses.com. Stunning aerial footage of Michigan lockdown.
[56:30.000 --> 56:37.000]  Protests and the people just said no, and they came in and they filled it up and they took over the Capitol and they told the crazed governor to stop it.
[56:37.000 --> 56:46.000]  This is the answer. And now we're in a civil war with the globalist openly trying to block our economy reopening,
[56:46.000 --> 56:53.000]  saying corporations and an alliance with blue states and cities under the UN direction will not open until the UN says so.
[56:53.000 --> 57:01.000]  Trump goes after the head of the UN because that's a globalist who's been caught covering up the bio weapon release and trying to get the Chinese into the country
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  when they had it to spread it to do this.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  Because Trump ignored what they said and ignored the federal judges and blocked the Chinese coming in.
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.000]  It was much less. And now they don't have the big death toll these dirty filthies wanted, do they?
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  These scum. That guy shouldn't be fired.
[57:18.000 --> 57:27.000]  He should be arrested on war crimes of bio weapons. And after he's convicted, hang his ass by the neck until dead.
[57:27.000 --> 57:37.000]  And I want to go overthrow China and hang Xi Jinping's ugly ass as well. You attack us with weapons. You die.
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  Nuremberg trials are coming. Get ready.
[57:41.000 --> 57:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, spread the word about the live transmission. You are Paul Revere's.
[57:48.000 --> 57:54.000]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[57:54.000 --> 58:00.000]  I believe in God and I believe in the long run. It'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.000]  I understand what comes around, goes around. You read what you show and I live that.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  If I would have hyped up the virus, it was going to kill three, four, five million people like the UN did.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  I've sold five times more supplements. But you know what? I didn't do that.
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.000]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient. People are deficient.
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  And I have died and so many other issues. You need those products regardless.
[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  So we started selling out of vitamin mineral fusion, all the other products.
[58:30.000 --> 58:41.000]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies of fences.
[58:41.000 --> 59:07.000]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storable food down.
[59:07.000 --> 59:14.000]  Everything, vitamin D, a big dose of that, a big dose of zinc, a big dose of selenium, copper, chromium, and a bunch of other stuff.
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  This is the perfect formula for what's going on right now.
[59:19.000 --> 59:29.000]  And it's about to sell out at infowarstore.com. And I want you to have it so that after all this craziness passes, it becomes a normal regimen in your life because it's something, in my view, you need every day.
[59:29.000 --> 59:42.000]  Get it right now, prostaguardedinfowarstore.com and whatever you do, please warn others that Mother Nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our overall health and wellness.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. And I have been so hot and heavy on the news, the news of which I'll cover when we come back in the next segment.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  And I've not gotten into some of the most important areas that need to be covered just for listeners and just for viewers.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  And it's a very symbiotic message that I've been so busy I've not had time to cut ads.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  So I'm going to cut an ad live right here on air right now.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  Look, my superpower, as I've said many times, is just telling it like it is and not holding back from people.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  And the more powerful the broadcast, the more serious the time that we're in, the more I tend to not plug products that we have for sale.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Even though those are products that people absolutely need and that are critical for them to have.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  And when you talk about storeable food, now is the time for everybody to have storeable food. Now is the time for people to understand that this whole system is about making you dependent on them.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  That's why they're trying to ban store selling non GMR heirloom seeds saying that's not essential.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  It's about getting full control over the people.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  And I know that all of you understand that. I just want to encourage all of you to get high quality storeable food at info or store.com.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  And to understand that most of the other companies out there that say they have storeable food that's available do not have it.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  This is high quality food. They had to pause food sales for a while to get the orders out if they had.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  They opened up some other big factories. It's high quality. It's the best price you're going to find.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  They're ready to take your orders again. And it's not about the virus.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  It's about the economy and the civil war and the globalist and what's coming in the future.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  And this is storeable food. It's high quality. It's packaged the best you're going to find.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  And it lasts 25 years. And yes, your purchase then funds this operation and money in the fight against the globalist is so incredibly important for us to do what we do here as well.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  It's the reason we've been able to stay on air under Democratic Party attacks, dirty tricks and so much more.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  It has been a very, very strong defense for us. So buying your supplements, buying your vitamins, your minerals, getting your water filtration, getting your air filtration at info or store.com is how we're able to stay on air.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Plus, these are things that you really need. And with how crazy the world is right now with how insane it is.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  It is such a no brainer to say to you, folks, you need to get high quality, storeable foods. You need to protect yourself and your family.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Storeable food, water filtration is right up there with firearms.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  And the only thing about that is having a relationship with God and having your soul in order.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  And so I got to tell you, I've not ever gone out and gotten a piece of property or gotten ready, even though I knew it was needed because I've been on so much on the offense and I still think we're going to win this fight.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  But the last few weeks, I knew all this was coming and I got to do it for my children and I just can't be in Austin during this type of stuff.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  And so in case they're able to have the full shutdown of the economy happen and beyond even depression, I went ahead and talk to some family and that's some property and stuff and have gone and help get that ready and everything and have got that stocked up and prepared.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  So for the first time ever, I have had to actually move into defense mode and prepare retreat. Okay, so that's how horrible all this is because they're going to just shut media down completely if they remove Trump.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  They're going to use that as the backdrop for the martial law that's going to happen.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  And then they're going to put out false charges against most of the leadership of the resistance and send in special leftist units.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And of course, everyone will resist when the units go to get you and then it all be killed. And that's the plan.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  And so, you know, if things go in that way, folks are not going to be dug in just waiting for that to happen.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Obviously, a lot of folks out there, I don't really know, know them, I just know how things work or plan in their own counter offensive systems rock just away for communists to come after us.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  But that's where the country is.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  You're in a total civil war, lawlessness, total evil, mutinous blockades of the West and East Coast run by chai comms that killed 100 million people.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  So they mean business so do we.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  But for my children, for my family, I'm a talk show host.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  I'm not going to be a military leader in this fight.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  I am preparing my evacuation.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  You always prepare an evacuation times like this.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  What are champions made of?
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  That's info.com.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Hey, hey, hey.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:39.960]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on Alex Jones, your host and these
[1:06:39.960 --> 1:06:44.920]  criminal globalists have this country in a stranglehold and so many Americans love the
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:55.240]  cowardice, they love getting into it, they love being roped like a dope, they enjoy it.
[1:06:55.240 --> 1:06:59.440]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm unable to do the show at this point, more and more I'm
[1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:01.720]  unable to do it, I just can't do it.
[1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:08.560]  There's not a fighting spirit is the problem in America and I just, it's like everybody's
[1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:18.440]  in a daze and a lot of people are waking up so I should be more positive but I've got
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:21.520]  some special reports I'm gonna air and I'm gonna decide if I'm coming back or not.
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:23.000]  This is some new drama thing I'm doing.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.840]  It's just people don't know the times they're living in.
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:34.160]  They don't understand the reality that we're under foreign attack with collaborator traders
[1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:40.080]  holding the nation hostage with a bio weapon they cooked up in Wuhan, released on us, covered
[1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:44.320]  up while it spread and then they blame our country and our president and are trying to
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:49.200]  put us in a permanent depression and put deadly vaccines in us from the very people that launched
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:50.400]  the bio attack.
[1:07:50.400 --> 1:08:07.400]  And that doesn't piss you off, nothing will.
[1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:19.720]  Now I just don't know anymore and you look how childlike and stupid people are everywhere
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:23.280]  and they just don't have any light in their eyes because they watch TV all day and they
[1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:31.000]  live in a fantasy land and so people are in a sleep state, a dull entertainment induced
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:38.080]  sleep state while we're under total attack by a bunch of globalist predators.
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:39.600]  It's unbelievable.
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:50.600]  Here's a little piece that Darren McBrain put together, 5G conspiracy 30 debunked, it's
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:51.600]  pretty funny.
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:55.200]  It's not very good for radio, but we're TV centric even though most of our audience
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:56.200]  is radio.
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:59.360]  There's not really ever a thought going into the fact that we're mainly audible.
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:00.360]  It's always visual.
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:11.360]  See that's a target distortion issue and then also we have other key reports here that I
[1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:21.640]  want to get to, there's a really good report, Trump versus the anti-sync media that's pretty
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:22.640]  good too.
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:23.640]  So we'll hear that too.
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:34.040]  11, after we play the other club here it is.
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:35.840]  Have you heard 5G causes coronavirus?
[1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:40.320]  Well here's where the claim first came from, it's from this Facebook post from March 19th.
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:44.960]  The poster claims to have done some research and made a map overlaying the new 5G towers
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:50.480]  with the COVID-19 cases, then claims how it's weird the towers are right by the hotspots.
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:54.400]  Well first, the poster only used AT&T's tower data, no other company.
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:58.680]  Two, where those towers are, they're based on population density, so where there are
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:01.880]  more people, there are going to be more cases of COVID-19.
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:05.800]  And three, there is just no evidence to support the poster's claim, so this is false.
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:21.640]  5G towers are not causing coronavirus.
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:49.240]  All right, we want to cut in here, there's two things the president has said in the
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:55.640]  last 15 minutes that we think is worth trying to explain or fact check here.
[1:10:55.640 --> 1:11:02.280]  One was on a medical recommendation that the president was making about the use of zinc.
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:06.040]  And if you were confused, that's why we have Dr. Gupta here.
[1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:11.160]  Dr. Gupta, explain what your best you could understand what the president was talking
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:13.160]  about when it came to zinc.
[1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:16.760]  The comments about zinc were mystifying.
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:24.040]  There's no evidence I've seen in the literature suggesting zinc, in addition to hydroxychloroquine,
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:25.040]  would be helpful.
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:27.960]  So I think this is another one of those unknowns.
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:35.040]  You will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises.
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:36.960]  If you do feel ill, what do you do?
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:38.480]  Zinc is a great idea you mentioned earlier.
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.560]  We started out with hydroxychloroquine and then the azithromycin, but then doing some
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:48.320]  of our research, we found that there could have been some benefit by adding zinc to that
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:49.800]  regimen.
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:55.680]  Sink has been found to block the RNA dependent RNA polymerase.
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:01.520]  Check out this paper titled, Sink inhibits coronavirus and arterivirus RNA polymerase
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:08.200]  activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture.
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:12.360]  Despite a new but still not peer reviewed study out today identifying 69 drugs that might
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:17.440]  be effective against the virus, what's lacking is a solid body of evidence that any of them
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:18.680]  work and are safe.
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:22.880]  State Representative Karen Witzit found out she had the virus the day her friend and colleague
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:25.560]  Isaac Robinson died from it.
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:29.440]  She has underlying health issues and was going downhill fast.
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:33.440]  And I thank God that the President of the United States mentioned that drug because
[1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:34.800]  it did save me.
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:39.440]  That drug is hydroxychloroquine, which is undergoing trials at Henry Ford.
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:43.160]  Where we're finding clinically with our patients is that it really only works in conjunction
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:44.160]  with zinc.
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:48.440]  So the hydroxychloroquine opens the zinc channel, zinc goes into the cell, it then blocks the
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:50.880]  replication of the cell in the machinery.
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:52.920]  So it has to be used in conjunction with zinc.
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:55.840]  We are seeing some clinical responses in that regard.
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:13:01.160]  So here we have a molecule of zinc, but it's hard for it to enter the cell.
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:08.520]  So these scientists, they had to add a molecule called PT, which is an ionophore.
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:10.360]  Now what does an ionophore do?
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:15.440]  Well, actually it makes the cell wall permeable for zinc.
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:20.240]  It grabs the zinc and pretty much carries it through the cell wall.
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:21.920]  And here's what they found.
[1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:27.600]  In their experiments, they used SARS-CoV, the pathogen causing SARS.
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:35.240]  And they found that if they added more zinc to their experiments, less viral RNA was produced.
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:40.000]  They're prescribing it and it is working for COVID-19 patients.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.920]  Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill.
[1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:46.520]  And within 8 to 12 hours, they were basically symptom free.
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:51.920]  Do we know anything even close to definitively where you would feel comfortable telling your
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:53.880]  friend, Chris, let's go with it.
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:57.360]  You know, there aren't any proven medications right now.
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:13:59.020]  And I should point out a couple of things.
[1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:01.760]  One is that we don't have the evidence that it works.
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:03.200]  Evidence is important here.
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:10.240]  So there was a study from France that showed that a medication called hydroxychloroquine,
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:16.240]  or the brand name is called plaquewinell, together with the antibiotic azithromycin,
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:21.440]  killed 100% of the virus in a test tube, not in the person in the test tube.
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:26.480]  And then there were some studies from South Korea that showed that the use of hydroxychloroquine
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:31.000]  with the mineral zinc was also somewhat helpful.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:39.080]  So what I did was I combined the two approaches, and I made a three-drug regimen, combining
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:45.160]  zinc with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and I can explain to you why.
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:51.040]  You can see that increasing doses of chloroquine caused increasing concentrations of zinc
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:52.840]  inside the cell.
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:55.560]  The comments about zinc were mystifying.
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:00.040]  But if you look at the overall statistics, out of those 200 patients that I treated
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:09.320]  statistically, 20 should have died, and many more should have been in the respirator.
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:16.120]  Even if you take a low-ball estimate, you say 5% mortality, so 10 should have died,
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:17.960]  and maybe 20 on a respirator.
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:23.040]  My results are that zero died and only two on a respirator, which is terrible, but still
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:26.440]  it's a significant order of magnitude improvement.
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:31.840]  And the entire treatment course of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and the antibiotic azithromycin, took
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:34.040]  just five days and cost $20.
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:36.080]  All right, we want to cut in here.
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:40.880]  There's two things the president has said in the last 15 minutes that we think is worth
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.160]  trying to explain or fact check here.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:50.800]  One was on a medical recommendation that the president was making about the use of zinc.
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:55.440]  And if you were confused, that's why we have Dr. Gupta here.
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:00.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:01.920]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:03.680]  I had a problem like you once.
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:09.080]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:10.200]  my life.
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:15.440]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:20.640]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:23.760]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:28.520]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:30.840]  and totally change your life.
[1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:36.040]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[1:16:36.040 --> 1:16:39.320]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.

[1:17:56.840 --> 1:18:01.680]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high-quality, durable food.
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:06.200]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown.
[1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:10.040]  It would cause, because the globe was for planning to hold America hostage and run a
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:13.560]  blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.040]  Now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an operation.
[1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:22.240]  It's not predictions, we have their battle plans.
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:26.920]  So going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out
[1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:30.560]  except my Patreon supply because they're the biggest and we're pre-positioned.
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:34.360]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:36.000]  able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.680]  They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up.
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:42.520]  Well, now they're caught back up, they got high-quality storeable food in stock, ready
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:44.120]  to be packaged and shipped to you.
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:49.040]  Get your orders in now at mforestore.com to go right at the head of the queue.
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:52.840]  You can deliver to you as fast as possible and from the employer.
[1:18:52.840 --> 1:18:56.160]  Here's trouble food now at mforestore.com.
[1:18:56.160 --> 1:18:59.200]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight.
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:03.160]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word,
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:06.960]  if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:07.960]  But you get that.
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:12.760]  You are patriots, you are people that live and work in the real world of a race, color,
[1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:14.280]  and creed and understand what's happening.
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:17.600]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:18.600]  joke.
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:19.600]  Thank you for what you've done.
[1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:20.840]  We're all of this together.
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:22.640]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:23.640]  We believe in families.
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:24.640]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:29.960]  We believe in capitalism, America, and Jesus Christ, number one, and we believe in free
[1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:30.960]  speech.
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:35.400]  And so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:37.920]  we're doing does everything in the world.
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:42.600]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have
[1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:44.280]  this whole planet sewn up by now.
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:45.280]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:50.720]  They thought they would want, but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[1:19:50.720 --> 1:20:16.720]  So God bless you all.
[1:20:16.720 --> 1:20:40.000]  Thank you.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:47.560]  God to have me at peace because I'm not afraid, and I don't feel sorry for myself.
[1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:54.240]  I'm really angry, more angry than I've ever been, that this is so ridiculously obvious.
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:58.960]  A bio weapon launched by the deep state against America to stop our recovery and to stop getting
[1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:04.080]  our country back and to bring in forced inoculations of medical tyranny and to now have a civil
[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:09.880]  war alliance of the east and west coast against the Midwest and against America and saying
[1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:16.120]  we're never reopening and the politicians laughing and smiling like they just had orgasms
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:19.200]  or won the lottery.
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:24.760]  It's outrageous, imagine a movie like this, you go see it and say this would never happen.
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:29.120]  It's so villainous, it's so ridiculous.
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:35.560]  And when I get up here and I cover all the times we told you this first, I don't do it
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:39.520]  again to go oh look, I'm doing it to say now the next thing I'm going to tell you is going
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:40.520]  to happen.
[1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:43.440]  In fact I haven't had the crew search, how many listeners have heard us the last eight
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:48.920]  nine weeks say they'll never reopen, the blue cities and blue states, west and east coast
[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:53.200]  will lock America down and they will never let Trump reopen and they will think the public
[1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:57.680]  is so ignorant that they'll say one coronavirus death's too much, we never open until that
[1:21:57.680 --> 1:21:59.480]  martial law house arrest.
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:05.640]  They started saying it within four weeks, you can predict either another battle plan
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:08.800]  or they just listened to the show and go this guy's a really dystopian person will
[1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:13.160]  take it, no that's not because I have their Rockefeller Foundation reports like lockstep
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:16.760]  and others salivating about worldwide authoritarianism.
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:24.600]  These are words they use, global government, digital tattoos, again, I'm pissed because
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:31.960]  this is a normal response to having your entire country, a lot of people don't care about
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:35.880]  quote rights, they just care about prosperity, well the rights come before the prosperity
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:40.800]  and generate it, it's like I don't care about gasoline, I just like my Ferrari, well without
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:48.640]  gasoline that car don't roll, without freedom there's no damn fuel and I don't like being
[1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:52.640]  raped, I don't like being dominated, I don't like having my ass kicked, I'm gonna tell
[1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:57.160]  you something, our country is getting its ass kicked right now, China's open for business,
[1:22:57.160 --> 1:23:02.840]  Germany's open and back up for business, it's all about shutting us down folks and as Nigel
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:08.200]  Farage came out and said his new cause after Briggs, it's mine too, told the crew this
[1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:14.320]  two weeks ago, it's gonna be reopening America and what we've gotta go through to do this.
[1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:18.600]  David Knight's with us for the rest of the hour, I have a stack of articles, a stack
[1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:22.680]  of videos, I haven't, one thing is I get ready for hours for the show just like David does
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:28.240]  and I've counseled David, he gets mad behind the scenes too, to not study so much, that
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:32.760]  sounds like an oxymoron, it sounds stupid but we read so much stuff and are all totally
[1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:38.120]  loaded before we come on the show with information and then you're so pissed that it's hard to
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:42.840]  even operate and because we do care folks, we're not psychopaths and I know you aren't
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:47.560]  either, that's why we're here together but without even looking today, I've got a whole
[1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:54.040]  bunch of articles about fakeness, look at this, mother enraged by face mask ad claiming
[1:23:54.040 --> 1:23:58.560]  her whole family died of COVID-19, apparently that baby that died of it was smothered by
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:04.440]  the baby center, none of it's real folks, look at this one, UK hospital's four times
[1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:10.160]  emptier than usual, the most empty ever because there's no one there, it's all, the anecdotal
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:13.640]  video's all over, it's true, David's here, we've got five minutes to break, we're gonna
[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:19.120]  go over all this but how seismic is it David, that here's the first article we can find
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:23.320]  before zero hedge, before anybody, and we love zero hedge, Chinese espionage behind
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:28.640]  the Wuhan bio weapon, David Knight and your great report about that, yeah well you know,
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:32.920]  that's the thing Alex, I went back, I could go back so far, we had to get help from the
[1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:38.440]  band out video guys to get back, it was actually the 23rd, this is 29th, before that I pointed
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:42.800]  out I said you know they're talking about this being in Wuhan, well you know it's interesting
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:47.920]  that they have their only, their one and only biosafety level four lab was opened up there
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:54.160]  in the same city and then about a day after that on the 23rd, Daily Mail said hey look
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:25:00.440]  it was one or two days after that, said look it's really close to that market that they
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:03.840]  said was coming out there and then after that we found out that oh yeah they've got some
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.160]  employees who've been selling animals, you know like I said today Binky and the Brain,
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:12.360]  you know they sell them at the market, make a little bit of money, there's a lot of ways
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:17.360]  that this could be out of that area and then about a week later when this article came
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:22.680]  out, that was when the NIH and the Department of Defense arrested that Harvard professor
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:27.360]  who interestingly enough had been brought in by the Chinese to set up the lab, they
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:33.040]  paid him about a one and a half million dollars set up the lab and they gave him about $50,000
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:39.400]  a month, about $158,000 living expenses as well, they paid him a lot of money to essentially
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:45.040]  set this up and he's now been arrested for espionage, so when we look at this, here's
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:49.460]  the thing I'm concerned about Alex, I said this this morning, there's essentially a cold
[1:25:49.460 --> 1:25:54.720]  war is developing around this, that's fine, we need to understand what the Chinese are
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:59.040]  and how they will use this type of stuff, but what I'm concerned about is that as we
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:05.160]  see these depressions being manufactured, this is a great depression that's been manufactured,
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:06.520]  how are we going to get out of this?
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:10.840]  Because we already had a massive bubble that had been baked into the economy before from
[1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:15.400]  the collapse in 2008, I don't know if they're going to be able to get out of this depression
[1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:18.840]  without a war, typically when we have a forced party.
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:23.280]  That's right, I hope all the leftists remember you asked for this jerks, you popped the bubble,
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:25.960]  you little pieces of trash.
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:26.960]  That's the thing I'm concerned about.
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:31.680]  I mean all you leftists want war, you're getting it now, idiots, I mean I feel like
[1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:36.600]  Charlton Heston when he finds out he's back on earth and he goes, you blew it all up,
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:44.960]  you bastard, it's got damn you to hell, I mean it's just what in the hell is your problem?
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:48.560]  I'm going to go over all this and what's coming in the next in the future and the blockades
[1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:54.280]  and everything, but what about breaking that obviously at the timing, it's not an accident,
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:57.920]  they lose a trade war, it's transferred, Bill and Melinda Gates want the power, they've
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.520]  got the virus patented, this is the rollout to take out the West, now it's failing, the
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:07.240]  Pentagon and Trump know it's fake, we know it's fake, the UN head is about to, you know,
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:12.680]  but you're right, this is leading to war brother, war, I hope you're all happy leftists and
[1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:17.680]  your little armchairs, your little SJW mess, your little malice brigades and your little
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:23.760]  weird sick love affair with ZZPing, ZZPing is as close to Satan as you'll ever get dumb
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:29.200]  asses and you grow up in this country having no respect for the basic freedom you have
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:33.240]  that you've now destroyed, I'm sorry, I'm ranting, go ahead.
[1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:37.840]  Well, you know, the thing I was concerned at the very beginning, I said, look, when
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:42.960]  you look at what China is doing, shutting that down, and again, I have questions about
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:49.440]  at the time, I said, we don't know how dangerous this is, is it bioengineered, probably, however,
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:52.560]  what is really being done is the social engineering.
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:57.280]  And once they set down the example that they're going to lock down an entire city and then
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:01.880]  they did other cities after that, but remember, we had millions of people get out of Wuhan
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:02.880]  before they locked it down.
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:06.760]  You didn't see this happening in the other cities to that extent, basically, nothing
[1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:07.760]  happened there.
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:11.880]  But as this pattern began to be rolled out in Italy and Spain, and then they went to
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:12.880]  bring it to the United States.
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:15.920]  It was all choreographed by the UN and GGP.
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:16.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:18.360]  That's the real false flag.
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.420]  The shutdown is the false flag.
[1:28:20.420 --> 1:28:23.320]  This is just an excuse that's behind it.
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:27.240]  And when we look at, we just had an Israeli mathematician, former general, come out and
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:29.920]  say, I reported this today.
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:32.200]  He said, it doesn't matter what you do.
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:35.920]  He's looked at all the different countries, and he says, whether you go total draconian
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:41.520]  or you do nothing at all, it lasts for about 40 days at 70 days, it peaks in 40 days, and
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:43.200]  70 days it goes to about zero.
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:44.720]  It doesn't matter what you do.
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:47.760]  And that's what virologists always say, they always run their course.
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:50.520]  Yeah, yeah, it's the, as far as law, it goes back to 1840.
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:52.600]  All right, but let's talk about what's coming next.
[1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:56.040]  Let's talk about the Jewish boy.
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:29:01.200]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate dot com.
[1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:05.160]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:06.640]  my family to freedom.

[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:14.200]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:00.680]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free home
[1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:03.200]  of the brave is dying right now.
[1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:08.240]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down and making
[1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:09.920]  us dependent on them.
[1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:14.520]  The food shortages have begun, the depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[1:30:14.520 --> 1:30:17.240]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:21.240]  Try to stop it, but the mainstream media working with the tricombs blocked it.
[1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:25.680]  That's why you and myself and everybody else has to get prepared now.
[1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:26.680]  Do not wait.
[1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:30.360]  It's not about the virus, it's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the
[1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:32.160]  next six months to a year.

[1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:41.200]  There are major shortages.
[1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:46.840]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism, but we the people, the
[1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:49.240]  patriots have to be prepared.
[1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:52.240]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far, we'll get ready to be really proven
[1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:53.240]  right.
[1:30:53.240 --> 1:30:58.080]  Get your swarble foods now at inFullWareShore.com.
[1:30:58.080 --> 1:31:04.160]  Now that this UN global government chicomb billable indicates medical tyranny has seen
[1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:10.640]  how far they can push it now, we just lapped it up like poison.
[1:31:10.640 --> 1:31:15.240]  You know now they're going to launch more bio attacks and even more hardcore.
[1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:20.680]  This early one does kill people, but see it's a virus billable indicates own.
[1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:25.400]  It's a virus that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine.
[1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:29.480]  See a regular cold or flu virus, you really can't do a vaccine for because it's always
[1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:30.480]  mutated.
[1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:36.640]  But see because this is a chimera and lab made, they can have a speciality.
[1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:38.240]  So it's a whole giant franchise.
[1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:40.000]  They can filter the rich off of it.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:41.880]  They can surveil everybody.
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:43.480]  Everybody gets to become a suspect.
[1:31:43.480 --> 1:31:46.000]  And now when you would have low numbers of death, it doesn't matter because they make
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:49.080]  a huge spectacle out of it.
[1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:52.520]  You watch next year with the flu, it'll even be bigger as well.
[1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:57.120]  This is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:04.280]  The World Health Organization run by the chicomb murderers and World Citizen are giving you
[1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:06.640]  the world at home.
[1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:13.400]  Extravagans are all the dried up, pathetic, evil, twisted Hollywood music crap.
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:16.480]  Force fed at you and your family.
[1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:22.040]  So stay at home, you dirty filthy Americans, China's open for business, you aren't.
[1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:28.320]  And watch open satanic rituals with Lady Gaga and all these other losers stumbling around
[1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:30.600]  again force fed to you and your family.
[1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:37.120]  It's all for one world at home, the carbon tax, your shutdown, your way of life has been
[1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:43.120]  canceled by the globalists and they're coming with force evacuations, implantable microchips
[1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:46.120]  and total medical tyranny to take over your life.
[1:32:46.120 --> 1:32:52.120]  You are now non-essential, you are now non-essential, the new older got you where they want you
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:33:00.120]  and now they're going to slowly kill you and suck all the money out of you.
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:26.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:35.160]  I am so angry right now because we're being totally right that I'm having trouble containing
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:39.120]  myself but David Knight is on fire, on air and off air.
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:43.600]  David you were pointing out FEMA has leaked to the Washington Post what they're planning.
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:48.640]  It has nothing to do with the virus, it's all about a Psyop, they are going to roll
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:53.920]  out the mask now and then say you have to wear a mask until the end of the year.
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:58.760]  That way you physically get used to doing things to your body, the government tells you so
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:04.160]  you take the force inoculation less than a year from now, they're like oh we got it
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:08.160]  out early and so you accept them being in your body.
[1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:11.320]  You absolutely must say no to this but some people because of their jobs are going to
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:12.640]  be forced to do it.
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:18.680]  We are already rush manufacturing, infowars.com mask and we're also rush manufacturing some
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:25.600]  that say COVID-19 is, COVID-19 is hoax so that you can exercise this out in the open.
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:29.800]  I'm going to go to local stores as soon as I have time wearing a gore mask, a paper bag
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:30.800]  over my head.
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:34.880]  This is all ridiculous, it's an act of subservience.
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:40.360]  That's why I told my wife and family I said buy six months extra food to supplement the
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:41.360]  food we have.
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:46.480]  We're not going to the stores, we're going to boycott these guys during this.
[1:34:46.480 --> 1:34:50.280]  David tell people what's coming next under this mind control.
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:54.240]  We told them it's man made, we told them China released it, we told them the death numbers
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:55.920]  are way under what they said they were.
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:00.960]  Now they're 90 plus percent under what their worst estimates, their best estimates.
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:05.800]  This is a sigh up by the deep state, the medical tyranny, the Chai comms and the UN and I think
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:10.760]  Trump moving to get rid of the World Health Organization had pointing out that the AP
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:17.960]  budgets, they were caught covering up for China that this was coming out of their lab.
[1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:19.960]  This is exactly where Trump needs to go.
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:24.720]  Well I just talked about this morning, talking about the World Health Organization and vaccines.
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:31.320]  They have their immune agenda 2030 and this is the fourth draft they just did on April
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:37.400]  the 2nd and they want vaccines, everyone, everywhere, every age.
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:42.000]  That's their slogan for the IA 2030 immune agenda.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.480]  So it goes right along with the UN Agenda 2030.
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:51.240]  They've just taken out the climate change aspect of this and they've substituted the
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:54.040]  what they want to do with the coronavirus.
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:58.760]  But it's all about the vaccine but also Alex, we've been talking about how this has been
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:06.480]  a long term plan, not just the UN Agenda 21 and the UN 2030 Agenda but also the takeover
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:08.240]  of the elections for example.
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:13.640]  Take a look at Bill Gates and Microsoft, they have been the ones selected by DARPA to run
[1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:14.640]  election garden.
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:15.640]  What does the election garden do?
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:19.880]  Well that gives different media organizations, not a story by story basis, it's not even
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:23.840]  fact checking but it's just saying well we're going to give a blue check to this organization
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:27.840]  over here and you don't pay any attention to what these other people do and that's
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:33.520]  being run by, that was created by Microsoft for DARPA and then they also funded election
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:34.520]  garden.
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:39.320]  So in fact the 2016 election, they had some state boards of elections said hey we got
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.200]  some probes from people trying to break into our site and did break in and in fact they
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:46.200]  traced that back to the federal government.
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:51.160]  DARPA is funding election garden and they're saying well we're going to make sure the election
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:52.160]  is honest.
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:54.800]  They had all this stuff running for a couple of years, it's four years now.
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:57.840]  So the election garden, news garden and election garden and now they're telling everybody
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:37:00.560]  now you're not going to be able to vote in person.
[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:03.720]  So this is all, all of these different aspects are coming together.
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:06.800]  If you go back to the late 1990s, when the Internet…
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:09.000]  This is how they force us on the digital voting.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  That's right.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.400]  This is how, this is the total revolution on the AI system.
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:13.400]  That's right.
[1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:14.400]  And Trump must resist it.
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:15.400]  That's right.
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:17.040]  You go back to the late 1990s, right?
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:21.960]  First of all, the Internet was designed by a DARPA psychologist, JCR Licklider, but it
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:26.840]  didn't become practical into the late 1990s and so when that happened, you had the CIA
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:32.160]  so eager to help to fund the right kind of tech companies, people are going to be working
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:34.120]  with them that they created Incutel.
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:36.240]  They openly created a venture capital firm.
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:40.920]  But in addition to that, you had a lot of people who are the NSA and other intelligence
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:44.320]  organizations that were on the boards of venture capital firms.
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:49.080]  They helped to create the social media companies now that are controlling speech and the public
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:54.400]  square and geospatial intelligence was born about that time as well, became really big.
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.360]  It is the fastest growing part of the intelligence community.
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:03.600]  Geospatial intelligence has been about activity-based intelligence, mapping out the human domain.
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:05.320]  What are they doing now, right?
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:09.360]  As this thing was rolling out in China before it got to Italy, before they started doing
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:13.720]  the lockdown in Italy, you had mainstream media stories.
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:16.480]  As a matter of fact, I think it was AP or Reuters was saying, well, you know, this is
[1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:20.960]  kind of creepy when they're doing social distancing, but this is something that we're really going
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:25.360]  to need for this epidemic as it gets to the West.
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:29.760]  And that's exactly how they're rolling out all of these different aspects, these things
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:32.680]  that they've been preparing for for decades.
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:39.160]  And David, if you look at all this seamlessly being tied together, it's now being used to
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:44.240]  shut down mainstream, to shut down the average economy, to shut down mom and pops.
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:47.760]  This is a criminal takeover and obviously-
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:50.040]  Walmart is allowed to stay open, right?
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:55.080]  But the mom and pops had somebody write me and said, I'm a hairstylist and I'm supporting
[1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:57.920]  myself, but Walmart, right next to me, they're allowed to be open.
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:01.160]  I'm not allowed to be open because it's about eliminating the middle class because that's
[1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:02.240]  what the communists do.
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:06.640]  This universal basic income, this monthly check stuff that they've now gotten into a competition
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:10.600]  between Trump and the Republicans and the Democrats, who can give us some more money.
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:15.140]  This is about eviscerating you, making you a dependent on the government and then giving
[1:39:15.140 --> 1:39:19.880]  everybody the same amount of money, just communism writ large.
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:22.000]  Do we have that cone of shame clip ready?
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.480]  Okay, so let's talk about this.
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:26.480]  It's the perfect thing.
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:31.600]  Set up a control grid that's for terrorists that you finance and protect, then you use
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:32.840]  the anti-terrorism grid.
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:37.080]  They're using the Mossad against the Israelis right now and then they're using the big tech
[1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:41.720]  in Apple and Google merging with the new ID and they had it on local ABC News last night
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:42.720]  in Austin.
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:47.120]  Oh, this company working with Google and Apple, it can see when people are social distancing,
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:50.640]  people are doing a better job before Easter and we got an A plus in Austin.
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.320]  We got a C minus after that, people are going out when they're not supposed to and people
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:59.240]  are getting too close to other people, they're using your phones in live time.
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:05.680]  So just like the movie Up, this is a cone of shame like the dog is wearing and they're
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:07.320]  all laughing at him.
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:08.720]  They're just saying, will you wear it?
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:12.760]  And then when you don't wear the mask out in public, people get in your face, they don't
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:18.680]  let you in the store, they don't let you in the church and then next, if you don't hold
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:24.240]  up your iPhone or your droid next year showing you have the antibodies, you've had the inoculation
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:28.480]  with whatever it is, Milgates that you didn't want to put into you, well, then you can't
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:32.640]  come in the church, the Mark of the Beast, you can't buy, you can't sell and the church
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:36.360]  wants to stay open to say, sorry, you can't come in.
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:39.080]  So they're bringing us to heal right now.
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:40.080]  This is the takeover.
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:41.880]  We know how the book ends though.
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:42.880]  They're going to end up failing.
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:46.160]  They're going to have the world government for, you know, maybe a year, whenever this
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:49.960]  happens in 10 years, 20 years, a year from now, I mean, if we totally collapse, it'll
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:51.080]  be boom right here right now.
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:53.720]  So here's from the movie up with the cone of shame.
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:54.720]  Wear that mask.
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:55.720]  That's you.
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:56.720]  Why don't we do a stunt?
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:57.720]  He has lost the bird.
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:40:58.720]  Put him in the cone of shame.
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:40:59.720]  I do not like the cone of shit.
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.720]  Well, you know, that would work pretty good as a face mask, wouldn't it, Alex?
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:17.680]  Because, you know, it kind of, you know, moves the, oh, I'm going to go to stores as soon
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:23.240]  as I have time, like people do wearing paper bags, wear a gore mask and then when people
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:26.560]  get in my face about it, I'm going to go, Hey, you said wear a basket, plus I love
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:27.560]  the gloves.
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:28.560]  People don't know.
[1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:32.240]  If you work at the medical field, every time you finish a procedure or if you got to go
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:37.680]  out of the room to autoclave tools or get medicine for the doctor, you then pull gloves,
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:40.640]  rewash to go in.
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:44.520]  Gloves are even better at holding dirt and transmitting it and don't protect you.
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:45.520]  It's all theater.
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:46.520]  Oh yeah.
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:50.640]  I've had people write me say, you know, Hey, I was in a store and I didn't have a mask
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:54.960]  on and I had people yelling and cursing at me at another guy who's an engineer said,
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:56.160]  I've got hay fever.
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:02.320]  I sneezed and they whisked me off and tested me for COVID because he sneezed.
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:04.400]  I mean, this is what it's whisking you off.
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:05.400]  Yeah.
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:07.640]  You are a medical doctor in Germany said it's a hoax.
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:09.120]  This is a very weak virus.
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:10.120]  They arrested her.
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:11.120]  They put her to mental institution.
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:12.120]  Yeah.
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  Oh yeah.
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:14.120]  Yeah.
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:15.120]  It's, it's absolutely amazing.
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:19.680]  But you know, this is what it's come to and they've gotten the public so afraid that
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:21.160]  they are demanding this.
[1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:25.120]  And this is why people have people are getting into it because they're, they're followers.
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:29.520]  And now they've been told you have power, impact people until they submit.
[1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:33.080]  Let's come back, David and talk about the blockade of the States.
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:34.080]  Almost no announcement.
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:36.280]  It's like, oh, we're not going to reopen no matter what Trump does.
[1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:38.000]  This is criminal.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.520]  And this is where the federal government can come in with this intrastate.
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:44.200]  When states start linking up and telling the federal government what to do.
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:48.040]  Well now we've entered another wheelhouse and some of the left love states rights now,
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:51.040]  ladies and gentlemen, but we have a federalist system.
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:52.040]  If you can keep it.
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:56.560]  We'll be right back with David on Alex Jones in full wars.com.
[1:42:56.560 --> 1:43:01.280]  Well, communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy
[1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:05.040]  used by half and the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:10.120]  So guess what happened along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:13.280]  already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:17.800]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control and of course with the
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:23.360]  medical tyranny comes the force inoculations, a microchip that comes with the vaccine and
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:24.600]  so much more.
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:29.600]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:34.480]  So remember folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:37.360]  The same left that says kill babies all day long.
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:38.360]  Women own their bodies.
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.440]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:45.440]  If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home.
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:46.440]  Mark the beast.
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:47.440]  Oh, and guess what?
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:51.120]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates under a bunch
[1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:53.840]  of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:55.640]  They hate you and your family.
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:43:59.880]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[1:43:59.880 --> 1:44:05.640]  The success is simple, worse is that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:13.000]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.800]  to destroy all independent forms of media.
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:18.720]  They're trying to shudder and silence human resistance.
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:24.200]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:27.480]  and everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true.
[1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:30.240]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:35.360]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't, but it's up to all
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:39.240]  of us to not let them silence any of us.
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:45.280]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:50.080]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:51.080]  come.
[1:44:51.080 --> 1:45:16.280]  We're going to kill the economy and do it all at once the whole time they were setting
[1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:35.740]  it up with us.
[1:45:35.740 --> 1:46:00.060]  I'm here to tell you, I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job.
[1:46:00.060 --> 1:46:13.420]  I've done nothing but my duty. I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people and I've been fighting them for 13 years and I'll never stop while I'm growing breath.
[1:46:13.420 --> 1:46:25.020]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Info Wars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide, waking people up to the new world order.
[1:46:25.020 --> 1:46:40.380]  The Bohemian Grove, the American Deep State, the rise of Communist China, the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[1:46:40.380 --> 1:46:52.540]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues. Join us, support the Info War, and together we will slay the dragon.
[1:46:52.540 --> 1:46:59.420]  Keep fighting, Alex. You're the gladiator.
[1:46:59.420 --> 1:47:07.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:07.420 --> 1:47:32.220]  I've had a lot of very famous people call me in the government, in Hollywood, in the media, and they say, what's it like, Alex? Your stock's gone up.
[1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:39.740]  Everyone's marbling that you and your guests were dead on accurate. You must be feeling pretty good right now.
[1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:50.060]  And I say to them, is that a joke? You think I feel good about knowing about this attack plan and we fail to stop it?
[1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:56.700]  I feel like crap right now. I'm in the most horrible time of my life.
[1:47:56.700 --> 1:48:09.580]  We're losing everything we've got. The New World Order is launching the attack we predicted. This is their best plan for success, the medical theorem.
[1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:16.380]  And I'm not bitching at the listeners. I'm not bitching at those people that called me. But everything in the universe is not about how it individually affects you.
[1:48:16.380 --> 1:48:19.980]  I'm an individualist. I believe in personal freedom.
[1:48:19.980 --> 1:48:28.780]  But if you personally are doing great while everything else goes to hell, that's going to hurt your kids in yourself short term even, not long term.
[1:48:28.780 --> 1:48:36.700]  And it's this, this thinking of, well, I'm not being affected by a stock market crash. Why do I care when you will be affected by that?
[1:48:36.700 --> 1:48:47.020]  So I want to go back to David Knight. He'll be with us riding shotgun in the next hour with Dr. Francis Boyle, who agrees to the lockdown, but agrees a vaccine is ineffectual and a fraud.
[1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:54.620]  And this is a giant police state power grab. So that's a paradox there. He knew it was a bio weapon. He early on exposed it as that.
[1:48:54.620 --> 1:48:59.500]  So just because I agree with him on one thing on the other, we're not running a cult here.
[1:48:59.500 --> 1:49:11.980]  Now, let me show you from the World Health Organization, Rockefeller cult, a graphic put out in a composite from the World Health Organization and a whole bunch of other groups.
[1:49:11.980 --> 1:49:21.580]  It's on John Hopkins website. This is COVID-19, 128,000.9 deaths as of yesterday. I think it's 134,000 right now.
[1:49:21.580 --> 1:49:39.580]  Now let's look at Ebola, 11,000, Mears, 8,850, SARS, 770, yellow fever, 150K, swine flu, 200K, 600,000, 18th century great plagues, Japanese smallpox, 1 million.
[1:49:39.580 --> 1:49:51.060]  Let's scroll up though, HIV to present, 35 million. The third plague, 12 million. It goes on open. Oh, look, look up here.
[1:49:51.060 --> 1:50:00.220]  5.6 million smallpox outbreak, Spanish flu, 40, 50 million. That was 1918, 1919.
[1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:15.780]  Plague of justinane, 50 million. Let's keep going up here. So they can zoom in on that one little area, COVID-19 right here, and they've got your whole universe zoomed into this.
[1:50:15.780 --> 1:50:21.060]  Give up all your rights, never leave your house again, even though it'll cause a worldwide depression to start with hundreds of millions of death.
[1:50:21.060 --> 1:50:31.060]  The whole universe is that, and if you've got blinders on, that's all you're looking at is this, you think it's the end of the world. But see, that's how they control your perspective, perception management.
[1:50:31.060 --> 1:50:40.660]  You pull back, let's pull back and show the whole graph, because you think 50 million's dead's bad. Let's open the graph up and go to the top of the pyramid here.
[1:50:40.660 --> 1:50:57.460]  When you start going up this graph, put out by the UN itself, you see plagues that killed hundreds and hundreds of millions. And on this graph, COVID-19 is not visible to the naked eye.
[1:50:57.460 --> 1:51:05.980]  And this is for TV viewers, radio listeners. We're live right now at m4s.com, forward slash show, band dot video. We'll have this posted later.
[1:51:05.980 --> 1:51:16.220]  So everybody can see it as a radio listener, but just look at this. You've got all these plagues here. Look at this big daddy right here, 50 million Spanish flu.
[1:51:16.220 --> 1:51:34.020]  They're now in the news saying that this flu, look at the Russian flu, killed a million people, 1890. They're saying this is the worst thing to ever hit the planet, and we're at 130,000 down there, and it doesn't even show up to the naked eye.
[1:51:34.020 --> 1:51:44.020]  If you blow it up though, you can see it on screen. There it is right there for you. So David Knight, your take on this.
[1:51:44.020 --> 1:51:57.260]  Well, I'm looking at the Colorado 6th outbreak that began in the 19th century. And you know, out of that, and part of what happened with that was in London, they had a very bad public sewer system.
[1:51:57.260 --> 1:52:04.860]  And it was a scientist, a mathematician, FAR. That's where they came up with FAR's law. You hear everybody talking about flattening the curve?
[1:52:04.860 --> 1:52:09.340]  Well, he was the one who came up with the curve, and it was based on the cholera epidemic.
[1:52:09.340 --> 1:52:16.300]  And of course, one of the things that you could do to stop the cholera epidemic was to, you know, fix the sanitation system of...
[1:52:16.300 --> 1:52:27.660]  And for those that don't know, up until the 40s, disease went down to almost zero because we got sanitation. Vaccine comes in, a global graph from Australia to Germany, the U.S. Suddenly with vaccines, disease goes back up.
[1:52:27.660 --> 1:52:34.500]  Not the low before, but sanitation comes in. I mean, sewage is in your front yard. There aren't mosquitoes everywhere. You have screen doors.
[1:52:34.500 --> 1:52:37.900]  Goes down to almost zero, and then vaccines come in, and the 40s goes back up.
[1:52:37.900 --> 1:52:43.980]  Yeah. Well, talk about mosquitoes, talk about the Zika virus, which is what the last thing that Fauci was pimping.
[1:52:43.980 --> 1:52:51.260]  Go back to 2017. He was whining about the fact that he didn't get another $2 billion from the Republican Senate, and he said,
[1:52:51.260 --> 1:52:57.900]  you just wait. Coming up this summer, it's going to come back because you didn't give me the money, and everybody's going to be sick with Zika.
[1:52:57.900 --> 1:53:06.220]  That didn't happen. But we'll go back to the 1840s. Again, that curve, one of the reasons that FAR was saying for that is because, you know, as you start to develop herd immunity,
[1:53:06.220 --> 1:53:13.780]  it's going to come in when there's something new that comes in, a new disease. You're going to have the people who have other health issues, just as we're seeing now with COVID.
[1:53:13.780 --> 1:53:21.180]  They're going to be affected primarily and rapidly. So you're going to see a rapid ramp up of that. And then it's going to level off.
[1:53:21.180 --> 1:53:27.300]  And then it's going to drop as people get exposed to it, as the vulnerable are taken out. That's just the way.
[1:53:27.300 --> 1:53:32.100]  Well, let's do a document cam shot right here for TV viewers. Ready? Let's just all describe it. Look at this.
[1:53:32.100 --> 1:53:40.860]  Stanford professor claims coronavirus death rate likely orders of magnitude lower orders of magnitude explained for people that aren't into mathematics with science.
[1:53:40.860 --> 1:53:48.340]  Orders of magnitude means exponential or logarithmic. Explain it's logarithmic is order of magnitude is times 10.
[1:53:48.340 --> 1:53:56.020]  So each order of magnitude is going to be times 10. So there's two orders of magnitude is going to be 100 times lower, which is exactly what they're looking at.
[1:53:56.020 --> 1:54:03.740]  But when you look at these numbers, now they're looking at it and saying, well, it's kind of looking like a regular flu in terms of its fatality rates.
[1:54:03.740 --> 1:54:09.100]  One of the things that they did to jack up these fatality rates, they would estimate the number of cases for flu.
[1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:13.060]  And we've seen this for flu. They've been jacking up flu, trying to get people to take a flu vaccine.
[1:54:13.060 --> 1:54:19.060]  So they would estimate up the number of cases of flu. Sure, they use people to die of something else. Here it is.
[1:54:19.060 --> 1:54:24.660]  So let's look at these numbers. So now they're now they're pivoting and you're seeing the flu desk go down dramatically.
[1:54:24.660 --> 1:54:34.660]  You're seeing they're counting those now in the column of COVID-19 just came out with new guidelines saying, hey, if somebody had a respiratory issue, if they died of a heart attack, if they died of something.
[1:54:34.660 --> 1:54:42.220]  Rick admits that every death of anybody that tests positive, whether it's a heart attack or anything, is counted as that. She admits that on the stand.
[1:54:42.220 --> 1:54:48.620]  Oh, yeah. And it gets worse. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It gets worse because they're now admitting that most of the positives are for regular coronaviruses.
[1:54:48.620 --> 1:54:54.740]  That's right. You look at the doctor who is also a state senator in Minnesota, he said, look at the incentivization of this, right?
[1:54:54.740 --> 1:55:04.620]  It's not the individual doctors who are doing this because I just talked about a Texas doctor who stopped a nursing home from becoming another one of these hot spots like they did in Washington to get that out.
[1:55:04.620 --> 1:55:11.700]  And he said, look, I gave everybody a hydroxychloroquine. I asked him, I had 50 some odd patients and 36 of them said, well, that's another big tell.
[1:55:11.700 --> 1:55:21.260]  Nobody had any side effects. Everybody got well. That's another big tell. They didn't want anybody to have hope or know about zinc or vitamin D3 or vitamin K or vitamin A.
[1:55:21.260 --> 1:55:23.900]  Or C. Yeah. They didn't want you to know about. They didn't want you to have any hope.
[1:55:23.900 --> 1:55:26.340]  Or stem cells, even stem cells.
[1:55:26.340 --> 1:55:38.060]  We got to go to break. We're going to come back, but I just want to tell us or something. People are like, okay, then why are you pushing supplements? Everybody needs winter sun, 50% off vitamin D and K period.
[1:55:38.060 --> 1:55:45.420]  Everybody needs vitamin, mineral fusion, 50% off. Everybody needs X3 about to sell out. Very close to selling out 60% off.
[1:55:45.420 --> 1:55:51.180]  Look into X3. Look into good, clean, high quality iodine and the major deficiencies that are out there.
[1:55:51.180 --> 1:56:06.140]  But here's what you really need. You need storable food. And I'm a guy that's all offense. I've now capitulated and, you know, I'm building the armored redoubt because, I mean, if this communist takeover wins, I mean, we're hell on earth about to happen.
[1:56:06.140 --> 1:56:16.540]  So I'm already getting with veterans and the family and all the patriots and we're digging in folks. So I think we're going to beat this, but 70% chance, 30% chance it's all going down.
[1:56:16.540 --> 1:56:19.620]  Hell on earth. Just get ready and you guard yourself for true.
[1:56:19.620 --> 1:56:28.980]  Storable food is available. Again, infowarstore.com. All the other distributors are lying to you. We have the biggest. We have the best because the other places can't be trusted.
[1:56:28.980 --> 1:56:36.940]  They're the biggest and the best because they do what they say they're going to do. They had to pause sales because they wanted to open more factories and get all the orders out on time or before.
[1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:43.780]  Now they've been able to do that. And they are actually ahead of schedule. Though they said, please don't say it. I had to convince them. I said, just admit you're a few weeks ahead.
[1:56:43.780 --> 1:56:51.780]  They go, well, a few orders, we might be right on time, but we are way ahead. It's really four weeks. But don't tell them that. And I said, let me tell them four to six weeks instead of seven.
[1:56:51.780 --> 1:56:57.860]  OK, because people want to know this. It doesn't matter. With what's going down, you'll get the food. This is going to take a month to collapse stuff.
[1:56:57.860 --> 1:57:03.340]  Who knows what they're going to run during this crisis where masks for the rest of the year try to keep the economy from reopening.
[1:57:03.340 --> 1:57:10.820]  They got the Democrats blockading the east and west coast. We have folks in Utah and Colorado and other key states.
[1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:15.340]  They don't miss it, where all the factories are with patriots that knew this was coming ready to get you the food.
[1:57:15.340 --> 1:57:24.500]  But you got to get the orders in now. Food is now available again, infowarstore.com or triple A to five, three, three, one, three, nine and spread the word about info wars now.
[1:57:24.500 --> 1:57:35.420]  I'll be honest with you. If we don't turn the corner very soon, it's not about finances here. They are going to start wiping the patriots out and they've already got the head teams ready.
[1:57:35.420 --> 1:57:43.700]  I'm not folks, you know, I don't just say stuff for no reason. America is fighting for its life right now. If you don't spread these links, I'm telling you, you're aiding the enemy.
[1:58:05.820 --> 1:58:22.540]  Similar to other mix in energy packets, turbo force from info wars life utilizes vitamins, amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus, clarity and a boost of energy when you need it.
[1:58:22.540 --> 1:58:37.060]  Turbo force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable and tasty energy. And speaking of affordable, you can even try turbo force for a limited time at an incredible 40% off.
[1:58:37.060 --> 1:59:00.340]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get turbo force right now only at infowarstore.com and all of a sudden the trap snaps inside hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years going back to the Magna Carta in 1215 of hard fought basic human dignity and liberty.
[1:59:00.340 --> 1:59:10.100]  And believing that the individual was sovereign and had basic, unenable rights has been absolutely erased just in March.
[1:59:10.100 --> 1:59:28.580]  And the Communist Chinese have been our teachers and big tech has been our controllers. We're all being introduced now in the digital straight jacket that depends on us complying with it and depends on us all in pecking each other into submission.
[1:59:28.580 --> 1:59:43.460]  But for all of you out there that have decided to go along with this, mark your calendars down and then a few months, a few years, look at the world. Remember, you did this. You were the prisoners, you were the slaves, you were the people that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you.
[1:59:43.460 --> 1:59:59.380]  Pass for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[2:00:13.460 --> 2:00:34.420]  All right, coming up next segment, Dr. Francis Boyle who's on record saying it's a man made bio weapon that he believed leaked out of the lab. Well, now that's the official story AP all of we haven't gotten to all that.
[2:00:34.420 --> 2:00:51.460]  This is so huge. And you'll be riding shotgun with us for a little bit longer here. David Knight, David, the Democrat governor say, we're not reopening anything. They're doing that for economic devastation. They're also pushing their forced inoculation.
[2:00:51.460 --> 2:00:58.180]  They're now admitting that this is the ingredients for civil war. What do you expect to see coming next?
[2:00:58.180 --> 2:01:02.980]  Well, I think what's going to happen next is we're going to see we've been talking about how the TSA was going to roll out to the road.
[2:01:02.980 --> 2:01:16.180]  Right. This is also part of the plan. We pointed out TSA was not the airport security administration. It's the transportation security. And years ago, when I first started here at Info Wars, they had the Viper teams.
[2:01:16.180 --> 2:01:24.340]  Remember that where they were shaking people down at the bus stations and so forth. Now they're talking about having tests and President Trump flow the idea.
[2:01:24.340 --> 2:01:37.780]  Well, maybe governors will do tests at the border of their states for people coming in and out. Now, what they're going to do is as they shut this down, this is an opportunity for us to use the Commerce Clause, the way it was really supposed to be used, in my opinion.
[2:01:37.780 --> 2:01:52.540]  The Commerce Clause has been abused. It was abused by FDR to force price controls interior into the inside of the states during the Depression, and it's been used to try to justify the war on drugs, even though they don't have the authority under the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[2:01:52.540 --> 2:02:03.500]  They say, well, we got the Commerce Clause, but we could use the Commerce Clause the way it was intended, which is to make sure that you're not going to have border controls for transportation, that you're not going to have border controls for goods.
[2:02:03.500 --> 2:02:15.580]  When we locked down the economy, we've now got two problems, not one. We've got a disease, and I don't think that this disease is as serious as it appeared to be initially.
[2:02:15.580 --> 2:02:30.460]  I think we're seeing manipulation of the statistics as we have them saying, you're going to count these as deaths. Instead, if you haven't even tested them, and so we see the deaths going up by 10,000 in New York, at the same time, Cuomo is saying, well, you know, we missed it by 100 percent.
[2:02:30.460 --> 2:02:42.380]  He tells that, Giuliani, we had that story on infowars.com a couple of days ago. We missed it by 100 percent. It's kind of like a weather forecast. No, they didn't miss it by 100 percent. They missed it by anywhere from 200 percent to 4,000 percent.
[2:02:42.380 --> 2:02:52.700]  They overestimated the hospital beds by two times to 10 times on a state-by-state basis. The number of ventilators that they estimated they would need, they overestimated that by a factor of 40.
[2:02:52.700 --> 2:03:03.900]  So this is not even a 100 percent miss. And yet, at the same time, they're trying to jack up the deaths by saying, we're going to count these as deaths, even if we haven't tested the people for COVID.
[2:03:03.900 --> 2:03:15.380]  We don't even know that they died. They got multiple issues or old as well. And then, oh, they also had COVID. So we'll make that the underlying cause. Now they're stepping it up by saying, we're not even sure that they had COVID.
[2:03:15.380 --> 2:03:28.020]  And they've been doing this with the flu for a long time, estimating up the number of cases, estimating up the number of deaths, and then they manipulated the data to show the COVID was going to kill everybody with a higher fatality rate.
[2:03:28.020 --> 2:03:39.620]  Guys, please minimize that. Thank you. And they tried to minimize it. They tried to maximize the fatality rate and then get everybody afraid about the lethality of it and then tell everybody now you're all going to get it.
[2:03:39.620 --> 2:03:49.820]  That's what's got everybody so panicked. That's what has everybody begging for the government to save them. But if we shut everything down, Alex, we are heading into a great depression.
[2:03:49.820 --> 2:03:58.620]  And the only way we're going to get out of this greater depression is with a world war. That's exactly what they want. They want to melt down the society. They want to impose communism on us.
[2:03:58.620 --> 2:04:06.700]  They want to destroy the middle classes. Why? I've shut down. There's no doubt that they're using this for power and control.
[2:04:06.700 --> 2:04:19.060]  But at the same time, the reason I was concerned about it is it's clearly manmade. It came out of the weapons lab. That's confirmed. So who's behind that? And we do know it is killing people.
[2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:28.300]  And so there's a lot going on here. And I respect you. And I think you've been vindicated on the fact that they're definitely trying to hype us up for a power grab.
[2:04:28.300 --> 2:04:39.900]  The question is, what's coming next in all this? And we're going to have Dr. Francis Boyle coming up with us here today. And I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:04:39.900 --> 2:04:47.420]  And we've been really just amazingly on target with our guests with all of this. But there's a paradox here.
[2:04:47.420 --> 2:04:54.300]  Yes, they've hyped up the virus to take our rights. But the collapse is the real issue. Yeah.
[2:04:54.300 --> 2:05:05.540]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight. If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[2:05:05.540 --> 2:05:18.340]  But you get that. You are patriots. You are people that live and work in the real world of a race, color, creed, and understand what's happening. And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke. Thank you for what you've done.
[2:05:18.340 --> 2:05:27.460]  We're all of this together. We believe in the rights of the unborn. We believe in families. We believe in the right to self defense. We believe in capitalism and America and Jesus Christ, number one.
[2:05:27.460 --> 2:05:36.260]  And we believe in free speech. And so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world.
[2:05:36.260 --> 2:06:04.740]  That's why I salute you. And I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewed up by now. They thought they'd be in charge. They thought they would want, but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together. So God bless you.
[2:06:04.740 --> 2:06:18.180]  In the intelligence community, a limited hangout is the deliberate revelation of some information about malfeasance to try to confuse and or prevent discovery of other information.
[2:06:18.180 --> 2:06:41.940]  In a recent Daily Mail article, the Communist Chinese admit after four months of denial that the COVID-19 virus resulted from work being done in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and was paid for by the U.S. National Institute of Health, run by none other than Anthony Fauci during the Obama administration.
[2:06:41.940 --> 2:07:01.540]  In the article, the CCP admits to harvesting their bats from a single cave in Yunnan, China, thereby vindicating the work of Indian researchers who scanned its genome and found evidence that COVID-19 is a manmade hybrid, also known as a chimera virus.
[2:07:01.540 --> 2:07:17.460]  Controversy sparked in 2015 over the creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus at the University of North Carolina, and a moratorium was enacted to end gain of function research in the United States.
[2:07:17.460 --> 2:07:38.500]  Gain of function research involves genetically increasing the transmissibility of deadly pathogens. Immediately following this moratorium, the Obama administration and the National Institute of Health under Dr. Anthony Fauci outsourced the work to the Wuhan Virology Lab in China.
[2:07:38.500 --> 2:07:50.900]  The NIH awarded $3.7 million in research grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain of function coronavirus experimentation on bats.
[2:07:50.900 --> 2:08:04.580]  The Wuhan Institute lists the NIH as a partner, as well as the University of Alabama, the University of North Texas, Harvard University, and the National Wildlife Federation.
[2:08:04.580 --> 2:08:34.260]  The CCP still claims that it was an accident, suggesting that the innocent bat experiments may have gotten out of control, but the admission is that COVID-19 came from the Wuhan laboratory and it was paid for and directed by Anthony Fauci and the NIH, the very same Fauci who is now suggesting extended lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations in the United States.
[2:08:34.260 --> 2:08:57.380]  As the world increasingly blames China for the COVID-19 virus, the CCP has fired a not-so-subtle warning shot across the bow of their American deep state accomplices. A massive war with China could potentially make all talk of deep state corruption vanish.
[2:08:57.380 --> 2:09:08.660]  Reporting for infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:25.940]  Look at those DrudgeReports.com headlines, airline test blood before you fly, immunity passports, New York state shut until May 15th, and you know they're going to expand it after that. Wall Street to Trump, keep it closed, but China is opening back up.
[2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:38.900]  You know, I have this little stuffed animal here that I bought at a gas station yesterday, driving back to Austin, because I was having to finally build a retreat route in case they turn off the lights.
[2:09:38.900 --> 2:09:56.580]  And I just thought, you know, the Chai Kong Dragons told over 100 million people, so Hitler was responsible probably for the deaths of 50 million people, so he'd be a little dragon half this size, installing a little bit smaller. You know, Mao, Mao's the biggest killer in the Chinese comics the world's ever seen.
[2:09:56.580 --> 2:10:10.900]  So it's not a cute little dragon here. This is very serious. We can joke around about this all day. And I know Professor Foyles, the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law, a lot of that got adopted in the world law. He prosecuted his dictators like Solomon Milozovic.
[2:10:10.900 --> 2:10:16.900]  He's represented major countries at the U.N. as their official representative.
[2:10:16.900 --> 2:10:33.700]  And we can agree, disagree about different facets of this, but where you and David have been dead on, David Knight here with us, a talk show host with the David Knight Show Weekday Mornings, 8 a.m. here at M4s, is that this was man-made, this was out of Wuhan, and that it now leaked.
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:39.780]  AP has the documents, Daily Mail has the documents. I said over the weekend, the fact this is happening shows a limited hangout.
[2:10:39.780 --> 2:10:48.420]  This is huge under international law that the head of the World Health Organization got caught lying, blocking, it's being reported.
[2:10:48.420 --> 2:10:56.980]  This is just such huge news, folks. It's all admitted now to saying that it didn't come out of the lab when it did, running interference.
[2:10:56.980 --> 2:11:07.220]  This is huge. So we have an expert, probably we say the expert on law internationally and nationally on this, and how big a development this is that it's gone from the back burner.
[2:11:07.220 --> 2:11:18.340]  Here in the fever swamps, as they call them, of inflores, all the real experts, from the wilderness now to the front page, what does this port tend for the world?
[2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:21.460]  Dr. Boyle, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:35.380]  Alex, thank you so much for having me on, and my congratulations to David Knight on his return to the show. I think this is the first time I've had the pleasure to speak with him.
[2:11:35.380 --> 2:11:43.060]  Well, I mean, we're not here to toot each other's horns, but I mean, you were dead on about North Carolina Chapel Hill. David's from there down the street from it.
[2:11:43.060 --> 2:11:49.540]  Gain of function, Fauci saying, you know, war criminal, we're actually seeing the guy behind it up there on TV.
[2:11:49.540 --> 2:11:54.180]  And then why did China release it? Was it an accident? You think it's so devastating. It was an accident.
[2:11:54.180 --> 2:12:00.020]  I see the timing at the end of this trade war, the deep state wanting to kill our economy. I think it's just as plausible that they did it on purpose.
[2:12:00.020 --> 2:12:06.420]  But just what is it like for you now nine weeks later after you came on the show, totally vindicated?
[2:12:06.420 --> 2:12:11.780]  And what what they're saying with these documents that the UN helped cover this up?
[2:12:11.780 --> 2:12:17.380]  Well, they're still trying to cover it up if you follow it carefully.
[2:12:17.380 --> 2:12:24.740]  Now we have what your reporter somewhere in there called a limited hangout, which we're familiar with.
[2:12:24.740 --> 2:12:36.340]  Fox News is saying, Oh, well, China was just trying to keep up with us in terms of scientific and medical endeavor.
[2:12:36.340 --> 2:12:44.980]  That's total full twaddle, Alex. This Wuhan BSL form was China's Fort Dietrich.
[2:12:44.980 --> 2:12:52.500]  It was their first Fort Dietrich. Everyone knows it. It was there for the purpose.
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:58.260]  And you said nine weeks ago they wanted to compete with America and show they could do it, but didn't have proper controls.
[2:12:58.260 --> 2:13:02.660]  Now the Pentagon officially said that word for word today.
[2:13:02.660 --> 2:13:15.700]  Right. This is a biological warfare factory. It is there for research, development, testing, stockpile of the most dangerous biological warfare weapons.
[2:13:15.700 --> 2:13:22.980]  You can possibly imagine two human beings. And that is what we are dealing with.
[2:13:22.980 --> 2:13:30.980]  It has, as I've said before, it has SARS, which is already a weaponized coronavirus.
[2:13:30.980 --> 2:13:39.540]  And that was done over in China, setting off the SARS pandemic there when it leaked one of their BSL threes.
[2:13:39.540 --> 2:13:45.140]  It has gained a function work that we know from the University of North Carolina.
[2:13:45.140 --> 2:13:51.860]  It has HIV in there. We know from that scientific article I discussed with you,
[2:13:51.860 --> 2:13:56.180]  with the Australia Health Board and Wuhan BSL IV.
[2:13:56.180 --> 2:14:05.140]  HIV was DNA genetically engineered into that. That was confirmed by the Indian scientists that HIV...
[2:14:05.140 --> 2:14:09.700]  And by the way, in the now officially the government's investigating Wuhan as a criminal action.
[2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:15.620]  So quantifying this, how big is this?
[2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:28.580]  Well, you know, Alex, just in terms of the human death here, it's astounding where this could lead if it is not properly handled.
[2:14:28.580 --> 2:14:36.900]  With all due respect to David, this is at a minimum SARS on steroids.
[2:14:36.900 --> 2:14:42.820]  And the resality rate of SARS already documented is 15 percent.
[2:14:42.820 --> 2:14:45.940]  Well, let's talk about it when we come back for a break. Because here's the deal.
[2:14:45.940 --> 2:14:48.820]  We have to take it serious because it came out of a bioweapons lab.
[2:14:48.820 --> 2:14:52.020]  And it does kill old people. We can discuss why it doesn't kill young people.
[2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:55.780]  Usually we'd have an autoimmune response. You're an expert on that. We'll both talk about that.
[2:14:55.780 --> 2:14:59.780]  And absolutely. But I think you agree, doctor, when we come back and talk about this,
[2:14:59.780 --> 2:15:03.700]  regardless that they're part of the power structure and the very medical tyranny
[2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:07.940]  that you say should hang from a lamppost, they're power grabbing out of this.
[2:15:07.940 --> 2:15:10.420]  So that's a very complex paradox.
[2:15:10.420 --> 2:15:16.340]  That is absolutely correct that the establishment, the medical,
[2:15:16.340 --> 2:15:24.020]  economic, all the doubles crowd of globalonious are jumping on this for all it's worth
[2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:31.300]  to push their own agenda. And so we have to, in my opinion, we have to separate that out
[2:15:31.300 --> 2:15:33.940]  from the danger that we truly do face.
[2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:37.060]  Sure. And just like you did, you know, pointing out the vaccine's pointless.
[2:15:37.060 --> 2:15:42.260]  It's a joke. Everybody admits that. But still, it's a real virus that does kill some people.
[2:15:42.260 --> 2:15:45.140]  And it's just insane. We'll be right back with both. We'll get David to take on this.
[2:15:45.140 --> 2:16:11.140]  We have Dr. Boyle with us as well. We're really honored to have him stay with us.
[2:16:11.140 --> 2:16:16.500]  If we've learned anything from China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns
[2:16:16.500 --> 2:16:22.260]  are just a few days away here in the U.S. Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce,
[2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:27.380]  you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one acre crisis garden.
[2:16:27.380 --> 2:16:32.740]  The truth is growing nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most
[2:16:32.740 --> 2:16:38.660]  important thing you do. Go to survivalseabank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature

[2:18:56.820 --> 2:19:02.100]  them under siege? Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself
[2:19:02.100 --> 2:19:07.860]  cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the
[2:19:07.860 --> 2:19:12.100]  populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[2:19:12.820 --> 2:19:17.780]  Bill Ma or even admitted it, man, I hope we have a depression. Now they've tailored the whole thing
[2:19:18.340 --> 2:19:23.540]  where the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the
[2:19:23.540 --> 2:19:29.380]  help of the blue states and blue states all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism
[2:19:29.380 --> 2:19:34.900]  for the depression it creates. If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us. But as for
[2:19:34.900 --> 2:19:39.860]  me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it. It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure
[2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:44.660]  that they're the good people keeping everybody safe. But that's not what they're doing. They are
[2:19:44.660 --> 2:19:50.500]  pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole
[2:19:50.500 --> 2:20:06.420]  world and committing millions of third world people to death. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:09.780 --> 2:20:13.460]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:13.460 --> 2:20:19.380]  I gotta tell you, David Knight is a smart engineer, great talk show host,
[2:20:19.380 --> 2:20:24.260]  Dr. Boyle's a prestigious lawyer and bio weapons expert and wrote the US law on bio weapons.
[2:20:25.540 --> 2:20:29.220]  And I'm listening to these guys during the four minute break and they sound like captains on a
[2:20:29.220 --> 2:20:34.020]  ship that's going down trying to save people. I mean, this is not a joke, folks. Okay, what's
[2:20:34.020 --> 2:20:38.420]  happened with the economy shutting it down is going to kill millions of bio weapons out. They
[2:20:38.420 --> 2:20:42.820]  now admit it's out. They now admit it leaked out of China. Dr. Boyle's very conservative. He's like,
[2:20:42.820 --> 2:20:47.940]  well, I can't imagine they released this on purpose, but clearly, you know, it leaked out of
[2:20:47.940 --> 2:20:53.140]  the lab. Well, now they're admitting it leaked out of the lab. And this is how wars start. So
[2:20:53.940 --> 2:21:00.660]  I've never felt more. I'm very energized because this is so serious. I've never been this energized.
[2:21:00.660 --> 2:21:05.940]  But I'm also feel like desperation, like we should be doing something. So I asked Dr. Boyle,
[2:21:05.940 --> 2:21:10.580]  you said, well, what should we do? Who gets prosecuted? Because when I watched Fauci nine
[2:21:10.580 --> 2:21:16.820]  weeks ago, Dr. Boyle and you separately on air reporting on NIH and the Chapel Hill and the
[2:21:16.820 --> 2:21:22.660]  scientist article and the research and now they confirm that and more and chopping up the bats
[2:21:22.660 --> 2:21:26.900]  and feeding it to the piglets and the piglets dying. They feed it to more piglets and you
[2:21:26.900 --> 2:21:31.860]  and like this is what they're telling us about. Clearly China released that last week to say,
[2:21:31.860 --> 2:21:37.780]  Hey, don't blame us. We'll blame Fauci and the NIH. Well, as you said nine weeks ago, Dr. Boyle,
[2:21:37.780 --> 2:21:42.740]  Trump must cut Fauci and all of them loose and explain. I didn't know and they just need to get
[2:21:42.740 --> 2:21:48.100]  arrested. Instead, they're the ones up there running the response, which I didn't have no confidence
[2:21:48.100 --> 2:21:54.180]  in Dr. Boyle. They're going to get us all killed. Alex, if they keep going the way they're going,
[2:21:54.180 --> 2:22:00.420]  you're you're exactly correct. I don't know what else to say. So you you literally nailed it exactly
[2:22:00.420 --> 2:22:03.700]  nine weeks ago. How did you do it? I mean, I know you're going to say research papers. This is
[2:22:03.700 --> 2:22:13.780]  what I do. But how did you nail it? Well, I did some basic research when the first reports of a
[2:22:14.580 --> 2:22:23.300]  strange pneumonia like disease came out of China. I looked into it and it let me just say I've been
[2:22:23.860 --> 2:22:31.700]  doing this work professionally since 1983 or four when the council for responsible genetics
[2:22:31.700 --> 2:22:37.140]  invited me from they're basically Harvard MIT people. My buddies there at Harvard and life
[2:22:37.140 --> 2:22:45.060]  sciences asked me to get involved and handle biological warfare work. So whenever some strange
[2:22:45.060 --> 2:22:53.860]  exotic disease breaks out somewhere with no explanation, I immediately try to look into it
[2:22:53.860 --> 2:23:00.180]  and see, well, is there a is that Congress came to you out of all the people and said write our
[2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:09.940]  bio weapon law? Well, we went to Congress. The council I well, I was invited by the council
[2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:20.900]  for responsible genetics to give a briefing on Capitol Hill in 1985 on the Reagan administration's
[2:23:21.940 --> 2:23:29.700]  biological weapons program, including the use of DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological
[2:23:29.700 --> 2:23:38.500]  weapons. And let me point out, it was exactly at that time under Reagan's neocons that Fauci was
[2:23:38.500 --> 2:23:44.020]  appointed to work for Reagan. And that's key because Cheney said even at that time,
[2:23:45.300 --> 2:23:50.740]  it was an LL limster idea from 20 years before, they were dreaming up the deployment of race
[2:23:50.740 --> 2:23:56.820]  specific bio weapons, which decades later in 2001 and rebuilding America's defense is PNAC,
[2:23:56.820 --> 2:24:02.660]  they admit it. They admitted it there. That's exactly correct. So Fauci was put in there
[2:24:03.220 --> 2:24:09.940]  right at the time I got involved to counteract what Fauci was doing at NIAID. And indeed that
[2:24:09.940 --> 2:24:16.660]  whole purpose of NIAID that there was a New York Times article several years ago saying 95% of this,
[2:24:17.460 --> 2:24:24.260]  I would say Nazi biological warfare work comes out of NIAID and Fauci, who was put in there by
[2:24:24.260 --> 2:24:30.660]  the neocons to do this type of work. And so skip ahead, why in the hell, under Obama,
[2:24:30.660 --> 2:24:35.220]  do they give gain of function as a national scandal, as you pointed out, to them. And now
[2:24:35.220 --> 2:24:42.820]  China's blaming what what is going on there? Well, this is a case what what we law professors
[2:24:42.820 --> 2:24:48.740]  and lawyers call joint and several responsibility. They're, they're both responsible on both sides.
[2:24:48.740 --> 2:24:57.460]  There's no question about it. China wanted to have its own fourth Dietrich. And our
[2:24:59.060 --> 2:25:05.060]  death scientists were more than happy to help them. These people I, you know, outside, I want to make
[2:25:05.060 --> 2:25:11.860]  it clear, I'm not using the word trees in here, because that has a definite meaning in the US
[2:25:11.860 --> 2:25:17.860]  Constitution and federal criminal law is originally hired here to teach criminal law for several years.
[2:25:17.860 --> 2:25:23.460]  But these people are traders, outright traders, these Americans involved in this,
[2:25:23.460 --> 2:25:27.620]  they are traders to the United States of America. Sure. What about the exactly the
[2:25:27.620 --> 2:25:31.860]  head biologist at Harvard? I mean, I'm not a guy that's into the death penalty. But I mean,
[2:25:31.860 --> 2:25:35.140]  what what that? Why did he get arrested right when all this started? Because David Knight,
[2:25:35.140 --> 2:25:37.860]  back in January, pointed out that he thought this was connected to it, is it?
[2:25:37.860 --> 2:25:48.180]  I think it is. Yes. Because as you see, Harvard was a sponsor of that Wuhan BSL4,
[2:25:48.180 --> 2:25:57.620]  your associate just had it on there, right? And in addition, then, this Harvard let the chair
[2:25:57.620 --> 2:26:04.180]  of their chemistry department to go over to Wuhan to set up his own laboratory in Wuhan.
[2:26:04.180 --> 2:26:09.940]  Well, this chair of the notion that Harvard didn't know that's just a cover story. Of
[2:26:09.940 --> 2:26:14.180]  course, Harvard, no, I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees from Harvard.
[2:26:14.180 --> 2:26:19.060]  Exactly. You were the special passenger PhD. So what was their thinking? Purely money from
[2:26:19.060 --> 2:26:23.780]  the Chai comms? Well, yeah, Harvard covered it up the first time the FBI asked some questions for
[2:26:23.780 --> 2:26:28.820]  it. I mean, you know, yeah, exactly. Harvard covered it up. And they were paying, you know,
[2:26:28.820 --> 2:26:35.220]  this is outright greed. You know, it's the statement that, you know, capitalists will sell
[2:26:35.220 --> 2:26:40.420]  the world. Let me ask you this, Dr. Andy Davis, we got a break here in a few minutes.
[2:26:41.620 --> 2:26:45.540]  What does President Trump need to do? I think, as you said last week, he should level with
[2:26:45.540 --> 2:26:51.460]  the American people. What does leveling look like? Well, I did want to finish this point
[2:26:51.460 --> 2:27:02.100]  because he is a specialist in nanotechnology. And it was already reported that over in Wuhan,
[2:27:02.100 --> 2:27:09.380]  he was applying nanotechnology to chemical matters and biological matter. So I suspect
[2:27:09.380 --> 2:27:16.420]  that what happened here was that he applied nanotechnology to what later became COVID.
[2:27:16.420 --> 2:27:23.220]  That is why that MIT scientists determined that it could travel 27 feet in the air.
[2:27:23.220 --> 2:27:30.020]  That's why it's so infectious. It's so small. It's nanotechnology, as well as everything
[2:27:30.020 --> 2:27:34.100]  else together. And we don't charge with because the latest thing I saw from the Justice Department
[2:27:34.100 --> 2:27:38.820]  is they're not saying why is that secret or your criminal lawyer? What do you think?
[2:27:38.820 --> 2:27:45.860]  It's being covered up. Sure. There's no question all about it. Just like the anthrax attacks
[2:27:46.580 --> 2:27:50.340]  coming out of Fort Detrick were covered up by the FBI and the Department of Justice.
[2:27:50.340 --> 2:27:52.500]  All right, we'll come back then and talk about what you think Trump needs to do
[2:27:52.500 --> 2:27:55.060]  and get David Knight's take on that. But let me ask you this, Dr. Polo, 50 seconds left.
[2:27:56.980 --> 2:28:03.300]  Well, I think, first of all, I don't even know if this has been explained to President Trump
[2:28:03.300 --> 2:28:09.300]  because everyone he has around him are liars and they're up to their eyeballs in this Nazi
[2:28:09.300 --> 2:28:17.860]  biological warfare work. Someone needs to sit down like I did with you and go through in detail
[2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:24.820]  with President Trump about how dangerous this is, okay? Existentially dangerous.
[2:28:24.820 --> 2:28:28.260]  Well, yeah, Bricks and Fauci are literally Gates minions.
[2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:35.300]  Yeah. Let's come right back to Dr. Boyle and David Knight with his questions.
[2:28:35.300 --> 2:28:40.260]  And we'll talk about this, folks. I have four children. I know a lot of you do as well.
[2:28:40.820 --> 2:28:43.540]  And I just want to explain to everybody. I know you already know this.
[2:28:44.100 --> 2:28:47.940]  It's not just depression we're facing. If it comes out trying to do this on purpose,
[2:28:47.940 --> 2:28:51.700]  we're going to war. That's what David Knight was warning about. We'll talk about that when we come back.
[2:28:53.140 --> 2:28:57.700]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:57.700 --> 2:29:01.460]  You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:01.460 --> 2:29:08.020]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:08.020 --> 2:29:13.140]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.140 --> 2:29:18.340]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:18.340 --> 2:29:24.180]  you need to call the national treatment advisors. They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to
[2:29:24.180 --> 2:29:29.940]  replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life. And if you have PPO,
[2:29:29.940 --> 2:29:35.300]  private health insurance, the entire program may be covered. Fix your problem right now
[2:29:35.300 --> 2:29:39.940]  before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[2:29:39.940 --> 2:29:54.980]  800-506-6740. 800-506-6740. That's 800-506-6740.
[2:30:10.100 --> 2:30:17.060]  Crap. Force-fed at you and your family. So stay at home, you dirty filthy Americans.
[2:30:17.060 --> 2:30:23.540]  China's open for business. You aren't. And watch open satanic rituals with Lady Gaga and all these
[2:30:23.540 --> 2:30:29.940]  other losers stumbling around. Again, force-fed to you and your family. It's all for one world,
[2:30:29.940 --> 2:30:36.660]  at home, the carbon tax. You're shut down. Your way of life has been canceled. By the globalists,
[2:30:36.660 --> 2:30:41.780]  they're coming with forced inoculations, implantable microchips, and total medical
[2:30:41.780 --> 2:30:47.860]  tyranny to take over your life. You are now non-essential. You are now non-essential.
[2:30:47.860 --> 2:30:51.860]  The new owner got you where they want you, and now they're going to slowly kill you
[2:30:51.860 --> 2:30:58.260]  and suck all the money out of you. Was only four months ago that I warned President Trump
[2:30:58.260 --> 2:31:06.980]  and the American people that Cobra would never stand for you resisting our takeover. There is
[2:31:06.980 --> 2:31:15.460]  no limit to which we will not stoop to make you bow via the fear that is innate in your hearts.
[2:31:16.180 --> 2:31:24.020]  It was I, the leader of Cobra, that foresaw your inoculations, and how much you would enjoy
[2:31:24.020 --> 2:31:30.340]  watching Netflix and wearing masks and gloves when you went out to feel all important like you
[2:31:30.340 --> 2:31:37.780]  were in a war. When the real target of Cobra was always the billions of people at the edge of
[2:31:37.780 --> 2:31:44.980]  starvation who were about dying at the tune of over a million people every three weeks.
[2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:52.580]  Cobra thanks you for watching time. Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet.
[2:31:52.580 --> 2:31:58.740]  Hail Cobra. Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars can now offer high-quality storeable food again.
[2:31:59.620 --> 2:32:05.380]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago, and they told people they had food. Most
[2:32:05.380 --> 2:32:11.860]  folks never were delivered their food. Well, when our sponsors food began to run short,
[2:32:11.860 --> 2:32:16.900]  they just then failed, so they opened more factories and secured more food. So if you
[2:32:16.900 --> 2:32:22.020]  eat your orders in, right now, they can take new orders and get it to you quickly. They'll
[2:32:22.020 --> 2:32:27.300]  probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is
[2:32:27.300 --> 2:32:32.580]  killing food distribution, farming, you name it, and now it's mainstream news that food shortages
[2:32:32.580 --> 2:32:37.860]  and delivery are already starting to happen. If Trump can turn the economy back on and
[2:32:38.500 --> 2:32:43.860]  rest control of our system away from the globalist, things may be okay, but it looks like it's going
[2:32:43.860 --> 2:32:47.540]  to get very, very rough. So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number
[2:32:47.540 --> 2:32:51.780]  one thing you need, high-quality storeable food, ready to get to you and your family now. If you get
[2:32:51.780 --> 2:33:03.460]  your orders in, then forstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:03.460 --> 2:33:19.460]  All right. We've got a lot of ground to cover here in the time we have left before. Our next
[2:33:19.460 --> 2:33:25.060]  guest, those takes over in the fourth hour of the War Room, Owen Schreuer, coming up.
[2:33:26.340 --> 2:33:30.660]  There are so many angles to hit on this, but the social engineering,
[2:33:30.660 --> 2:33:37.300]  the whole social engineering front, David, is really the big enchilada. You were saying,
[2:33:37.300 --> 2:33:42.660]  look at Mao's great leap forward. Yeah. Yeah. 80 million people, they bragged,
[2:33:42.660 --> 2:33:49.220]  80 million people died from that. What was that? Was that a disease? Was it war? No,
[2:33:49.220 --> 2:33:56.020]  it was democide. And it was moving everybody out to the farms and taking people out of their
[2:33:56.020 --> 2:34:00.900]  normal jobs and putting them on communes, putting people in factories. They didn't know how to work
[2:34:00.900 --> 2:34:08.900]  it. But it was really Mao trying to take the society down to the base level for his own power.
[2:34:08.900 --> 2:34:15.140]  And Alex, it was about the disease of the human mind. It was about communism. That's been the
[2:34:15.140 --> 2:34:18.820]  disease that killed more people in the 20th century than anything else. And we have to
[2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:24.020]  understand how powerful that can be. I mean, this is something that can be stopped. It's
[2:34:24.020 --> 2:34:30.340]  not necessary. It's self-inflicted. And the great leap forward is looking a lot like this.
[2:34:30.340 --> 2:34:34.420]  And I said from the very beginning, I said, it looks like the great leap forward. Exactly.
[2:34:34.420 --> 2:34:38.340]  And it even comes out of communist China with the captured world health organization now on
[2:34:38.340 --> 2:34:43.700]  record covering up the level four bio weapon release, however it happened, out of Wuhan.
[2:34:43.700 --> 2:34:47.940]  And the very people that have released it and stand to gain from it, shut down the Taiwanese
[2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:52.260]  protest of shut down their own country are now shutting our shadow and leftist politicians
[2:34:52.260 --> 2:34:57.460]  and global politicians are holding the country hostage to take political control. Whether the
[2:34:57.460 --> 2:35:04.020]  virus is ultra deadly or not is a side issue. That's why listeners, I didn't get up here in panic
[2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:08.260]  about your health. Okay, I said, boost your immunity. That's important. But when it comes
[2:35:08.260 --> 2:35:14.100]  to storable food, I said, you need firearms, you need food, you need a six month a year supply
[2:35:14.100 --> 2:35:18.500]  of food if you can afford it. And we have the biggest food supplier in the country because
[2:35:18.500 --> 2:35:23.380]  they're known, they're respected. They have food, they ship it to you. The other companies don't
[2:35:23.380 --> 2:35:29.460]  folks have good records. We have it. They had to pause shipments of new orders for two weeks.
[2:35:30.100 --> 2:35:34.420]  They couldn't take new orders for two weeks because they wanted to get out the other shipments.
[2:35:34.420 --> 2:35:38.020]  Now they've got the food and they're able to get it out to you right now for new orders.
[2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:42.580]  We're now taking new orders of high quality storeable food, the nice plastic tote containers,
[2:35:42.580 --> 2:35:48.900]  sealed bags, not air, all full of high quality food, very delicious, very healthy. And the profit
[2:35:48.900 --> 2:35:53.300]  that comes in funds this operation that is just a rearguard action, trying to defeat this global
[2:35:53.300 --> 2:35:59.380]  operation. So I'm telling you, you need storable food. And with the economy shut down and the
[2:35:59.380 --> 2:36:05.300]  election shut down and all the craziness going on, this stuff last 25 years, get it, you'll get it
[2:36:05.300 --> 2:36:09.700]  shipped to you and you'll have it. And it's five times cheaper than the average supermarket food
[2:36:09.700 --> 2:36:12.900]  with all the markup. This is the best deal you're going to find out there. It's why they're our
[2:36:12.900 --> 2:36:17.460]  sponsor. It's why they're the biggest. Get your storeable food right now at infowarstore.com.

[2:36:26.820 --> 2:36:32.180]  Get your X3 about to sell out. 60% off. We've cut prices during this crisis. And again, frankly,
[2:36:32.900 --> 2:36:36.500]  I'm not even worried about the money except keeping us running. I've had to
[2:36:36.500 --> 2:36:44.180]  go out and actually on the family farm that my dad has, just get ready in case everything collapses.
[2:36:44.180 --> 2:36:47.700]  And it was a very sad feeling. It's beautiful out there. A family's been there.
[2:36:48.340 --> 2:36:54.100]  And since the Mexican land grants in the 1820s, and we've sold most of the land except the old
[2:36:54.100 --> 2:36:58.340]  core part of the property, it's still expensive. And I'm out there with beautiful oak trees and
[2:36:58.340 --> 2:37:04.100]  piney woods. And it looks like heaven. And we've got a little lake there and a spillway and I was
[2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:10.420]  catching fish with my kids. And I almost threw up driving back to Austin yesterday to think that
[2:37:11.380 --> 2:37:14.820]  we're having to get the well going. We're having to get the horrible food in. I'm having to get,
[2:37:14.820 --> 2:37:19.620]  you know, family that are veterans ready. And they all agree. And these are folks that weren't
[2:37:19.620 --> 2:37:25.060]  just pushing pencils in the military. I'll tell you that they're all ready. Because if this fails,
[2:37:25.060 --> 2:37:28.100]  and we don't get the Republic back and the authoritarianism comes down on the other side
[2:37:28.100 --> 2:37:32.100]  of this virus, it is going to be one hell of a fight. You're talking about pushing pencils. I
[2:37:32.100 --> 2:37:36.580]  talked about eye pencil, the famous piece from Leonard Reed, where he talks about how complicated
[2:37:36.580 --> 2:37:41.860]  it is to make something as simple as a pencil. The people who are shutting down our economy
[2:37:41.860 --> 2:37:47.700]  don't realize how they have broken it. I mean, this is about, you know, you've got farmers who
[2:37:47.700 --> 2:37:52.340]  are pouring their milk down the drain, who are plowing their fields under. And let this bitch
[2:37:52.340 --> 2:37:56.980]  and go give that milk to people. There ain't no trucks to get it. You don't milk the cows.
[2:37:56.980 --> 2:38:02.340]  They're others burst. You idiots. Exactly. You cannot centrally plan an economy,
[2:38:02.340 --> 2:38:07.460]  but that's the conceit that fouchy economies are on relationships between producers,
[2:38:07.460 --> 2:38:12.180]  inventors and markets. That's right. And they don't understand how complicated that is.
[2:38:12.180 --> 2:38:15.780]  And they don't understand it. They may break it. They've pushed Humpty Dumpty off the wall.
[2:38:15.780 --> 2:38:21.620]  They may not be able to put him back together again. Let's go to, let's go to Dr. Francis Boyle,
[2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:26.420]  who's laid all this out. What does President Trump need to do now? How does he level the
[2:38:26.420 --> 2:38:35.380]  American people? Well, I think once he understands that the American people in our Republic are
[2:38:35.380 --> 2:38:43.220]  facing this existential threat, he has to have a major address and tell the American people
[2:38:43.220 --> 2:38:51.140]  exactly what went on here, including the involvement of all these US Nazi death scientists,
[2:38:51.140 --> 2:38:56.900]  which by the way happened long before him. I'm not blaming President Trump for this. I don't
[2:38:56.900 --> 2:39:03.940]  even think he knew what was going on between you and me. And then to understand that we are in the
[2:39:03.940 --> 2:39:14.820]  fight of our lives here and we are going to have to operate accordingly in order to stop and contain
[2:39:14.820 --> 2:39:24.100]  COVID and try to throw it back. I think, and to think along those lines, this is far more dangerous
[2:39:24.100 --> 2:39:33.460]  to us and the American Republic than Hitler and the Nazis or the Japanese imperialists or whatever.
[2:39:33.460 --> 2:39:42.260]  They never got over here. COVID is here now. It can kill, I think, up to 15% of us if it is not
[2:39:42.260 --> 2:39:48.340]  handled properly. And that's where we are right now, Alex.
[2:39:48.340 --> 2:39:52.980]  Can I interject something? Let's talk about the elephant in the room, which is what you alluded
[2:39:52.980 --> 2:39:57.380]  to there, the operation paper clip. You know, talk about the Japanese imperialists and the
[2:39:57.380 --> 2:40:02.020]  Nazi scientists. And of course, we brought them in with operation paper clip. I lived right down
[2:40:02.020 --> 2:40:08.020]  the street when I was in North Carolina from UNC Chapel Hill. And I really didn't realize that this
[2:40:08.020 --> 2:40:12.340]  was going on. Most people don't realize that there are hundreds of these things going on in
[2:40:12.340 --> 2:40:17.540]  universities all over the place. It wasn't really until there was the outbreak down at the National
[2:40:17.540 --> 2:40:21.620]  Primate Center of Burkholderia, Pseudomalia, which is a bacteria that they brought in from the
[2:40:21.620 --> 2:40:27.540]  obscure place for gain of function stuff that when that got out, and then we had a rash of
[2:40:27.540 --> 2:40:31.940]  public incidents where they were mailing live anthrax through the mail and so forth. People
[2:40:31.940 --> 2:40:37.060]  don't realize how prolific this is and how they have violated the prohibitions of the treaty that
[2:40:37.060 --> 2:40:44.260]  you had there. They don't realize that Fauci and the NIH were funding this and how Fauci and Francis
[2:40:44.260 --> 2:40:50.340]  Collins, even when there was a stop order to stop the funding in 2014, they continued with a half
[2:40:50.340 --> 2:40:55.300]  dozen of these UNC Chapel Hill was just one of them. There were all these bioethicists that were
[2:40:55.300 --> 2:40:59.700]  outraged when they released their paper about and Francis Collins said, Well, I just continued it.
[2:40:59.700 --> 2:41:03.860]  And then they lifted that restriction 2017. We got to get that information out to the American
[2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:10.500]  people. No way. Well, yeah, that's why I've been talking to Alex here. He's the only one letting
[2:41:10.500 --> 2:41:17.460]  me say that. I've been blocked out of all the mainstream news media on purpose. No one's letting
[2:41:17.460 --> 2:41:21.460]  me say that. Well, you're certainly vindicated now. So what do you expect to happen now that we
[2:41:21.460 --> 2:41:27.300]  learn AP gets the documents that the UN World Health Organization is involved covering this up for
[2:41:27.300 --> 2:41:34.500]  communist China? What should Trump do with that information? Well, again, Trump has to come out
[2:41:34.500 --> 2:41:41.060]  and be honest with the American people and say, No one told me this is a biological warfare weapon.
[2:41:41.060 --> 2:41:47.220]  I don't think he was told this and how existentially dangerous it is. He's now leveling with the
[2:41:47.220 --> 2:41:55.300]  American people. Yes, we have our own American Nazi bio warfare death scientist working with
[2:41:55.300 --> 2:42:01.060]  China on this. And, you know, these people are a fifth column, we're going to get them all
[2:42:01.060 --> 2:42:06.180]  prosecuted. Don't don't let them hold us hostage. He shouldn't become a party to the cover up with
[2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:10.100]  Fauci and them, but they'll use that on Trump. He needs to bring it out now.
[2:42:12.020 --> 2:42:16.500]  I think that's correct. This is this is a matter of telling the truth, the American people level
[2:42:16.500 --> 2:42:24.180]  with us and then come up with an agenda by legitimate public health authorities, medical
[2:42:24.180 --> 2:42:31.380]  doctors, epidemiologists who have never taken one penny. Exactly. You can't have the people that
[2:42:31.380 --> 2:42:37.220]  caused the crisis in charge of the crisis. Of course not, because they're all busy covering
[2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:44.100]  up their own criminal responsibility under my biological weapons anti-terrorism act that has
[2:42:44.100 --> 2:42:50.260]  life imprisonment. And as for North Carolina, we'll come right back with that. Please stay with us.

[2:43:54.020 --> 2:44:00.980]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that rugged individualism and
[2:44:00.980 --> 2:44:07.060]  people that think for themselves build free societies, innovate to amazing things. But those
[2:44:07.060 --> 2:44:13.220]  that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to comply and think
[2:44:13.220 --> 2:44:19.620]  that it's a virtue, they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny and then finally collapse.
[2:44:21.220 --> 2:44:27.780]  And the world is now being tested. Remember seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've
[2:44:27.780 --> 2:44:32.980]  complied and submitted their whole lives believing if they just submit down a bigger way,
[2:44:33.860 --> 2:44:40.820]  somehow they'll create a heavenly future. But the technocrats running the global system are
[2:44:40.820 --> 2:44:46.500]  oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future.
[2:44:47.140 --> 2:44:52.260]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing into the ocean.
[2:44:54.820 --> 2:44:59.860]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even if it ends up hurting me
[2:44:59.860 --> 2:45:04.020]  short term. I believe in God and I believe in the long run. It'll end up being better for
[2:45:04.020 --> 2:45:08.100]  myself and everybody else in this world we live together in. I understand what comes around,
[2:45:08.100 --> 2:45:12.100]  goes around, you reap what you sow and I live that and I fundamentally the cellular level
[2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:17.140]  understand it. Now if I would have hyped up the virus was going to kill three, four, five million
[2:45:17.140 --> 2:45:21.940]  people like the UN did, I would have told five times more supplements. But you know what? I didn't
[2:45:21.940 --> 2:45:28.500]  do that. But I said on a routine basis regardless people are vitamin D deficient, people are
[2:45:28.500 --> 2:45:33.940]  deficient in iodine and so many other issues. You need those products regardless. So we started
[2:45:33.940 --> 2:45:40.420]  selling out of vitamin refusion all the other products. I cut the prices from 30% off to 60%
[2:45:40.420 --> 2:45:46.020]  off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized
[2:45:46.020 --> 2:45:51.380]  to up their bodies defenses. But now I'm telling you with the economic crisis going on get your
[2:45:51.380 --> 2:45:58.420]  storeable food now. Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you
[2:45:58.420 --> 2:46:03.460]  to stay in your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you to go. It's called
[2:46:03.460 --> 2:46:08.900]  martial law. It's called living in authoritarian country. Everybody knows that. Everybody understands
[2:46:08.900 --> 2:46:13.940]  that and the Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state saying we're going to listen
[2:46:13.940 --> 2:46:18.740]  to Fauci and the World Health Organization who've done nothing but put out all this fakeness
[2:46:18.740 --> 2:46:23.220]  information so far. We're not going to listen to the president. We're not going to listen to Congress
[2:46:24.020 --> 2:46:28.420]  but then all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with big tech to
[2:46:28.420 --> 2:46:33.780]  surveil and control and keep things shut down. This is economic warfare and I know everybody
[2:46:33.780 --> 2:46:39.300]  understands that. Public with the president and others need to develop a plan to understand
[2:46:39.300 --> 2:46:45.780]  that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage and this is a mutiny
[2:46:45.780 --> 2:46:51.620]  against our country by globalist forces. Only understanding the reality of the magnitude of
[2:46:51.620 --> 2:47:07.540]  that gives us any chance of defeating it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:07.540 --> 2:47:29.140]  Live from Austin Texas it's Alex Jones. Well last weekend Bill Gates came out with a clever
[2:47:29.140 --> 2:47:34.020]  word he played several times this week so I'm playing him where he said oh one out of ten
[2:47:34.020 --> 2:47:38.340]  thousand had a problem so seven hundred thousand get sick or die from the vaccine but it's okay
[2:47:38.340 --> 2:47:46.180]  to pay that because we need to have governments indemnify people who get hurt. Well explain
[2:47:46.180 --> 2:47:50.820]  what's really going on there. Well you know Alex this is another connection to Fauci as Dr. Boyle
[2:47:50.820 --> 2:47:56.820]  was explaining. They brought him in to help to push back against Dr. Boyle's work when he was trying
[2:47:56.820 --> 2:48:03.700]  to control this gain of function research but also Fauci was brought in in 1985 and if everybody
[2:48:03.700 --> 2:48:11.060]  recalls that 1986 was when they created what they called the National Childhood Vaccine Act.
[2:48:11.060 --> 2:48:17.380]  What that did was that gave immunity from lawsuits to the big pharmaceutical companies
[2:48:17.380 --> 2:48:23.220]  that had that damaged people with their vaccines. Now there's not any other industry that I know of
[2:48:23.220 --> 2:48:27.700]  that has complete immunity from any damage that they do with their products except for the vaccine
[2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:32.740]  industry but Fauci was there when this went through and it was sold as a way to protect
[2:48:32.740 --> 2:48:40.180]  the children. And notice before all this hype came out about how we all got our vaccines they've
[2:48:40.180 --> 2:48:44.420]  been trying to censor everybody that criticizes them. I'd love it if the vaccine would protect
[2:48:44.420 --> 2:48:48.420]  me for something but over and over again they have bad side effects they don't protect you and
[2:48:48.420 --> 2:48:52.900]  they cover it up. How do you have it for the common cold? This is not the common cold but if that's
[2:48:52.900 --> 2:48:58.180]  the basis of the virus they admit. That scientist on not just Dr. Boyle they go yeah no you can't do
[2:48:58.180 --> 2:49:04.260]  that it's not going to work. So what is the agenda Dr. Francis Boyle behind this forced
[2:49:04.260 --> 2:49:13.860]  inoculation and these IDs to travel and all this? Well it's I agree with both David and you have said
[2:49:13.860 --> 2:49:22.660]  it's domination and control population reduction the Nazi philosophy of useless eaters that was
[2:49:22.660 --> 2:49:31.220]  condemned in the Nuremberg judgment of 1946. I mean we know Gates is a eugenicist and a genocider
[2:49:31.220 --> 2:49:39.220]  that's that's a better public record and yet he's out there constantly being appearing on MSNBC
[2:49:39.220 --> 2:49:47.860]  and CNN. You know what what can I say they're giving him this immunity passports it's completely
[2:49:47.860 --> 2:49:56.180]  preposterous so many of these vaccines are more dangerous than worthless this HPV vaccine that
[2:49:56.180 --> 2:50:02.500]  they're you know trying to pump into all our children even Judicial Watch has exposed that and
[2:50:02.500 --> 2:50:08.180]  you know they're a very conservative legal organization. The list of these things go on
[2:50:08.180 --> 2:50:16.500]  and as I told you before you know Gates trying to purvey a vaccine here I don't believe there is
[2:50:16.500 --> 2:50:23.300]  a vaccine out I just I just don't see it I'm sure he he understands that too so that could be more
[2:50:23.300 --> 2:50:29.540]  dangerous than worthless and in any event he'll have a patent on it and scaremonger everyone
[2:50:29.540 --> 2:50:34.980]  to take the vaccine one way or the other and then you get a passport. Well here's the good news
[2:50:34.980 --> 2:50:42.900]  without even looking on YouTube on Twitter on Facebook on Instagram his name is like he's like
[2:50:42.900 --> 2:50:50.180]  worse than Hitler now. Bill Gates is the new Hitler I mean people overuse Hitler he people
[2:50:50.180 --> 2:50:54.660]  know now there's organically they figured it out. Well you know you go back and you look at Fauci
[2:50:54.660 --> 2:50:59.220]  look what he did with the 2009 swine flu oh it had to be a vaccine and then they rushed that through
[2:50:59.220 --> 2:51:03.140]  in just four months he was telling everybody you know in the press conference his note will take
[2:51:03.140 --> 2:51:08.340]  us 18 months he knows that he helped to push through and vouched for the safety of endemrics
[2:51:08.340 --> 2:51:12.900]  and now you've got massive lawsuits that happened in the wake of that a swine flu outbreak when you
[2:51:12.900 --> 2:51:18.900]  had Zika virus the answer was going to be vaccines again but this time around unlike in previous
[2:51:18.900 --> 2:51:24.180]  outbreaks Fauci won't even talk about how there could be any other possible treatment to even
[2:51:24.180 --> 2:51:28.420]  ameliorate any symptoms everything's got to be locked down until we get a vaccine. Oh yeah I've never seen
[2:51:28.420 --> 2:51:35.300]  they are behind the scenes having grand juries impaneled to indict major vitamin companies
[2:51:35.300 --> 2:51:40.660]  that promote vitamin D3. Wow. Because they always were authorized by the lawyers in FDA to say hey
[2:51:40.660 --> 2:51:46.020]  boost immunity antiviral that's on the NIH website that Zika does that's a D3. They're calling these
[2:51:46.020 --> 2:51:51.380]  companies up and having grand juries send them subpoenas saying we're about to indict you as a
[2:51:51.380 --> 2:51:56.100]  drug you can't say you need D3 or you need Zika. Well they just had a couple of armpits. Well the
[2:51:56.100 --> 2:52:02.260]  president he can't say that. Yeah March 23rd March 24th you had the former head of the CDC was talking
[2:52:02.260 --> 2:52:09.300]  about vitamin D in relation to the the coronavirus and then the day later you had an op-ed piece
[2:52:09.300 --> 2:52:13.940]  watch it was in a scientific paper you had somebody currently working at the NIH talking
[2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:18.420]  about how the vitamin D calms the immune system and so forth so there's a lot of evidence. Yeah let
[2:52:18.420 --> 2:52:24.180]  me ask that question of Dr. Boyle why is there such a demonization of hydroxychloroquine zinc
[2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:30.980]  vitamin D3 vitamin K vitamin A why are they I guess the drug companies just don't want competition
[2:52:30.980 --> 2:52:38.420]  or what's going on here. Sure they're in control they're in domination and that's that's what they
[2:52:38.420 --> 2:52:44.980]  want I think Fauci probably has patents on this type of stuff. We got a hundred million dollars from
[2:52:44.980 --> 2:52:54.820]  Bill Gates in October for dealing with mutinogenic viruses. Nothing to say. I don't know what that means.
[2:52:54.820 --> 2:53:01.460]  What does that mean. It's Dr. Tony Mengele Fauci that's what we're dealing with here and
[2:53:02.020 --> 2:53:08.740]  first is not much better. So you know how can the president properly formulate
[2:53:09.300 --> 2:53:16.020]  a policy to deal with an existential threat which I believe is there to the American people
[2:53:16.020 --> 2:53:21.460]  and the American Republic. Alex as you said it could all collapse if this is not properly handled
[2:53:21.460 --> 2:53:28.660]  so with people like that that are basically criminals that clearly violated my biological
[2:53:28.660 --> 2:53:34.500]  weapons anti-terrorism act all up and down. That's why I got that act into law
[2:53:35.300 --> 2:53:42.340]  espionamously by both Houses of Congress signed by President George Bush Sr. to stop these
[2:53:42.340 --> 2:53:50.340]  Nazi biological warfare death scientists like Fauci and Collins and Berks and and this whole
[2:53:50.340 --> 2:53:57.140]  cast of characters right. I went right after them. Well Dr. Boyle you've been dead on about
[2:53:57.860 --> 2:54:02.660]  about the fact that this is a man-made bio weapon and have been totally on target and I respect the
[2:54:02.660 --> 2:54:08.020]  fact that it's man-made it could be even more deadly than we know and to say hey quarantine all
[2:54:08.020 --> 2:54:12.500]  that is legitimate if when you say the vaccine's fake and they're doing a power grab that's all
[2:54:12.500 --> 2:54:16.980]  real and that's real scholarly discussion and I hope you know I hope overall that you know that
[2:54:16.980 --> 2:54:21.700]  David's right that it's not as bad as it looks like and I you know I I I hope that you're wrong
[2:54:21.700 --> 2:54:26.900]  but uh regardless we know the power grab is real Dr. Boyle people can google your name Dr. Francis
[2:54:26.900 --> 2:54:31.860]  Bull find your amazing bugs thank you so much for the time. Well that's just one other point though
[2:54:31.860 --> 2:54:37.780]  and with all due respect to David Knight I have a book here Agents of Bioterrorism by Professor
[2:54:37.780 --> 2:54:46.100]  of Biology at Columbia published in 2003 before all this happened and it says quote the overall
[2:54:46.100 --> 2:54:54.420]  death rate of SARS patients is 14 to 15 percent unquote and right now as I've explained we are
[2:54:54.420 --> 2:55:03.140]  dealing with a super turbocharged SARS so I think that is a minimum of the lethality that we are
[2:55:03.140 --> 2:55:10.420]  dealing with 14 to 15 percent I said that the first thing don't confuse a power grab over the lockdown
[2:55:10.420 --> 2:55:17.780]  with the fact that the lockdown could be saving people. Well I'm saying that we we have to understand
[2:55:17.780 --> 2:55:25.700]  how existentially dangerous this is and then we tailor our policies from there to to preserve
[2:55:25.700 --> 2:55:30.820]  as we don't have the people behind the attack running the response right you know it's just
[2:55:30.820 --> 2:55:37.060]  like world war two you know that's what we're in now it's it's it's world war three and yes we'll
[2:55:37.060 --> 2:55:43.700]  have to accept some restrictions on our civil rights and civil liberties uh while the emergency is
[2:55:43.700 --> 2:55:50.580]  there but we don't want to give them a way to these uh Davos Blablonius I agree with you 100
[2:55:50.580 --> 2:55:55.860]  percent on that. All right we're out of time thank you so much Dr. Boyle. Thank you after
[2:55:55.860 --> 2:56:01.940]  to be with you and my congratulations there to David for being up and running again and I enjoyed
[2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:10.580]  our dialogue. We have to end your best. Regardless of what the fatality rate is let's understand
[2:56:10.580 --> 2:56:15.620]  that more people died from just the great leap forward than what you saw on these different
[2:56:15.620 --> 2:56:20.900]  pandemics that Alex showed at the beginning. All the pandemics last 150 years didn't kill
[2:56:20.900 --> 2:56:24.500]  as many as Mao Zedong. That's right and let's understand the political power grabs the main
[2:56:24.500 --> 2:56:30.900]  threat. Let's understand the Alamo the death rate was 100 but they fought for liberty you cannot give
[2:56:30.900 --> 2:56:36.500]  up your liberty you cannot surrender your life to these people it doesn't matter what these
[2:56:36.500 --> 2:56:41.140]  fatality rates are you've got to stop this shutdown this lockdown it's got to stop. It's
[2:56:41.140 --> 2:56:45.700]  going to kill billions in the third world. Oh well it will. I want to take the last minute of you
[2:56:45.700 --> 2:56:50.660]  right up front the whole show full show today not the rebroadcast on the show we put up at Bandai
[2:56:50.660 --> 2:56:55.300]  video. All right I love you all everybody's truthful we're all have different perspectives but
[2:56:55.300 --> 2:56:59.700]  we're moving in the right direction uh Mike Adams has his he's a great guy he's about to take over
[2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:04.820]  folks I'm just telling you you better get your firearms for self-defense and your storeable food

[2:57:57.620 --> 2:58:01.940]  that's what environmentalism is it's about having an anti-human future and having people live in a
[2:58:01.940 --> 2:58:07.780]  subsistence futile served state that's what they want these people that have stolen the planet are
[2:58:07.780 --> 2:58:13.620]  worth trillions of dollars do not want you having a good life they know you're having fun they know

[2:58:31.380 --> 2:58:36.420]  and being gullible and being domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder and
[2:58:36.420 --> 2:58:40.660]  they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet and they are the enemy of humanity
[2:58:40.660 --> 2:58:49.780]  and need to be stood up against oh hi i'm a liberal professor here yeah we're bringing in
[2:58:49.780 --> 2:58:56.980]  fours of mentors to stop the extremism sure it's true the science publication five years ago and
[2:58:56.980 --> 2:59:06.500]  public documents that obama and falgy transferred covid-19 to china but you know what there's too
[2:59:06.500 --> 2:59:13.700]  many people like the pubs and this is the popular either capitalism or less and you didn't really
[2:59:13.700 --> 2:59:22.740]  think you'd defeat shiji ping and sexy devil did you yeah yeah and look at your media so
[2:59:22.740 --> 2:59:28.820]  laptop and supporting the takedown americans celebrating it because you put up with it that's
[2:59:28.820 --> 2:59:38.180]  right you're gonna keep taking and remember pedophile story time is gonna happen too you
[2:59:38.180 --> 2:59:43.460]  don't have any free speech either so drink your fluoride and die stupid americans
[2:59:43.460 --> 2:59:57.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:57.300 --> 3:00:08.980]  you can run on for a long time
[3:00:08.980 --> 3:00:18.020]  run on for a long time run on for a long time sooner or later gotta cut you down sooner
[3:00:18.020 --> 3:00:28.500]  or later gotta cut you down go tell that long-tongue liar go and tell that midnight rider tell the
[3:00:28.500 --> 3:00:35.380]  rambler the gambler stepping in for the fourth hour today here on the alex jones show thank you
[3:00:35.380 --> 3:00:43.220]  for joining me i'm gonna cover some very interesting aspects of this today and i know that uh
[3:00:43.220 --> 3:00:51.780]  my priorities and views on this have differed somewhat from some other informers guess you
[3:00:51.780 --> 3:00:56.900]  know tensions are running kind of high right now but there's some key things that we all agree on
[3:00:56.900 --> 3:01:03.380]  and that is that socialism and communism are so dangerous that those forms of bad government
[3:01:03.380 --> 3:01:09.780]  will kill vastly more people than this pandemic could ever dream of and so part of what i'm
[3:01:09.780 --> 3:01:15.700]  going to focus on today is i mean yes covid-19 is real yes you know tens of thousands of people
[3:01:15.700 --> 3:01:21.780]  are dying in america but those numbers could be dwarfed by the deaths of socialism and
[3:01:21.780 --> 3:01:27.620]  communism if we allow those systems of tyranny to take over the united states and with governor
[3:01:27.620 --> 3:01:35.620]  quomo today announcing that there's going to be another 30 days of lockdown well into you know
[3:01:35.620 --> 3:01:43.700]  mid-may now in new york and connecticut and new jersey and so on it's it's progressing as we had
[3:01:43.700 --> 3:01:51.620]  warned that these lockdowns are going to continue for a very long time and even when society is
[3:01:51.620 --> 3:01:58.580]  open back up again what are the criteria going to be for governors like quomo to lock people down
[3:01:58.580 --> 3:02:04.660]  again and could this be you know one month of freedom two months of lockdowns one month of
[3:02:04.660 --> 3:02:08.740]  freedom two months of lockdowns you know are we approaching the day where you're going to be arrested
[3:02:08.740 --> 3:02:19.140]  by a drone that that scans your your biometric you know rfid chip or or armband with your immunity
[3:02:19.140 --> 3:02:26.340]  passport and what's this turning into it's very dangerous what is happening right now and even
[3:02:26.340 --> 3:02:32.580]  though yes it's true that there's some danger going out in public and protesting this virus
[3:02:32.580 --> 3:02:38.500]  without a mask on let's say yeah you could catch the virus yeah you can it's very infectious it's a
[3:02:38.500 --> 3:02:45.540]  biological weapon but what's the relative danger of allowing let's say the federal reserve to take
[3:02:45.540 --> 3:02:52.340]  over our entire economy of transitioning into a soviet style economic system of top-down control
[3:02:52.980 --> 3:02:58.180]  where we the people have no rights remaining whatsoever where we are tracked and poked and
[3:02:58.180 --> 3:03:07.140]  prodded and injected at gunpoint we have to carry papers or rfid chips or mandated apps on our mobile
[3:03:07.140 --> 3:03:13.860]  devices with apple tracking and google tracking and government tracking of our antibody status
[3:03:13.860 --> 3:03:19.220]  we're going to be discriminated against based on what's in our blood or what's not in our blood
[3:03:19.860 --> 3:03:25.540]  you won't be able to get on an airplane without having the correct antibodies in your blood you're
[3:03:25.540 --> 3:03:32.660]  going to have to prove your blood status in order to get on a plane to board a train to go to a
[3:03:32.660 --> 3:03:38.420]  sporting event maybe to walk down the sidewalk you'll be a prisoner in your own home if you don't
[3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:44.020]  have the correct antibodies that's what this is coming to and it's a very very dangerous time
[3:03:45.140 --> 3:03:48.740]  so we're going to focus on that yeah we're going to talk about the the real deaths
[3:03:48.740 --> 3:03:53.220]  we're going to talk about how to protect yourself from this i'm just checking my notes here
[3:03:53.220 --> 3:03:58.500]  we're going to talk about the zombie economy dead people are receiving bailout money now
[3:03:58.500 --> 3:04:05.380]  that's how insane this is becoming dead people getting bailout money it's where this is going
[3:04:05.380 --> 3:04:10.740]  is utterly insane and real quick to the producers i'm not seeing the clock so just fade in the music
[3:04:10.740 --> 3:04:16.420]  when we go to break so i can catch that but the zombie economy is not functional long term you
[3:04:16.420 --> 3:04:22.100]  can't pay oil drillers to not drill you can't pay people to not work i mean you can do it for a
[3:04:22.100 --> 3:04:26.100]  temporary period of time during the mandatory lockdowns but what about after that people want
[3:04:26.100 --> 3:04:31.540]  to get back to work people want to have a purpose in their lives and i hear the music so we are
[3:04:31.540 --> 3:04:35.380]  going to break right now but we're going to talk about all those things and much more this is mike
[3:04:35.380 --> 3:04:40.340]  adam's health ranger here for the fourth hour today of the alex jones show we'll be back after
[3:04:40.340 --> 3:04:53.780]  this break with all those details and much more straight ahead don't go anywhere

[3:06:09.220 --> 3:06:14.180]  all right mike adam's continuing here i've got the hour thank you for joining me we have a lot
[3:06:14.180 --> 3:06:20.900]  of important issues to cover right now and as i mentioned in the in the last segment which you
[3:06:20.900 --> 3:06:25.300]  may have missed depending on what radio station listening on i know that tensions are running
[3:06:25.300 --> 3:06:32.580]  really high right now and opinions and analysis varies quite a bit and i've you know my own
[3:06:32.580 --> 3:06:39.140]  projections and numbers and explanations have been at odds with other guests here on info wars
[3:06:39.140 --> 3:06:44.020]  but that's part of the beauty of independent media is that you do get a lot of different views
[3:06:44.020 --> 3:06:49.620]  you get a lot of different analysis of course you know i'm i'm confident that what i'm bringing you
[3:06:49.620 --> 3:06:55.220]  is the best information that i can muster for you i always try to give you accurate numbers
[3:06:55.220 --> 3:07:01.220]  and that's my mission today as well and the the good thing is you know you can decide what you
[3:07:01.220 --> 3:07:06.580]  think is most appropriate for you and what you wish to follow and you know how seriously you need
[3:07:06.580 --> 3:07:10.900]  to take this thing but the one thing that we all agree on and this is part of my focus today
[3:07:10.900 --> 3:07:15.780]  is that socialism and communism are far more dangerous than any pandemic i mean even if this
[3:07:15.780 --> 3:07:21.620]  pandemic swept across the country and killed five million americans which is technically possible
[3:07:22.180 --> 3:07:28.100]  if there were no mitigation efforts whatsoever it could kill five million people however communism
[3:07:28.100 --> 3:07:34.020]  would probably kill you know a hundred million maybe if we let the communists run the country
[3:07:34.020 --> 3:07:41.140]  they would have death camps that dwarf the covid-19 quarantine deaths you know what i mean you want
[3:07:41.140 --> 3:07:47.460]  to see mass graves in a country you go throughout history you look at stalin you look at chairman
[3:07:47.460 --> 3:07:53.300]  mao you look at polpot you look at the mass murderers of history even adolf hitler and the third
[3:07:53.300 --> 3:07:59.860]  rike which was really a radicalized you know left-wing socialist fascist type of regime and
[3:07:59.860 --> 3:08:07.860]  and communist china today is incredibly dangerous to our world and we must focus on the priorities
[3:08:07.860 --> 3:08:12.420]  here yes we have to survive the pandemic we have to take precautions and i'll talk about some of
[3:08:12.420 --> 3:08:17.140]  that today and basically most of the listeners to this show are already doing the right things you
[3:08:17.140 --> 3:08:23.060]  you probably have stored food you're probably maybe wearing a mask out in public if you suspect
[3:08:23.060 --> 3:08:27.940]  other infected people are around you're probably taking zinc you know vitamin d3 you're taking
[3:08:27.940 --> 3:08:31.780]  care of your health maybe you're doing a multivitamin from the infowars store you're you're doing
[3:08:31.780 --> 3:08:37.140]  things that are helping you boost your your immune system because this is really a immunodeficiency
[3:08:37.140 --> 3:08:43.540]  type of disease that attacks people with weakened immune systems a healthy person who's got good
[3:08:43.540 --> 3:08:49.700]  nutraceuticals is extremely unlikely to be killed by this infection even though it is a biological
[3:08:49.700 --> 3:08:57.300]  weapon but on top of all of that we must we must very soon and some people already started to do
[3:08:57.300 --> 3:09:05.940]  this you know protest in michigan for example we must very loudly tell the government that
[3:09:05.940 --> 3:09:12.740]  they've gone too far with the tyranny with the mandatory lockdowns and the coming mandatory
[3:09:12.740 --> 3:09:22.100]  vaccines if we do not assert our rights as individual americans our right to exercise religion
[3:09:22.100 --> 3:09:29.860]  our exercise our right to exercise free speech our right to control our own bodies if we don't
[3:09:29.860 --> 3:09:35.300]  exercise these rights we will lose them and it is happening by the day very very quickly
[3:09:36.420 --> 3:09:41.860]  now what i do understand here you know as a a functioning scientist i'm a published scientist
[3:09:41.860 --> 3:09:50.100]  science author and so on i called for lockdowns in early march and the lockdowns were temporarily
[3:09:50.100 --> 3:09:55.460]  necessary until we learn more about this now i'm calling for ending the lockdowns because we now
[3:09:55.460 --> 3:10:01.060]  have the knowledge of how to get america back to work with these nutritional supplements with
[3:10:01.060 --> 3:10:06.020]  wearing masks and and enhanced testing so that we can really identify what are called asymptomatic
[3:10:06.020 --> 3:10:10.340]  carriers you know people who are spreading it and they don't even know they have it if we can
[3:10:10.340 --> 3:10:16.740]  identify those people then we can get we can get our economy working again and yet what i see with
[3:10:16.740 --> 3:10:21.300]  governor qualmo in this announcement today is that the new york governor doesn't seem to be that
[3:10:21.300 --> 3:10:27.540]  interested in getting new york back to work again he wants another 30 days of lockdown and then he
[3:10:27.540 --> 3:10:33.300]  says after that we'll see what happens he could extend it till the end of may or frankly till
[3:10:33.300 --> 3:10:39.220]  the end of june there's really no limit and it begs the question at what point do we the people
[3:10:39.220 --> 3:10:45.140]  have to say no we are no longer going to be prisoners in our own homes and apartments
[3:10:45.140 --> 3:10:51.780]  we're no longer going to allow you the governor of new york and others to decimate
[3:10:52.340 --> 3:10:59.140]  our economy and drive us into starvation and destitution and socialism because at some point
[3:10:59.940 --> 3:11:05.220]  that reaction by the governor of new york becomes more dangerous than the disease itself
[3:11:06.500 --> 3:11:12.020]  and i'm someone who has reiterated the danger of this disease probably more than anyone
[3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:17.540]  here on info wars you know i've warned where this could go early on i said this this could have gone
[3:11:17.540 --> 3:11:23.540]  to two million deaths by july if we didn't take early steps fortunately we took steps
[3:11:24.260 --> 3:11:31.940]  we locked down the cities temporarily and then i altered my projections to 45 000 to 90 000 americans
[3:11:31.940 --> 3:11:37.540]  dead by the end of july and that was at a time when the white house was saying there's going to be
[3:11:37.540 --> 3:11:43.780]  100 000 to 240 000 deaths i didn't see those numbers being real and i said so publicly i said no the
[3:11:43.780 --> 3:11:48.420]  white house numbers are too large now based on the social distancing factors that are in place
[3:11:48.420 --> 3:11:55.140]  i believe we can keep the deaths under 90 000 through july today the official deaths from the
[3:11:55.140 --> 3:12:02.900]  cdc are right around 33 000 plus now i know there's some debate about what they consider to be deaths
[3:12:02.900 --> 3:12:09.620]  versus probable deaths and so on but that number is in the 30 000s and it's it's going to go into
[3:12:09.620 --> 3:12:16.020]  the 40 000s so probably looking at things right now we're going to end up with maybe 50 to 60 000
[3:12:16.020 --> 3:12:21.860]  deaths by the end of july which is right in the middle of what my projection said so i have been
[3:12:21.860 --> 3:12:26.900]  someone who tried to sound the alarm early on about where this was going and i think you'll
[3:12:26.900 --> 3:12:31.460]  find that the projections that i've modeled mathematically actually turn out to be among
[3:12:31.460 --> 3:12:36.420]  the most accurate that are out there and of course i adapted my projections once the social
[3:12:36.420 --> 3:12:41.700]  distancing went into place and the lockdowns went into place which again was necessary temporarily
[3:12:41.700 --> 3:12:48.820]  so when you hear me say it's time to end the lockdowns i think that that carries a lot of maybe
[3:12:48.820 --> 3:12:54.900]  extra weight versus somebody who always said no lockdowns were necessary i'm saying i understand
[3:12:54.900 --> 3:13:01.060]  and the effectiveness of social distancing i i understand the 30 000 deaths that are occurring
[3:13:01.060 --> 3:13:09.700]  and even i am saying we have to end the lockdowns because again the risk of of death and economic
[3:13:09.700 --> 3:13:17.060]  destruction and destitution starvation those risks are now it's obvious that if we let these
[3:13:17.060 --> 3:13:24.340]  democrat governors run this country into the ground far more people will die from those events than
[3:13:24.340 --> 3:13:30.260]  would have died from the virus again if we had done nothing there would be two million americans
[3:13:30.260 --> 3:13:37.540]  dead by july but if we revert to socialism there might be 20 millions dead in the next couple of
[3:13:37.540 --> 3:13:41.140]  years i mean it's it's it's impossible to say real projections for that because we don't know what
[3:13:41.140 --> 3:13:46.580]  scenarios may unfold but if we end up just in a civil war alone millions of americans could die
[3:13:48.100 --> 3:13:52.020]  you know laying the lives down to fight for the basic fundamental freedoms
[3:13:52.020 --> 3:13:58.660]  that americans are supposed to defend and i don't know about you but i'm i'm getting to the point
[3:13:59.220 --> 3:14:05.220]  and i know a lot of other americans are where there's no life at all if you have to live life
[3:14:05.220 --> 3:14:10.500]  as a slave under a lockdown medical police state where all the decision makers in washington dc are
[3:14:10.500 --> 3:14:15.380]  run by big pharma and they want to put a gun to your head and a needle in your arm and tell you
[3:14:15.380 --> 3:14:20.420]  that you're the property of the state and you don't even own your own body no thank you i don't
[3:14:20.420 --> 3:14:26.180]  want to live under that system i'd rather fight and die for freedom than to live under a medical
[3:14:26.180 --> 3:14:32.260]  police state tyranny where they're forcing toxic substances into my body and tracking my blood in
[3:14:32.260 --> 3:14:38.340]  order for me to engage in commercial transactions mark of the beast technology no thank you i'll
[3:14:38.340 --> 3:14:44.340]  save my soul and sacrifice my life if that's what it takes but i am not surrendering both my soul
[3:14:44.340 --> 3:14:51.780]  and my body to this tyrannical mark of the beast demonic book of revelation end game type of system

[3:17:54.820 --> 3:17:59.140]  that they needed to get high quality storeable food not because of the virus but because of the
[3:17:59.140 --> 3:18:04.420]  crises and the economic shutdown it would cause because the globalists were planning to hold
[3:18:04.420 --> 3:18:10.100]  america hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states now that prediction
[3:18:10.100 --> 3:18:16.820]  has come true because the globalists are running an operation it's not predictions we have their
[3:18:16.820 --> 3:18:22.180]  battle plans so going back more than eight weeks ago all major storeable food companies were sold
[3:18:22.180 --> 3:18:27.140]  out except my patreon supply because they're the biggest of a preposition when it got to the point
[3:18:27.140 --> 3:18:31.540]  they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner
[3:18:31.540 --> 3:18:36.020]  they stopped taking orders till they got caught back up well now they're caught back up they got

[3:18:58.260 --> 3:19:04.260]  that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had china released to then
[3:19:04.260 --> 3:19:10.420]  take down the populist president and those pesky american people that have become too uppity bilmar
[3:19:10.420 --> 3:19:15.700]  even admitted it man i hope we have a depression and now they've tailored the whole thing with the
[3:19:15.700 --> 3:19:21.140]  big corporations and the media are gonna keep the country closed along with the help of the blue
[3:19:21.140 --> 3:19:26.660]  cities and blue states all the time blaming trump and capitalism and americanism for the
[3:19:26.660 --> 3:19:32.580]  depression it creates if america is that stupid we deserve what happens to us but as for me
[3:19:32.580 --> 3:19:37.380]  i'm not sitting here and i'm not taking it it's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that
[3:19:37.380 --> 3:19:42.020]  they're the good people keeping everybody safe but that's not what they're doing they are pulling
[3:19:42.020 --> 3:19:48.660]  america up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings our health our whole world and committing
[3:19:48.660 --> 3:19:57.940]  millions of third world people to death you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:57.940 --> 3:20:16.580]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:21.380 --> 3:20:25.220]  all right we're going to go to the numbers right now and we're going to look at
[3:20:25.220 --> 3:20:32.180]  covid 19 deaths versus other events and other causes of death but then also compare that to
[3:20:32.180 --> 3:20:37.860]  the number of deaths caused by well bad government and tyranny so let's get right to the numbers i've
[3:20:37.860 --> 3:20:43.460]  published a couple of charts today and yesterday on on my website natural news uh if you bring up
[3:20:43.460 --> 3:20:48.340]  one of those charts to the producers please the daily deaths in the united states by cause
[3:20:48.340 --> 3:20:54.740]  and what this shows is that yesterday the deaths from covid 19 at least as officially recorded i
[3:20:54.740 --> 3:20:59.300]  know there can be a little bit of debate about that but the numbers were well on april 14th
[3:20:59.300 --> 3:21:07.940]  they were 2407 people died on that day that was tuesday in the united states from covid 19 or
[3:21:07.940 --> 3:21:13.220]  coronavirus about 800 of those deaths were in new york alone which really is being overrun with
[3:21:13.220 --> 3:21:18.740]  dead people and you know mass graves and body bags everywhere in the hospitals and so on now that
[3:21:19.300 --> 3:21:24.980]  on that day that's the number one cause of death in america heart disease killed about 1700 on that
[3:21:24.980 --> 3:21:32.580]  day uh cancer about 1600 that's it's all cdc data just averaged out over the year accidents killed
[3:21:32.580 --> 3:21:39.300]  465 and other causes stroke all timers diabetes and so on notice at the bottom of this chart seasonal
[3:21:39.300 --> 3:21:45.700]  flu kills an average of 94 people per day if you average out the flu deaths across the year so on
[3:21:45.700 --> 3:21:51.540]  any given day in america about 94 people are killed by seasonal flu according to cdc statistics
[3:21:51.540 --> 3:21:59.540]  that's that's roughly about 33 000 or whatever it is 34 000 people a year so covid 19 is peaking
[3:21:59.540 --> 3:22:04.580]  we we hope this is the max that we're going to see we hope it's going to go down from here
[3:22:04.580 --> 3:22:11.300]  but right now nothing is killing more people in america than covid 19 but hold on this isn't over
[3:22:11.300 --> 3:22:17.620]  let's compare covid 19 to other events such as 9 11 natural disasters and so on i have another
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:24.740]  chart there that talks about a coronavirus versus 9 11 on 9 11 in that you could say rigged
[3:22:25.620 --> 3:22:32.580]  but real terrorist attack where airplanes hit the twin towers and then world trade center 7
[3:22:32.580 --> 3:22:38.740]  building 7 was brought down by demolition so think about the similarities here 9 11 was an
[3:22:38.740 --> 3:22:45.860]  engineered event that involved real deaths in order to rule out real tyranny the enhancements
[3:22:45.860 --> 3:22:49.620]  of the patriot act and domestic surveillance and so on that was used against the president trump's
[3:22:49.620 --> 3:22:55.940]  campaign by the deep state james comey you know robert mewler clapper and all these others and
[3:22:55.940 --> 3:23:01.380]  brock obama and so on so they use the 9 11 event which it's important to understand was a real
[3:23:01.380 --> 3:23:07.380]  attack with real deaths almost three thousand people according to official statistics died
[3:23:07.380 --> 3:23:15.380]  on 9 11 and they rigged another building world trade center 7 to to be dropped with demolition
[3:23:15.380 --> 3:23:19.860]  so we know they planned it we know they rigged it well now covid 19 the corona virus is also
[3:23:19.860 --> 3:23:27.060]  rigged in a sense it's engineered it was built as a bio weapon and the covid 19 deaths in the
[3:23:27.060 --> 3:23:34.260]  in the aggregate as of today are according to official numbers above 33,000 i think it's 34,000
[3:23:34.980 --> 3:23:41.060]  or thereabouts so it's over 10 times the number of deaths of 9 11 and also in that chart we show
[3:23:41.060 --> 3:23:46.580]  deaths from a hurricane maria and hurricane katrina los vegas shooting and all the way down to
[3:23:46.580 --> 3:23:52.020]  charlottesville which the left wing media went insane trying to use charlottesville to paint every
[3:23:52.020 --> 3:23:58.260]  trump supporter as a neo nazi charlottesville had a grand total of one death so think about the left
[3:23:58.260 --> 3:24:04.900]  wing media response to the charlottesville one death versus these other things like hurricanes
[3:24:04.900 --> 3:24:09.780]  and so on and how the disproportionate response from the media revolved around only one death now
[3:24:09.780 --> 3:24:15.700]  you might say well the left wing media is spreading mass hysteria you might say about the corona virus
[3:24:15.700 --> 3:24:22.900]  but what are they not talking about that's a far greater cause of death that is death by
[3:24:22.900 --> 3:24:29.620]  government death by bad forms of you know socialism communism governments go on a ride
[3:24:29.620 --> 3:24:34.100]  and so there's a study out of the university of hawaii that's been cited many times on this show
[3:24:34.100 --> 3:24:42.660]  it shows in the 20th century alone the bad governments killed 262 million people and that's
[3:24:42.660 --> 3:24:50.020]  in china it's in the soviet union it's in germany and so on it's it's wars and it's genocide and so
[3:24:50.580 --> 3:24:55.940]  what i'm actually going to do i'm going to publish a chart probably tomorrow that compares the corona
[3:24:55.940 --> 3:25:03.140]  virus deaths versus democide which is government deaths to show and i'm doing this over a series
[3:25:03.140 --> 3:25:07.380]  of days i'm trying to really put out good numbers so that people can understand the comparisons and
[3:25:07.380 --> 3:25:14.820]  understand relative risk and the risk of being killed by bad government throughout the last
[3:25:14.820 --> 3:25:22.740]  120 years is much higher than the risk of being killed by this corona virus even if the corona
[3:25:22.740 --> 3:25:30.100]  virus continues to spread democide is well in this article that's being shown on cmbc the third
[3:25:30.100 --> 3:25:36.580]  leading cause of death right now democide is dangerous so dangerous to us that if we allow
[3:25:36.580 --> 3:25:43.860]  these tyrants to take over our society because they use a real engineered event a real bioweapon
[3:25:43.860 --> 3:25:50.900]  that did come out of the uhan laboratory that did receive funding from obamas in i-h 3.7 million
[3:25:50.900 --> 3:25:56.420]  dollars went to that lab that lab was building a biological weapon that weapon got released i
[3:25:56.420 --> 3:26:01.860]  believe intentionally that weapon is devastating the world's economies and it's killing you know in
[3:26:01.860 --> 3:26:07.460]  the united states 33 000 people it'll probably be 60 000 in in a few months that number is still
[3:26:08.340 --> 3:26:13.780]  dwarfed by the number of people killed by bad governments 262 million people a quarter of a
[3:26:13.780 --> 3:26:20.500]  billion people and by the way as those deaths were happening in those years past that was a much
[3:26:20.500 --> 3:26:26.740]  larger percentage of the world population at the time than what you would think today as the world
[3:26:26.740 --> 3:26:33.380]  population i don't know what it was in you know 1925 or 1940 i i'm sure we obviously we could look
[3:26:33.380 --> 3:26:39.300]  it up but that world population was much smaller than the population today so in terms of per capita
[3:26:39.300 --> 3:26:45.220]  deaths carried out by governments throughout history they were enormous they were much larger
[3:26:45.780 --> 3:26:51.540]  than anything that you're seeing related to this corona virus and the reason i'm driving home this
[3:26:51.540 --> 3:26:58.100]  point is well it's it's threefold at least number one you've heard me disagree with those who say
[3:26:58.100 --> 3:27:05.140]  the corona virus is a hoax the virus is real just like in 9 11 the airplanes really did hit the twin
[3:27:05.140 --> 3:27:10.580]  towers those weren't holograms they use real planes and they sacrifice real people they killed real
[3:27:10.580 --> 3:27:16.740]  americans in order to achieve their narrative their goal of rolling out this patriot act surveillance
[3:27:16.740 --> 3:27:22.660]  state so remember these globalists they want to kill really about six billion human beings they don't
[3:27:22.660 --> 3:27:28.180]  mind killing 3000 to roll out a narrative they don't mind killing you know a million if that's
[3:27:28.180 --> 3:27:32.500]  how many die from this corona virus worldwide over the next year or two they don't mind killing a
[3:27:32.500 --> 3:27:37.860]  million people to them that's just getting warmed up that's like the bill gates warm up round at the
[3:27:37.860 --> 3:27:42.660]  batting cage you know they're swinging for billions of people to die they don't care if they kill a
[3:27:42.660 --> 3:27:48.820]  million just to establish control over your body with vaccine mandates they're just getting warmed
[3:27:48.820 --> 3:27:56.740]  up folks they their real goal is orders of magnitude larger than what they have achieved
[3:27:56.740 --> 3:28:01.620]  so far at least i don't know how many orders of magnitude we can do the math but they don't want
[3:28:01.620 --> 3:28:07.460]  to see just 30 000 people die they don't want to see 30 million people die they want to see probably
[3:28:07.460 --> 3:28:14.820]  three to six billion people dead and they can't accomplish that with a virus alone they can only
[3:28:14.820 --> 3:28:22.660]  accomplish it with the vaccine the vaccine is the death weapon that's the kill switch the corona virus
[3:28:22.660 --> 3:28:28.740]  has just been used to set up the vaccine that's what's going to take out humanity by the billions
[3:28:28.740 --> 3:28:33.700]  if we let them get away with it so that's that's the important message here much more straight
[3:28:33.700 --> 3:28:46.100]  ahead you're watching mike adams on the alex jones show we'll be back stay with us

[3:31:54.660 --> 3:31:59.860]  fight if others human beings don't resonate with what i'm saying if you don't spread the word if you
[3:31:59.860 --> 3:32:04.820]  don't buy the products to fund our operation the dog doesn't hunt but you get that you are
[3:32:04.820 --> 3:32:10.100]  patriots you are people that live and work in the real world of erase color create and understand
[3:32:10.100 --> 3:32:14.100]  what's happening and that's why when you call in and thank me for what i've done it's really a sick
[3:32:14.100 --> 3:32:18.660]  joke thank you for what you've done we're all of this together we believe in the rights of the
[3:32:18.660 --> 3:32:23.060]  unborn we believe in families we believe in the right to self-defense we believe in capitalism
[3:32:23.060 --> 3:32:29.460]  america and jesus christ number one and we believe in free speech and so the fact that you shop with us
[3:32:30.100 --> 3:32:34.260]  and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world
[3:32:34.260 --> 3:32:39.300]  that's why i salute you and i thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this
[3:32:39.300 --> 3:32:43.700]  whole planet sewn up by now they thought they'd be in charge they thought they would have won but
[3:32:43.700 --> 3:32:51.860]  they didn't count on you and i and others coming together so god bless you all
[3:32:51.860 --> 3:33:01.860]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:04.580 --> 3:33:11.860]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[3:33:12.420 --> 3:33:14.340]  it's mike adams
[3:33:14.340 --> 3:33:24.020]  in this segment and welcome back we're gonna talk about how to beat the virus and beat the tyranny
[3:33:24.580 --> 3:33:29.540]  that's the slogan for for today and i don't know call this maybe the the health ranger approach
[3:33:29.540 --> 3:33:36.100]  to how we beat all this beat the virus beat the tyranny because you see the goal of the globalists
[3:33:36.100 --> 3:33:41.940]  is to have built this virus released it to the world which they did and then keep it bouncing
[3:33:41.940 --> 3:33:48.340]  around and keep people infected until they can roll out a vaccine so they really want infections to
[3:33:48.340 --> 3:33:54.500]  stay high so that they can justify this mandatory vaccine which will be the kill switch for humanity
[3:33:54.500 --> 3:33:59.060]  by the way that's the depopulation weapon it may cause infertility it may cause deaths upon a
[3:33:59.060 --> 3:34:04.100]  secondary infection by some other disease that's released later so it could be a binary weapon
[3:34:04.100 --> 3:34:08.740]  system that's that's probably the way they'll they'll run it but if we beat the virus before
[3:34:08.740 --> 3:34:15.220]  they get a vaccine ready you see it's a race then it'll become obvious that the vaccine is irrelevant
[3:34:15.220 --> 3:34:21.060]  because we've beaten the virus so how do we beat the virus and this is why i've been arguing really
[3:34:21.060 --> 3:34:25.700]  so passionately about the fact that the virus is real it really is a biological weapon they
[3:34:26.260 --> 3:34:30.420]  they are really killing people with this thing so we have to take the virus seriously this is why
[3:34:30.420 --> 3:34:35.300]  i've just you know publicly disagreed with some people who say it's not real i believe it is real
[3:34:35.300 --> 3:34:40.820]  i believe that our path to victory is to first strategize how we beat this virus and so the
[3:34:40.820 --> 3:34:47.700]  way we do that is we get the infections really really low close to zero if possible across
[3:34:47.700 --> 3:34:52.260]  america and we do that with things that we've covered before you know nutrition but also
[3:34:52.820 --> 3:34:57.940]  reasonable social distancing here for a temporary period of time and wearing masks in public as we
[3:34:57.940 --> 3:35:04.020]  reopen the economy the good news in this is i believe that if if we are willing to just wear
[3:35:04.020 --> 3:35:10.260]  masks for a temporary period of time in workplaces and you know in the food factories and so on and
[3:35:10.260 --> 3:35:17.540]  is in public transportation i think that that really drops the r0 value of this virus below
[3:35:17.540 --> 3:35:24.100]  1.0 i can't prove it yet but i suspect it's true and the reason i suspect this is because of taiwan
[3:35:24.660 --> 3:35:29.540]  so taiwan you know where i live for a period of time my wife is from taiwan you know i speak
[3:35:29.540 --> 3:35:36.660]  mandarin chinese taiwan has beat this virus for the most part without resorting to lockdowns
[3:35:36.660 --> 3:35:42.420]  but taiwan model is actually the best model in the world and how did they do it especially given
[3:35:42.420 --> 3:35:47.620]  that they have very high density cities such as taipei right i mean i used to live in taipei very
[3:35:47.620 --> 3:35:54.020]  high density city a lot like new york city they've also got taijong and tai nan and other other cities
[3:35:54.020 --> 3:35:59.060]  that are very high density throughout throughout the island nation of taiwan how did they beat it
[3:35:59.060 --> 3:36:06.100]  they did it with wearing masks and also having good contact tracing and they really enforced
[3:36:06.100 --> 3:36:13.060]  quarantines of individuals who tested positive which is a necessary medical step to stop this from
[3:36:13.060 --> 3:36:20.660]  spreading and so if we can follow the taiwan model then i think we can beat this virus very quickly
[3:36:20.660 --> 3:36:25.860]  and we can get the number of cases down close to zero to the point where the vaccine proponents
[3:36:25.860 --> 3:36:31.220]  can't make the argument that everybody needs to be vaccinated because this thing is blown wide open
[3:36:31.220 --> 3:36:36.980]  and everybody's going to get infected no if we control the virus and we beat the virus by having
[3:36:36.980 --> 3:36:43.780]  the discipline and the medical knowledge to just say yeah masks are effective they work because a
[3:36:43.780 --> 3:36:48.980]  person who has the virus when they wear a mask they're not spraying out the virus every time they
[3:36:48.980 --> 3:36:55.140]  talk you know hey say it don't spray it bob you know some people they spit a lot when they talk
[3:36:55.140 --> 3:37:00.340]  we got to stop those people from spreading the virus and then secondly nutrition all the things
[3:37:00.340 --> 3:37:05.380]  we talked about elderberry and zinc and vitamin c and vitamin d and magnesium and turmeric and all
[3:37:05.380 --> 3:37:11.060]  those things that you know about that are not proven against the coronavirus but are very well
[3:37:11.060 --> 3:37:16.740]  known to help support natural immune function an immune response that your body needs i think
[3:37:16.740 --> 3:37:22.820]  that if we do those things and you know we we we have to control the borders we have to control
[3:37:22.820 --> 3:37:27.780]  incoming flights from countries that have a lot of infections you know we've got to control our
[3:37:27.780 --> 3:37:32.820]  borders use the military if necessary control the border especially by the way this thing's
[3:37:32.820 --> 3:37:37.940]  going to get out of control in mexico very soon i've actually been looking at this it's going
[3:37:37.940 --> 3:37:42.420]  to get bad in mexico it's going to get bad in brazil it's going to get bad on the african
[3:37:42.420 --> 3:37:48.740]  continent and certain african nations uh and in iran and and certain other places where it's not
[3:37:48.740 --> 3:37:55.540]  well controlled mexico has only just begun so probably this is my projection within about
[3:37:56.340 --> 3:38:02.500]  eight to ten weeks we're going to start seeing a lot of people who are infected in mexico
[3:38:02.500 --> 3:38:07.300]  attempting to cross the border into the united states and go to sanctuary cities where they can
[3:38:07.300 --> 3:38:12.980]  get free medical care because they know they're infected so they're going to be importing this
[3:38:12.980 --> 3:38:19.140]  disease into the united states in numbers that will demolish the the steps that we've taken to
[3:38:19.140 --> 3:38:23.940]  control it ourselves so you're going to have infected people walking through texas and new
[3:38:23.940 --> 3:38:28.660]  mexico and arizona and california seeking sanctuary cities this is why controlling the
[3:38:28.660 --> 3:38:33.540]  border is critical to controlling this disease and defeating the tyranny defeating the globalists
[3:38:34.100 --> 3:38:40.580]  so if there were ever a time to build the wall and deploy the military and control this border
[3:38:40.580 --> 3:38:45.860]  this is it president trump this is it you either protect the border now or you surrender our
[3:38:45.860 --> 3:38:51.300]  country to a wave of infections that's going to come in over the next few months mark my words
[3:38:51.300 --> 3:38:55.860]  it's coming it there's no question about it it's going to get out of control in mexico
[3:38:55.860 --> 3:39:01.300]  and by the way they they will not resort to lockdowns in mexico and not in any way that you've
[3:39:01.300 --> 3:39:07.860]  seen in new york and and connecticut for example because mexico the the workers there you know
[3:39:07.860 --> 3:39:14.100]  you can't disrupt their lives for 30 days because there's a lot of the low wage workers in mexico
[3:39:14.100 --> 3:39:20.260]  really depend on a daily payment or a once a week at the most just to be able to buy food and
[3:39:20.260 --> 3:39:25.060]  and survive and especially in rural mexico you can't lock those people down for 30 days
[3:39:25.060 --> 3:39:29.700]  they'll just have riots because they they can't go 30 days without starting to starve to death
[3:39:29.700 --> 3:39:36.900]  oh and i forgot to mention india the situation in india is going to get very bad this nationwide
[3:39:36.900 --> 3:39:43.620]  lockdown of the entire country of india with only a four hour notice this is leading to mass
[3:39:43.620 --> 3:39:48.820]  starvation by the tens of millions already by the tens of millions and it's going to be hundreds
[3:39:48.820 --> 3:39:54.580]  of millions in india soon there might be if this isn't ended this lockdown there might be more people
[3:39:54.580 --> 3:40:00.820]  starving in india soon than the entire population of the united states that's how bad it's going to get
[3:40:00.820 --> 3:40:07.380]  and those people eventually when you know nine meals from anarchy right when you're starving to death
[3:40:07.380 --> 3:40:12.580]  you're going to rise up if you can't eat and you're going to die anyway as a prisoner in your own
[3:40:12.580 --> 3:40:18.260]  home or apartment there's no risk of rising up and demanding your rights and your freedoms to
[3:40:18.260 --> 3:40:22.500]  go to work and earn a living and put food on the table and the people of india are probably going
[3:40:22.500 --> 3:40:30.100]  to approach that moment of of shared realization very soon maybe 60 days i don't i don't know how
[3:40:30.100 --> 3:40:37.300]  long it's going to maybe sooner a lot sooner so america even as we get this virus under control
[3:40:37.940 --> 3:40:41.700]  in america and we get the deaths way down we get the new infections way down
[3:40:42.260 --> 3:40:47.700]  there are going to be threats from outside this country especially mexico because they can walk
[3:40:47.700 --> 3:40:52.180]  across the border and you're going to have democrats of course arguing like governor neusam
[3:40:52.180 --> 3:40:57.220]  arguing oh we have to let these people come in we have to treat them he's given out free money
[3:40:57.220 --> 3:41:03.620]  to illegals all over california hundreds of millions of dollars of free money to illegals
[3:41:04.580 --> 3:41:10.740]  while the american people are suffering and dying in california not in huge numbers yet there
[3:41:10.740 --> 3:41:13.940]  hopefully they can keep that under control but the american people are suffering economically
[3:41:13.940 --> 3:41:20.740]  all over california why are you handed out money to illegals who didn't even pay taxes
[3:41:21.380 --> 3:41:26.660]  to income taxes maybe they paid sales taxes but not income taxes something is horribly wrong
[3:41:26.660 --> 3:41:31.460]  with that model it's going to be democrats arguing to let infected people into the country
[3:41:31.460 --> 3:41:37.220]  because they want to keep it going they want to keep the infections running they want to keep
[3:41:37.220 --> 3:41:43.380]  people dying and desperate and totally freaked out so they can roll out the global vaccine kill
[3:41:43.380 --> 3:41:49.860]  switch that's what this is all about is extending these infections and that's why i say our duty as
[3:41:49.860 --> 3:41:56.900]  patriots our duty as americans is to beat this virus quickly and that's how we beat the tyranny
[3:41:57.460 --> 3:42:03.060]  we beat the globalist by beating the virus so take your nutritional supplements where i'm
[3:42:03.060 --> 3:42:08.420]  asking public this is my my take on it i know some people disagree but i'm saying beat the virus we
[3:42:08.420 --> 3:42:13.620]  beat the tyranny so when the day comes that they roll out that vaccine and they they've got vaccine
[3:42:13.620 --> 3:42:18.100]  swat teams knocking on your door with a gun on your face here you're required to take this vaccine
[3:42:18.100 --> 3:42:24.260]  before that day comes we need to be able to say hey we've got this thing beat we don't need your
[3:42:24.260 --> 3:42:31.060]  your death weapon immunization system we've already beat this virus we did it as americans we did it
[3:42:31.060 --> 3:42:37.060]  with common sense approaches we don't need your death science medicine that's the strategy that's
[3:42:37.060 --> 3:42:41.860]  the health ranger strategy okay that's what i'm laying out there and i'll wrap this up in one
[3:42:41.860 --> 3:42:46.900]  more segment on the other side stay with me mike adams here for the alex joe show we'll be back
[3:42:46.900 --> 3:42:56.340]  after this break i'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the
[3:42:56.340 --> 3:43:02.980]  successes info versus that you're paying attention you know we've done together but i'll tell you this
[3:43:04.420 --> 3:43:10.820]  the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms
[3:43:10.820 --> 3:43:17.300]  of media they're trying to shutter and silence human resistance so now is the time to understand
[3:43:17.300 --> 3:43:21.140]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate and everything you warned your friends
[3:43:21.140 --> 3:43:26.420]  and family about us around to be true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power
[3:43:26.420 --> 3:43:33.700]  structures of silence those of us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence
[3:43:33.700 --> 3:43:41.540]  any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we have to
[3:43:41.540 --> 3:43:46.980]  make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come so be the
[3:43:46.980 --> 3:43:57.780]  polar bears you are now that this un global government shycom billable indicates medical tyranny
[3:43:57.780 --> 3:44:06.020]  has seen how far they can push it now we just laughed it up like like poison you know now
[3:44:06.020 --> 3:44:12.900]  they're gonna launch more bio attacks that are even more hardcore this early one does kill people
[3:44:12.900 --> 3:44:18.980]  but see it's a virus billable indicates own it's a virus that that's novel from others so they can
[3:44:18.980 --> 3:44:23.540]  give you a vaccine see a regular cold or flu virus you really can't do a vaccine for because it's
[3:44:23.540 --> 3:44:31.460]  always mutated but see because this is a chimera and lab made they can have a speciality so it's
[3:44:31.460 --> 3:44:36.740]  a whole giant franchise they get filthy rich off of it they can surveil everybody everybody gets
[3:44:36.740 --> 3:44:40.340]  to become a suspect and now when you would have low numbers of death it doesn't matter because
[3:44:40.340 --> 3:44:46.340]  they make a huge spectacle out of it you watch next year with the flu it'll even be bigger as well
[3:44:46.980 --> 3:44:49.780]  this is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots
[3:44:49.780 --> 3:44:57.060]  one of our best-selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four months
[3:44:57.060 --> 3:45:01.220]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited supply right now
[3:45:01.220 --> 3:45:05.060]  but it's selling out fast and i want those of you that haven't experienced living defense
[3:45:05.060 --> 3:45:09.860]  to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial i looked in january 2016 i went in
[3:45:09.860 --> 3:45:14.660]  a hospital i went to va hospital out here in boise and i was in until june and one of the only
[3:45:14.660 --> 3:45:20.260]  things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and i kept hearing
[3:45:20.260 --> 3:45:24.740]  dr group and all you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man i had an
[3:45:24.740 --> 3:45:29.940]  internal digestive problem and i stumbled with it for about five or six years and the doctors they
[3:45:29.940 --> 3:45:34.420]  tried every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and
[3:45:34.420 --> 3:45:37.940]  dr group and those commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking
[3:45:37.940 --> 3:45:41.300]  living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have
[3:45:41.300 --> 3:45:46.660]  us but i ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man
[3:45:46.660 --> 3:45:53.700]  that stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my life the america
[3:45:53.700 --> 3:45:57.780]  that we've known and loved the america that was the land of the free home of the brave is dying
[3:45:57.780 --> 3:46:03.860]  right now and everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us shutting us down and
[3:46:03.860 --> 3:46:09.380]  making us dependent on them the food shortages have begun the depression is going to be long
[3:46:09.380 --> 3:46:14.340]  and very very serious in fact it's probably too late now to even turn back trump tried to stop it
[3:46:14.340 --> 3:46:18.820]  but the mainstream media working with the tricombs blocked it that's why you and myself everybody
[3:46:18.820 --> 3:46:25.060]  else has to get prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus it's about the economic chaos
[3:46:25.060 --> 3:46:29.540]  that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year get your high quality storeable foods
[3:46:29.540 --> 3:46:34.660]  and info warshore.com they're available again before a limited time the food supply is running
[3:46:34.660 --> 3:46:41.700]  out there are major shortages this is a globalist siege a globalist lockdown globalist terrorism
[3:46:41.700 --> 3:46:46.420]  but we the people the patriots have to be prepared we've already been proven right about prepping
[3:46:46.420 --> 3:46:51.220]  so far we'll get ready to be really proven right get your storeable foods now at info warshore.com
[3:46:54.660 --> 3:46:57.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:46:57.300 --> 3:47:12.900]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:47:17.700 --> 3:47:23.380]  make no mistake no matter where we fall on the spectrum of concern about coronavirus or whether
[3:47:23.380 --> 3:47:29.620]  different people think it's real or fake or the deaths are high or low or the death certificates
[3:47:29.620 --> 3:47:34.820]  are real or fake or whatever wherever people are on that spectrum we're all on team humanity
[3:47:35.700 --> 3:47:39.860]  that's that's what we all have in common and it's clear that we are going to have to defeat the
[3:47:39.860 --> 3:47:46.180]  globalists as well as defeating the virus in order for humanity to have a future that is my
[3:47:46.180 --> 3:47:51.860]  focus i've spent the last couple of months really trying to warn people and wake people up to how
[3:47:51.860 --> 3:47:56.980]  deadly this biological weapon is and i think that's done i don't think there's anybody out there who
[3:47:56.980 --> 3:48:02.180]  doesn't know how dangerous this thing can be you know because most people know somebody at least on
[3:48:02.180 --> 3:48:07.540]  the east and west coast they know somebody who's either infected or has died from this because
[3:48:07.540 --> 3:48:12.500]  you know the number of deaths is getting so large but i don't think we have to keep trying to wake
[3:48:12.500 --> 3:48:16.740]  people up hey hey this is a biological weapon people get that now the bigger threat as i've
[3:48:16.740 --> 3:48:22.740]  said this entire hour here is the tyranny that's coming down the tyranny that's coming for you
[3:48:23.300 --> 3:48:28.180]  and how they're going to lock you up for as long as they can and starve you to death and make you a
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:33.940]  food slave because if you can't eat you'll give up everything eventually depending on how hungry
[3:48:33.940 --> 3:48:39.860]  you get you'll trade your rifle for a meal at a fema camp if it gets that bad and don't ever allow
[3:48:39.860 --> 3:48:44.820]  yourself to be in that situation that's when you do become a slave if you don't have a food supply
[3:48:44.820 --> 3:48:49.940]  if you can't take care of yourself then they've got you right where they want you so in this final
[3:48:49.940 --> 3:48:54.900]  segment today let me talk about a couple of things it's really crucial to know first of all
[3:48:55.540 --> 3:48:58.580]  i'm gonna i'm gonna make a commitment to you today i've been trying to get this done for a
[3:48:58.580 --> 3:49:03.620]  long time but by the time i come on next week i want to be able to show a special report just a
[3:49:03.620 --> 3:49:11.460]  a short video of how to make colloidal silver using silver eagles and silver rounds from the
[3:49:11.460 --> 3:49:18.180]  us mint and you know a lot of people use silver wires to make silver which is great it works but
[3:49:18.180 --> 3:49:23.060]  i've been doing a lot of experimentation i've actually scaled up industrial level colloidal
[3:49:23.060 --> 3:49:30.420]  silver production for my own purposes and i found that the higher the surface area of your silver
[3:49:30.420 --> 3:49:34.900]  anode and cathode which is really what it is because you put positive and negative current on them
[3:49:34.900 --> 3:49:43.220]  the higher the surface area the more you can make very tiny particle silver in other words silver
[3:49:43.220 --> 3:49:50.420]  wires are fine but if you use silver coins it's even better now the silver coins are not 99.99
[3:49:50.420 --> 3:49:56.740]  percent pure silver there are other elements in there but wouldn't you know it i've got a lab and
[3:49:56.740 --> 3:50:02.500]  i can test for heavy metals so what i'm about to do is actually make colloidal silver with
[3:50:02.500 --> 3:50:09.300]  silver coins send that to the lab and get an elemental analysis of what else is in it exactly
[3:50:09.300 --> 3:50:14.900]  is it you know is it zinc is it aluminum you know what is it if it's aluminum obviously we don't
[3:50:14.900 --> 3:50:18.580]  want to drink that because that that would be bad but you could still use it topically into
[3:50:18.580 --> 3:50:23.860]  sanitized surfaces and so on but what's actually in the silver coin we're going to find out man
[3:50:23.860 --> 3:50:29.140]  we're going to do the science on this and i i commit to you i i really hope i can keep this
[3:50:29.140 --> 3:50:32.420]  promise i guess depends on how crazy the world gets but i want to be able to bring you a video
[3:50:32.420 --> 3:50:37.860]  report next week here on this show this shows you how to make silver using silver coins and one of
[3:50:37.860 --> 3:50:44.660]  the key things is you have to reverse the electrodes every couple of hours and and you will turn your
[3:50:44.660 --> 3:50:51.300]  silver coins basically kind of black looking so you'll ruin them as currency okay but silver is
[3:50:51.300 --> 3:50:56.420]  not that expensive you know you get a silver coin for i don't know what 20 bucks or 25 bucks or
[3:50:56.420 --> 3:51:00.980]  whatever it is you just need two coins and you can do this and you just switch the polarity i'll
[3:51:00.980 --> 3:51:04.980]  show you how to do that in the video you just need three nine volt batteries and you need some
[3:51:04.980 --> 3:51:09.940]  alligator clips and then you need some clothes pins and you need a you need some deionized water
[3:51:09.940 --> 3:51:14.740]  which is basically distilled water so if you want to get some supplies ready for for that you know
[3:51:14.740 --> 3:51:19.060]  for that demonstration that's that's it that's the whole list get three nine volt batteries i
[3:51:19.060 --> 3:51:24.260]  like the lithium batteries get some alligator clips so you can clip on to the battery terminals
[3:51:24.260 --> 3:51:28.500]  and clip on to the silver coins you're going to need some clothes pins a little bit of wire
[3:51:29.220 --> 3:51:34.580]  a vessel like a jar you know like a wide mouth canning jar and some deionized water
[3:51:34.580 --> 3:51:39.380]  and that's it and you can make your own coloto silver you know dirt cheap one of the reasons
[3:51:39.380 --> 3:51:43.860]  i mentioned that too is because you know info wars was was really threatened heavily by the
[3:51:43.860 --> 3:51:49.860]  ftc and the fda for selling silver products the same products that are sold everywhere else and
[3:51:49.860 --> 3:51:54.260]  and because of that i don't even know the status i i think info wars temporarily may have pulled
[3:51:54.260 --> 3:51:58.420]  those products i don't know the status maybe they're back online i don't know but i think that every
[3:51:58.420 --> 3:52:04.740]  american needs to have this skill set because we may be in a civil war we may be in a situation
[3:52:04.740 --> 3:52:10.980]  where you gotta make an antibacterial medicine yourself at home this is a way to do it and so
[3:52:10.980 --> 3:52:16.100]  if you if you stockpile silver coins i mean think about how amazing this is out of the silver you
[3:52:16.100 --> 3:52:21.940]  can barter it's money it's a store of wealth and you can make medicine out of it are you kidding me
[3:52:21.940 --> 3:52:28.500]  yeah that's silver silver coins is the answer here of course it's hard to get silver coins right now
[3:52:28.500 --> 3:52:34.500]  but if you're willing to pay a premium you know maybe you pay $35 that's overpriced for compared
[3:52:34.500 --> 3:52:38.980]  to spot price but for the purposes of making medicine i mean i haven't done the math yet but
[3:52:38.980 --> 3:52:46.180]  i think you can make thousands of gallons of colloidal silver from just two silver coins i again i have
[3:52:46.180 --> 3:52:51.780]  to do the math but that would be thousands of gallons of maybe 20 parts per million silver
[3:52:51.780 --> 3:52:58.740]  i mean hardly uses any silver at all to make colloidal silver so and i'm not trying to hurt anybody
[3:52:58.740 --> 3:53:03.700]  out there that commercially sells colloidal silver i'm not this is not not some kind of veiled attack
[3:53:03.700 --> 3:53:08.020]  or anything i just want everybody to have this skill set it's important to be able to make
[3:53:08.020 --> 3:53:13.700]  our own medicine and to be more self-reliant uh and you know i say this is someone who myself we
[3:53:13.700 --> 3:53:19.620]  sell silver products but i'm maybe i'm hurting my own sales fine that's fine everybody needs
[3:53:19.620 --> 3:53:24.740]  this skill set and i'm sure alex would agree with that philosophy as well um and the reason
[3:53:24.740 --> 3:53:29.300]  you buy silver products from info wars store is because they've just done all the work for you
[3:53:29.300 --> 3:53:34.340]  i mean it takes work to do this yourself it's it's trouble you know and so commercial producers
[3:53:34.340 --> 3:53:38.740]  do it more conveniently and they have more you know standard quality controls and so on so
[3:53:38.740 --> 3:53:44.180]  if info wars store has silver that comes back online then definitely support info wars otherwise
[3:53:44.180 --> 3:53:52.580]  make it yourself uh i'm i'm i'm going to try to show you how to how to do that so uh anyway um
[3:53:52.580 --> 3:53:56.820]  and i say all that just as an independent person i don't have any financial ties to uh to the
[3:53:56.820 --> 3:54:02.420]  info wars store i'm just you know i'm just an independent commentator and so that that's just
[3:54:02.420 --> 3:54:07.460]  that that's just my independent uh opinions on that in case the regulators are watching you know
[3:54:07.460 --> 3:54:12.100]  i'm not here promoting any particular product i'm just promoting self-reliance i'm just trying
[3:54:12.100 --> 3:54:17.700]  to help people um you know get food supplies as well food is really crucial in all of this
[3:54:17.700 --> 3:54:22.660]  if there's food there may be food right now plenty of food in the country for people
[3:54:23.380 --> 3:54:28.660]  but it's not getting distributed and so you know if the food's not in your local grocery store what
[3:54:28.660 --> 3:54:34.180]  are you going to do about food supplies right now i i know that some officials in washington are
[3:54:34.180 --> 3:54:39.140]  saying there's plenty of food but it's not in all the stores so you've got to have food supplies
[3:54:39.140 --> 3:54:44.660]  squared away and that's part of how we beat the globalist right now too is we we have back up
[3:54:44.660 --> 3:54:50.740]  food supplies we do home gardening uh i'm hatching baby chicks as you know i've got i think 14 or 15
[3:54:50.740 --> 3:54:56.980]  chickens that have hatched so far to produce eggs in a few months i've talked about sprouting it's
[3:54:56.980 --> 3:55:01.700]  about food self-reliance you know the same thing you can make your own food it's it's you know pork
[3:55:01.700 --> 3:55:06.980]  plants are being shut down right and and food processors that use a lot of low-wage labor
[3:55:06.980 --> 3:55:10.900]  well a lot of those people don't want to take the risk of possibly being infected so they're staying
[3:55:10.900 --> 3:55:16.660]  home and a lot of the food processors are being shut down amazon is shutting down warehouses
[3:55:16.660 --> 3:55:21.860]  even right now uh from time to time you know temporarily because they they spot somebody
[3:55:21.860 --> 3:55:27.300]  with an infection so there's going to be disruptions in food supplies and so all these things i've
[3:55:27.300 --> 3:55:32.660]  talked about in this segment are things that you can do to increase your self-reliance and your
[3:55:32.660 --> 3:55:39.620]  readiness and your level of health and get a hold of you know the zinc pecolonate the zinc
[3:55:39.620 --> 3:55:45.940]  gluconate the you can get bulk zinc powders that you can blend into a smoothie just use a use a
[3:55:45.940 --> 3:55:50.660]  small amount you can overdose on zinc if you you know you don't want to put heaps of it in a smoothie
[3:55:50.660 --> 3:55:54.260]  so keep the dosing whatever's reasonable whatever's recommended by your doctor
[3:55:54.980 --> 3:56:01.140]  keep it reasonable but you can acquire that you can stockpile zinc and i find it interesting that
[3:56:01.140 --> 3:56:06.580]  we're living in a time when the table of elements provides so many answers for us whether it's gold
[3:56:06.580 --> 3:56:12.740]  or silver or zinc or you know copper copper has antibacterial properties it's used in some hospitals
[3:56:13.460 --> 3:56:19.460]  to kill superbugs on surfaces even you know these elements have amazing value to us and if we are
[3:56:19.460 --> 3:56:25.940]  just wise enough to understand what the elements are are used for and if we are wise enough to acquire
[3:56:25.940 --> 3:56:31.700]  them then we can really protect ourselves and that's i guess that's the ultimate message of what
[3:56:31.700 --> 3:56:37.060]  i'm all about here and i understand that you know my my opinions are pretty passionate from time to
[3:56:37.060 --> 3:56:42.660]  time that's because i i really i really care i have compassion for you i care about beating
[3:56:42.660 --> 3:56:48.100]  these globalists i care about human freedom i care about human health and you know i sometimes
[3:56:48.100 --> 3:56:53.860]  sometimes my passion can run a little hot i get it just like alex's can maybe maybe his runs a
[3:56:53.860 --> 3:56:58.500]  little hot more hot than mine from time to time but we're all passionate about team humanity here
[3:56:58.500 --> 3:57:04.500]  we want humanity to win we want humanity to survive and my job here on this show and i thank alex
[3:57:04.500 --> 3:57:09.220]  for allowing me to to be a fill in the host my job is to bring you the best and most accurate
[3:57:09.220 --> 3:57:14.100]  information that i can in in in the best way possible the most honest and transparent way
[3:57:14.100 --> 3:57:20.180]  possible that's what i'm here to do so i i pray for all of you listening today i pray for america
[3:57:20.180 --> 3:57:27.060]  god bless america god bless you do your part get prepared and we can defeat this virus and we can
[3:57:27.060 --> 3:57:33.700]  defeat the tyranny defeat the globalists and maybe we can protect america for generations to come
[3:57:33.700 --> 3:57:44.660]  this was mike adams the health ranger thank you for watching
