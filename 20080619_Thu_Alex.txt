[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.840 --> 00:15.680]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies
[00:15.680 --> 00:20.320]  and gentlemen welcome I am not Alex Jones I am Jason Burmese and I will be
[00:20.320 --> 00:25.440]  sitting in for the remainder of the week Alex should be joining us at some time
[00:25.440 --> 00:33.420]  today however if you didn't know Michael Reagan and his cronies have now had
[00:33.420 --> 00:39.400]  Mark Dice's YouTube account pulled that's right because Mark Dice posted
[00:39.400 --> 00:44.760]  that small little audio clip about Michael Reagan threatening his life and
[00:44.760 --> 00:50.320]  really the lives of all 9-11 truthers they've pulled his account and he's
[00:50.320 --> 00:54.800]  gonna come on to talk about that but there is a press release talk show host
[00:54.800 --> 00:58.240]  Michael Reagan files copyright infringement claim to remove audio clip
[00:58.240 --> 01:04.640]  of him calling for the murder of anti-war activist from the internet last week
[01:04.640 --> 01:08.120]  radio talk show host Michael Raiden called for listeners to track down and
[01:08.120 --> 01:14.000]  murder anti-war activist Mark Dice after Dice downloaded the show's free
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.640]  podcast and posted the three-minute and 21-second clip on YouTube Reagan filed a
[01:19.640 --> 01:23.960]  copyright infringement claim to remove the clip in an attempt to prevent it
[01:23.960 --> 01:30.000]  from circulating you see it was ending up in too many people's emailing email
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.280]  boxes and if this caught national attention I mean there's no way to save
[01:34.280 --> 01:41.120]  his job yeah Commission for our murders Friday June 13th Dice received a call
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.840]  from Reagan's producer demanding the clip be removed claiming they have they
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.640]  hold the copyright and Dice explained that falls under the fair use loss and
[01:48.640 --> 01:53.960]  the clip evident of the clip is evidence of a crime which it is the clip was
[01:53.960 --> 01:59.120]  available at the following euro URL until Wednesday June 8th at 343 Pacific
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.680]  Time Reagan also removed the entire hour of his show from his podcast directory
[02:03.680 --> 02:08.640]  so others can't download that part of the show and hear his streams or I'm sorry
[02:08.640 --> 02:12.400]  and hear his statements our two of the June 10th show is now missing from the
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.680]  directory located at radioamerica.org audio clips of Reagan statements may
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.920]  still be available on other YouTube accounts if someone searches for it
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.280]  Reagan statements were made after he heard that Dice and others were sending
[02:27.280 --> 02:31.840]  letters and DVDs to troops stationed in Iraq which supported the idea that the
[02:31.840 --> 02:35.960]  United States officials had allowed the 9-11 attacks to happen on purpose and
[02:35.960 --> 02:41.640]  aided in their execution for political leverage according to a 2006 Scripps
[02:41.640 --> 02:47.400]  Howard News Service Bowl 36% of Americans believe this
[02:47.640 --> 02:51.920]  and then there's the transcript of the statements I would probably try to play
[02:51.920 --> 02:55.400]  it from YouTube but I'm going to guess most of them are pulled it's it's pretty
[02:55.400 --> 02:58.120]  unbelievable and like I said we're gonna have Mark on in a couple minutes we're
[02:58.120 --> 03:03.400]  also going to have Jonathan from We Are Change Colorado on in the top of the
[03:03.400 --> 03:07.960]  hour in the second half and we're gonna be playing some of these urban warfare
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.760]  drills that are going on right now in Colorado we've been reporting on in the
[03:12.760 --> 03:17.040]  last few days then at noon we're going to have Barbara Lowe Fisher from the
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.440]  National Vaccine Information Center at one we're gonna have Bob Chapman and
[03:21.440 --> 03:27.080]  two we're gonna have Michael Markovich and I'm I'm hoping that Alex is gonna
[03:27.080 --> 03:32.480]  call in he is on vacation but you know let's let's let's get his opinion at
[03:32.480 --> 03:36.040]  least on these urban warfare drills I really feel like they're gearing up for
[03:36.040 --> 03:41.960]  something big at the DNC from trying to provocateur well meaning people into
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.440]  violence to rounding them up it really looks like they're gonna have their
[03:46.440 --> 03:53.360]  bases covered and this is scary to me you know I mean again Apache helicopters
[03:53.360 --> 03:59.360]  black hawks they're all being used right now so people who are like you know
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.760]  that's black helicopter stuff Jason I don't want to hear it well black
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.480]  helicopters unfortunately do exist it's a simple Google search away they've been
[04:08.480 --> 04:16.480]  in America for some time now okay it's time to stop being in denial it's time
[04:16.480 --> 04:21.640]  to show people this it's time to say hey wait a minute maybe this shouldn't be

[07:54.960 --> 08:01.160]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:01.160 --> 08:09.200]  folks we're back it's the Alex Jones show and joining us now is Mark Dice of
[08:09.200 --> 08:16.280]  the resistance and Mark why don't you just just tell the people what happened
[08:16.280 --> 08:19.720]  your YouTube account how upsetting it is and and how you may not be able to
[08:19.720 --> 08:25.360]  recover this stuff now listen I my entire YouTube account is gone I had
[08:25.360 --> 08:29.680]  probably over 60 different videos with I think millions of views some of them
[08:29.680 --> 08:34.760]  were up into the multiple hundreds of thousands they are all gone permanently
[08:34.760 --> 08:41.720]  suspended account permanently deleted now I don't know if they were able to
[08:41.720 --> 08:45.560]  pull some strings and get the entire account deleted or if I had exceeded my
[08:45.560 --> 08:51.120]  quota of so-called copyrighted material on there but this just goes to show
[08:51.120 --> 08:56.320]  that this guy this crown it's just scrambling to try to try to dump any
[08:56.320 --> 09:00.000]  evidence of his crime and of his statements down into the memory hole I
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.720]  checked a couple other YouTube videos yesterday of his statements and another
[09:04.720 --> 09:08.560]  one was removed due to terms of service violations or whatever I don't know if
[09:08.560 --> 09:13.920]  that entire account was closed so I just think it would be an interesting
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.560]  phenomenon if everybody would start downloading the the videos that are
[09:17.560 --> 09:23.240]  there and just continue to post them and let's get hundreds of these things out
[09:23.240 --> 09:26.560]  there also like you mentioned in the in the beginning of the show he removed the
[09:26.560 --> 09:30.400]  entire podcast of that day which is a free podcast
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.480]  we've removed it from the podcast directory Tuesday June 10th the second
[09:35.480 --> 09:40.040]  hour is mysteriously now missing from the podcast directory on the bottom of his
[09:40.040 --> 09:46.240]  page also my entire appearance on his show is missing the entire hour if not
[09:46.240 --> 09:51.360]  the entire day I believe it's actually the entire day Monday's show is gone not
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.080]  available for download so this crowd is scrambling trying to claim copyright
[09:56.080 --> 10:02.080]  infringement when the podcasts are freely available downloadable from his site so
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.940]  apparently it's okay for people to download the podcast from his site but
[10:05.940 --> 10:10.240]  not on YouTube and like I said his producer Brett last Friday told me that
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.400]  their lawyers wanted the clip pulled I said that they own the copyright and I
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.320]  had clearly stated that it was fair use and he did he decided to apparently take
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.160]  some action against it and this is just disgusting what's even more disgusting
[10:24.160 --> 10:28.200]  is nobody in the press has covered this issue yet nobody nobody in the mainstream
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.960]  press has covered this issue a few stories on Google news and so I at this
[10:33.960 --> 10:39.600]  point I'm just going to continue to use this as a as an engine and as a reason
[10:39.600 --> 10:45.760]  to just ramp up things ramp up the effort here man and somebody called in the
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.720]  other day on on the show suggested that we use my space as an outreach tool so
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.320]  let's expand operation and form the soldier and again I don't want this to
[10:55.320 --> 10:58.840]  overshadow operation and form the soldier so you can go on my space and
[10:58.840 --> 11:02.440]  I think they changed the menu items a little bit but you can search under
[11:02.440 --> 11:05.880]  friends or you can browse used to be able to just click the search and the
[11:05.880 --> 11:08.640]  browse feature you can find out and search people in different cities
[11:08.640 --> 11:12.120]  different countries you can search for people in Iraq you can come up with
[11:12.120 --> 11:15.880]  countless marines and we can befriend them we can email them videos and links
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.400]  and then all kind of stuff to become directly communicating with them so I
[11:20.400 --> 11:24.280]  just I'm so frustrated right now I want to thank everybody out there for their
[11:24.280 --> 11:27.560]  support and I want to thank you Jason and I just want to also to my happy you
[11:27.560 --> 11:31.280]  you're doing a great job telling and for Alex Jones I know a lot of us if we
[11:31.280 --> 11:34.360]  couldn't tune into the show in the morning to get our our daily dose of the
[11:34.360 --> 11:37.240]  news I don't know what we would do so I just want to say you're doing a great
[11:37.240 --> 11:40.560]  job everybody out there is doing a great job and it's not just me that Michael
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.680]  Reagan wants to kill he wants to kill all of you everybody who's listening to
[11:43.680 --> 11:47.280]  this show right now Michael Reagan and the neocons and this these Nazis want
[11:47.280 --> 11:52.440]  you all dead absolutely and that's why we're gonna be giving out radio America's
[11:52.440 --> 11:57.840]  presidents contact information yet again today if you want to email Jim Roberts
[11:57.840 --> 12:01.840]  and let him know you're very upset that Michael Reagan still has a show and has
[12:01.840 --> 12:06.960]  not been reprimanded for his actions it is Jay is in the letter Roberts at
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.760]  radioamerica.org or Jay Roberts at AmericanVeteranCenter.org and I might
[12:12.760 --> 12:16.200]  say that if you're gonna throw those emails out you might want to email
[12:16.200 --> 12:20.520]  YouTube and let him know how upset you are that Mark Dice's account has been
[12:20.520 --> 12:25.440]  pulled when you know he's part of the media folks he's a media critic he's an
[12:25.440 --> 12:29.920]  author you know he's had a radio show he's a pundit he puts out press releases
[12:29.920 --> 12:35.400]  there is no excuse for them pulling an entire account over a three minute clip
[12:35.400 --> 12:41.280]  which he has more than enough right to use seeing he's in it so if you want to
[12:41.280 --> 12:47.880]  give them a call it is 703-302-1000 over at radioamerica.org and let
[12:47.880 --> 12:51.880]  him know how pleased displeased you are that again they're letting their hosts
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.720]  threaten our lives and then they're trying to cover it up after the fact they
[12:55.720 --> 12:58.640]  don't want this to be a national news story they're doing everything in their
[12:58.640 --> 13:06.000]  power Mark to try to put this down the little the blackout trail I mean they
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.560]  don't want this as a national news story they haven't wanted this national news
[13:09.560 --> 13:12.520]  story from the very beginning because I number one I think that he knows he can
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.600]  he can legally be reprimanded he might even do some jail time maybe even some
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.600]  probation and this guy is a guy that probably has never had to go through
[13:20.600 --> 13:24.040]  that in his entire life he looks like a pampered guy he doesn't know what the
[13:24.040 --> 13:27.600]  value of human life is obviously when he's saying that he needs to take
[13:27.600 --> 13:33.000]  grenades and put it up baby's bottoms the man is a very sick man he's called
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.320]  for the hanging of Howard Dean yeah he wants to blow up little babies in in the
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.200]  Middle East and then kill all the mothers as well and this is an
[13:41.200 --> 13:45.680]  opportunity for us to really affect the change to hold somebody accountable to
[13:45.680 --> 13:50.000]  get them fired you know we we tried to get him to push impeached Dennis
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.680]  could send inches is introduced the articles of impeachment it seems that
[13:53.680 --> 13:56.920]  these guys can get away with so much and just let it slide and let it slide but
[13:56.920 --> 14:01.520]  here we have a chance to get somebody held accountable on one level to get them
[14:01.520 --> 14:06.640]  to lose their job to lose their propaganda platform and also I just want to
[14:06.640 --> 14:09.760]  thank everybody so much I just can't believe that I'm stuck in the middle of
[14:09.760 --> 14:13.040]  this and this is just distracting me from getting the resistance manifesto
[14:13.040 --> 14:16.600]  revised edition out but this is something that needs to be done and also
[14:16.600 --> 14:19.600]  please if everybody wants to call the mainstream press and just demand that
[14:19.600 --> 14:23.480]  this story be covered because I spent hours and hours emailing everybody
[14:23.480 --> 14:26.960]  calling new stations and nobody's covered this nobody at all the only
[14:26.960 --> 14:28.760]  people who've called me have been a couple
[14:28.760 --> 14:34.200]  uh... left-wing radio stations in and fairness in media reporting from website
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.840]  i don't know how popular they are
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.920]  uh... but nobody's covered this and so if we just continue to call the fox
[14:39.920 --> 14:44.320]  news studios and even the left wing you would think that msnbc or or uh...
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.120]  somebody in these these more liberal networks would be able to cover this and
[14:48.120 --> 14:50.480]  expose this criminal for what he is but
[14:50.480 --> 14:55.040]  that this is just beyond the pale and i want to just continue to use this as an
[14:55.040 --> 14:56.600]  excuse to show
[14:56.600 --> 14:59.440]  uh... that these are criminals that they can get away with what they want to
[14:59.440 --> 15:02.880]  do so we need to just prevent that in radio america and i was been getting
[15:02.880 --> 15:04.200]  hundreds of calls
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.560]  the fcc's been getting dozens of complaints probably hundreds
[15:07.560 --> 15:11.360]  i was on the phone with the fcc trying to find out what the process is for the
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.560]  complaint and they said it can be quite a lengthy process
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.600]  and they're gonna be sending me a letter explaining what the consequences so
[15:18.600 --> 15:22.920]  hopefully we can get this criminal fired we can get the fcc to levy a couple
[15:22.920 --> 15:26.200]  hundred thousand dollar fine against radio america
[15:26.200 --> 15:27.560]  i mean when howard stern
[15:27.560 --> 15:30.800]  uh... got a couple million dollar fine just for making some
[15:30.800 --> 15:32.320]  some kind of sick jokes

[20:31.280 --> 20:35.520]  receive a free engine treatment which is a twelve ninety five value free

[24:27.240 --> 24:33.280]  doing is posting really up protection and commenting on I mean again this is the

[24:55.560 --> 24:59.120]  overshot overshadow the program that we're putting together for the troops
[24:59.120 --> 25:04.760]  we still want people to reach out to soldiers in Iraq through both my space
[25:04.760 --> 25:09.680]  and mail and send these people care packages with information about what's
[25:09.680 --> 25:14.600]  really going on in this country mark we speak to that really quickly yeah like
[25:14.600 --> 25:18.720]  I said we're getting the letters and DVDs to the soldiers a lot of times you
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.480]  can send them a package under 13 ounces for five bucks if you use a US priority
[25:23.480 --> 25:29.000]  mail envelope and you can also get their addresses you have to get a specific
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.360]  address from them there's a couple different services that will do that
[25:32.360 --> 25:37.840]  adopt a us soldier org is one or you could just Google how to write letters
[25:37.840 --> 25:41.680]  to soldiers how to pack send packages to soldiers and if you don't have the
[25:41.680 --> 25:44.720]  money if you don't want to send the postage and if you can't copy DVDs and
[25:44.720 --> 25:49.040]  things there's a couple other services letters to soldiers org and they'll
[25:49.040 --> 25:52.760]  connect you with a with an email of a soldier over there you can use your my
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.280]  space page and and browse the friends list and browse the country of Iraq or
[25:58.280 --> 26:02.640]  browse different groups find Iraq veterans groups and you can email these
[26:02.640 --> 26:08.200]  people directly and that's that's really what caused this this hatred in this
[26:08.200 --> 26:11.240]  call to have a kill this because we're taking it up to a new level here we're
[26:11.240 --> 26:15.400]  not just informing other people about what's going on we're going straight to
[26:15.400 --> 26:18.680]  the troops straight to the ones that are risking their lives that that are
[26:18.680 --> 26:23.880]  having their lives put in danger based on these these lies I mean all of us are
[26:23.880 --> 26:28.720]  affected by 9-11 and by the loss of our freedoms but nobody else more so than
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.600]  the people that are being shot at and and and having bombs thrown at them and
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.800]  and really risking their lives and being killed and maimed and leaving their
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.920]  families for months and months at a time to secure this country and and many of
[26:42.920 --> 26:47.520]  them you know are believed that they're they're supporting president Bush
[26:47.520 --> 26:51.720]  believe that this is a just cause and so if we could just reach out to them I
[26:51.720 --> 26:57.240]  think that that's the last frontier of uninformed people and once we become
[26:57.240 --> 27:01.280]  friends with these people once they become informed as the circumstances
[27:01.280 --> 27:05.880]  and once we create a climate over there where people can address these issues I
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.960]  think that this entire war is going to come crumbling down and once the
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.240]  soldiers start joining 9-11 truth and more veterans for truth organizations
[27:14.240 --> 27:18.080]  then we can really get somewhere we can start getting this country and this
[27:18.080 --> 27:23.680]  world back on track we can prevent any more false flag attacks or minimize them
[27:23.680 --> 27:27.320]  and we could start holding these criminals accountable so that's what
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.320]  operation and form the soldiers is all about so again you can just Google
[27:31.320 --> 27:36.600]  information on how to send packages DVDs and once again you might not want to
[27:36.600 --> 27:40.040]  send a DVD in a package because somebody might go through this just to make
[27:40.040 --> 27:43.360]  sure because there are certain items that are not supposed to be sent over
[27:43.360 --> 27:48.720]  there pornography alcohol and other items so somebody might go through the
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.040]  packages so just label the DVD a cool Hollywood film that's still in theaters
[27:53.040 --> 27:56.520]  or just got released or just say hey here's some movies for you guys and
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.840]  let's get it out to the soldiers and send them some care packages and some
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.800]  some other goods to help make their time over there a little more a little
[28:04.800 --> 28:08.400]  easier on them and maybe some board games and some other things and also you
[28:08.400 --> 28:11.320]  could find lists of items that the soldiers need that'll help make their
[28:11.320 --> 28:15.760]  their tours over there a little bit easier for them that's right the more
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.320]  fun you make these packages the more likely it's going to be that these
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.400]  people watch the videos and say you know what this person's obviously concerned

[33:58.640 --> 34:04.360]  Colorado martial law drills these urban warfare training drills black
[34:04.360 --> 34:10.840]  helicopters ex-military current military police all intertwined detention centers
[34:10.840 --> 34:14.520]  and from what I'm watching in the videos I mean you can watch these
[34:14.520 --> 34:20.320]  helicopters flying over going from roof rooftop to rooftop in different
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.800]  scenarios they're dropping glow sticks with pro-america propaganda on them
[34:25.800 --> 34:31.960]  and here with us joining us to discuss this is Jonathan from We Are Changed
[34:31.960 --> 34:39.080]  Colorado Jonathan are with me do we not have Jonathan yet oh all right well
[34:39.080 --> 34:44.600]  hopefully we'll be going to him soon but but if you want to see the videos right
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.920]  now they're posted over at loosechange911.com and it's pretty
[34:48.920 --> 34:55.840]  incredible stuff I mean downtown Denver it has been turned into this urban
[34:55.840 --> 35:03.480]  warfare training center it's it's pretty wild to watch these guys landing on
[35:03.480 --> 35:08.360]  rooftops of businesses jumping out of these things like all hell's broken loose
[35:08.360 --> 35:14.080]  and I don't know I haven't seen anything like it since the police state films by
[35:14.080 --> 35:19.520]  Alex Jones and it is very unnerving to watch these guys in full black
[35:19.520 --> 35:24.200]  uniforms they're not supposed to be talking to anybody the mainstream press
[35:24.200 --> 35:30.120]  doesn't seem to be covering it at all they do have one short local news clip
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.640]  intertwined in these YouTube clips I guess the one report about the
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.960]  helicopters being in the air but what they can't follow up on it I mean
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.480]  seriously they know the helicopters are in the air they don't they don't want to
[35:44.480 --> 35:47.480]  drive down 20 feet to see what's going on on the ground they don't want to take a
[35:47.480 --> 35:54.520]  look at these urban warfare training exercises I just don't understand it just
[35:54.520 --> 35:57.360]  don't understand it
[35:59.160 --> 36:03.520]  well hopefully we can get Jonathan on because he is our eye he's uh he's our
[36:03.520 --> 36:07.440]  eyes and ears on the ground here at the the Info Wars team right now when it
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.440]  comes to these drills Jonathan are you there what's going on man hey man alright
[36:12.440 --> 36:16.200]  so you've posted these videos I'm sure they're gonna be doing stories on them
[36:16.200 --> 36:21.080]  on info wars and prisonplanet.com but why don't you just sum up what you've
[36:21.080 --> 36:25.680]  been doing the last two days and why well we're chasing around these black
[36:25.680 --> 36:29.720]  helicopters originally the news did not report on it they were actually not
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.640]  allowed and we actually have our Monday night we are change meetings and one of
[36:34.640 --> 36:40.400]  our members Turtle was on his way to the meeting and he literally saw a black
[36:40.400 --> 36:47.440]  helicopter flying right over his car on the 525 and there were dudes hanging off
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.600]  there were chain guns I mean it looked like some out of the movie and he was
[36:51.600 --> 36:54.320]  like swerving and stuff and he showed up to the meeting and he was like dude I
[36:54.320 --> 36:57.320]  felt like this guy from the movie conspiracy theory I thought they were
[36:57.320 --> 37:01.800]  coming after me and we were like yeah yeah whatever later of course that night
[37:01.800 --> 37:06.120]  we went out and there they are training landed on buildings using live fire we
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.360]  posted the videos firing paint rounds firing some kind of another kind of
[37:11.360 --> 37:14.720]  lethal weapons we're not sure what the projectiles are but we showed images and
[37:14.720 --> 37:19.120]  pictures of what we found all throughout Denver abandoned buildings being
[37:19.120 --> 37:24.520]  converted into detention facilities everything so we immediately decided to
[37:24.520 --> 37:28.960]  check it out found out that military is conducting drills exercises all week long
[37:28.960 --> 37:34.240]  in Denver and when this began by the way this this began over over the weekend on
[37:34.240 --> 37:38.640]  Monday when did this start to happen well they recently did a bio warfare
[37:38.640 --> 37:43.240]  exercise a couple weeks ago and then there was a bunch of military trucks and
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.320]  black SUVs and white SUVs with tenor windows downtown at the convention
[37:47.320 --> 37:51.560]  center with on the side of their vehicles that said weapons of mass
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.240]  destruction civil response team yeah and that was part that was part of the
[37:56.240 --> 38:02.120]  scenario where a dirty bomb went off and 20,000 people were killed outside and
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.760]  inside of the the center and that's where of course the DNC is going to be
[38:07.760 --> 38:13.880]  held and then exactly and then then they basically needed a way to get all
[38:13.880 --> 38:19.080]  these bodies and injured people to the hospital and it was it was like when did
[38:19.080 --> 38:23.040]  they start that exercise I want to say they did it right on right on Tuesday was
[38:23.040 --> 38:27.240]  when that one started correct yeah I mean the whole and then of course these
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.200]  drills that they're conducting all week every night we've been following them
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.560]  around they evacuated 1600 Broadway which is the Colorado State Building it's one
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.800]  of Denver's largest buildings Blackhawks were landing on the roof all night last
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.000]  night jumping from buildings to buildings of course we got footage of this
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  people were protesting and the media is for the most part remaining silent now
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.200]  there was a couple of reports on it the other night I posted them in the video
[38:51.200 --> 38:56.120]  and everything's on truth lines everything's on loose change blog it's
[38:56.120 --> 38:59.360]  only a change Colorado org side starting to get out there we have the
[38:59.360 --> 39:04.560]  exclusive video folks 23 minutes I added it down from 8 hours of footage we we
[39:04.560 --> 39:08.440]  basically split up in four teams and just drove around looking for these
[39:08.440 --> 39:11.200]  things because we knew we knew they were flying around they're not telling us
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.600]  where they are so the video is basically like storm chasers except we're
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.640]  chasing these black helicopters and we ended up discovering one of the
[39:20.640 --> 39:25.440]  facilities which is a staging ground for a detention facility the old children's
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.520]  hospital on 21st and downing in Denver that's funny because you see that you
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.480]  see them landing on that facility and it's got like a big smile on it's it's
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.920]  pretty ridiculous it is ridiculous the whole building's fenced off barbwark
[39:37.920 --> 39:40.880]  there's security around it we actually just went up to the yesterday to see if
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.440]  there'd be any training there and I'm not joking Jason about maybe 10 seconds
[39:45.440 --> 39:50.280]  in this car screeches right around us and this guy runs out he's got a bad
[39:50.280 --> 39:53.040]  joint okay what are you doing you got to get away from the fence and we got to
[39:53.040 --> 39:56.400]  sell on camera like hey man we're just we just want to know if there's any black
[39:56.400 --> 39:59.480]  helicopters today we're just spectators is that you guys got to get out of here
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.200]  right now and it was it was I couldn't believe how fast he was honest we were
[40:04.200 --> 40:07.800]  just walking up to the fence well why don't you talk about these out why don't
[40:07.800 --> 40:12.720]  you talk about these little pro propaganda glow sticks they're dropping
[40:12.720 --> 40:17.760]  with American flags yeah they're it's almost like they're practicing either
[40:17.760 --> 40:22.280]  we we're not sure if they're fragging or practicing flashbangs or tear gas or
[40:22.280 --> 40:26.120]  riot control we don't know but as the helicopters fly low and this is all
[40:26.120 --> 40:30.760]  throughout the city they're dropping these like glow sticks with us army
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.720]  patches and American flag patches zip tied around them and like kids are going
[40:35.720 --> 40:38.840]  to pick them up and people are like oh cool the military's dropping these on us
[40:38.840 --> 40:44.160]  and we're the only ones that are like you know that could be anything that could
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.220]  be a test for you know who knows what they're dropping on it's totally
[40:48.220 --> 40:53.280]  conditioning it's basically come to say hey we're the good guys we're here to
[40:53.280 --> 40:57.920]  help look we're gonna assist you and they're doing a urban warfare exercise
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.240]  where they're literally again rounding up dead bodies and probably quarantining
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.280]  areas and they have to prep the rest of the people to know that the military is
[41:06.280 --> 41:10.480]  in charge so they're gonna drop these little leaflets or whatever and I've
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.640]  seen them you know again they're posted and it just looks it looks unreal it
[41:15.640 --> 41:21.080]  doesn't even it doesn't even look like America anymore it literally is unmarked
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.680]  helicopters apaches and black hawks flying around the cities landing on
[41:26.680 --> 41:32.440]  rooftops you know soldiers jumping out and not in military garb you know you
[41:32.440 --> 41:37.840]  can't tell whether their army navy marines national guard they're in black
[41:37.840 --> 41:43.240]  uniforms and they're all working together not a movie it does if we thought
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.200]  it was like you know it you know what it looks like it looks like one of those
[41:47.200 --> 41:51.520]  supervillains in an actual Hollywood action film and he's like about to rob a
[41:51.520 --> 41:54.800]  bank or something and here's his black helicopters in his little mercenary
[41:54.800 --> 41:58.280]  crew because they're all on mark and they've got by the way they're all
[41:58.280 --> 42:02.920]  holding weapons with live fire and so when when they're landed everyone's I
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.080]  mean when we were filming it there were children screaming people were running
[42:06.080 --> 42:09.560]  nobody knows because there was no there's no forewarning nobody knows
[42:09.560 --> 42:12.200]  where they're drilling nobody knows what they're exercising they're just going
[42:12.200 --> 42:15.160]  where they want throughout the city the Denver Police Department we spoke to
[42:15.160 --> 42:20.000]  Sonny Jackson the spokesperson for the DPD and he said yep you know they don't
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.240]  tell us and we just kind of comply and they're you know they're doing anti
[42:23.240 --> 42:27.880]  terrarials and it's for your safety and I was like are you kidding me in the
[42:27.880 --> 42:31.360]  whole thing is nuts the whole city is under martial law right now well some
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.800]  some law officers actually know that this is bad news and have known this was
[42:35.800 --> 42:40.880]  bad news for years and have refused to have this type of thing come to their
[42:40.880 --> 42:44.480]  city and when they refuse they just do it anyway but at least those people have
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.720]  the foresight to know it's bad and more in the people you know but when they
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.600]  get a compliant officer like that who honestly believes that this is for our
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.720]  safety this is nothing more than a domestic takeover drill this is nothing
[42:58.720 --> 43:05.240]  more than to try to put the kibosh on our First Amendment this summer outside
[43:05.240 --> 43:10.840]  of the DNC which is going to be held from August 25th to the 28th you know we
[43:10.840 --> 43:14.760]  already know the only group that has a permit to protest there stems from a
[43:14.760 --> 43:20.240]  group who called for violence for God's sakes for who called for red paint to
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.920]  be thrown on people with cameras cameras destructions to bring a shield to wear
[43:24.920 --> 43:30.760]  armor total provocateur bull nonsense and they basically just changed their
[43:30.760 --> 43:35.520]  name and they're gonna be there they're gonna try to provocateur something they
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.480]  would love to see something pop off so these black helicopters are flying
[43:39.480 --> 43:44.120]  around during the DNC but so the riot police have carte blanche to do whatever
[43:44.120 --> 43:50.040]  they want and so that the people with a real voice and a real issue are nowhere
[43:50.040 --> 43:57.280]  near the Democratic convention at all you know and I see that as the whole
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.800]  deal I mean they're prepping it just in time we're in June mid-June we're two
[44:01.800 --> 44:06.240]  months away from this from this really it's gonna be a historic event whether
[44:06.240 --> 44:09.680]  you like it or not you know a lot of people are brainwashed by the talking
[44:09.680 --> 44:13.720]  points they've put out there but there is a very good possibility that we may
[44:13.720 --> 44:19.000]  have not only our first African-American president but possibly our first woman
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.080]  vice president you know he hasn't chosen officially yet but we all know what
[44:23.080 --> 44:27.280]  happened during the Bilderberg conference this year you know magically
[44:27.280 --> 44:32.440]  Jonathan Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton secretly meet in northern
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.560]  Virginia on the night that Bilderberg kicks off in guess where northern
[44:36.560 --> 44:41.480]  Virginia his press secretary is on a plane saying well Barack wanted to go
[44:41.480 --> 44:45.160]  to some secret meetings with some people that he didn't want the press around
[44:45.160 --> 44:52.080]  really huh that's interesting but nobody on that plane had the foresight to put
[44:52.080 --> 44:55.880]  two and two together and come up with four Jonathan that's that's my big
[44:55.880 --> 45:01.000]  issue with that those guys acted all upset all up with the press corps you
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.200]  said we were going back to Chicago you know and instead of instead of writing
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.360]  a real story they're just like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama meet with
[45:09.360 --> 45:13.600]  senator Diane Feinstein at her home okay that might not be true they were at
[45:13.600 --> 45:17.960]  Hillary Clinton's house in DC all right that might not be true they were at an
[45:17.960 --> 45:23.160]  undisclosed location you know it's it's just amazing the spin they put out and
[45:23.160 --> 45:28.240]  the fact that they don't even want to pursue the real story exactly and then
[45:28.240 --> 45:32.800]  the whole city you know for the DNC coming up we've noticed already
[45:32.800 --> 45:39.640]  facilities that are set up as temporary grounds for we're not sure what but
[45:39.640 --> 45:43.960]  there's two major facilities that there's tents being set up there's fencing
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.680]  we're gonna be posting a video tonight from what we shot yesterday that's not
[45:48.680 --> 45:53.120]  out yet blackhawks were landing on rooftops the tallest buildings in
[45:53.120 --> 45:58.280]  Denver but they look like like sniper teams or something but looks like
[45:58.280 --> 46:02.360]  there's a detention facility about 10 blocks from the convention center and
[46:02.360 --> 46:05.320]  the whole convention center by the way the National Guard in Colorado is gonna
[46:05.320 --> 46:10.440]  be protecting that and the entire convention center has 10 foot fences
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.080]  that they're building around it with gate and anybody who wants to get near it
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.760]  has to be bust in they approach these gates the gates open you enter and then
[46:18.760 --> 46:22.520]  the gates close and in order to get on this bus you have to have a pass the
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.440]  press is going to be basically embedded behind these big 10 foot fences
[46:26.440 --> 46:30.480]  I'm about a quarter mile in to the convention center in this huge
[46:30.480 --> 46:35.640]  Auschwitz looking like facilities actually the convention so all these
[46:35.640 --> 46:39.760]  demonstrations are going to be way outside of it in free speech zone you
[46:39.760 --> 46:44.200]  know up to two miles away they've got detention facilities set up to house
[46:44.200 --> 46:48.720]  people they got black helicopters training to drop who knows what they're
[46:48.720 --> 46:51.600]  planning to drop on us but you know could be tear gas could be could be
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.640]  anything we don't know they've got sound beam weapons they've got riot gear
[46:55.640 --> 47:00.440]  there's $50 million the city's spent on security forces and new equipment the
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.080]  whole city I'm not joking Jason looks like they're preparing for war it's
[47:05.080 --> 47:11.520]  nuts absolutely and if there was a better time to join we are change it
[47:11.520 --> 47:16.440]  couldn't be any closer to now if you're a listener out in Colorado and you're
[47:16.440 --> 47:20.920]  upset with what you're hearing with what you're seeing because you live in
[47:20.920 --> 47:27.840]  Denver well I got some news for you it's time to step up and join we are
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.880]  change step up to the plate take a swing take a shot at the title you know I
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.040]  mean what is stopping you from activating you know Jonathan doesn't do
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.760]  this you know for money or for fame he does this because our Constitution and
[47:40.760 --> 47:44.440]  Bill writes hang in the balance our very way of life hangs in the balance and
[47:44.440 --> 47:49.920]  the more and more we let this criminal elite get away with provocaturing
[47:49.920 --> 47:56.760]  events to make the people look bad and make authority look good because you
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.080]  know what you could have a dozen people die at this DNC and it'll be justified
[48:01.080 --> 48:06.600]  and it'll be the police saved us you know again they tried to provocateur
[48:06.600 --> 48:12.240]  violence already at this thing red paint wear a mask bring a shield destroy
[48:12.240 --> 48:16.440]  cameras the demonstrations are even more outrageous there was there's
[48:16.440 --> 48:19.840]  demonstrations to surround the federal courthouse there's demonstrations to
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.840]  bust any legal immigrants and have them riding in front of the Capitol building
[48:24.840 --> 48:28.640]  there's one demonstration to surround the Denver Mint which is only one of I
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.560]  believe three coin meant me not in the United States with which has actually we
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.720]  have some footage of that that is only about a block away from the convention
[48:37.720 --> 48:41.000]  center it's right across the street from the city and county of Denver
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.120]  courthouse it's on its caddy corner to the city's jail right across street from
[48:46.120 --> 48:51.200]  the brand-new jail they're building it's dead center into a whole world of police
[48:51.200 --> 48:55.520]  headquarters and one of the demonstrations that were set up was to
[48:55.520 --> 48:59.680]  surround this Denver Mint and attempt to levitate the building and that's the
[48:59.680 --> 49:04.960]  words from the group that's planning it and you know you can't bend you can't
[49:04.960 --> 49:09.920]  touch that fence without being they can shoot you I mean it's a federal facility
[49:09.920 --> 49:14.520]  and I mean and just surrounding the federal courthouse and demanding the
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.680]  the release of prisoners on death row that demonstration is asking for trouble
[49:18.680 --> 49:21.560]  every single one of the demonstrations that I've seen that these groups
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.640]  planning is nothing to do about messages I don't even know what the messages are
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.640]  to be honest with you just looks like they're at their agitational they're
[49:29.640 --> 49:34.240]  aggravated looks like they're provocative it puts demonstrators in a
[49:34.240 --> 49:37.880]  dangerous proximity to police it looks like they want to make Rush Limbaugh's
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.280]  dream come true of riots in Denver I mean when the neocons are calling for
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.120]  riots in Denver you better watch out especially somebody as high level as
[49:47.120 --> 49:51.000]  Rush Limbaugh who's an obvious operative I mean you don't just get
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.000]  caught smuggling in a bunch of Viagra to go outside of the country without your
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.880]  wife by the way I wonder what he was doing with all that and all these other
[50:00.880 --> 50:04.760]  pain pills and it just goes under the radar you know I mean this guy's a
[50:04.760 --> 50:10.120]  hardcore drug addict and he's taking them across country lines nothing happens
[50:10.120 --> 50:15.360]  well that's because you have a rush pinball yeah we really appreciate it
[50:15.360 --> 50:20.560]  and that guy you know and the truth is people like Rush Limbaugh and and this
[50:20.560 --> 50:24.160]  this Mike Reagan you know these guys what they don't get is they're the
[50:24.160 --> 50:27.960]  minority right now if no idea how big this movement's getting and they better
[50:27.960 --> 50:32.760]  pick a side because they're on the wrong one now absolutely it's we are

[52:24.480 --> 52:30.000]  this story ties into that and was told by my old friend and colleague pastor
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.160]  Earl Jones in his November 1st 2001 Christian intelligence newsletter
[52:35.160 --> 52:40.440]  pastor Jones was a courageous Christian soldier as well as a soldier in World

[52:45.000 --> 52:50.120]  researcher and in his study and research he discovered what Pope Anaclete the
[52:50.120 --> 52:57.720]  second did and what he was in 1130 he was the first Perione to become Pope of
[52:57.720 --> 53:02.480]  the Catholic Church up until that time the Catholic Church was entirely
[53:02.480 --> 53:08.280]  different than it is today it was Pope Anaclete the second who got rid of the
[53:08.280 --> 53:13.200]  ancient rite or shall we say changed the ancient rite so that it no longer
[53:13.200 --> 53:18.560]  worked what is that ancient rite that Rids demons what was the change Pope

[54:03.560 --> 54:11.400]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went higher and
[54:11.400 --> 54:21.360]  it burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of fire and it burns burns burn
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.480]  the Alex Jones show I am Jason Bermas I'll be sitting in with for Alex for the
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.560]  rest of the week you want to get at me it's myspace.com slash Jason Bermas I've
[54:30.560 --> 54:34.080]  been getting a ton of emails and a ton of great tips so I thank all you guys
[54:34.080 --> 54:37.760]  that are getting ahold of me and not not whining and or knitting but actually
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.640]  throwing me news so I can throw it on this program and bring it to all of you
[54:42.640 --> 54:48.160]  look if you're in Colorado if you're close to Denver now's the time to join
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.960]  we are change Colorado I believe the website is we are change colorado.org
[54:52.960 --> 54:58.440]  and if you don't live in Denver if you're outside of Denver if you're outside of
[54:58.440 --> 55:02.480]  Colorado altogether you can still help by donating to these young men and
[55:02.480 --> 55:06.960]  women because without them we're not going to get true coverage of the DNC
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.800]  and they're the only ones on the ground I'll guarantee it with this type of
[55:10.800 --> 55:15.080]  footage this should be all over the place when you when you see these YouTube
[55:15.080 --> 55:19.480]  videos of these black helicopters flying around everywhere and I promise you
[55:19.480 --> 55:24.520]  will be extensive coverage at prison plan info wars later you start to
[55:24.520 --> 55:30.440]  realize that they do have a plan here that it's not a constitutional plan and
[55:30.440 --> 55:36.200]  that it's not a plan that's going to be good for the average person some people
[55:36.200 --> 55:39.600]  are emailing and saying oh well they only have a few helicopters well remember
[55:39.600 --> 55:43.680]  black helicopters didn't exist 15 years ago and there's so many more of us if
[55:43.680 --> 55:48.200]  they tried something well we'd be able to fight back really because those sound
[55:48.200 --> 55:52.980]  weapons look like they put off 20 to 30 people at a time with no problem and just
[55:52.980 --> 55:57.400]  type in sound weapons CNN over at YouTube and you can watch the clips and
[55:57.400 --> 56:01.000]  the people are like yeah it feels like your whole body's on fire for a second
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.680]  that's great Jonathan why don't you tell people how they can get involved what's
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.360]  the website if they can't join we are change how can they donate we have a
[56:10.360 --> 56:14.800]  donations model on the we are change colorado.org website and we also have
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.320]  truthlines.net as a donations module up there those two sites are connected
[56:20.320 --> 56:23.680]  basically the same members on both truth lines is a little bit more
[56:23.680 --> 56:28.320]  international membership and basically we're the only two Denver groups next
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.280]  to Colorado 911 visibility and we are we're gonna be covering everything we
[56:33.280 --> 56:37.800]  can at that DNC we've got about 60 people who have pledged to be down there
[56:37.800 --> 56:41.280]  we're setting up legal viewers we're getting press passes we're trying to
[56:41.280 --> 56:46.560]  get basically little convoy set up so we don't get harassed or abused by the
[56:46.560 --> 56:50.040]  police but we want to get in there so we can cover whatever's gonna go down and
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.000]  so we're coordinating basically a plan to go throughout the city we need money
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.840]  we need help most of us are all working Americans as normal we don't have much
[56:59.840 --> 57:05.200]  money on the side anything helps a dollar helps you know we also hand out
[57:05.200 --> 57:11.320]  800 DVDs a week up to that much so one of the most powerful things we can do
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.560]  is start educating I handed out DVDs yesterday to security guards and people
[57:15.560 --> 57:21.480]  who were running the drills over at the old children's hospital. What DVDs
[57:21.480 --> 57:26.600]  do you hand out? I always hand out we have our own multi DVDs but we hand out
[57:26.600 --> 57:33.000]  anything from terror storm to loose change America freedom to fascism end game
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.320]  Washington your fired American drug war those are the DVDs we're handing out in
[57:39.320 --> 57:45.120]  mass we also have compilation DVDs that basically have all those on there so
[57:45.120 --> 57:49.400]  we're trying to hand out information right to the hands of these people we're
[57:49.400 --> 57:54.160]  talking to security guard who was at the fence at this abandoned hospital and I
[57:54.160 --> 57:57.400]  handed them DVDs and he you know he seemed really interested that was the
[57:57.400 --> 58:01.040]  great thing I can't tell you how many people we woke up that were running up
[58:01.040 --> 58:05.360]  to these helicopters to see what they were doing they had no idea what they
[58:05.360 --> 58:07.920]  were there and we even asked people Jason you're gonna love this we asked
[58:07.920 --> 58:11.960]  people you know what do you think about it some people were so brainwashed that
[58:11.960 --> 58:15.520]  they were saying things like oh it's fine it's great yeah they have all the
[58:15.520 --> 58:18.600]  rights they can do whatever they want I love it they have no idea about the

[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:41.160]  vaccinations are the best thing since breakfast now no one's saying that I
[1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:45.760]  don't want to become immune to disease that I don't think we should be
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:52.440]  protected from things like you know smallpox although that's way out there
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:57.560]  chickenpox you know I'm not really in favor of the booster shot I remember
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:01.120]  the last time they tried to give me a booster shot I was like nope sorry not
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:05.120]  taking a booster shot doc and it was funny because the doctor had seen a loose
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:10.200]  change and we were kind of talking shop before that he was asking me you know
[1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:14.920]  what what did I do other than this and where where do I go and you know what's
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:20.000]  the experience been and he was a fan of the movie and we started talking he's
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.040]  like well I see that you you haven't had a booster shot since you went to college
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:26.320]  I'm like yep and he's like maybe we should give you one of those and I'm
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:30.560]  like I don't think so doc I'm not gonna be taking any vaccinations today and he's
[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:34.600]  like really why why is that and I'm like how many times have they been caught
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:37.760]  putting on mercury and the vaccines among other things and he's talking to
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:42.800]  him goes oh are you talking about the thimerosal and and I'm like yeah and he's
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:46.080]  like I thought they took that out of most of them I'm like come on doc I'm
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:49.880]  like take a take a read on the thing most of them still have thimerosal in them
[1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:52.960]  and he's like well what what are you worried about I'm like well it causes
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:58.440]  autism in children and brain damage and mercury is a poison and he's like so
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:01.160]  wait a minute what are you you're scared you're gonna get autism at this age I
[1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:06.640]  go no I just don't need my IQ to be lowered and I don't need to get sick from
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:10.080]  some kind of poison they put in there I mean let's let's be honest they've been
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:15.920]  caught putting SV 40 in the vaccinations Simeon virus 40 the cancer
[1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:21.280]  causing virus and that's why there's been a lot of encouragement at least to
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:26.360]  me and others who know about this issue in the past year when Jenny McCarthy
[1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:30.080]  who's dating Jim Carrey one of the biggest stars on the planet has come
[1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:33.920]  forward she wrote the book louder than words she went on Oprah Winfrey and
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:41.240]  exposed that her child became autistic after taking a round of shots quote
[1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:46.340]  unquote bad shots yeah right there they're all bad okay there's no good
[1:02:46.340 --> 1:02:50.240]  ones you know and this has been a recurring theme on some television shows
[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:55.560]  I'm a big fan of the shield on FX and one of the subplots is that he has an
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:03:01.440]  autistic son and indeed his son became autistic through the vaccinations and
[1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:06.320]  they were going through a struggle to get some kind of a lawsuit together so it
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:09.120]  is starting to hit the mainstream people are waking up and you know they're
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:12.480]  waking up when Time magazine on its cover a couple weeks ago on the June
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:16.720]  2nd edition they have a baby with a needle about to go in his arms saying
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:21.200]  the truth about vaccines worried about autism many parents are opting out of
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:24.760]  immunizations it's right up till that point and then they're saying how they
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:28.440]  are putting the rest of us at risk see we're the bad guys when we know what's
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:33.200]  going on with the vaccines that being said we have Barbara Lowe Fisher on the
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:39.560]  line of nvic.org Barbara how are you I'm just great how are you I'm very well
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:43.160]  and I'm going through some of your material right here well why don't you

[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.080]  National Vaccine Information Center had children who were injured or had died
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:06.720]  from the effects of vaccination and we felt that we didn't want to give out
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:12.000]  information that was anchored with scientific references and and also that
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:16.160]  that talked about what happens to children after vaccination they can
[1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:22.520]  reach us and at www.nvic.org that's for National Vaccine Information Center
[1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:26.720]  we also have a new website standupbeacannad.org because we've launched
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:34.480]  a national effort to raise funds to do a public education campaign that will
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:38.680]  alert parents to the to the risk of vaccination and the fact that their
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:43.080]  civil liberties are being threatened in this area. We'll be back after the break

[1:07:55.320 --> 1:08:00.080]  because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:08.160]  all right folks we're back with Barbara Lowe Fisher of MVIC.org an
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:14.000]  organization that started up in 1982 so they've been fighting this this battle
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:20.520]  for over 25 years now wow Barbara you said that most people in your
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:24.080]  organization got involved through basically vaccinating their children
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:29.080]  and them having an adverse reaction to it and mostly becoming autistic I mean
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:32.720]  this has been a real struggle for this to gain a mainstream acceptance in any
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:36.800]  way shape or form but I've seen in the last year 18 months with you know
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:40.960]  celebrities like Jenny McCarthy writing a book called Loudland Words her her
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:45.160]  boyfriend Jim Carrey and her marching on Washington them having them on Oprah
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:49.240]  Winfrey that that this issue is starting to get big and people are starting to
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:53.960]  take notice well it's interesting those of us back in the 80s we had children who
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:59.040]  were brain injured by the DPT vaccine and we work for 14 years to get a safe
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:03.600]  for vaccine in here for America's children but during the last 25 years we
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:08.080]  have seen a more than tripling of the numbers of doses of vaccines that the
[1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:12.440]  government tells us our children have to get we are the most highly vaccinated
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:16.200]  population in the world we force our children to get more vaccines than any
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:20.120]  other country in the world and during that same time period we have seen this
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:24.440]  incredible increase in chronic disease and disability among our children as we
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:29.000]  vaccinated them more and more now one six and one of six American child is
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:34.160]  learning disabled one in nine has asthma one in 100 to 150 is diagnosed
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:39.480]  autistic and one in 450 child is diabetic we have an epidemic of
[1:09:39.480 --> 1:09:42.720]  chronic disease and disability even though we're vaccinating our children
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:48.040]  more now more than ever so those of us in the 1980s our children suffer brain
[1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:51.840]  inflammation after DPT vaccine and what we're seeing now is children are
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:55.960]  getting sometimes 8 to 10 vaccines on one day and then they're regressing into
[1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:00.800]  poor health and the autism see back when we started autism was affecting like
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:05.800]  two in 10,000 children it was just not the problem it is today but as we've
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:09.000]  seen this more and more vaccination we have seen the numbers of autistic
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:13.520]  children grow so my child was not rendered autistic he he suffered a brain
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:17.840]  inflammation within hours of his fourth DPT shot at age two and a half and he
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:21.880]  suffered a mild brain dysfunction took the form of multiple learning
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:25.760]  disabilities and attention deficit disorder because the vaccine induced
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:30.680]  injury can can run the gamut from the milder forms which is learning
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:36.640]  disabilities ADHD through to autistic behaviors mental retardation seizure
[1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:40.760]  disorders and of course the most severe consequences death and what we're
[1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:45.080]  seeing is doctors are sticking their heads in the sand and when they give
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:49.600]  all these vaccines to children and the children regressed into poor health they
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:53.360]  are denying that the vaccines had anything to do with the children's
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:58.080]  regression into poor health and this we've seen over and over again with each
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:01.760]  new vaccine that comes into the schedule doctors saying oh you know when
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:06.200]  your child suffer paralysis or seizures or or you know regressed into
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:10.280]  autism that didn't have anything to do with the vaccines we just gave your
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:15.720]  child and it's it's it really tragic it to sit here for a quarter century and
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:21.040]  watch this happen over and over again absolutely however I do think that this
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:24.880]  year there was a landmark case where they did have to admit that the
[1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:29.840]  vaccinations did cause autistic like symptoms they wouldn't cop to the fact
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:34.800]  that it actually caused the child's autism but it did say that it was the
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:39.080]  vaccinations I forget how they worded it they said it attacked some kind of a
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:42.920]  I want to say Michael Connery or something like that mm-hmm yeah yeah do you
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:47.000]  know about it tell the list I do know about that the Hannah polling case but
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.120]  what's interesting about that case is the media kind of made a big deal of it
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:56.480]  even though there had been cases prior to the Hannah polling case that was
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:01.120]  awarded compensation through the vaccine injury compensation program under a law
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:05.600]  that was passed in 1986 that that I and my organization worked on actually back
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:11.160]  in the 1980s there have been awards previous for DPT vaccine induced brain
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:15.240]  inflammation that is you know brain inflammation after DPT where the kids
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:20.360]  have have become autistic but they've never been talked about it was always
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:25.440]  kept kind of hush hush well with the Hannah polling case that their parent
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:29.320]  the parents were medical professionals he had been an urologist at Johns
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:34.520]  Hopkins and she was a nurse who then became a lawyer and I think it became
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:39.240]  a very high-profile case and it was part of a case in the omnibus hearing that is
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:43.120]  looking at autism and vaccines and whether or not autistic children should
[1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:46.960]  be compensated under this vaccine injury compensation program when they
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:51.240]  conceded because the government conceded this case what they basically were
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:56.080]  saying well you know Hannah had a pre-existing medical condition that just
[1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:00.600]  made her more susceptible to the I think she got seven or nine vaccines on one
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:05.760]  day I can't remember exactly and that made her it and yes her brain
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:10.360]  inflammation could be considered to be an autism could be considered to be
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:14.720]  connected with it but Hannah's parents are saying they don't believe that she
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:18.640]  had the mitochondrial disorder prior to the vaccination they believe those
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:23.640]  vaccines may have triggered that disorder absolutely and then and then the
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:28.040]  other big question that I get all the time you know I wake my friends up I
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:32.680]  wake my family up I have a little niece myself and even my brother is like well
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:37.320]  how do I go about them not vaccinating my kid because they tell me it's the law
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:41.960]  they tell me I have to vaccinate my child and I always say to them well you
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:44.360]  have to be stern with these people you have to say you know there's a
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:48.360]  conscientious objective waiver and that you want to see this and your kid isn't
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:52.720]  going to take the vaccination how do you tell people to go about keeping it away
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:59.000]  from their kids well on our website at mdic.org we have all the state laws and
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.360]  the regulations governing vaccine laws because vaccine laws are state laws
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:06.880]  they're not federal laws even though the federal government the Centers of
[1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:11.520]  Disease Control health officials make federal vaccine policy that then is made
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:15.920]  into law at the state level it is your state that makes your vaccine laws so
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:20.080]  you need to go on and click on we have a map and you click on to the map and you
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:24.000]  can read about what what are the vaccine laws and what are the exemptions in your
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.800]  state that you're allowed to take in all space there is a medical exemption that
[1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:34.360]  has to be written by a medical doctor or a doctor of osteopathy if those are very
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:38.520]  hard to get because the government and the American pediatrics have so narrowed
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:42.600]  the contraindications to vaccination that is the reasons why you shouldn't
[1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:47.120]  vaccinate that almost no child qualifies for a medical exemption and when
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:50.920]  doctors do try to make right medical exemptions they're often questioned by
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:54.840]  health officials in the state and harassed then there are all but two
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:58.160]  states that have a medical exemption I mean I'm sorry a religious exemption to
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:02.680]  vaccination Mississippi and West Virginia don't have a religious exemption in
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:06.520]  some states are very narrow in their definition of what qualifies for a
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:10.160]  religious exemption and others are wider so you really need to read the law and
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:15.280]  what you need to do to file that and then there's a in about 17 states there's a
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:19.840]  philosophical personal belief or conscientious belief exemption those are
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:24.200]  the states in this country that come close to conforming to the ethical
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:27.960]  principle of informed consent that is that you have the right as a health care
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:31.880]  consumer to know the benefits and risk of a medical intervention and be able to
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:37.600]  make a free voluntary decision about it and if you belong or live in one of
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:43.120]  those states you're very lucky and that the thing is that a lot of leading
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:48.080]  doctors and medical organizations are calling for an end to religious and
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:52.360]  philosophical or conscientious belief exemptions they want nothing but the
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:56.240]  medical exemption to be enforced in this country and the National Vaccination
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:00.600]  Information Center has been sounding the alarm for 25 years we've been saying
[1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:04.440]  America you've got to wake up you're about you're going to have your right
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:09.960]  taken away from you to make voluntary vaccination decisions the American
[1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:14.040]  Academy of Pediatrics in the last few days has written the letter to all of its
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:17.840]  members they are the organization that represent pediatricians in this country
[1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:23.480]  and they basically have have said we are going to fight the parents who are
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:28.480]  trying to make vaccination choices that don't conform to government and to the
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:34.960]  AAP policy they are going to mount a national campaign advertising and
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:39.800]  public education campaign to try to well I think they're going to try to
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:45.120]  demonize people who want to make voluntary choices you know right now the
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:51.680]  government says our kids are supposed to get 69 doses of 16 vaccines from birth
[1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:59.200]  from the day of birth through age 18 that's a phenomenal amount of
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:04.520]  vaccinations and we've never ever done this to our children and in all of our
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:10.280]  history we have never exposed our children to so much atypical manipulation
[1:17:10.280 --> 1:17:15.240]  of the immune system through vaccination and so I think that people have got to
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:20.800]  really be vigilant and monitor what their state legislatures do we try to get
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:25.280]  the information out to people I have a vaccine e-newsletter that I send out
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:29.600]  weekly to try to keep people up-to-date on what's happening in your state what's
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:33.600]  happening nationally about this very important issue that affects every child
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.960]  in this country and every family in this country the AAP is suggesting that
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:42.520]  doctors throw out parents who refuse to vaccinate according to that what they
[1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:46.960]  say they should do that that is refused to treat them to refuse to treat the
[1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:51.520]  children and when you get this kind of a harsh stance by the pediatricians of
[1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:56.880]  this country you know that we are definitely in a very difficult situation
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:02.080]  that is it's like a war absolutely in the mainstream media uses such
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:06.960]  propaganda and lies to try to demonize us such as this time magazine cover where
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:11.360]  they say we are putting the rest of you at risk and then they just make the
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:14.720]  blatant lie in here that one in a hundred and fifty the prevalence of
[1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:18.880]  autism among eight-year-olds in the US autism rates have not declined even
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:22.280]  though thimerosal which some believe contributes to the disease was removed
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:26.520]  from the vaccines in 2001 it hasn't been removed from the vaccines but what
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:32.040]  happens is if you tell them that you want a non thimerosal vaccination they
[1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:35.960]  can order it for you and then you can take that one but it's still in the
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:39.840]  majority of the vaccines out there isn't it well it's it well it is still in the
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:45.480]  full strength in the influenza vaccine that the CDC now says every single
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:51.240]  child from age six months through 18 has got to get every year that is it has the
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:55.480]  full amount it is still in the dip there your tetanus shot which children get if
[1:18:55.480 --> 1:19:01.000]  they don't get DP DT AP it has been reduced to trace levels in most of the
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.240]  other childhood vaccines but you know if you're giving a child every single year
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:09.880]  a mercury-containing vaccine and that child happens to be susceptible to not
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:14.160]  being able to genetically susceptible for example to not being able to
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:18.440]  efficiently excrete mercury from the body you can really be setting that child
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:23.480]  up from some for some serious problems yes the that the autism rate has
[1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:29.560]  continued to climb climb even though they have reduced to trace levels in the
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:35.240]  in a lot of the vaccines that are given to children since about 2002 but the
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:39.240]  problem is is there are many other components of vaccines that could also
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:43.160]  be causing brain inflammation all right it's Alex Jones show we'll be back

[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:52.280]  and barbara we're in a final short segment with you here
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:55.160]  what is your advice to everybody out there listening
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:58.920]  well what should they do to protect their children they've got to become
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:02.360]  educated about vaccines they can't just blindly trust their doctor
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:05.960]  unfortunately they need to understand vaccines have toxic
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:08.920]  components in addition to mercury aluminum phenoxyethanol
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:13.240]  bromaldide there are many many vaccines that are recommended that have not been
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:17.160]  properly tested pre-licensure because the standards have become so lax at the
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:20.600]  federal level and because these companies are really having a free hand
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:24.600]  in getting these vaccines produced and like and licensed and then recommended
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:28.360]  for use by all children you got to become an educated healthcare consumer
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:32.520]  and that means becoming an edge educated about vaccination before you take your
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:36.680]  child in for a for a shot and how can people support you and your
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:40.760]  organization well we are really trying to raise money for the stand-up be counted
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:45.160]  campaign so we can matter national education campaign to counteract
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:49.160]  the campaign by pharma and industry i mean by the pharmaceutical companies and
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:52.040]  the medical organizations and government that are trying to say these
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:55.480]  vaccines are totally safe and effective don't worry about it just do what we
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:58.840]  say so they can go to stand up be counted dot org
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:03.000]  and make a donation we've got dbd we can send them we've got bumper stickers
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:07.240]  says no forced vaccination not in america you know that is our that is our
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:10.760]  mantra now we we should not be forced in this country to take a pharmaceutical
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:14.600]  product like a vaccine without our voluntary informed consent and what do
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:17.880]  you think the the best tools are what are the best books and videos on the
[1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:21.560]  subject that are out there oh gosh there are so many on our website at
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:24.840]  nbic.org we list some of them we've got links to all sorts of other
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:29.160]  organizations to that offer information i mean there are so many now that it's
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:33.720]  it's difficult to pick to pick them so i would just you know you're gonna i mean
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:37.960]  i do believe in the university of google i think that you can get some fantastic
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:42.120]  information on the website and and you need to become educated and we have
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.360]  your building now with it with the internet
[1:26:44.360 --> 1:26:48.040]  to be able to get information we never could before you can do medical
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:51.800]  research on the internet and get medical studies that that you would have had to
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:55.640]  go into a medical library like i had to do in the in the in the 80s in order to
[1:26:55.640 --> 1:26:59.480]  write the book i wrote dpt a shot in the dark in 1985
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:05.080]  you you can become your own expert on on vaccination and indeed any health care
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:09.080]  intervention that your doctor is is suggesting your child undergo
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:12.760]  absolutely the information age is an is an amazing time and
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:17.720]  i'm with you i i also believe in the university of google and yahoo and
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.440]  you know all these different sites and tools
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:23.800]  obviously you have to weave through the information but it's never been in our
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:28.040]  fingertips like it has before literally cdc papers are out there
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:33.160]  i i mean there's just so much great stuff and it's also easier to reach out
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:36.520]  to your family and friends through email it's so easy to
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:41.320]  embed a seven-minute uh youtube video where parents are being threatened with
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.560]  jail time if they don't vaccinate their kids
[1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:47.400]  uh i mean it's just so easy to share this information if you're motivated to
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:51.160]  do so yes indeed become an educated consumer that is
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:54.680]  what what we need we can't be afraid of the truth about vaccination
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:57.240]  we have it's been hidden from us for too long
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:00.440]  we have to embrace it and we then have to put pressure on our
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:03.880]  politicians and on our health officials officials to change it
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:08.680]  so that we can minimize a vaccine entry you know one of my big things is that
[1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:12.680]  i explained to people unfortunately we live in this consumer obsessed
[1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:17.480]  society where we're more apt to take advice from a celebrity
[1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:22.120]  than a medical expert or a scientist or a physicist
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.480]  on on various issues we always want you know the person that's been on
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:28.360]  television and that's why i think it was so important
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:32.520]  that jenny mccarthy did what she did and wrote that book and went on
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:35.800]  oprah and said the vaccines aren't good and she continues to march on
[1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:39.880]  washington with jim carrey another superstar i don't you don't you feel
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:43.320]  we should harness that power well you know it's interesting because you know
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:46.920]  in the last quarter century i've i've debated doctors five times
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:52.040]  than today's show i've been on cnn i've i mean this issue has been debated and
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:56.520]  has been on television and radio etc in the last three five years
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:29:00.360]  but it wasn't until a really well-known celebrity
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:04.280]  like jenny mccarthy and jim carrey stepped up
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:08.120]  and made this issue something that was acceptable
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:12.520]  to talk about uh well i don't know if it's still very politically correct but
[1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:15.800]  at least they stepped up to the plate and got the information out there and i

[1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:22.680]  politically motivated and from what i understand
[1:33:22.680 --> 1:33:26.840]  they're saying it uh is a white male in his 20s
[1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:30.440]  somewhere around six feet tall apparently athletic
[1:33:30.440 --> 1:33:34.200]  climbed the fence through some kind of fireball or something over with
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:37.480]  over the thing and they're saying they have a video they haven't released it
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:40.360]  somehow they still haven't been able to pinpoint
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:44.520]  who this is and uh a week or so back we had someone on the program who had
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:47.160]  worked security inside the governor's mansion on
[1:33:47.160 --> 1:33:51.400]  on the alex jones program and he rejoins us today
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:55.160]  uh his name is kevin titus uh kevin thank you for joining us
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:59.320]  what's up brother why don't you recap what you told alex uh
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:06.120]  a little over a week ago well basically uh i had called in um because i kind of
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:09.720]  thought the whole deal was suspicious and i was you know
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:14.840]  was listening to y'all's program and uh figured i'd called in so i basically
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:19.080]  called in went over how i thought it was odd that
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:23.960]  you know arson you know there was an arson investigation
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:27.400]  going on when i first heard about the incident i thought it would have been
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.680]  you know something related to the construction maybe
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:34.520]  and uh when i when i heard arson on the media
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:38.600]  i just kind of something didn't seem right you know so i called you guys
[1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:43.080]  and uh and basically what happened
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.320]  was uh i was at work yesterday and uh
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:52.680]  a ts agent and i want to say was somebody with the fire marshal's office
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:57.480]  they showed up to my work and they just they wanted to interview me and i guess
[1:34:57.480 --> 1:35:01.000]  they were talking to a couple other people and what they say they wanted to
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:05.160]  interview uh it was almost as if they were like kind
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:09.560]  of like placing me there they were asking me questions like it was like
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:13.000]  almost like a you know the tv episodes like where were you you're where's your
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.320]  alibi this and that and i'm you know in my mind i'm like i don't have an alibi
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:20.840]  because for one thing i don't know anything so how can i tell these people
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:24.440]  you know what i mean it's like doesn't make any sense yeah i'm not even sure
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:28.120]  what day it started i want to say what it wasn't over the weekend is saturday or
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:31.560]  sunday politically yeah uh i think they said it was like
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:37.320]  two a.m or something two or three sunday night yeah i think that was a couple
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:43.640]  about two or three weeks ago but uh it was just man i just
[1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:48.120]  these people are insane and we you know we know they won't stop at anything and
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:52.200]  it's just funny you know i mean i fit the description of this guy too i'm about
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:55.720]  six foot tall you know their weight range that they
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:59.480]  did but i mean how how many other people well i would say about you know
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:02.680]  25 people 25 percent of the people out in austin
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:06.440]  fit that description all she has to do is be a male and an average stature
[1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:10.280]  and you're you're in on that you're in on that description it just
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:13.400]  it boggles my mind after going down there to cover it
[1:36:13.400 --> 1:36:18.920]  uh... and the media is saying that the security system was broken now
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:23.800]  the particular agency that i've worked with uh they handed over that security
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:26.600]  system a while back to another agency i'm not
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.880]  you know sure on the specifics of that because i'm just you know i'm like low
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:33.080]  level i go fix things that break you know what i mean
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:37.080]  and uh it's just you know they're asking me all these
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:41.480]  weird questions and just you know it was really kind of
[1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:45.880]  you know kind of offended me in all honesty you know it's like defamation of
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:48.760]  character absolutely you said that they actually went to your
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:52.760]  co-workers over there thinking that i'm some you know
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:57.320]  nut job or something and then i come home and uh
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:00.840]  kind of wanted to see if my neighbor heard anything because i you know i've
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:04.600]  heard on here how i've heard from several different people you know on
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:09.160]  alex joneshow how they how different you know abc agencies they go
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.000]  do like knocking talks and try to talk to neighbors and this and that and
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:17.560]  they were asking my neighbor they they actually came in a question by neighbor
[1:37:17.560 --> 1:37:21.960]  and was asking my neighbor questions about me and this and that and i just
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:24.600]  man i thought that was just really messed up so
[1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:27.960]  what did you know i don't want to come on here for
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:31.960]  just to make a statement you know let it be known everybody who knows me knows
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:35.640]  you know i would never do anything as idiotic or
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:40.840]  you know stupid as that you know what political what benefit what i have you
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:43.880]  know what i mean keep on up who stands to gain
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:47.400]  absolutely and uh it really again how would they know
[1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:50.840]  quote unquote that the theory they're working off of is that it was a
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:56.360]  politically motivated fire exactly how do they even know that
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:00.120]  you know i mean i know was this guy wearing some sort of a flag or some
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.760]  kind of a t-shirt that made a statement i mean
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:06.760]  let's you know what if they've got all this evidence i think it's time
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:10.680]  to put it out into the public let's see these security uh videos i mean it's
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:14.520]  more than suspicious that they said that they made the phone call to the fire
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:18.360]  department when they didn't when it was a bystander when the when the fire was
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:22.440]  very very low he makes the call uh dh 15 minutes later
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:26.600]  yeah well 15 minutes later the uh fire department gets there
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:30.840]  but dh still isn't even there they're not there 15 minutes later they're there
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:34.360]  25 minutes later these are the guys that are that are in the media saying that
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:38.040]  they made the call no they didn't they were nowhere to be found
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:42.360]  and i find it very hard to believe that that security system would have been
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:46.040]  down because when we were working on it if anything happened to that security
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:50.360]  system if it didn't get fixed that day you know it was like
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:53.800]  we were in trouble you know what i mean uh and i'm sure you still had somebody
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:58.280]  on the scene you know if the security system wasn't there you had guards right
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:02.520]  the normal guards walking around like they normally do i mean
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:05.560]  yeah the the whole thing stinks to high hell
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.720]  you know i'm really i mean i'm i'm kind of freaked out about you know knowing
[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:13.560]  what i know about you know the things going on in this
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:17.240]  government and this and that i mean they just you know i wouldn't put anything
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:20.840]  past them at this point you know i think it gives them the opportunity to uh
[1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:25.080]  put out the white al-qaeda myth a little bit more you know or say that they're
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:29.160]  working with anarchists now or you know anti-globalists
[1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:33.400]  you know they'll try to pin us into this uh this group you know militia members
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:36.920]  all all yeah all these things that might have a negative connotation to the
[1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:40.680]  public and i mean me i'm a musician you know i mean i'd like
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:45.320]  dj downtown every now and then you know i mean it's just it's ridiculous that i
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:48.920]  could even be pigeonholed into the into a group that would
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:53.080]  fire bomb the mansion you know what i mean just because i don't agree with the
[1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:57.080]  force the vaccination of guard afield to the
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:00.600]  children in texas doesn't mean you know what i mean no absolutely just because
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:03.000]  you have a brain and you're a thinking person
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:06.760]  uh you know doesn't mean that you should be a suspect in arson a serious crime
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:11.400]  exactly i mean really it it kind of makes me want to get a lawyer just for the
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:15.080]  you know cannot i mean or is that their job is that all they do is the same
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:19.960]  people's character you know what i mean it seems to be a recurring theme
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:23.640]  uh with these sort of jackboots you know they're more
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:26.680]  they're more motivated to quote unquote get a win
[1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:30.440]  than actually solving the crime you know as long as they prosecute somebody and
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:35.560]  put them in uh jail it's a win for them and uh they're not really concerned
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:39.480]  uh with the general populace and then like i said the thing stinks to high
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.920]  hell there's there are just cameras everywhere folks and not just the
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:49.720]  rotating cameras the ones that are planted highly equipped cameras
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:55.480]  yeah i mean this this is a cc tv dream i mean they're up in the trees you can
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:59.720]  barely see some of the the little white cameras and then you have the ballcams
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.880]  that rotate around now they're admitting finally that they have video
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:07.000]  you know they're putting but the weird thing about the description to me
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.280]  is they said that he was either wearing khakis or jeans
[1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:14.360]  uh i can usually tell the difference between khaki pants and i mean won't
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:18.200]  they just show the video that's right i don't know why that video is not out
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:21.800]  yet and i don't know why this is quote unquote politically motivated maybe
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:24.040]  there's something in the video maybe the guy's running down the street with a
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:27.720]  flag or something before he he's fine i'm not feeling man maybe they're trying i
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:31.560]  got a tattoo on my arm maybe they're trying to superimpose that on him with
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:35.720]  some photoshop you know the laughter effects
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:39.480]  absolutely insanity you can't put anything past these people
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:42.280]  because they've been caught in the past setting other people up
[1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:46.840]  i mean just just look at the railroad job that mcveighi yeah was he involved
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:50.360]  in the Oklahoma city bombing you bet he was we'll see the only guy involved no
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:53.240]  way you know exactly but was he demonized into
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:57.960]  being the only guy yes i mean this guy was sending letters home
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:02.120]  saying that he was actually part of a covert military program and he'd been
[1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:05.480]  recruited for army intelligence uh to his sister
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:09.080]  everybody disregards that and then you find out that the rider truck
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:14.200]  that was used uh its picture was taken at a military facility in Oklahoma
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:17.560]  just before the attacks you find out they took all
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:22.040]  they took all of the security cameras so people couldn't see quote unquote
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:26.360]  john doe number two and they took bombs out of the building
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:30.360]  on camera the bomb squad took bombs out of the building
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:33.400]  on camera uh keating who was the governor at the time
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:36.520]  got on television said it was a sophisticated group that they had
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.520]  diffused uh two other uh bombs and that they were larger than the
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:44.280]  first and inside the building so they really do create their own
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:48.040]  reality don't they Kevin they do and and what's what's
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:51.320]  ironic about this whole thing is there's like you know
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:55.400]  my buddy's up at work you know i mean i listen to info wars and every now
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:58.680]  you know when i'm work uh right around in my work truck or whatever
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:02.520]  and uh so i kind of you know they kind of mess with me a little bit like oh
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:06.360]  he's a conspiracy theorist this and that and uh
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:10.600]  everybody was kind of joking about that like oh man Kevin they're gonna try to
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:14.200]  like do this and that not all done it was just like a ha ha kind of
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:18.280]  laughing you know joking type thing and i mean it's funny until it comes to
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:22.520]  fruition asking my neighbors questions about me it's just like yeah
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:26.280]  people need to understand this is not a game these are people it's not a game i
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:31.160]  mean i know firsthand it is not a game you know i mean i mean these people
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:35.240]  i mean i i don't know what the thing because i mean i ain't never done it
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:38.760]  i mean i have no criminal history or anything like that i mean
[1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:42.360]  these people are trying to pigeonhole me as some terrorist now
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:46.440]  i mean that's the vibe i got no i i i guarantee that's what they were trying
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:49.880]  to do you know they're trying to intimidate you into some kind of a
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:53.800]  wayward confession and then when you didn't budge they went to your neighbors
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:57.320]  and they're probably staking out your home and tapping your phone as we speak
[1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:00.760]  i mean they'll probably run surveillance on you for at least another couple
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:04.360]  weeks uh until they put out the next asinine theory
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:07.960]  that you know god knows what but you know what
[1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:10.920]  we've got a lot of local tuxas listeners it's time to call up
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:15.240]  uh the dhs and demand that they put this video out
[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:18.040]  you know they they're saying they've got somebody on tape
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:21.720]  put the video out put it out let's see what happened there i want to see what
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:24.360]  happened there let's see what other lies we can
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:29.320]  can uncover with their own footage kevin you must hide the video from the
[1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:33.480]  comrades i agree with what it is man i mean all
[1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:36.440]  right kevin i i i thank you for stopping is there anything else you want to
[1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:40.440]  say in closing uh man i just want to you know let it be
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:43.640]  known i mean everybody who knows me knows
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:48.200]  true i mean he's you know i just want to make a statement in case
[1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:52.840]  these people do try to do anything insane all right man our prayers are with
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:56.680]  you and i thank you for joining us it's the alex jones program folks well there
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:59.640]  you have it remember the governor's mansion
[1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:04.440]  you know first they're not sure it looks accidental then it's arson
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:08.280]  then they're saying that the dhs isn't even there then the dhs are the ones
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:11.240]  that called the fire department but they weren't on the scene
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:14.600]  then we find out that no it was actually a bystander who called the fire
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:18.520]  department uh we interviewed him i believe that's up on info wars
[1:45:18.520 --> 1:45:23.080]  or jonesreport.com been up there for a couple weeks
[1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:26.760]  he said that uh when the fire department got there it was 10 or 15 minutes later
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:30.440]  it took him a while and that the police still had not arrived until after
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:36.440]  the fire trucks had got there then uh recently they decided that it was
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:40.680]  politically motivated they said they had a videotape of the assailant
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:44.680]  giving about the most general description of a human being you could
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:48.520]  possibly give you know five nine to six foot
[1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:52.440]  uh white athletic or skinny and that's it
[1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:55.800]  wearing jeans or khakis i i don't understand how you can't tell
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:45:59.160]  the difference between jeans or khakis i thought that would really matter i
[1:45:59.160 --> 1:46:02.680]  guess since most guys who own a pair of jeans
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:07.640]  also own a pair of khakis at least i do you know i got my khaki shorts on
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:12.280]  right now oh but this is the new freedom
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:15.240]  you know they'll go and harass somebody like him because
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:19.000]  he comes on the alex joneshow and says that he's worked security in that
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.400]  building and the thing doesn't add up that uh that security system being down
[1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:27.800]  is ultra suspicious and even if it was down there should have been guards on
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:30.680]  the scene that's that fire shouldn't have went
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:34.280]  down the way it did there's something fishy there big time
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:38.680]  big time and that's why we're going to keep covering here over at info wars
[1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:45.240]  dot com you know i wish i had some new news on uh
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:49.400]  on the secession of oklahoma now i don't know where it's going with that but we
[1:46:49.400 --> 1:46:52.760]  read the bill yesterday and the resolution passed 92 to 3
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:56.680]  from representative charles key a republican
[1:46:56.680 --> 1:47:00.680]  out in oklahoma i think basically declaring states rights rights
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:03.560]  you know bringing it back remember folks we're not a democracy
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:07.800]  we're a constitutional republic made made up of 50 states
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:11.880]  okay states have power the federales don't have all the power
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:15.400]  that's why there are states rights so we can challenge the federales
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:19.080]  when they become too corrupt which they have been they've
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:23.880]  they've become out of control corrupt where they try to fearmonger people
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:27.320]  into vaccinations where they try to fearmonger people
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:31.080]  into accepting the end of posicom and taught us
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:34.280]  okay much like is going on in denver right now
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:38.440]  like just look at the videos people it's on loose change 911.com
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:41.320]  and uh hopefully they're going to be posting it over at prism planet info

[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:04.520]  let's not forget the all-important propaganda drops
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:07.400]  uh i think i'm going to take a few phone calls before we get to our next

[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:35.080]  preview a little michael markovic because you know
[1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:38.040]  we need more free speech uh zones in this country
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:41.960]  you know free speech zones which are uh the exact opposite
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:48.680]  see i love the language it's so 1984 now you have free speech zones
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:53.160]  hey guess what the country's a free speech zone did you know
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:49:00.760]  did you did you uh did you find that out yeah first amendment constitution
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:04.440]  no nobody knows about that well people don't know what the amendments to the
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:07.240]  constitution are they don't understand what free speech is anymore
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:11.720]  makes me sick makes me ill i'll tell you what's not free speech

[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:37.480]  out there to awaken other americans
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:41.320]  that's what this country's about you know it's it that's why i'm disgusted
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:44.920]  when people get arrested for quote unquote peddling when they are well
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:50.120]  within their first amendment rights to give away let me say it again give away
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:54.200]  dvds and other material they're not asking for any money
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:59.720]  it's not peddling it's it's literally what the civil rights movement did to
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:02.280]  be successful they went out on the street
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:05.400]  they papered and pamphleted the hell out of the place
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:09.000]  and they gained support that's when you know we're
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.040]  we're threatening these guys when they they realize that they can't win
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:16.840]  when they play by the rules so they have to break them

[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:29.880]  and they're going to continue to break those rules if we allow them to

[1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:27.400]  rights the morality that america once had
[1:55:27.400 --> 1:55:30.840]  we didn't just used to dehumanize people you know
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:34.440]  but we're on a whole another level now we're on a whole
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:37.480]  another level let's take a couple calls before we go to bob Chapman on the other
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:41.320]  side let's go to noah in texas no are you there
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:46.040]  yes i'm here hi jason nice to talk to you sure um
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:49.560]  i wanted to commend charles key for uh introducing that
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:53.480]  the legislation in oklahoma um he's also the person that
[1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:57.640]  uh headed up to oklahoma uh city bombing investigation and put out the
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:01.320]  report it's really good i mean this guy's a true american hero
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:05.160]  absolutely yeah but um it doesn't it doesn't really
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:08.760]  say anything about the session just to be clear like i don't know where it was
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:11.960]  reported about the session but it just you know i read the bill
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:16.360]  yesterday and i could swear to god that there was a clause in there about the
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:19.160]  seating i got a stack in front of me today
[1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:22.760]  so i don't think it says cease and desist on any activities that are
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:27.400]  unconstitutional but i mean it's just saying that
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:30.520]  the government has stepped best its bounds and it's trying to say that step
[1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:34.200]  back i believe but anyway that's all i wanted to say
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:36.920]  all right thanks man i appreciate the call all right let's pop to the next
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:40.760]  caller let's go to chris in arizona christy there
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:47.960]  uh yeah hello what's on your mind chris um well i was uh
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:53.400]  alex had the general stubble bind on his show a couple of weeks ago
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:57.960]  sure um and i was watching this thing called uh crazy rulers of the world
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:01.480]  where they talk about uh the men who stare at ghosts and stuff like that
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:04.520]  yeah i've seen the documentary it's actually a three-part documentary the
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:07.320]  first has been opted for a movie the one you saw
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:11.080]  uh the men the men who stare at goats in the first earth battalion
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:15.080]  and stubble bind was part of this program where they would try to use
[1:57:15.080 --> 1:57:18.920]  mind powers to stop the hearts of animals
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:22.920]  yeah they yeah then they said there was one guy who did it but he did damage to
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:27.080]  his own heart by doing it or something um and then they were shown this other
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:31.240]  guy who was able to do it uh with his hamster or whatever
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:35.560]  yep it'll seem a little weird to me the whole um the whole series had to do with
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:40.680]  like psyops basically um this i believe the second part was uh
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:46.120]  about blasting loud music and stuff what it was about was uh the prisoners at
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:57:51.720]  gitmo and they were actually pumping in uh barney music while they were blinded
[1:57:51.720 --> 1:57:56.360]  all day and sensory deprivation all they could hear all day is i love you

[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:05.080]  yeah correct and they also did the sesame street music and then they said a
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:08.360]  couple metallica songs yeah absolutely bizarre stuff

[2:00:30.360 --> 2:00:35.480]  bob chabin how are you today bob well pretty good pretty good
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:39.720]  uh so i mean he joins us every once in a while to give us uh some forecasting
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:43.800]  on the economy the economy still in the pits i mean i i saw gas
[2:00:43.800 --> 2:00:48.200]  prices last night they continue to rise uh people are telling me it's tougher to
[2:00:48.200 --> 2:00:52.520]  get jobs i just read a headline at a cnn that says that a third of the cio
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:56.040]  ceo's out there are going to start cutting uh workers
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:00:59.560]  almost immediately and it looks like we're in some pretty we're in for some
[2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:03.400]  pretty rough times well that figure was up from 22
[2:01:03.400 --> 2:01:07.400]  percent in april to make it even worse
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:12.600]  but these are superficial uh end result things
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:17.480]  uh going on going on in the bowels of the
[2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:21.240]  monetary financial and economic world are
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:25.400]  far worse things first of all the credit crisis is nowhere near over
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:29.720]  if it best it might be 15 percent over only because the
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:33.480]  federal reserve and the european central bank and others
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:38.920]  are supplying anywhere between 500 billion and a trillion dollars
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:44.600]  in a month in short term financing uh mostly two banks in
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:48.520]  financial firms who if they didn't have that money
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:52.360]  would not be in business and uh they of course
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:57.320]  take part of that money and speculate with it and the rest of it they take
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:01.480]  and they lend to other speculators so we have a
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:06.520]  world that is being financed by the fed and the ecb
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:10.920]  so people can speculate and uh when you speculate you don't really create
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:18.280]  anything except gains and losses and uh the fed if you notice this morning
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:23.400]  uh our treasury secretary said that the fed should have more power
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:27.480]  to regulate what goes on a wall street well number one
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:32.680]  the fed is the problem uh wall street is part of the problem
[2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:38.360]  and it's like putting the wolf in charge of the or the fox in charge of the
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:42.440]  chicken coop um what they're trying to do
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:49.400]  is consolidate the financial industries that includes all of them
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:53.800]  and when they consolidate them it'll be a form
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:03:00.280]  of nationalization so if what's left of the financial industry can't
[2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:03.560]  make it which in all probability will happen
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:10.280]  eventually with deflation when it comes then they will have a handful of banks
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:13.960]  a handful of brokerage houses a handful of insurance companies
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:17.880]  and they'll all be nationalized and this is what they're after because
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:21.960]  this is the format for corporate as fascism
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:26.360]  and that's what we have in america today what will we see things like uh
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:32.440]  the nasdaq merging with uh what will we see wall street merge as well i mean
[2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:36.360]  will we see just one place to trade is that what you're saying
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:41.000]  um eventually yes um uh this the weaker firms
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:46.360]  uh even those some of whom like layman is a shareholder in the fed reserve
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:49.240]  maybe split up because they just can't make it
[2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:53.720]  but most of the middle-sized and little firms will be gobbled up
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:57.720]  yes they'll try eventually to merge all the exchanges
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:01.720]  and they'll delist all of the smaller companies so that they can't
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:05.800]  raise capital in the equity market and that they have to go to banks to do that
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:09.000]  and the same thing is going to happen to the banking
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  and system as well as the insurance companies
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:20.920]  and that also will limit the ability of corporations to raise money
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:24.600]  because they will have to raise money through banks
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:27.960]  some of it through equity but mostly through banks so
[2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:32.840]  the banks the government will control the corporations
[2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:36.280]  and that's how it's going to end up this is the uh
[2:04:36.280 --> 2:04:40.200]  the dream of benito mussolini it's an absolute fascism and we'll be back
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:43.080]  after this with bob chatman of the international forecaster

[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:11.080]  conspiracy files a little bit later after bob Chapman
[2:08:11.080 --> 2:08:14.680]  basically there the number seven documentary is coming out it's going to
[2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:18.440]  be a total hit piece get ready for it it'll probably coincide
[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:21.720]  with the same time that the actual report comes out
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:25.640]  um this is on july 6th so i would say
[2:08:25.640 --> 2:08:29.960]  look for that nist report uh the week of july 6th i really would say that i
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:34.120]  can't imagine them not doing that but maybe i'm wrong
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:37.800]  all right let's go back to bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com
[2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:41.880]  you just uh discussed how they really are trying to bring in a uh
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:47.320]  a fascist system where there's one place to trade there's one banking system
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:50.840]  what will this mean for the american people will they be able to get their
[2:08:50.840 --> 2:08:53.560]  money out of the banks when this happens they won't right they're just
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:56.840]  going to lose all of their uh all of their you know i guess
[2:08:56.840 --> 2:09:00.680]  quote-unquote hard assets their their paper assets
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:04.440]  well it's hard to say how that'll work out because
[2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:11.400]  um right now the fdic which is the government entity
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:16.440]  that is financed by banking uh that provides the funds from banks go under
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:21.160]  i think it has 52 billion dollars and that is probably not even enough to
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:27.400]  bail out one minute medium-sized bank and government is talking about
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:33.160]  150 to 300 banks going under over the next three years
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:39.560]  now i and i've called back 35 experts who work during the 80s and 90s
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:43.560]  uh for the fdic and asked them to come back to work because they're going to
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:48.120]  need them because of their experience and um
[2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:52.040]  so i think there's going to be a lot of mergers
[2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:56.760]  and um they know the banks that have problems because you know they see their
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:10:00.520]  numbers all the time and um i think there'll be a lot of
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:05.480]  mergers and uh you know bank a might merge with bank
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:09.720]  b and bank b might get gobbled up by bank c
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.920]  and that sort of thing um it is not in their interest
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:19.320]  uh to allow banks to go under and people not to get paid
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:22.840]  it's extremely important to all you listeners
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:26.680]  that you do not have more than a hundred thousand dollars in any one bank
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:31.720]  account because beyond that you're not insured so remember that
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:38.760]  and i think what will happen is that congress will just allocate more money
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:43.240]  to bail out more banks as they go along and of course
[2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:47.880]  what that will do is create more debt for the american public
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:52.920]  and that's not good and as they print the money out of nowhere
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:56.920]  um well the government will allocate it and they will
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:01.720]  pay interest on the debt that's issued to be able to finance that the people
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:05.640]  who essentially create money out of thin air as a
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:09.160]  federal reserve which is a privately owned entity
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:13.240]  and um i wrote a piece on it this morning uh
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:17.320]  the federal reserve does not use the same kind of
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.000]  accounting system that the corporate america does
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:24.520]  or other banks do they have their own federal reserve
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:28.760]  operating manual um and one of the reporters
[2:11:28.760 --> 2:11:32.440]  under the freedom of information act asked for a copy
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:36.280]  because they wouldn't give them one and they gave it to them it was so badly
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:40.200]  redacted that you couldn't make any sense out of it
[2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:42.680]  and so they're trying to hide what they're doing but essentially what
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:47.160]  they're doing at the fed is they're taking in
[2:11:47.160 --> 2:11:54.680]  uh what we call toxic waste toxic garbage which are bonds
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:12:01.640]  which consist of mortgages or other kinds of loans
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:08.200]  or debt and uh the worth probably on average around 40 cents on the dollar
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:15.640]  and uh this private firm uh black rock is supposedly trying to
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:18.920]  peddle the garbage that they're collecting
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:22.120]  and uh i don't think there's any effort at all because
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:26.600]  the fed never has to mark their books to the market and this is
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:32.120]  extraordinarily important on the f asb rules which is the
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:36.680]  international accounting agency will call it um
[2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:41.400]  companies have to if they have securities they have to mark them to the
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:46.120]  market in other words and on june 30th when they finish the
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:51.000]  second quarter and they tell everybody what they're worth
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:55.720]  the pluses and the minuses uh and they have to go to the market
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:59.800]  and they have to find out what their security's worth the fed doesn't have
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:03.000]  to do that the fed can carry that on the books
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:08.360]  indefinitely in that suspended state so the fed you can just keep on
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:12.680]  printing if you may or creating money as long as it wants
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:18.840]  it's a totally beyond belief fiat system and it is going to collapse
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:22.920]  all you have to do is live long enough to see it and i figured
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:28.120]  probably about three years down the line i i've read a couple of people
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:33.160]  uh who are in the industry so to speak which i've been in for 50 years
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:37.000]  as opposed to being a writer of the financial industry
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:40.040]  and they're starting to say the same things that i've been saying for the
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:43.400]  last three or four years they're catching up
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:47.400]  and of course they're ostracized for it but they're
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:53.000]  they're speaking up and uh we had the royal bank of scotland
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:56.200]  uh two days ago say that we're headed for
[2:13:56.200 --> 2:14:02.120]  very very difficult times and then one of the hedge fund managers
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:05.880]  who manages thirty billion dollars said the same thing
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:11.640]  and they both thought that the problems were going to get
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:19.160]  worse quicker uh they may but i've learned in 50 years of being
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.360]  in these situations that you got to be patient
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:26.120]  uh things don't happen as quickly as uh you think they will
[2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:30.040]  but it's irrespective it's all going to happen
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:33.160]  you mentioned that the federal reserve was private can you just
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:36.760]  lay out how the board members of the federal reserve are actually chosen
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:41.480]  what their terms are and how we pick the fed chair
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:47.080]  well the fed chair is nominated by the federal open market committee
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:52.040]  which is in turn approved by congress uh i don't know whether it's uh
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:57.080]  the appointee is made by the uh the uh the presidential
[2:14:57.080 --> 2:15:01.400]  administration and uh congress says yeah that's okay
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:05.560]  uh because congress doesn't argue and the reason that they don't
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:10.040]  uh is that they are the recipient of large amounts of money from the
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:13.800]  financial community uh so they can get reelected
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:16.840]  and what they don't use in their election they get to keep so
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:20.840]  it's a payoff system just like lobbying is and so
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:27.400]  uh he's appointed he's chosen from within uh the people who uh work in the
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:32.280]  different federal reserve banks are chosen and appointed from within
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:37.080]  it's all run by the shareholders who are banks
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:40.680]  and the biggest shareholder is JP Morgan Chase
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:45.000]  his Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and his uh myriad of others
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:51.560]  but uh uh that group there controls probably about 55 60 percent of the
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:55.240]  votes and so when you saw this Mickey Mouse
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:15:58.920]  Bear Stearns assassination a couple of months ago
[2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:02.600]  and that's really what it was it was an effort
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:06.920]  by the fed to take Bear Stearns out and I had all kinds of
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:11.960]  excuses for doing so but the excuse the excuses didn't wash and the
[2:16:11.960 --> 2:16:16.840]  reason why is two days after they declared the deal
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:21.720]  which was 30 billion dollar deal uh and the 30 billion dollars was
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:28.120]  to collect uh the money to offset the values
[2:16:28.120 --> 2:16:34.040]  purportedly of their bonds which are toxic were toxic garbage
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:39.240]  which the Fed took in and Morgan gave the Fed a billion dollars
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:42.040]  to cover losses of course the losses are going to be
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:46.600]  phenomenal but the whole thing is contrived but getting back
[2:16:46.600 --> 2:16:50.840]  to Bear Stearns they were taken out because they weren't one of the group
[2:16:50.840 --> 2:16:54.040]  and there were certain parts of Bear Stearns that
[2:16:54.040 --> 2:16:58.360]  uh JP Morgan Chase wanted and that's why they were taken down
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:01.800]  and there have been a couple of other writers in Wall Street who come up at
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:05.720]  the same conclusion but not many and the reason why is they're afraid
[2:17:05.720 --> 2:17:10.360]  they'll get fired from their jobs or be ostracized within their community
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:14.360]  and people like me who write that stuff just like Alec Alex
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:19.240]  are targets of the government and uh and they do what they can to make our
[2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:26.120]  lives miserable but uh the the Fed is controlled by
[2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:29.240]  the federal open market committee and all of those people
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:35.560]  are appointed and belong to the major banks who own the Federal Reserve
[2:17:35.560 --> 2:17:39.960]  and it is an absolutely rotten system it is
[2:17:39.960 --> 2:17:46.040]  it is arch criminalism and uh it's got to be done away with and given back to
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:48.600]  the U.S. Treasury this has got to be stopped
[2:17:48.600 --> 2:17:53.880]  every panic that we've had since 1913 has been planned and executed by the
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:17:56.360]  Federal Reserve in behalf of the banking and
[2:17:56.360 --> 2:18:01.240]  Wall Street community and that's a fact. So how do we defeat it?
[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:06.120]  How do we move on from the Federal Reserve into a separate type of monetary system?
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:09.880]  I think the only way is you've got of course to get Congress
[2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:13.160]  to do something about it and with the people we have in Congress now that's
[2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:16.760]  not going to happen and that's why I've told my subscribers
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:20.280]  with the exception of Ron Paul vote everybody out of office
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:24.200]  and maybe we might have a shot at something otherwise they're just going
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:28.280]  to keep doing what they're doing and they're going to control us
[2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:31.800]  and with the laws they have in the books now that have been put on in the last
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:36.120]  seven years they can do anything to anybody
[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:41.560]  anytime they want and if they disagree with what Alex says that they
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:45.800]  pick them up and say we suspect that he's a terrorist
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:49.560]  and they can inter him indefinitely they don't even have to bring charges
[2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:53.080]  against them. So if we're not able to defeat this
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:57.080]  system how how is it that the average you know American listening to this
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:01.960]  broadcast can protect themselves from the coming up financial crisis?
[2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:05.800]  Well the first thing I always tell people is get rid of your credit card
[2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:10.680]  and revolving debt and try to be as clean of debt as you can
[2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:17.080]  and then you should make plans you got to get insurance for bad days ahead you
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:20.440]  do that by getting freeze dried and dehydrated foods
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:27.480]  a method of purifying water something to defend your family in your home
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:30.440]  and once you've got that in place if you have more money
[2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:34.120]  you can think of buying golden silver coins and golden silver shears if you
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:36.760]  like to speculate. All right it's the Alex Jones
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:39.800]  show I am Jason Burma sitting in for the remainder of the week

[2:20:54.440 --> 2:20:57.720]  private debt increased to a record high in 1999
[2:20:57.720 --> 2:21:02.920]  reaching a peak of 14.8 trillion dollars marking 10.57 percent annual
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:07.160]  increase outpacing its previous 10 years the U.S. economy receives its
[2:21:07.160 --> 2:21:10.600]  currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the
[2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:13.400]  federal reserve system in the year 2000 debt growth
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:17.160]  collapsed to only 4.5 percent it's bad enough that the U.S.
[2:21:17.160 --> 2:21:21.080]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce however shocking the
[2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:24.520]  economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of

[2:24:00.440 --> 2:24:04.760]  I am Jason Burma sitting in with us is Bob Chapman of the international
[2:24:04.760 --> 2:24:08.040]  forecaster.com and you've given some great advice you've
[2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:11.480]  told people don't have more than a hundred thousand dollars and more in uh
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:16.360]  in one bank account at any given time uh go into hard assets and get rid of
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:20.440]  their debt what else can people do to ensure
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:24.200]  you know that they're going to be okay in five or ten years
[2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:28.360]  well I think that what they have to do is spend their spare time
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:32.600]  learning more about what is causing all this and passing that information on to
[2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:36.520]  other people uh Alex and I do it on the year but
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:40.600]  uh it's up to you out there to pick up the information
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:44.840]  and and give it to other people and in granted you know most people don't want
[2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:48.040]  to hear it um I know there's something wrong they
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:52.440]  say but um I don't want to know uh but that's
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:58.120]  okay um I've been involved in the exposure this for almost 50 years
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:03.720]  and uh I feel that if one person out of a hundred listens
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:07.640]  then I've accomplished something and so that's the attitude you have to take
[2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:10.680]  and you also have to work on the elected
[2:25:10.680 --> 2:25:14.680]  representatives keep on sending them short emails
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:18.920]  like I am in disagreement with Bill such and such
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:22.920]  and uh I wish you would vote against it and just as simple as that you don't
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:26.440]  have to go into detail because in the congressional offices they have two
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:31.240]  piles for each bill and one is yes and the other is no
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:35.160]  and uh the letter you'll get back uh from the congressman or senator's
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:38.840]  office will uh read some flowering thing
[2:25:38.840 --> 2:25:43.880]  about uh that particular bill and what the congressperson has done
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:48.600]  previously but still uh you make your influence known
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:53.160]  and you use it uh within the system that's all you can do
[2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:57.720]  uh it would be nice to say that you could uh vote for intellect people who would
[2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:00.520]  listen and do what the constitution was wanted
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:06.840]  uh that can happen in some cases uh and and hopefully more in more cases than
[2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:11.160]  it has in the past uh those are the things you can do
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:14.120]  working within the system well I feel if we want those things to happen
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:18.040]  educational process yeah we have to run if we want those things to happen we
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:20.760]  have to become the government we have to become the media
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:24.440]  uh you know I had a caller on yesterday saying you know I've given all this
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:27.640]  information to my local senators my congressman
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:31.640]  the city council and they look at it but they just kind of brush me off and I'm
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:34.280]  like well then it's time to say you know I'm done
[2:26:34.280 --> 2:26:38.040]  giving you information I'm now going to take your job and run against these
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:43.160]  people and interject real issues and and that and that is a good
[2:26:43.160 --> 2:26:50.040]  kind of comeuppance to them for not listening and uh you know I I've seen
[2:26:50.040 --> 2:26:55.400]  activists who I thought would never win an election
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:26:59.400]  and did uh simply because of persistence and you you
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:03.800]  you can't give up you have to be persistent you
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:07.720]  have to believe what you're doing uh is is uh
[2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:12.040]  a profitable thing for your society as well as yourself
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:15.800]  and you can't leave it up to alex and people
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:20.360]  like alex on other programs and writers like myself
[2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:24.520]  uh to do it for you will give you the information you've got to carry it
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:29.640]  you've got to you know have that message and and you have to disperse it
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:33.960]  absolutely and and and you've got to remember
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:38.760]  it's not a happy message because it's a truth and the truth is sometimes a very
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:42.120]  hard sell but you got to keep on hammering
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:46.360]  and picking off little things that you see which will prove your point
[2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:51.800]  and eventually people come around and the people in your own family
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:56.200]  are the most difficult to convince yeah often that is the case
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:27:59.640]  but I really think that it's it's about convincing yourself
[2:27:59.640 --> 2:28:04.120]  that you can have an effect that you can be powerful that you have great power
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:08.280]  within and you can expand on that so many people give me this defeatist
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:12.360]  attitude of I can't change this and I can't do that
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:16.600]  uh you know I was in a bar last weekend and someone saw my little info wars
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:20.840]  uh wristband and he asked me if I was military I told him what I wasn't
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:24.280]  and he asked me what the uh bracelet was about and I explained it to him
[2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:28.440]  I had building seven on my phone so I showed him that and I got him thinking
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:30.920]  for sure and I showed him some other things and he goes you know
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:33.880]  you're probably a hundred percent right and this guy was ex-military he had
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:37.080]  just been overseas in uh in japan recently
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:40.600]  stationed there and he's like but I can't do anything about it and they instill
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:44.920]  that in you I mean from from television to radio to
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:48.200]  your profession they always try to make you feel
[2:28:48.200 --> 2:28:52.120]  insignificant they always try to demoralize you so you won't step up
[2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:54.680]  and I think that's that's the big thing uh
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:57.720]  bob that we need to get over that and realize no
[2:28:57.720 --> 2:29:01.960]  you know we can make a difference we can create change
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:08.120]  well the and also those who say what you just said you say to them well that's
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:11.400]  okay uh why don't you just call up the
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:15.400]  department of home security and ask them which internment can't be going to be

[2:33:20.680 --> 2:33:24.440]  will not be it will be a total and complete hit piece i spent some time
[2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:28.600]  uh... with the guy who was interviewing dylan quite a bit of time actually
[2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:31.480]  uh... when we were out in uh... i want to say

[2:34:48.280 --> 2:35:07.640]  calls in just a moment but let's play this world trade center seven bbc clip
[2:35:18.280 --> 2:35:21.720]  building seven is the smoking gun of nine eleven
[2:35:21.720 --> 2:35:25.480]  it is the most obvious example of controlled
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:31.640]  demolition it's not real the the materials of the technologies
[2:35:31.640 --> 2:35:36.520]  just aren't there if they were i know in the building i heard explosions
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:42.200]  outside the building i heard explosions
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:45.720]  i saw this building which had never been hit by a plane come
[2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:50.040]  crashing straight down for it to fall symmetrically
[2:35:50.040 --> 2:35:53.960]  and completely and rapidly was quite astounding
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:57.800]  could one use a controlled demolition on any building sure
[2:35:57.800 --> 2:36:00.840]  it happened to the wtc seven nine eleven no
[2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:06.840]  it did not
[2:36:07.480 --> 2:36:10.120]  as far as i know that's the first time it's happened in architectural history
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:14.040]  a steel high-rise building has collapsed simply because of damage and fire
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:17.240]  you can hear the building creak you hear things fall
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:20.920]  you hear the fire burning you can hear you know there's such a way of
[2:36:20.920 --> 2:36:26.680]  other no steel frame high-rise building has
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:31.880]  ever collapsed due to fire
[2:36:31.880 --> 2:36:34.360]  you know you have to look at what was inside building seven you have the
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:36.200]  largest secret service field office outside of
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:39.480]  washington dc you had the largest cia field office
[2:36:39.480 --> 2:36:42.680]  you had a number of government agencies inside the building
[2:36:42.680 --> 2:36:45.720]  i think we're just about the last ones in this building right now
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:49.800]  i think you should leave everybody else is gone
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:36:57.960]  the first explosion i heard when i was on the stairwell
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:02.520]  like a boom like an explosion
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:08.760]  jane what more can you tell us about this collapse details are very very
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:14.360]  sketchy
[2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:18.280]  the entire half inch of the beam is is gone
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:22.360]  entirely dissolved something happened to cause the steel to
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:32.520]  really thin and in some places to disappear entirely
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:35.960]  building seven is the first high-rise building in the world
[2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:43.480]  that has collapsed solely due to
[2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:47.560]  well there you go folks get ready july 6th uh that's going to be coming to the
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:50.680]  bbc and i want to point out that richard clark who
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:54.200]  some people for some reason love him in this movement
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:37:58.200]  because he apologized before the 9-11 commission i just want to let you know
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:38:02.040]  richard clark you make me sick i don't like you
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:05.720]  a lot of people in this movement don't like you and the ones that do wake up
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:08.760]  man this guy just got on a special and said
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:12.280]  world trade center seven was not a controlled demolition
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.880]  he's a punk okay he doesn't deserve the time of day
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:19.080]  i don't care if he confirms that cheney was in the pia
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:22.680]  that's great all right we got other confirmation of that
[2:38:22.680 --> 2:38:26.520]  i don't care if he can confirms continuity of government that day
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:30.040]  okay we got other people to confirm that he's a punk
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:34.200]  he's on camera saying that building seven isn't a controlled demolition
[2:38:34.200 --> 2:38:37.400]  it is okay i'm sick of the people within the
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:39.800]  movement trying to say there's not enough evidence for it
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:43.400]  are you kidding me well they've got barry jennings on there barry jennings of
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:47.160]  course going to be in fabled enemies uh i'm i'm anxious to see what he had to
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:49.640]  say to the bbc and what the bbc puts out there
[2:38:49.640 --> 2:38:53.560]  obviously dylan was interviewed uh he's in the film and the last person you
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:57.800]  heard from was uh that sondar gentleman who originally said to popular
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:02.040]  mechanics that up to 25 percent of the building was scooped out
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:06.200]  scooped out it's a 47 story skyscraper let's do the math
[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:10.040]  that's 12 full stories plus scooped out of the building
[2:39:10.040 --> 2:39:14.840]  it's bull okay that guy that's sondar guy
[2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:18.040]  he should stand before a military tribunal eventually
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:21.560]  he knows he's covering up the truth the guy before him though i had never seen
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:24.200]  before and he was talking about how some of the beam
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:28.120]  had simply disappeared you know they also have other government talking
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:31.240]  heads like the lozo family the lozo guy was like
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:34.600]  i'd know about it i'll bet you would you and your family
[2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:38.440]  you bunch of criminals all right let's take some calls
[2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:42.200]  let's go to jim in ohio jimmy you're there
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:46.120]  what's up jim hey how you doing today i just got a couple questions for you
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:50.760]  the last guy it was on um the question was when the banks go bankrupt and you
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:54.120]  owe them debt uh uh where does your debt go does it get
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:39:57.240]  just erased that i don't think so i think they're going to set up debtor's
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:01.160]  prisons they've been in uh the process for quite some time and instead of a
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:05.240]  prison that you'll live in you'll have to go work on weekends kind of like a
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:11.000]  community service no kidding yeah then the other question was um
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:14.680]  the movie uh the condor flight of the condor
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:19.000]  robert redford in the last part of it they talk about
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:23.960]  uh the food shortages and having what to do with all the people and everything
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:27.880]  and this movie was made like about 25 years ago sure it's it's way old well i
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:32.200]  mean look if you read and i brought this document up yesterday again
[2:40:32.200 --> 2:40:35.880]  but rebuilding america's defenses the peanut document that everybody talks
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:38.120]  about the new pearl harbor and all that good stuff
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:41.880]  still in it talks about using bio weapons talks about using
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:46.600]  uh food as a weapon talks about using uh you know weather weapons and mod
[2:40:46.600 --> 2:40:51.160]  weapons and creating earthquakes i mean they've got it all planned out they've
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:54.920]  they've wrote dozens if not hundreds of papers on the matter what they do is
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:40:58.280]  they have these think tanks war game it out in a scenario
[2:40:58.280 --> 2:41:01.320]  and they put all the scenarios out there and i think one of the ones they're
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:05.000]  going to use this food against us i mean it's very suspicious to me and i
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.600]  played this on the show a week and a half ago in the last part of that he
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:11.960]  comes out and says that very thing and in that movie
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:16.200]  that uh government wipes out his whole agency that supposedly working for the
[2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:19.560]  government that knows the truth yeah well then they go after him
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:23.480]  yeah it happens and then uh you know a lot of people think that's just a movie
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:27.080]  but our government is more corrupt than any movie could possibly tell
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:30.680]  unfortunately truth is much stranger than fiction i thank you for the call
[2:41:30.680 --> 2:41:36.600]  jim let's jump to uh tracy in missouri tracy you're there
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:43.560]  hi jason hello hello um i was gonna ask if you think that the um situation
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:47.080]  going on in denver um goes against the posse commentatus
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:50.760]  yeah absolutely absolutely violate the posse commentatus
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:55.880]  posse commentatus is the statute where the police and the military are separate
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:41:59.800]  and right now the police and military are working together for a domestic
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:05.080]  takeover drill in unmarked helicopters in black uniforms so absolutely that's
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:08.200]  exactly what's going on right now i just wanted to point that out because i
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:11.080]  hadn't heard you say anything about it today so i just wanted to point that
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:14.440]  out absolutely thank you and they're and they're prepping for this thing
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:18.280]  that's happening at the end of august august 25th to august 28th if you want
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:21.720]  to see the videos hopefully they're going to be posted over at prisonplanet.com
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:25.880]  and info wars.com uh but we've got them right now at loosechange911.com
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:29.720]  and you can go check out these apaches these black hawks you can see the
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:33.240]  detention centers you can see everybody dressed up in their nice little black
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:35.880]  uniforms you can see the propaganda that they're
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:40.360]  actually dropping on the people these orange glow sticks with uh american
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:44.520]  flags wrapped around them and military patches around them very bizarre very
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:48.600]  very bizarre let's jump to steve in washington steve are you with me
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:52.280]  hi hi jason how are you sir i'm doing good
[2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:56.760]  uh i was just listening to the gentleman prior to your
[2:42:56.760 --> 2:43:02.600]  building seven coming down and uh i agree i i try to tell everybody i can
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:06.760]  that'll listen and most people don't want to listen they're too busy with their
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:10.760]  life and uh what you really got to put down to them
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:13.960]  is that they're not going to be that busy they won't be concerned about their
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:18.200]  uh their season tickets they won't be concerned about the next uh the next
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:21.400]  suv they want to drive they won't be concerned even about
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:26.040]  their housing payment because chances are the bank owns that house and when the
[2:43:26.040 --> 2:43:29.320]  bank goes under that means that house is going to be owned by the federal reserve
[2:43:29.320 --> 2:43:32.680]  banking system and if they're nice enough to let you keep that house they're
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:35.400]  probably going to put you in some type of debtor prison
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:40.360]  and you know i agree and the thing is you know you can talk talk talk all day
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:45.080]  and you know people will brush you off i again find that the best tools are
[2:43:45.080 --> 2:43:48.760]  movies people don't read anymore and even when they read they're very suspect
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:51.880]  on it i would say give give somebody a film like america
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:43:56.280]  freedom to fascism give them a loose change i do that i do that yeah i do
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:43:58.840]  that i buy him i buy him in multiples and i do that
[2:43:58.840 --> 2:44:02.760]  well well even not buying him in multiples get one copy learn how to burn
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:06.760]  i mean this is why i love what mark dice is doing uh with the soldiers because
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:09.960]  they need to know too everybody needs to know
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:13.800]  and the my family was the first people that i went to and you
[2:44:13.800 --> 2:44:18.360]  bet i got jason come on shut up that's ridiculous jason you've got to be joking
[2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:20.840]  me oh my god you you wouldn't believe the things
[2:44:20.840 --> 2:44:24.520]  that were said to me i remember uh my stepfather at one point
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:28.680]  uh saying to me you know i just don't want to see you go nuts and find a jar
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:32.280]  full of ears in your room and i'm like what are you taught a jar full of ears
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:37.800]  i'm like rick this is the real deal yeah and uh it's and he's come all the way
[2:44:37.800 --> 2:44:41.000]  around he's gotten his money out of banks he's starting into hard currency
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:46.360]  he he knows nine eleven was an inside job he's he's done a full 180 and did it
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:49.960]  did it happen overnight no it took about five to six years
[2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:53.960]  and uh we just got to keep pressing and pressing and pressing and finally
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:57.800]  something will come out in the mainstream media or in their daily life
[2:44:57.800 --> 2:45:01.320]  that is gonna flip the switch it flips the switch over and they're just like
[2:45:01.320 --> 2:45:05.080]  oh my god this is the reality i thank you so much for your call
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:08.760]  steven keep pressing on you know we need more info warriors like yourself
[2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:12.200]  let's go to mike in tennessee mike you with me
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:15.800]  i'm with you uh the fellow was talking about paying off revolving debt and
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:19.240]  credit cards since those are non-secured debt
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:23.960]  meaning they can't come take your property uh i would say paying off your
[2:45:23.960 --> 2:45:28.040]  home would probably be the most important thing something that's got
[2:45:28.040 --> 2:45:30.680]  a lean function that they can apply towards it
[2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:33.720]  no i'm with you i'm definitely and that's what i just said is that
[2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:37.480]  if the banks come in and uh they go out of business chances are they're the
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:40.840]  ones that actually own your house and then it'll be up to the federal reserve
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:43.720]  banking system you know if they if they take in that
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:45.880]  debt whether you get to keep your home or not so yeah but
[2:45:45.880 --> 2:45:49.800]  your house is probably the number one priority to pay off well unless
[2:45:49.800 --> 2:45:52.360]  unless they go to your local registrar's office
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:57.480]  and uh they really can't even take your property but the fact is is that
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:00.760]  under the terms of your contract as long as you don't default as long as you pay
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:04.520]  that monthly note by the due date in full your monthly payment
[2:46:04.520 --> 2:46:07.640]  to whoever that is and i would send it to the original
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:12.200]  agreed upon address uh they they still can't take your property as long as
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:15.560]  you're paying that note they might try to squeeze you and threaten you
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:19.720]  but unless you've got corrupt local uh court systems like we do
[2:46:19.720 --> 2:46:22.760]  and and certainly where i live they would they would do that against me in a
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:25.880]  heartbeat because i'm not the old boy network and
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:29.640]  i'm i'm burning disk and doing all these other things which is
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:34.680]  um making making a stinker in here but you know the bottom line is that
[2:46:34.680 --> 2:46:38.840]  secured debt yes unsecured debt no i wouldn't worry about it personally
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:42.040]  all right man i thanks for the opinion let's jump to another caller let's go
[2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:46.280]  to uh betty in north care uh north california or north carolina i don't
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:50.760]  know about betty you there yeah i'm here i'm jason hello again

[2:47:02.440 --> 2:47:06.440]  and you know how do you feel when someone like the lazo
[2:47:06.440 --> 2:47:09.800]  family who is the head of control demolition incorporated
[2:47:09.800 --> 2:47:13.800]  who helped clean up oklahoma city who was contracted to clean up the world
[2:47:13.800 --> 2:47:16.840]  trade center gets up there and says there's no way it was a controlled
[2:47:16.840 --> 2:47:21.160]  demolition if it was i'd know about it and the bullshit
[2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:26.040]  oh i gotta let you go betty i'm sorry we you gotta watch the language on this

[2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:32.120]  times all right let's jump to elliott in ohio
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:36.440]  elliott are you with me elliott yeah what's on your mind man
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:41.320]  you there yeah absolutely yeah i mean like uh
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:44.920]  i'm about to bring up just a side topic but uh i mean
[2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:49.160]  larry silverstein came out and even said yeah we pulled it so
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:52.920]  i mean it's definitely controlled demolition when you
[2:47:52.920 --> 2:47:56.200]  got the dude that ends the whole place saying by the way we blew it
[2:47:56.200 --> 2:47:59.400]  i think but the debunkers just they just literally
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:03.880]  rewrite the language into saying that pull it means pull down the building
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:07.400]  when we had people call uh controlled demolition
[2:48:07.400 --> 2:48:11.640]  corporations and say hey could you let me know what the the term pull it is and
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:14.280]  they're like oh that's when they're actually going to take down the building
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:17.560]  you know it's an obvious term
[2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:21.720]  obvious but perception is stronger than reality these days
[2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:25.800]  you know absolutely anything else you'd like to say
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:29.240]  uh i got a question you know i came in like a earlier on the day you're talking
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:32.920]  about vaccines and all that good stuff yep and uh i've read up on the
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:35.720]  information you know mark's putting cancer and the polio
[2:48:35.720 --> 2:48:39.960]  vaccines hpv vaccines are making little girls you know
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:43.400]  paralyzed and all that good stuff what about like a tetanus
[2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:47.160]  vaccination or all that good stuff do you believe that all the vaccinations
[2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:51.480]  i'll tell you what i i don't trust any of the vaccinations
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:55.560]  at all but i'm not going to say that they're all
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:48:58.920]  as bad as each other okay i'm just saying i don't trust them
[2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:02.920]  when they openly put sv 40 and other types of
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:07.560]  sv into vaccinations as a preservative i don't trust them when they're putting
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:10.600]  mercury in the vaccinations i don't trust them when they're doing these
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:15.240]  nationwide promotions uh for women to get vaccinated against hpv
[2:49:15.240 --> 2:49:19.880]  which is kind of a joke it's kind of it's really a joke where i am in onyana
[2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:24.040]  because it's a big college town and you know all the local medical officials
[2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:28.680]  will tell you you know around 80 to 90 of the people that are there have hpv
[2:49:28.680 --> 2:49:32.120]  and it's it's really you know they say it causes cancer
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:36.040]  and uh even my even my uh my girl she thinks
[2:49:36.040 --> 2:49:39.640]  she thinks the same thing she's like oh i'm so worried about this hpv thing i'm
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:43.480]  just like it's all a scam so am i against every vaccination no

[2:55:02.280 --> 2:55:05.960]  colorado were actually arrested and charged with peddling
[2:55:05.960 --> 2:55:10.200]  for handing out free dvds when weeks prior they had talked to the police
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:13.720]  and guess what it was okay it was well within the law
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:18.040]  and the constitution uh you want to you want to elaborate a little bit
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:21.240]  derrick oh yeah well um what i was going to say is
[2:55:21.240 --> 2:55:25.400]  something that kind of ties into that subject about four years ago there was
[2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:28.440]  the there were these two guys in my city that started
[2:55:28.440 --> 2:55:31.800]  going downtown and setting up a little stand where they would give out free
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:34.920]  books they just had boxes and boxes of books
[2:55:34.920 --> 2:55:40.680]  and uh about two years later they started installing cameras all over
[2:55:40.680 --> 2:55:46.120]  the whole city all over downtown and uh then the next thing i know
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:50.040]  of a year after that i'm down there one day downtown and i'm picking up some
[2:55:50.040 --> 2:55:52.760]  books and talking to them and these police show up to
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:56.680]  two policemen show up and tell them that they have to move
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:00.840]  because uh and they're asking them questions like are you selling anything
[2:56:00.840 --> 2:56:05.000]  uh what what exactly are you guys doing so they were trying to find some reason
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.280]  to get them to move and they they kept saying oh you are you're
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:12.840]  obstructing the sidewalk traffic and they weren't and so they moved their
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:17.160]  stuff back even farther and then some lady from a shop who owned a shop said
[2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:21.560]  oh you guys can set up outside my store and and before they could move
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:26.600]  about six more cop cars showed up and they swarmed out and arrested these two
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:30.200]  guys for giving out books and i wanted to ask you
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:33.720]  what would the rationale behind that be what reasons can they
[2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:38.280]  detain people just for doing just for giving out something like free books
[2:56:38.280 --> 2:56:41.320]  uh they're egos uh the fact that they think that they're
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:44.600]  seriously that's it that's the only thing it's just this new copy ego
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:48.520]  that they're they're the law they decide what's what's constitutional now they
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:51.800]  don't even know what the constitution is man i remember
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:55.960]  a couple years back i was walking down my street in upstate new york this is an
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:56:59.000]  amish community by the way literally people in horse and buggy
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:05.080]  uh a crime capital by no means whatsoever i had a cup of coffee in my hands
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:08.840]  walking down a main road and the police pulled me over walking
[2:57:08.840 --> 2:57:12.840]  they're like hey you what's your name i'm like excuse me
[2:57:12.840 --> 2:57:17.720]  he's like what's your name i'm like sir i i i mean i have no reason to give you
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:20.600]  my name is there a reason that you're pulling me over they literally got out
[2:57:20.600 --> 2:57:23.640]  of the car started to go for their pepper spray they're like you want us to
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:25.560]  arrest you you want to go to jail right now
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:29.720]  oh yeah i was trying to defend them and say and and and uh say what what the
[2:57:29.720 --> 2:57:32.520]  hell are they going for sorry for the language but
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:35.960]  they were threatening to arrest me just for that too and uh
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:40.200]  so people on the street decided just to let it be absolutely and then i said
[2:57:40.200 --> 2:57:43.320]  they said that they were doing an investigation and i said okay
[2:57:43.320 --> 2:57:46.200]  and they're like what's your name i'm like my name is jason
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:49.160]  and they're like jason what i'm like are you looking for a jason what's going

[2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:55.240]  and eventually i gave him my full name and they got back in their cars
[2:57:55.240 --> 2:57:58.680]  i almost let him take me downtown but my girlfriend at the time would have my
[2:57:58.680 --> 2:58:01.800]  head she was coming in to to meet me but yeah
[2:58:01.800 --> 2:58:05.960]  the only thing that gives him that power are their egos we'll take your calls later

[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:07.480]  by the liberty bell and recently convicted of preaching on a
[3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:11.000]  sidewalk near the liberty bell mr marcovich are you with us
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:14.520]  yes i am uh thanks for having me on the program i appreciate it well thanks for
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:19.080]  hat for thanks for coming on the program uh breakdown for the listeners
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:22.280]  what you were doing when you were initially arrested and how this process
[3:01:22.280 --> 3:01:26.200]  took place well i traveled to a lot of public venues
[3:01:26.200 --> 3:01:30.760]  i've been on alex's program before and we talked about the rnc convention in
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:34.680]  new york city everyone come down put down on the
[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:39.000]  pier 57 with with the free speech areas that are being established
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:43.080]  more and more and here at the liberty bell center in philadelphia in an
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:46.520]  independent hall uh... they've established what they call a free
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:51.160]  speech area or a free speech zone in which you also need to get a permit to
[3:01:51.160 --> 3:01:56.040]  even engage in uh... activities there and i was on the public
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:00.360]  sidewalk which aligns sixth street in philadelphia now they built a new center
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:03.880]  it's called the liberty bell center and that's the long side the sidewalk
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:07.080]  and i was standing on that sidewalk speaking to people waiting in line
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:11.320]  about the important message that uh... written right on the liberty bell which
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:15.400]  is from the book of leviticus which is proclaimed liberty throughout the land
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:18.920]  and all the inhabitants thereof so as i was speaking to
[3:02:18.920 --> 3:02:22.600]  passerby about uh abortion our country and how it's
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:26.760]  very grievous that this is continuing and about everyone's need to to come to
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:31.160]  know god through jesus christ uh... i'm an evangelist that's what i do i go out
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:34.920]  to the public square and i declare this message of repentance and the need for
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:38.920]  a savior and i was standing on that sidewalk outside the liberty bell
[3:02:38.920 --> 3:02:42.360]  center i was told to go over there in the
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:45.880]  ranger motion uh... where i was to go which was on the other side of the
[3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:49.800]  building uh... away from the people i was trying to reach
[3:02:49.800 --> 3:02:54.040]  and this is on a public sidewalk it's open to the public it's not shut down
[3:02:54.040 --> 3:02:56.840]  there are other people there that are engaged in
[3:02:56.840 --> 3:03:01.400]  uh... activities and i was prohibited from continuing
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:05.240]  um... with my message so i ultimately
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:10.760]  had been uh... cited for a violating the terms and conditions of a permit a
[3:03:10.760 --> 3:03:15.720]  permit in which i never accepted uh... but it was pushed upon me
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:20.120]  and this permit with basically a verbal permit and i was told to go to this
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:24.520]  free speech area so that's what happened i try to reason
[3:03:24.520 --> 3:03:29.080]  with these park rangers asking them to please speak with our legal counsel
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:31.480]  uh... before they start instituting this
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:35.960]  in fact the chief ranger that oversees the area down there said that that was a
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:39.960]  new policy that was just rolled out and it had not made it to the rangers in
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:42.760]  the field yet this is what had been testified to
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:46.040]  during the criminal trial but i had been charged first with
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:49.640]  violating the terms and conditions of the permit now this was a permit i
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:53.480]  never accepted uh... and also and that was for not going to the
[3:03:53.480 --> 3:03:57.080]  free speech zone uh... the second charge i got in the mail
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:00.680]  six months later via certified mail and this
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:05.960]  was uh... a violation of uh... the code of federal regulations
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:09.560]  like the the permitting issue but this one uh...
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:13.560]  cited cited that i was interfering with agency functions by standing there and
[3:04:13.560 --> 3:04:17.160]  speaking to the people on messages uh... on on
[3:04:17.160 --> 3:04:20.840]  on on various topics so that's what happened and
[3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:24.520]  ultimately i was put on trial and convicted on those two counts
[3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:27.320]  well i want to get into the uh... trial i want to get into the conviction on the
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:31.000]  other side it's the alex joneshow info wars dot com prison

[3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:23.640]  i'll be here tomorrow and we're talking to michael markovic a preacher who was arrested
[3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:28.840]  for spreading the word on the sidewalk folks and then i guess recently convicted
[3:08:28.840 --> 3:08:34.120]  by trial i'm wondering michael when they arrested you did they just give you a ticket did they
[3:08:34.120 --> 3:08:38.920]  bring you down to the station how did that process go and then tell me what happened at the trial
[3:08:38.920 --> 3:08:45.960]  well first to your first question what happened is as i was speaking i had been approached
[3:08:45.960 --> 3:08:52.840]  uh one final time by the supervising ranger saperstein supervising ranger saperstein who
[3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:59.560]  came and several other rangers and they used pain compliance where they bent my hand behind my back
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:08.040]  and forcibly made me go into the liberty bell center into a room in which i had been questioned
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:17.240]  and then uh cited and released and after that uh the citation the second citation which is also
[3:09:17.240 --> 3:09:24.120]  a federal violation came in the mail certified mail six months later and in relationship to
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:30.920]  the trial itself that was a two-day trial in which um the prosecution put their case on of course
[3:09:30.920 --> 3:09:38.840]  and then we put our case on and uh ultimately i had been found guilty of violating the terms and
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:44.760]  conditions of a permit and secondly for interfering with agency functions by just simply standing
[3:09:44.760 --> 3:09:51.480]  on the sidewalk and speaking with people so it uh definitely is uh very revealing as to where our
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:57.320]  country is uh headed in or it has been headed in this direction for a very long time now and it's
[3:09:57.320 --> 3:10:01.160]  just getting worse and this free speech zone establishment which is becoming more common
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:07.080]  place at major events um this is now being instituted here at the liberty bell center
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:11.160]  and independent hall in the public sidewalks yeah it seems like it doesn't even have to be at a main
[3:10:11.160 --> 3:10:17.400]  event like the rnc like the dnc uh you know it it can be anywhere now and they're they're trying to
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:22.200]  put these into squelch free speech even further uh they're arresting people quote on quote for
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:28.200]  peddling uh when they're giving away dvds at this point i mean even at a bank i get the
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:32.760]  run around it's a total surveillance society police state where they want all these forms of
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:37.480]  identification they want all these regulations so that if they don't agree with what you're saying
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:41.560]  you won't be able to say it at all and that's what this country has really become anything
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:47.560]  that is labeled quote on quote a free speech zone is bad news because the free speech zone
[3:10:47.560 --> 3:10:52.920]  is this country it's any public property that is in the united states of america in my opinion
[3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:59.080]  that's right and uh what was very shocking is what assistant u.s attorney richard goldberg
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:05.480]  was arguing he was stating that our defense and that was a part of our defense that was propaganda
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:11.560]  and that uh i was a clear and present danger uh to people being on that public sidewalk in the
[3:11:11.560 --> 3:11:16.200]  name of safety they're starting to shut people down from being able to speak on the public
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:20.680]  sidewalks about issues that are important to them and it's happening more and more often
[3:11:20.680 --> 3:11:25.720]  in fact what happened is that this u.s attorney richard goldberg asked the judge judge rapaport
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:32.040]  uh who who heard this case to send a message not only to me but to those in the courtroom
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:36.360]  and anyone else who would dare stand on a on public property and share their beliefs without
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:42.920]  government permission and it's it's very very revealing yeah it is much like the government
[3:11:42.920 --> 3:11:48.600]  has quote unquote become god and we know that a lot of these preachers have really sold their
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:54.120]  flocks down the river by taking government funding uh and telling them that uh when the
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:11:59.880]  government comes in listen to them go to the camps it's just unbelievable how far this is gone
[3:12:00.920 --> 3:12:05.640]  certainly is it certainly isn't you know they're trying to send this message and and i think that
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:10.520]  uh they are this is getting some attention because of the fun and because i was put on a
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:17.720]  year probation i have to now go down to the u.s probation office tomorrow by 2 p.m. and register
[3:12:17.720 --> 3:12:24.520]  and not only get permission uh for you know being able to exercise my rights in public but anywhere
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:29.240]  i go i need to now get permission from the u.s probation office and they could deny me for
[3:12:29.240 --> 3:12:35.240]  whatever reason they so desire if i need to go in uh to a ministry project in another state i
[3:12:35.240 --> 3:12:40.920]  have to get permission from the u.s probation office so this is really a shocking decision
[3:12:40.920 --> 3:12:46.280]  and i think that they should awaken some people to voice some opposition and to stand up for what
[3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:51.400]  is right where can people find your uh your information what's the website how can people help
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:59.320]  well i'd encourage people to visit us at repent america dot com that's r e p e n t america dot
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:04.120]  com and on our website there's actually a link to the video footage now i know it's at info wars
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:09.240]  dot com as well uh if people would like to take a look at that they can they can go to our website
[3:13:09.240 --> 3:13:14.600]  at repent america dot com you also have it on info wars dot com if they want to see it on youtube
[3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:20.600]  they can just go to youtube and use the key word liberty bell center and it's the very first video
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:27.000]  and in that video footage you will see this supervising ranger approach me uh a couple of
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:33.240]  times and instruct me to go to this free speech area and i had declined that as well as the verbal
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:39.400]  permit that was issued um now nowhere in the what they call the compendium or in the code of federal
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:46.760]  regulations do we see them being able to issue verbal permits nowhere there is that even listed
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:52.360]  and the judge argued in his uh finding of facts that well it's not listed therefore they can
[3:13:52.360 --> 3:14:00.040]  issue it so it really is a bad decision and we're working on an appeal right now our legal counsel
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:05.880]  our attorney scott shield is getting ready to file that appeal and it's our hope that this gets
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:11.880]  shut down because if they shut down the public sidewalks to the free expression of ideas at the
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:17.720]  liberty bell center and at independent hall in the birthplace of american freedom that our nation
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:23.960]  uh as it is right now is in trouble absolutely absolutely and uh you know that's why it's so
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:29.880]  important for people to arm themselves with cameras because even if you do go down in uh you know a
[3:14:29.880 --> 3:14:35.640]  court a courtroom at least in the court of public opinion we have a chance we can show how corrupt
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:40.840]  the system is and shed light on that and show how corrupted is all around it's not just the police
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:47.160]  but it's the judge you know it's the court system that would rule in favor uh of of this you know
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:51.480]  police state measure rule against the first amendment rule against the constitution and
[3:14:51.480 --> 3:14:57.000]  bill of rights what else what else are you guys up to what's what's the next step for uh repent america
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:04.280]  yeah well right now we're really concentrating on this particular situation because of uh what
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:09.640]  it all entails and trying to get this overturned and ensuring that people not only myself for
[3:15:09.640 --> 3:15:13.720]  people who disagree with our message and we do believe jesus christ is the way the truth in
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:17.560]  the life and that no man comes to the father but by him but we know that people are going to
[3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:22.200]  disagree with that but that's why the public street should be open up to discussion and open
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:27.960]  up to the free expression of ideas not shut down by government because they're afraid of safety
[3:15:27.960 --> 3:15:34.120]  issues or they're using this in the name of safety but they want to silence us and uh we're uh
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:38.120]  going to be headed to a couple of events coming up we're going to be in washington dc for the
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:44.280]  fourth of july and at some other events but being out there on a regular basis this is becoming
[3:15:44.280 --> 3:15:48.920]  very much commonplace uh the free speech zone establishments that are at these major events
[3:15:48.920 --> 3:15:52.840]  that are not only at major events as you said but they're on college campuses they're they're
[3:15:52.840 --> 3:15:58.520]  becoming now just a regular part of a city where someone is told you have to go over there if you
[3:15:58.520 --> 3:16:04.280]  want to express your views and uh what what's going to stop them from just shutting it all
[3:16:04.280 --> 3:16:10.760]  down completely without uh that permit and and and then denial of those permits it's very troublesome
[3:16:10.760 --> 3:16:15.960]  and in this case is as i said very revealing as to the direction our country continues to head in
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:21.480]  and what is that direction i mean the way i'm i've been seeing it is you know you're gonna
[3:16:21.480 --> 3:16:26.280]  have more police on the streets you're seeing a merger of the military and the police especially
[3:16:26.280 --> 3:16:31.400]  in these drills that are going on in denver i think we're seeing even more sophisticated
[3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:37.080]  types of control where you know organizations like recreate 68 get found out you know that
[3:16:37.080 --> 3:16:41.720]  they're bad that they're trying to incite violence at the dnc that they're telling people to bring
[3:16:41.720 --> 3:16:47.400]  red pain and throw it on others uh to bring shields to wear armor and of course this is the only group
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:52.920]  that actually gets the quote unquote permit to protest and then they're exposed and all they do
[3:16:52.920 --> 3:16:57.000]  is they change their name and it's basically the same members and they're the only ones that get
[3:16:57.000 --> 3:17:01.880]  the permit it seems like they're setting up the people that don't know for violence in order to
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:07.400]  bring in you know the military and police to put put the squelch on on freedom of speech yet again
[3:17:07.400 --> 3:17:12.360]  to make it seem like the country wants barack obama there's no question about it that that's
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:17.800]  exactly what they're what their goal is and uh you know they're using fear these fear tactics
[3:17:17.800 --> 3:17:22.040]  and telling the people well you know we can't have that because there'd be riots there'd be
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:26.760]  this and there'd be that in the name of safety we're telling people they need to stay over there
[3:17:26.760 --> 3:17:33.080]  behind that building behind that tree over there down the street you know there's the limits on this
[3:17:33.080 --> 3:17:38.040]  it's it's it's so subjective and and and these directives are becoming more and more
[3:17:38.040 --> 3:17:43.400]  uh evident through what's happening to a lot of different people that are out there at these
[3:17:43.400 --> 3:17:49.080]  events now we're headed out to the dnc convention as well as the arctic convention and uh you know
[3:17:49.080 --> 3:17:54.200]  we have reason to believe that they're going to do as they did in new york city and and and and
[3:17:54.200 --> 3:18:01.080]  up in uh messachusetts uh in boston when they had that the cages established these these cages and
[3:18:01.080 --> 3:18:06.920]  i'm saying cages because they're fences that basically you're put into and you could express
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:12.200]  yourself in in in those those cages particularly at the the dnc convention where that happened but
[3:18:12.200 --> 3:18:18.200]  then at the rnc convention they put people down in an abandoned warehouse on pier 57
[3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:24.360]  in caged-in areas and when i was escorted in there after having been arrested uh on a public
[3:18:24.360 --> 3:18:29.640]  sidewalk there because i wouldn't go to the site and sound or the free speech area that they had
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:35.640]  established um i was sitting in a cage and looking at all these people of different types of political
[3:18:35.640 --> 3:18:41.960]  you know positions and and and ideas and they were all criminalized because they were out there
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:47.800]  exercising their right to free speech and uh it's very disturbing it's just amazing where this
[3:18:47.800 --> 3:18:53.880]  country has gone it truly has become land of the coward home of the slave and when they try to tell
[3:18:53.880 --> 3:18:59.240]  you that a free speech zone is a cage think about it they're treating you like an animal
[3:18:59.240 --> 3:19:04.600]  literally treating you like a pet and letting you know they're the boss well i'm not i'm not in line
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:09.000]  with that i'm not down with it i'm not getting into any cage if you've got to arrest me because of
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:14.280]  that so be it uh again i'm encouraging a lot of people to go to the dnc this year arm yourself
[3:19:14.280 --> 3:19:18.520]  with cameras let them know you're not going to cause violence let them know that you might not

[3:21:44.840 --> 3:21:48.600]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve note
[3:21:48.600 --> 3:21:53.160]  and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:57.560]  as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:02.040]  can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:07.160]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the
[3:22:07.160 --> 3:22:12.280]  government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current
[3:22:12.280 --> 3:22:17.400]  effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:22.440]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:27.480]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[3:22:27.480 --> 3:22:32.920]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven by

[3:24:42.280 --> 3:25:01.880]  building seven is the smoking gun of 9 11 it is the most obvious example of controlled demolition
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:09.800]  it's not real the materials of the technologies just aren't there if they were i'd know
[3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:13.720]  no in the building i heard explosions outside the building i heard explosions
[3:25:17.960 --> 3:25:24.280]  i saw this building which had never been hit by a plane come crashing straight down for it to
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:31.640]  fall symmetrically and completely and rapidly was quite astounding could one use a controlled
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:41.080]  demolition on any building sure did it happen to wtc 7 or 9 11 no it did not
[3:25:43.240 --> 3:25:46.360]  as far as i know that's the first time it's happened in architectural history a steel
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:51.080]  high-rise building has collapsed simply because of damage and fire you can hear the building
[3:25:51.080 --> 3:25:55.800]  creak you can hear things fall you can hear the fire burning and you can hear how the
[3:25:55.800 --> 3:26:03.880]  destruction went above it no steel frame high-rise building has ever collapsed due to fire
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:10.760]  you know you have to look at what was inside building seven you had the largest secret

[3:26:15.240 --> 3:26:19.640]  you had a number of government agencies inside the building i think we're just about the last
[3:26:19.640 --> 3:26:27.480]  ones in this building right now i think you should leave everybody else is gone
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:31.960]  the first explosion i heard when i was on the stairwell
[3:26:33.640 --> 3:26:36.360]  like a boom like like an explosion
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:46.200]  jane what more can you tell us about this collapse details are very very sketchy
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:56.680]  the entire half inch of the beam is gone entirely dissolved something happened to
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:07.400]  cause the steel to really thin and in some places to disappear entirely
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:13.400]  building seven is the first high-rise building in the world that has collapsed solely due to
[3:27:13.400 --> 3:27:28.840]  well there you have it folks the bbc uh first time the prison plan dot tv subscribers are seeing it

[3:27:43.560 --> 3:27:51.400]  version at best not even a lie hop guy more of a more of all we're so incompetent he's scum
[3:27:51.400 --> 3:27:59.240]  okay he's total and complete scum i'm gonna say it again richard clark is scum and lazo getting
[3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:06.440]  up there and saying i'd know about it i'd know about it really would you tell about it because
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:10.680]  you have a bunch of government contracts and you know you have a family owned business called
[3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:16.600]  controlled demolition incorporated that cleaned up the world trade center these people are criminals
[3:28:16.600 --> 3:28:21.880]  folks they need to be brought to justice let's go to our first caller on the list let's go to dan
[3:28:21.880 --> 3:28:27.960]  in illinois dania there hello jason how you doing dan okay i have you know the other day you had a
[3:28:27.960 --> 3:28:33.720]  guest on from counter punch the gentleman yes we had paul craig robertson and he's basically
[3:28:33.720 --> 3:28:38.120]  still had the faith in the political system yeah well you know we all know that the left
[3:28:38.120 --> 3:28:41.960]  and the right is all fake and everything else but my question is how does any thinking person
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:49.640]  after 2006 when the united states of america people came out in record numbers and voted against
[3:28:49.640 --> 3:28:54.200]  bush by putting the democrats in the congress and the senate and in the last two years they've
[3:28:54.200 --> 3:28:57.640]  done absolutely nothing in fact they just gave them a trillion dollars today or something like
[3:28:57.640 --> 3:29:02.600]  that for the war how can any thinking person have any faith in it well here's the deal with
[3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:07.720]  with him and others i've i've noticed when you are in these administrations like paul craig roberts
[3:29:07.720 --> 3:29:14.520]  was like rena govern was it is extremely difficult for them to get past this left right paradigm
[3:29:14.520 --> 3:29:21.000]  probably because of the right wing end of it is outwardly evil in many cases man i'm gonna get into
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:34.440]  your question a little bit more on the other side of the alex joneshow info wars dot com

[3:33:05.560 --> 3:33:11.240]  finish up on that caller's point it everybody i've interviewed that was part of you know the
[3:33:11.240 --> 3:33:17.320]  reagan administration in the 80s or the bush administration in the 90s or worked with these
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:23.000]  people always seems to fall back into this left right paradigm you know when i interviewed reama
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  govern years ago when we had just put the democrats into office he feels like you know now they need
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:33.880]  to be emboldened but they're going to do something they didn't do anything okay paul craig roberts
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:39.400]  although he realizes both of these are corporatized candidates for aco obama he feels is the better
[3:33:39.400 --> 3:33:43.800]  one because he's not associated with the republicans i mean i brought up bill derberg to him i brought
[3:33:43.800 --> 3:33:49.640]  up the fact that him and hillary had probably met with those guys and he just does not uh give any
[3:33:50.280 --> 3:33:55.000]  credence to the fact that bill derberg over he me and grove or devos or any of this stuff
[3:33:55.640 --> 3:34:00.920]  really sets any policy and i couldn't be of a more different opinion uh let's go to the next
[3:34:00.920 --> 3:34:10.840]  caller let's take uh let's see let's take uh james in ohio james you're with me we got james how you
[3:34:10.840 --> 3:34:19.240]  know jason how you doing man but too bad i was just calling uh i didn't know if you uh were aware
[3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:27.720]  well back alex was talking about some uh marine exercise military exercises that were
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:33.880]  maybe supposed to be going on in uh indianapolis yes i think that they were actually i think they
[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:39.560]  were actually going on this week i got a call earlier uh this week about those types of drills
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:44.440]  and all the ones i've been focusing on are the ones out in denver but apparently there's a
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:49.240]  couple more going on in the country and uh there's a good chance that i'm pretty sure one of the
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:53.720]  callers did call in and say it was going on in indiana and it was urban warfare training right
[3:34:53.720 --> 3:35:00.200]  right and the only thing i wanted to bring attention to was uh indianapolis is right next to
[3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:09.400]  a beach grove which was brought up by the uh was a lone lone lantern uh lone lantern dot arc sure
[3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:13.880]  yeah but yeah it's just i was i thought it was supposed to be coming up and i wasn't sure it
[3:35:13.880 --> 3:35:18.440]  was going on i ain't i ain't seen nothing about it well i think i think it is going on right now
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:21.960]  but if you want to take a look at the type of drills that they're probably carrying out
[3:35:21.960 --> 3:35:27.880]  uh go to loose change 911.com and go check out the uh the drills going on over at colorado go ahead
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:34.680]  i also had a question uh i like i said i talked to you previously and uh we talked about uh
[3:35:34.680 --> 3:35:40.520]  just getting a membership to prism planet tv the the plethora of information that's there
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:48.840]  and i recently was listening to an old mp3 of alex's where he talked to uh hop sticker
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:53.240]  sure daniel hop sticker sure he he did uh mohammedata in the venice flying circus
[3:35:53.240 --> 3:35:59.720]  right and i can't find that on uh prism planet tv i don't know if anybody um if it's not there
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:04.440]  it's probably somewhere archived in the free archives over at prismplanet.com i'd say run a
[3:36:04.440 --> 3:36:09.160]  couple google searches uh give me a give me a give me a myspace message i'll see if i can dig it up
[3:36:09.160 --> 3:36:13.720]  for you you know i really dig uh hop stickers research because he goes into the fact that the
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:20.920]  hijackers uh indeed had very odd intelligence ties and on top of the intelligence ties uh
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:25.240]  they had ties to be in drug dealers i mean these guys weren't radical islamists they were uh
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:30.120]  coke heads that were down at strip clubs let's let's be real folks uh let's go to west in
[3:36:30.120 --> 3:36:36.760]  idaho west are you with us what's on your mind west hello jason yes how are you sir
[3:36:36.760 --> 3:36:45.320]  oh not too bad uh wanted to comment on vaccinations flu shots and allergy shots don't hear much
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:54.920]  about allergy shots but on november 22nd 1963 i just turned 13 years old i was given an allergy
[3:36:54.920 --> 3:37:02.280]  shot and nearly died from a reaction this term that alex continues to use i just heard
[3:37:02.280 --> 3:37:11.880]  tainted vaccinations is misleading there has never been any scientific proof that vaccinations
[3:37:11.880 --> 3:37:20.440]  and i'll add flu shots and allergy shots are safe and effective no i'm with you i you're right i mean
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:24.840]  uh i guess that he uses that for the layman's just coming into this you're right all these
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:30.600]  vaccinations are poison in my opinion i don't trust any of them you know i you can add flu shots
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:36.440]  and allergy shots to those as well i don't hear much discussion about allergy shots i'd like to
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:42.120]  know what exactly what i was shot up with uh those well i'll tell you what uh why don't you go down
[3:37:42.120 --> 3:37:47.400]  to nvic.org and see what kind of information you can dig up over there we had a great guest on
[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:51.800]  earlier today discussing it but when somebody called me up and asked me if i would take any of
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:57.320]  these vaccinations or any of these shots i flat out said no i i'm not saying that every single
[3:37:57.320 --> 3:38:02.120]  shot out there is pure and complete poison but i'm not putting it past them and i'm not taking
[3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:06.920]  this stuff i thank you for the call west uh let's go to rodney in kentucky rodney are you there
[3:38:07.880 --> 3:38:13.800]  it's been firm as man you're doing a fantastic job sir well thank you man uh on the heels of
[3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:16.920]  your special guest you had i just like for everybody it's out there to crack open their
[3:38:16.920 --> 3:38:23.880]  bottle today and take a look at psalm nine seventeen uh it'll kind of just ponder it for a
[3:38:23.880 --> 3:38:28.280]  minute or two the reason i called you is i want to know i know you can't give a definite answer
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:36.040]  where is the line drawn when is too much enough you know i mean i look at the video my big thing
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:40.680]  the line in the sand for me is the kids you're at people out there that have children i look at
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:44.840]  the video of the sixteen-year-old boy you know in the video now that i'm not trying to be michael
[3:38:44.840 --> 3:38:49.800]  wagon at all so i won't even you know go down that line but if that was my son you're talking
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:53.960]  about hold on you're talking about the the kid let's let's be clear here you're talking about the kid
[3:38:53.960 --> 3:38:58.840]  who had his teeth knocked out in fact let's play the video let's play an officer yeah yeah let's
[3:38:58.840 --> 3:39:02.920]  play it hold on one second we'll get back your call in a moment sure um let me make sure that
[3:39:02.920 --> 3:39:07.960]  i'm actually on there am i on there do we have it do we have the video for the there it is right
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:17.720]  there all right let's play it police officer caught on tape slamming a teenager's head into a wall
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:22.360]  he knocked out three of the young man's teeth that happened after the sixteen-year-old was arrested
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:27.080]  for violating rules at a transit center you also see the sixteen-year-old being dragged
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:32.040]  across the floor the officer is suspended without pay an investigation found the officer used
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:38.120]  excessive force but concluded that the teens injuries were quote unintentional yeah unintentional
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:45.480]  my my god they they just took this kid smashed his face into a a cinder block or brick wall
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:50.200]  and put the guy down i mean this is a sixteen-year-old kid against the grown man and i gotta tell you
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:54.440]  although you know there's lines to be drawn on the sand my line was drawn uh when i found out
[3:39:54.440 --> 3:39:58.600]  about nine eleven that was it you know that's when i decided to get active but i think it's
[3:39:58.600 --> 3:40:02.680]  different for everybody what do you think well i mean i agree with you hundred percent because
[3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:08.840]  i buy fifty blank dvds every two weeks and copy loose change second edition freedom to fascism
[3:40:08.840 --> 3:40:13.480]  and martial law nine eleven and hand them out but what i'm saying is with this this is one of these
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:17.880]  times where i'm not calling for anybody to do anything i'm saying that that was my son
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:21.880]  i have a fifteen-year-old son a five-year-old daughter if that man had laid his hand on my
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:26.200]  son like that i would give him something to remember that about the rest of his life every
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:29.720]  time he couldn't use his right arm or walk with a lamp for the rest of his life he'd think about
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:34.280]  that i mean you just that's something like that that's our children that is the next generation
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:38.760]  that is your flesh and blood and if you just sit by and let people do something like that to you
[3:40:38.760 --> 3:40:43.240]  i mean that to me there's something has to be done about that i'm with you and i'm glad you're so
[3:40:43.240 --> 3:40:47.080]  fired up because that should get you fired up thanks for the call rodney you know another thing
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:52.920]  that totally fires me up and another thing i said to this young gentleman who asked me about my
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:40:59.000]  info wars dot com bracelet was i was like look i'm gonna lay it out for you right now you're
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:03.560]  telling me that you have no power you can't do anything about it i'm gonna just let you know
[3:41:03.560 --> 3:41:09.000]  who runs things okay the people that say that they're christian conservatives that you praise as
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:15.640]  your leaders are a cultists that are in the pedophilia that like to rape little kids okay
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:21.560]  that's the bottom line that should be enough okay a lot of these guys get caught look at foley
[3:41:21.560 --> 3:41:25.960]  foley was heading up like the cps division of the government you know he was all we need to
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:32.200]  protect the children what's he get caught doing oh he's paging 16-year-old boys dennis hasard has
[3:41:32.200 --> 3:41:38.520]  lived with his uh his male assistant now for years and years and years and years we know about barney
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:45.000]  frank getting caught back in the 80s uh when i think he was still a republican uh with uh an
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:50.680]  underage male brothel in connecticut okay the horror stories that have come out of the bohemian
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:55.960]  grove via the franklin cover-up go watch conspiracy of silence you think you got a strong stomach
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:42:01.560]  it's 45 minutes long it's on youtube and i'll tell you what the first time i came across the
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:07.240]  information i couldn't keep my lunch down let's go to peter in north carolina peter are you there
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:13.800]  hey jason um i want to thank you for having the courage to continue talking about what
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:20.120]  very few others are willing to talk about well thank you i wanted to comment about uh you know
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:27.400]  you had a guy on earlier that had a website uh repent america and um i see very few christians
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:34.520]  that really see um the hand of god and all that is going on you know the bible talks about a time
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:41.640]  when christ will actually be coming back and i believe that we're seeing that day at hand and
[3:42:41.640 --> 3:42:49.960]  uh you know jesus said that that the um that satan was the god of this world so why are we surprised
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:57.160]  that the institutions of men are being controlled by it um well i would say this because most of
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:43:02.680]  these uh christian communities and these churches are anything but they're they're like cults man
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:08.280]  they just want to sing and dance and read scripture and think everything's all right but the bottom
[3:43:08.280 --> 3:43:12.280]  line is they're not really acting like christians they're not out there trying to solve the social
[3:43:12.280 --> 3:43:16.520]  woes that are out there they're not reaching out to their fellow man and they're willing to just
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:22.440]  lay down and become sheep and obey the preacher as if he is the godlike figure absolutely but
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:28.360]  that that's not what i'm saying at all i think that uh the institutionalized christianity that
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:33.800]  we see out there is uh you know they're pushing ridiculous subjects that really are not relevant
[3:43:34.520 --> 3:43:41.160]  and um you know separating people uh by issues like homosexuality or abortion
[3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:47.480]  while the real criminals are raping and robbing you know the country you don't even know how much
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:53.320]  i'm with you on that thank you for the call peter i i really exactly why are we folk and not that
[3:43:53.320 --> 3:43:58.440]  those aren't real issues you know what i mean but they're side issues right now our country's going
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:04.920]  down the tubes and uh he's right you know homosexual rights and abortion should be side
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:09.560]  issues for christians they shouldn't be the main focus that's how they get you to use your energy
[3:44:09.560 --> 3:44:14.440]  and make you feel like you're doing something positive but really you know there's a chance
[3:44:14.440 --> 3:44:19.320]  that your preacher's the demon unfortunately all right let's go to kenny in wisconsin kenny are
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:25.080]  you there yeah trucker kenny here boy i'll tell you something jason this ain't the same country i
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:31.320]  grew up in i'm a retired cross country trucker and 62 years old and i'll tell you what bud
[3:44:32.120 --> 3:44:38.200]  anyway the reason i called in jason i've got two websites i want uh the listening audience to look
[3:44:38.200 --> 3:44:47.400]  at it's a plethora of research information okay it is the first one is ref desk re f
[3:44:47.960 --> 3:44:57.320]  desk dot com okay and what's the other one constitution dot org and what kind of material
[3:44:57.320 --> 3:45:05.880]  can we find on these sites you're going to find everything from a to z on ref desk and on constitution
[3:45:05.880 --> 3:45:14.520]  dot org you're going to find everything constitution related including supreme court decisions uh this
[3:45:14.520 --> 3:45:21.320]  the transcripts the whole nine yards like in dc v heller you can go to the web blog on constitution
[3:45:21.320 --> 3:45:26.840]  dot org and you'll read the uh the whole thing all right kenny i'll tell people to check it out
[3:45:26.840 --> 3:45:33.960]  thanks for the call let's jump to jimmy in tennessee jimmy are you with us hey what's up um i think
[3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:41.000]  we could i got something we could all do that could uh easily make an effect is uh start actively
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:48.440]  boycotting all the six media companies um and even retroactively boycotting on where if you have any
[3:45:48.440 --> 3:45:54.280]  music or movies from i'm not saying you don't watch movies or music but you start pushing your money
[3:45:54.280 --> 3:45:59.240]  until the alternative media that puts out that stuff well i would just say this man it's going to be
[3:45:59.240 --> 3:46:05.080]  awful tough i mean i just know how hard it is to mobilize people and to wean them off mainstream
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:09.960]  entertainment i mean and we're talking about the big networks here is going to be almost impossible
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:16.920]  what i started doing it even to the point of like going when i see a movie to uh locally on theater
[3:46:16.920 --> 3:46:21.880]  but i mean like there's more alternative companies and mainstream companies it's just that they own
[3:46:21.880 --> 3:46:26.920]  most of the big movies and everything else but yeah i see what you're saying i think that the key
[3:46:26.920 --> 3:46:33.160]  is for us to start our own network and i've always you know i had a real long discussion about this
[3:46:33.160 --> 3:46:37.960]  with mark dice last year i wonder if he remembers it but i was saying you know in order for us to
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:43.160]  have a chance in this thing we are going to have to build at least one of us out in this alternative
[3:46:43.160 --> 3:46:50.440]  media some kind of a empire that is at least one tenth or one twentieth the size of a fox news
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:46:57.640]  department or an msnbc only because i i think we can be the david against their goliath but i
[3:46:57.640 --> 3:47:02.760]  think that we have to to almost play by their rules in other words on tv we don't even have to
[3:47:02.760 --> 3:47:07.640]  be organized if everyone just listen to us made a conscious effort to look on the back of their
[3:47:07.640 --> 3:47:13.560]  of their cds and dvds and bought like the smaller studios and record labels it would make a big
[3:47:13.560 --> 3:47:18.040]  difference we don't have to have rubber stamps on everything unfortunately we live in an
[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:23.720]  incredible halt iron man world where batman's coming out you know these are big these are the
[3:47:23.720 --> 3:47:29.480]  big events for some people summer lives man it's not even like the barbeque on july 4th or spending
[3:47:29.480 --> 3:47:34.200]  time with their kids it's oh my god look at this hollywood blockbuster that's how much we've fallen

[3:47:54.680 --> 3:47:59.800]  to start to swap them away from a cane supporter but anyway when i got there you know we did the
[3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:03.960]  whole little pre convention thing where each district goes into something and we vote our
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:08.760]  delegates out to the main convention but i got up to the main convention was just completely

[3:56:52.760 --> 3:56:57.480]  the night of one eleven do you realize how much equipment that heavy equipment how much heavy
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:57:02.360]  equipment they got out there so fast well yeah i mean you know in lucian second edition we cover
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:07.480]  the fact that they have found those trucks underneath abandoned with gold in them so someone
[3:57:07.480 --> 3:57:12.440]  must have told these people to get out of the trucks before they were crushed uh you know
[3:57:12.440 --> 3:57:15.640]  or they would have uh they would have been in the trucks when they were crushed i mean they
[3:57:15.640 --> 3:57:19.640]  were literally taking gold out of the world trade center complex underground and they found these
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:24.120]  trucks abandoned underneath the world trade center someone had to tell them how would they know when
[3:57:24.120 --> 3:57:28.680]  the when the tower was going to collapse unless they detonated it themselves yeah they had they
[3:57:28.680 --> 3:57:34.600]  had that machinery sitting over on the new jersey side of the Hudson river waiting to come in because
[3:57:34.600 --> 3:57:39.560]  it was there too fast it takes a while to get that well what the their excuse is going to be
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:45.080]  that they were running drills man you know they had those FEMA drills uh they had tripod going on
[3:57:45.080 --> 3:57:50.040]  so FEMA was there see what they did is they had drills to send uh counterterrorism experts of

[3:57:54.200 --> 3:58:00.040]  Monterey california but then they would also have the emergency teams ready to respond on a moment's
