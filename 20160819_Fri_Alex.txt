[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  We are live on this Friday, August 19th edition of the Alex Jones show.
[00:29.840 --> 00:34.400]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, I'll be in for the first hour. At the bottom of the hour, we've got
[00:34.400 --> 00:40.640]  close Trump confidant, of course, former campaign advisor Roger Stone, a regular guest, dropping
[00:40.640 --> 00:45.680]  in for a quick segment to talk about the latest with the campaign. Of course, today it was announced
[00:45.680 --> 00:51.360]  that Paul Manafort would step down. That was kind of predictable, given that they had hired Stephen
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.400]  Bannon just a couple of days previously. Of course, Trump gave a massive speech last night.
[00:56.400 --> 01:02.400]  We're going to get into segments of that later in the show. Is he pivoting? Is he taking on a more
[01:02.400 --> 01:08.240]  conciliatory tone? And is that wise? We're going to talk about that with Roger Stone and other
[01:08.240 --> 01:15.120]  issues related to the Trump campaign at the bottom of the hour. But again, massive news blitz coming
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.440]  up. If you thought that the Hillary health scandal was over, then think again, because for the past
[01:21.440 --> 01:28.000]  two weeks, the mainstream media have been asserting that this is just a wild conspiracy theory backed
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.760]  up by no credible voices. Well, they were shook to the core a couple of days ago because we had Dr.
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.280]  Drew come out, America's most trusted physician, and basically make the same observations that other
[01:39.280 --> 01:45.040]  medical experts have been making for several weeks and months now that there is something
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.640]  seriously wrong with Hillary Clinton, her campaign is backpedaling wildly. Now they're claiming that
[01:52.640 --> 01:59.280]  a fake document debunks the entire issue, despite the fact that no serious commentator who drew
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.960]  attention to the questions surrounding Hillary's health in the first place ever cited this fake
[02:04.960 --> 02:11.600]  document as proof they're using it as a straw man, bringing it up over and over again to try and make
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.640]  these questions go away. Well, they're not going to go away. Hillary Clinton hasn't had a press
[02:16.640 --> 02:26.240]  conference for 257 days. And now even the Washington Post is beginning to realize that there's
[02:26.240 --> 02:33.360]  something seriously wrong here. They can't cover it up any longer. So again, massive new revelations
[02:33.360 --> 02:38.880]  about Hillary's health coming up in the next segment. And another story, which is probably even
[02:38.880 --> 02:46.480]  bigger than that, the Hillary campaign sent out a campaign email last night to all her subscribers,
[02:46.480 --> 02:53.520]  basically vowing to destroy the conservative media outlet Breitbart, not destroy it in the
[02:53.520 --> 03:00.400]  sense of just discredit it, but actually destroy it and take it off the internet. We've been warning
[03:00.400 --> 03:07.280]  for eight years about the internet kill switch, about this move towards censorship, authoritarianism
[03:07.280 --> 03:13.360]  on the World Wide Web. Well, wait until you hear what the Hillary Clinton campaign is now saying
[03:13.360 --> 03:19.680]  about Breitbart in the aftermath, of course, of Stephen Bannon linking up with the Trump campaign.
[03:20.240 --> 03:26.400]  Absolutely chilling content in this email that was sent out by Hillary's campaign. You won't
[03:26.400 --> 03:31.120]  believe it. We're going to get to that. We're also going to get to the religion of peace strikes
[03:31.120 --> 03:38.000]  again in France. There was a stabbing of a Jewish rabbi within hours, despite the fact that the
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.480]  assailant was screaming out Allah Akbar as he stabbed this Jewish rabbi who was wearing orthodox
[03:44.480 --> 03:51.920]  dress within hours, the police came out and said, no terrorist motive, no anti-Semitic motive.
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.800]  We've seen this over and over again. They're covering up terror attacks throughout Europe
[03:56.800 --> 04:03.120]  because they're becoming so commonplace now that if this narrative is allowed to continue,
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.040]  there's going to be riots, there's going to be civil unrest, there's going to be huge upheaval.
[04:07.840 --> 04:12.880]  So instead of actually addressing the fact that bringing in millions of Muslim migrants from the
[04:12.880 --> 04:18.960]  Middle East, 21% of whom in many cases support ISIS is not a good idea and actually trying to
[04:18.960 --> 04:25.520]  readdress that policy, they're simply covering up the terrorist attacks by these Islamists. This
[04:25.520 --> 04:29.360]  is happening more and more in Europe. So we're going to get into that. We're going to get into
[04:29.360 --> 04:36.320]  the Atlantic basically coming out and saying that any criticism of Hillary Clinton is sexist.
[04:36.320 --> 04:42.000]  We saw that coming a long way off. And again, the war for the internet, major news websites,
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  removing comment sections entirely will tell you how that links into the internet takeover.
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.600]  But more massive news on Hillary's health and the motive behind Hillary's campaign's email to
[04:55.600 --> 05:21.600]  try and destroy Breitbart.com. This is huge. Stay right there.
[05:25.760 --> 05:30.560]  400 million in cash until the prisoners were released, correct? That's correct, Kirby replied.
[05:30.560 --> 05:36.000]  In an August 4th press conference, President Obama said the opposite. We do not pay ransom. We
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.200]  didn't hear and we won't end the future. The president told reporters, speaking of the January
[05:41.200 --> 05:47.520]  17th payment and hostage release, families know we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the
[05:47.520 --> 05:54.320]  notion that we would somehow start now in this high profile way defies logic Obama added at the time.
[05:54.320 --> 05:59.360]  Well, guess what? The cat's out of the bag. You lied. We called it info wars.com.

[08:05.920 --> 08:19.360]  Alex Jones here with a very important note I'd like to add during this live Friday worldwide
[08:19.360 --> 08:24.400]  broadcast as we have Paul Watson hosting in the first part of the transmission from London,
[08:24.400 --> 08:28.480]  England and of course Leanne McHugh and the rest of the team at the info wars news center here
[08:28.480 --> 08:34.960]  in Austin, Texas as well as our contributors from around the world. What we witnessed yesterday
[08:34.960 --> 08:43.120]  in this 45 minute speech that Donald Trump gave that is posted on info wars.com is beyond a pivot
[08:43.840 --> 08:50.960]  as some of the media is calling it and the speech is again posted in full info wars.com
[08:50.960 --> 08:59.360]  and it's titled Donald Trump just gave his best speech and I agree this is the most overall
[08:59.360 --> 09:05.760]  popular speech he's given a true unifier. Now the truth is he's been unifying the nation against
[09:05.760 --> 09:11.600]  globalists that are trying to dissolve our borders and bring us under foreign rule via the TPP
[09:11.600 --> 09:18.640]  and other multinational combines. So he has to rally us as Americans and as patriots so that we
[09:18.640 --> 09:26.480]  have a common basic theme and system and rule of law so that we can oppose the outside globalist
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.440]  corporate takeover it's that simple the media calls that being divisive saying that we're
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.360]  going to have the same rules on people to come into our country that other nations have it's
[09:35.360 --> 09:41.040]  simple but he's always in his long speeches talked about being inclusive talked about really trying
[09:41.040 --> 09:46.400]  to rebuild the inner city areas talking about bringing in the good immigrants of every race,
[09:46.400 --> 09:52.880]  color and creed that are vetted and getting them higher paid jobs but also making sure that Americans
[09:52.880 --> 09:59.520]  don't lose out and so the rising tide raises all ships but overall it was a focused speech it was
[09:59.520 --> 10:05.600]  obviously off a teleprompter and probably written by Bannon in conjunction with Trump because it's
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.960]  it's Trump's ideas so I'd say 90% of it was probably written by Trump just listening to it
[10:10.960 --> 10:18.000]  and watching it and he talked about unifying and he talked about now this is the most important
[10:18.000 --> 10:28.160]  point he repeatedly looks at the crowd who's probably 80% Caucasian and says to them in the
[10:28.160 --> 10:33.520]  Carolinas we are going to have to be inclusive and we're going to have to bring everybody in
[10:33.520 --> 10:40.480]  and rebuild America we're going to go out and hire people from every sector in every group
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.560]  and bring everyone together that's the opposite message of Obama and MSNBC they say overall
[10:46.560 --> 10:51.840]  fighting overall racist overall scum only the state-run media and the state-run systems can
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.400]  unify everyone by brainwashing training and sensitivity training and all this other bull
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.640]  when you hear Trump speak this is what could really save the country see they have to wreck
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.520]  the American system to on its ashes build the new old order we all know that the listeners of this
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.360]  broadcast do many of you before I was even born understood this and people fight in the new
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.520]  old order for 60 70 years but now we have to reach out to the rest of the public at a critical time
[11:15.520 --> 11:21.040]  when globalism is taking the planet over and people are finally ready to see the truth we're at
[11:21.040 --> 11:26.240]  that make it or break it point right now and throughout the broadcast today I want to be
[11:26.960 --> 11:31.680]  playing some of these clips on air so that folks can really hear what Trump had to say and I hope
[11:31.680 --> 11:36.080]  everybody will go to info wars.com and get the full speech and share it to everyone you know
[11:36.080 --> 11:42.720]  because this is a true unification speech based on America and liberty and private property and
[11:42.720 --> 11:49.440]  hard work and freedom and true inclusiveness not unity of the globalist system where they divide
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.640]  us all in little subgroups and then tie us together that is the very symbol of fascism is a bundle of
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.920]  sticks chopped off symbolizing different captured groups and countries and and nationalities and
[11:59.920 --> 12:07.440]  religions tied tied with leather straps with hatchets above it symbolizing the force of the
[12:07.440 --> 12:12.560]  state to keep you all under their control we are going into a fascist system we're going into the
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.600]  broken coalition stratagem and it's a fact the globalist right books on it that's what's so
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.760]  frustrating is this is not my opinion and so I'm going to throw this back to Paul Watson and then
[12:21.760 --> 12:24.720]  Lee and Mackie and others I'll be filing more reports throughout the day I've got a special
[12:24.720 --> 12:28.640]  report coming up at the start of the next hour dealing with all these people that say don't
[12:28.640 --> 12:33.680]  fear monger about nuclear war the reason we stopped a nuclear war in the last 65 years is because
[12:33.680 --> 12:37.520]  people have been concerned about it and most analysts say we're in greater danger than we've
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.880]  ever been and so does Donald Trump then they say he wants to start a nuclear war because he wants
[12:42.880 --> 12:49.520]  detente this is crazy now back to Paul Joseph Watson from london england but this is a very
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.840]  exciting speech the media is trying to ignore it or they're trying to spend it that oh he was so
[12:53.840 --> 12:59.440]  hateful now he's backtracking and being nice he has put forward an olive branch saying look I say
[12:59.440 --> 13:02.640]  a lot of things on the campaign trail in the heat of battle some of it you know I could have said
[13:02.640 --> 13:08.640]  better so it is an olive branch but he had to unify americans first before we can then start
[13:08.640 --> 13:15.040]  reaching out to everybody else we have to have an identity before we can continue on as a nation
[13:15.040 --> 13:20.400]  the globals want to kill our identity and bring in an absolute total and complete corporate
[13:20.400 --> 13:26.560]  tyranny now back to Paul Watson that was Alex Jones talking about Donald Trump's speech yesterday
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.680]  we're going to have excerpts of that coming up later in the show but I want to turn back again to
[13:31.680 --> 13:38.160]  Hillary's health because the Clinton campaign is in damage control mode right now they thought they
[13:38.160 --> 13:43.360]  could dismiss this as a conspiracy theory they thought they could own that narrative and they
[13:43.360 --> 13:50.240]  can't they get an overwhelmed every single day by expert after expert agreeing with each other
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.840]  saying the same thing that there's something majorly wrong with Hillary Clinton's health not just from
[13:55.840 --> 14:02.560]  her personal behavior which we've seen the bizarre seizure type episodes the twitching the inability
[14:02.560 --> 14:08.720]  to walk the inability to stay on her feet the pillows propping her up during campaign events
[14:08.720 --> 14:15.520]  Hillary's leaning stool all of that but now more experts going on the record and in fact this has
[14:15.520 --> 14:22.080]  now become part of the Trump campaign since our video went viral just over two weeks ago
[14:22.080 --> 14:28.880]  Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pearson appeared on MSNBC yesterday to address this issue let's go to the
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.920]  clip this is something that Donald Trump brought up during the primaries do you mean the questions
[14:33.920 --> 14:39.120]  about Secretary Clinton's health is that what you're referring to yes he has said that she doesn't
[14:39.120 --> 14:45.600]  have the strength or the stamina for a very long time that part is nothing new what's new
[14:45.600 --> 14:52.320]  are the other reports of the observations of Hillary Clinton's behavior and mannerisms specifically
[14:52.320 --> 14:57.680]  with what you just showed in the in those previous clips as well as her dysphagia the fact that she's
[14:57.680 --> 15:07.280]  fallen she has had a concussion there's no indication that she let's just step back for one second
[15:07.280 --> 15:13.280]  we did get this reaction from her doctor i just want to read that to you who says quote a secretary
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.360]  clinton's longtime physician i released a medical statement during the campaign indicating that she
[15:17.360 --> 15:22.160]  is an excellent health i've recently been made aware of allegedly leaked medical documents regarding
[15:22.160 --> 15:26.800]  secretary clinton with my name on them these documents are false were not written by me and
[15:26.800 --> 15:31.840]  are not based on any medical facts to reiterate what i said in my previous statement secretary
[15:31.840 --> 15:38.480]  clinton is an excellent health and fit to serve as president of the united states so these health
[15:38.480 --> 15:44.320]  questions have been debunked Katrina and yet donald trump continues to try to stir them up is that
[15:44.320 --> 15:50.880]  responsible for someone who's running for president well he's not talking about her health record we
[15:50.880 --> 15:56.000]  he's talking about specific observations just like some of the clips that you've shown and it is
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.520]  extremely important to know that Hillary Clinton has taken a lot of time clearly trying to spin up
[16:01.520 --> 16:07.840]  some of that speculation well it's it's something that needs to be addressed she's taken a lot of
[16:07.840 --> 16:13.120]  time off the campaign trail she hasn't had a press conference this year why don't we just
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.720]  have miss clinton have a press conference and she can answer all of these in question now
[16:18.720 --> 16:24.800]  you heard there the msnbc commentator the host again talking over the trump campaign spokeswoman
[16:24.800 --> 16:31.680]  not even allowing her to make her points claiming that the quote issue had been debunked now they're
[16:31.680 --> 16:37.440]  doing that by citing this fake document that was circulating on twitter that purported to be
[16:37.440 --> 16:44.000]  from hillary clinton's personal physician it wasn't everybody knew it wasn't nobody no serious
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.680]  commentator who has been talking about hillary's health ever used that document as proof i didn't
[16:49.680 --> 16:55.120]  use it in the viral video that's now over three million views sean hannity didn't use it on fox
[16:55.120 --> 17:01.040]  news mike cernovich didn't use it when dr drew came out and talked about that this issue he
[17:01.040 --> 17:07.200]  didn't use it nobody's citing that document as proof we know it's a fake document we knew it was
[17:07.200 --> 17:14.720]  a fake document from minute one so why did the clinton campaign draw attention to a fake document
[17:14.720 --> 17:21.520]  that no serious commentator had even cited as proof because it's a straw man they can hold this up
[17:21.520 --> 17:27.600]  and say look at this fake document it's so amateurish it's so obviously being debunked therefore
[17:27.600 --> 17:33.280]  all the other questions made by serious observers medical experts about hillary's health are also
[17:33.280 --> 17:38.560]  debunked you see that little trick they're playing well they've got a problem because every single day
[17:38.560 --> 17:44.800]  prominent people are coming out we had dr drew two days ago low and behold k abc that affiliate
[17:44.800 --> 17:51.520]  out of i think it's los angeles deleted the original dr drew interview from their website
[17:51.520 --> 17:57.360]  you go there now it's gone it's been memory hold now there's no indication that dr drew
[17:57.360 --> 18:02.320]  himself wanted them to do that but it's it's disappeared thankfully i uploaded it to youtube
[18:02.320 --> 18:08.560]  it's got probably 300 000 views by now on just an audio file they can't keep this issue down it's
[18:08.560 --> 18:14.640]  going to keep coming back and it has again today this is up on info wars dot com not a conspiracy
[18:14.640 --> 18:20.880]  theorist another expert radiologist dr milton r wolf who says that hillary clinton has a quote
[18:20.880 --> 18:28.400]  serious underlying disease again that's not from a fake document that's not from a conspiracy
[18:28.400 --> 18:35.120]  theorist that's from a practicing position dr milton r wolf says that hillary clinton has
[18:35.120 --> 18:41.120]  a serious underlying disease that her campaign is hiding from the american people and he reached
[18:41.120 --> 18:47.520]  out to me last night directly to question why hillary is being given this blood thinner kumadin
[18:47.520 --> 18:52.000]  which is a drug used to prevent heart attack strokes and blood clots in veins and arteries
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  according to wolf this is a quote hillary's doctors know you would never never give kumadin
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.600]  to normal healthy patients it's too dangerous and the fact that she's taking this drug
[19:03.600 --> 19:10.480]  must mean quote her risk of morbidity from blood clots without kumadin must be substantial
[19:10.480 --> 19:17.280]  he goes on to say that in in his medical expert experience people who take kumadin are at risk
[19:17.280 --> 19:25.520]  of intercranial hemorrhage and suffer from falls on a regular basis now isn't that interesting
[19:25.520 --> 19:31.040]  given what we've seen with hillary's handlers the secret service agents having to constantly

[25:33.200 --> 25:40.480]  early dvd release special at info wars store dot com few minutes left here in this segment and this
[25:40.480 --> 25:46.080]  is absolutely huge this just came out a couple of hours ago over at the daily caller listen to this
[25:46.080 --> 25:52.400]  this hillary campaign vows to destroy your opposition website democratic nominee hillary
[25:52.400 --> 25:58.400]  clinton's campaign has sent out a fundraising email arguing that the website bright bar news has
[25:58.400 --> 26:08.000]  quote no right to exist that's the quote no right to exist and suggest that if elected the website
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.560]  will be shut down entirely now of course we had the link up with bannon and the trump campaign a
[26:14.560 --> 26:20.880]  couple of days ago now clinton even if she wins the election is saying that she will go on to
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.640]  destroy it bright bar now of course if they want to destroy bright bar they want to destroy the
[26:26.640 --> 26:32.000]  drudge report they want to destroy the daily caller they want to destroy info wars dot com
[26:32.720 --> 26:40.320]  no right to exist this is a quote from the email sent out by the clinton campaign quote we've had
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.840]  a conservative media in this country for a while this was sent out by christina reynolds i don't
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.800]  always like what they have to say but i respect their role in their right to exist reynolds
[26:50.800 --> 26:55.200]  acknowledgment that the regular conservative media has a right to exist though is used to contrast
[26:55.200 --> 27:03.680]  it with bright bar which apparently has no such right so they're saying that all the coxervative
[27:03.680 --> 27:08.960]  websites that were behind ted crews that have thrown donald trump under a bus they're perfectly
[27:08.960 --> 27:16.160]  fine we're going to tolerate those websites but bright bar dot com no way no right to exist this
[27:16.160 --> 27:22.480]  is what the email goes on to say this is chilling bright bar is something different they make fox
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.520]  news look like a democratic party pamphlet they're a different breed altogether not just conservative
[27:27.520 --> 27:35.040]  but radical bigoted anti-muslim anti-Semitic conspiracy peddlers who've never been and
[27:35.040 --> 27:41.200]  never should be anywhere near the leaves of power in this country again bigoted the guy is basically
[27:41.200 --> 27:48.880]  the website is basically dominated by mylo yinopolis who is a very prominent member of the
[27:48.880 --> 27:57.120]  lgbt community there's no anti-Semitism on there whatsoever they tell the truth about migrant crime
[27:57.120 --> 28:03.040]  apparently that's islamophobic now you know cnn sally cone says that sharia law is progressive
[28:03.040 --> 28:09.200]  we've got the bbc coming out with documentaries saying that anyone who even mentions sharia law
[28:09.200 --> 28:15.840]  is an islamophobe so their view of what is bigoted and anti-muslim is merely questioning
[28:15.840 --> 28:23.040]  the belief system of islam which is not a race but to them that's racist that's bigoted that's
[28:23.040 --> 28:31.760]  anti-muslim and now the clinton campaign is vowing to destroy destroy bright bar dot com
[28:31.760 --> 28:39.520]  after the election shut down their entire website complete contempt for free speech for the first
[28:39.520 --> 28:47.360]  amendment and remember it's coming up here i believe just in a few days this is out the bbc us
[28:47.360 --> 28:54.160]  ready to hand over the internet's naming system well isn't this an interesting correlation the
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.520]  us has confirmed it's finally ready to cede power of the internet's naming system ending the almost
[28:59.520 --> 29:05.040]  20 year process to hand over a crucial part of the internet's governance so they're basically
[29:05.040 --> 29:11.600]  handing over control of the domain name system to the united nations which will then be dominated
[29:11.600 --> 29:18.960]  by countries that don't quite have the same view on free speech as the united states countries like
[29:18.960 --> 29:25.920]  china and russia in fact bright bar itself reported two months left until obama gives
[29:25.920 --> 29:32.640]  dictators control of the internet so they're about to give the un dominated by russia and china
[29:32.640 --> 29:38.720]  control of the internet to shut down free speech right as hillary clinton's campaign says that
[29:38.720 --> 29:44.720]  certain conservative websites like bright bar dot com don't have the right to exist this is
[29:44.720 --> 29:51.360]  absolutely chilling we'll be back with roger stone on the alex jones show info wars dot com will be
[29:51.360 --> 29:56.080]  by us on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.640]  joe bakes here with info wars dot com trump spokeswoman hillary health questions must be
[30:04.640 --> 30:09.360]  answered why doesn't she have a press conference article by paul joseph watson donald trump
[30:09.360 --> 30:15.040]  spokeswoman katrina pierce and told msnbc tuesday that questions surrounding hillary clinton's health
[30:15.040 --> 30:21.120]  must be addressed including why hillary is taking so much time off pierce and drew attention to hillary
[30:21.120 --> 30:27.360]  strange behavior and mannerisms that were featured in our viral video in addition to her documented
[30:27.360 --> 30:32.800]  health problems as a result of her fall in 2012 the host then claimed that the whole issue had been
[30:32.800 --> 30:37.920]  debunked because of a fake document cited by the clinton campaign which none of the commentators
[30:37.920 --> 30:42.480]  asking questions about hillary self have been used as evidence in addition because hillary's
[30:42.480 --> 30:48.400]  personal physician says she is in good health that's apparently an impartial source according to msnbc
[30:48.400 --> 30:53.680]  americans are less convinced a recent rasmussen poll found that 59 percent of them want hillary
[30:53.680 --> 31:00.320]  to release her full medical records just as the media pressure john mccain back in 2008 it's not
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.560]  just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air
[31:04.560 --> 31:11.040]  we're breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely

[34:32.080 --> 34:37.520]  we put it back at the top of the agenda with that viral video back a couple of weeks ago
[34:37.520 --> 34:45.120]  now everybody's talking about it now the clinton campaign is in damage control mode that's why it's
[34:45.120 --> 34:49.600]  really important for you to support us to allow us to challenge the mainstream media directly

[34:54.720 --> 35:00.320]  matter or any of these other media organizations we're not funded by corrupt dictatorial governments
[35:00.320 --> 35:08.480]  like cnn we're not funded by giant pharmaceutical companies we're funded by you and you alone so
[35:08.480 --> 35:15.120]  please it's vital to get the products at info wars life dot com now going back to what we
[35:15.120 --> 35:20.560]  were covering before the break this is absolutely massive the hillary campaign sent out an email
[35:20.560 --> 35:27.200]  vowing to destroy bright bar dot com saying that oh we can tolerate some conservative websites but
[35:27.200 --> 35:34.880]  this one doesn't have a right to exist they're openly bearing their teeth about to sink their fangs
[35:34.880 --> 35:42.160]  into the first amendment if hillary wins this election and just by coincidence barack obama
[35:42.160 --> 35:48.240]  is about to hand over control of the internet to the united nations dominated by these countries
[35:48.960 --> 35:55.600]  who have crushed free speech in the past who have silenced dissidents remember for the past eight
[35:55.600 --> 36:01.200]  years intermittently we've had the obama administration come out and signal that it could
[36:01.200 --> 36:07.280]  back this internet kill switch used by the likes of the communist chinese government
[36:07.280 --> 36:12.560]  who shut down certain parts of the internet for example when there's civil unrest when there's
[36:12.560 --> 36:18.960]  a protest when some particularly damaging piece of information comes out about a politician somebody
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.760]  in the government they have the power to shut down certain parts of the internet in certain
[36:23.760 --> 36:29.280]  areas of the country the obama administration and other people like joe Lieberman have supported
[36:29.280 --> 36:35.760]  that on a routine basis this is going to make it easier for them to do that now concurrent to this
[36:35.760 --> 36:42.480]  we've got this story out of the daily caller again npr deletes comment says commenters are too old
[36:42.480 --> 36:49.200]  and mail national public radio is the latest online publication to eliminate public comments on its
[36:49.200 --> 36:54.480]  articles defending the decision by saying few people actually comment and those who do are
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.720]  typically older men and of course they don't count because they have white male privilege that means
[37:00.720 --> 37:05.680]  we can just ostracize them and pretend they don't exist that's their great privilege that they have
[37:05.680 --> 37:11.200]  npr says its decision to get rid of comments is mostly based on engagement now if this was
[37:11.200 --> 37:17.520]  one example then it'd be a different thing but we've tracked for the past three four years all
[37:17.520 --> 37:24.080]  these major websites time magazine daily beast the verge you can go on down the list removing
[37:24.080 --> 37:29.680]  comment sections from their websites entirely why are they doing that well it's because studies
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.760]  have shown that when readers read an article they don't judge its accuracy based on the content of
[37:35.760 --> 37:42.240]  the article they judge it based on what the respondents are saying in the comment section
[37:42.240 --> 37:48.960]  that's why the left has declared war on comment sections because time and time again their narrative
[37:48.960 --> 37:55.200]  is being completely eviscerated so now they're saying we'll cut off our nose to spy our face we'll
[37:55.200 --> 38:00.160]  just get rid of the comment section entirely even though that's going to cost them a ton of traffic
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.520]  because that's how desperate they are to control the narrative but we have roger stone on the line
[38:05.520 --> 38:10.320]  now we'll get back into these roger you need no introduction of course you've been on several
[38:10.320 --> 38:16.480]  times before you wanted to pop in with an update so you've got the floor tell us the latest thank
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.640]  you that's very kind uh was on my way uh to lunch first of all let me apologize for wearing a button
[38:22.640 --> 38:28.640]  down shirt with a vested suit I understand it isn't done however uh when I checked from the
[38:28.640 --> 38:35.200]  laundry it was the only clean white shirt I had anyway I'm delighted to be with you uh because
[38:35.200 --> 38:43.200]  I think the events in today's Trump campaign uh need to be explained uh in essence here Paul Manafort
[38:43.200 --> 38:51.360]  became concerned that the unfounded and baseless attacks on him which were uh orchestrated by
[38:51.360 --> 38:59.120]  Sydney Blumenthal the dirty trickster and hitman who works for Hillary uh paid for by Victor Pinchuk
[38:59.120 --> 39:06.000]  the Ukrainian billionaire who purchased the Ukrainian coup from the Clintons for a 10 million
[39:06.000 --> 39:13.760]  dollar uh contribution to the Clinton Foundation uh and these hooked up baseless stories in which
[39:13.760 --> 39:20.240]  we have a ledger uh alleging Manafort took uh payments for which there is no financial trail
[39:20.240 --> 39:27.280]  or record evidence that would never stand up in court a story uh in the New York Times that admits
[39:27.280 --> 39:32.640]  that he is not accused of any wrongdoing that no government official has accused him of wrongdoing
[39:33.200 --> 39:39.920]  Manafort has not worked for the government of Ukraine or Russia he worked for a democratic
[39:39.920 --> 39:48.160]  political party through two difficult parliamentary elections and a presidential election Paul you try
[39:48.160 --> 39:54.000]  electing a guy named Kauzanowski to the Ukrainian parliament in a district that has
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.840]  more cows than people uh his payments were legal and there's no evidence of wrongdoing but
[40:00.720 --> 40:08.320]  we know that uh that Sydney Blumenthal the hitman who works for Hillary has had a phalanx of
[40:08.320 --> 40:17.520]  investigators all over Kiev and Moscow trying to dig dirt up on Manafort this is the most they
[40:17.520 --> 40:24.960]  could find there is no they're there in fact I would suggest to you that this alleged uh ledger
[40:24.960 --> 40:32.000]  that shows payments to him may be the product of Ukrainian intelligence controlled by the billionaire
[40:32.000 --> 40:40.160]  Pinchuk so uh Manafort being a professional and recognizing that the mainstream media is not
[40:40.160 --> 40:48.080]  going to be objective about this and also recognizing that this controversy feeds the
[40:48.080 --> 40:59.040]  false theme of Trump Putin Russia Manafort which is modern-day McCarthyism because Trump is not
[40:59.040 --> 41:06.080]  for war before because he's for détente with the Russians and hard-headed negotiations that would
[41:06.080 --> 41:13.440]  allow us to work together to eradicate ISIS we question his patriotism the Clinton people saying
[41:13.440 --> 41:18.640]  that Manafort and Trump are in league with Putin says they're working against the interests of
[41:18.640 --> 41:26.640]  their country it's treasonous it's false it has no basis in fact but this entire narrative about
[41:26.640 --> 41:34.320]  Manafort in the Ukraine is spun by the Clinton thugs was a distraction so Manafort being a
[41:34.320 --> 41:43.280]  professional and having left the campaign in structurally better shape with a research operation
[41:43.280 --> 41:52.000]  a field operation a state operation and so on decides to step aside in the best interest
[41:52.640 --> 41:59.840]  of the Trump campaign let me point out Manafort never was paid a penny that allegations that
[41:59.840 --> 42:06.000]  Corey Lewandowski is out trying to peddle that there was some kind of financial impropriety on
[42:06.000 --> 42:14.800]  Manafort's part are actionable if anybody chooses to write that but he did what a political pro
[42:14.800 --> 42:23.840]  would do step aside but not before he understood this news cycle and helped install the bomb-throwing
[42:23.840 --> 42:31.120]  firebrand and friend of mine and now friend of Manafort's Stephen K Bannon and Kelly Conway
[42:31.120 --> 42:39.360]  who I think is great and and have a lot of confidence and so that's what really transpired
[42:39.360 --> 42:45.600]  here this is a selfless act on Manafort's part it's what and I hate that this is a filibuster
[42:45.600 --> 42:51.920]  Paul but it's what Corey Lewandowski should have done when he was accused of manhandling
[42:51.920 --> 42:58.320]  a reporter in the interests of Donald Trump in the campaign Mr Lewandowski may say well I was
[42:58.320 --> 43:04.720]  innocent but Manafort is also innocent although there's more evidence in Corey's case so that's
[43:04.720 --> 43:11.120]  what's really transpiring here the Ukrainian government of Pinchup may be trying to purchase
[43:11.120 --> 43:18.080]  an election they would like to disqualify Donald Trump so yes there's internal Ukrainian politics
[43:18.080 --> 43:28.000]  here but this fellow working through his US agents purchased the coup that toppled a democratic
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.640]  elected president in Ukraine he gave so much to the Clintons I believe in that year he moved ahead
[43:34.640 --> 43:41.440]  of the Saudis and perhaps the Chinese that's the backstory that those who are watching us today need
[43:41.440 --> 43:47.760]  to know so we got the media again obsessing Roger about you know Russia interfering in the US
[43:47.760 --> 43:52.880]  election when this could be an example of that very thing but a concrete effort by the government
[43:52.880 --> 43:59.840]  of Ukraine to do that very same thing on the flip side we've got the point at the same time the
[43:59.840 --> 44:04.960]  mainstream media including the New York Times choose to ignore the overseas adventures of the
[44:04.960 --> 44:13.120]  Podesta brothers who have illicitly profited from all these foreign governments at the based on their
[44:13.120 --> 44:19.360]  Clinton connections Podesta throws out some emails where he and Manafort have a small
[44:19.360 --> 44:25.040]  piece of business together violating the confidence of his client and also getting
[44:25.040 --> 44:32.000]  reported to clean up the story a little bit in terms of his involvement but more about Mr. Podesta
[44:32.640 --> 44:38.000]  and Mr. Blumenthal soon what let me remind your listeners Sidney Blumenthal is the man who we now
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.800]  know indisputably made up the false claim that the attack on our brave men in Benghazi was
[44:44.800 --> 44:52.560]  caused by an anti-Islamic video that's a lie invented by Sidney Blumenthal confirmed by his
[44:52.560 --> 45:00.560]  emails is found by the US Congress it is born of his son Max a Jew hating Israel hating radical
[45:00.560 --> 45:08.400]  like Blumenthal himself and it is this is a guy Sidney Blumenthal who who thinks he's Ted
[45:08.400 --> 45:16.000]  Sorensen but in fact he's Al Capone this guy will do anything legal or illegal as we also
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.320]  know from the emails he was urging Hillary to topple Gaddafi not disclosing that he himself
[45:22.320 --> 45:29.840]  would make millions out of that based on some side viewings now Roger we've got Hillary Clinton
[45:29.840 --> 45:35.040]  basically has more skeletons in her closet than a crypt the New York Times is not interested in
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.520]  digging up the dirt the Washington Post isn't interested it's all about Manafort it's all
[45:39.520 --> 45:44.800]  about Trump we've got pay for play with the Clinton Foundation you were talking about I believe
[45:44.800 --> 45:50.560]  yesterday these WikiLeaks email releases which Assange promised weeks ago you're saying that
[45:50.560 --> 45:55.440]  this could be the October surprise for Hillary Clinton what do you think is going to be in
[45:55.440 --> 46:03.440]  those emails when they all eat well but who knows I believe based on my sources of information that
[46:03.440 --> 46:10.240]  Mr. Assange who I regard as a hero and someone who's been fighting the deep state both Republican
[46:10.240 --> 46:19.920]  and Democrat all neocons all for war all globalists he has released the first DNC documents to
[46:19.920 --> 46:26.480]  cataclysmic effect but I would point out again that they were first hacked by crucifer 2 who is
[46:26.480 --> 46:32.320]  not in the employ of the Russians when he put them out they got no traction they got no coverage
[46:32.320 --> 46:39.760]  he took them to WikiLeaks they confirmed their authenticity and they re-released him no Russians
[46:39.760 --> 46:44.960]  the whole idea that this was done by the Russians is a false narrative by the pneumocarthiites
[46:44.960 --> 46:54.800]  you know in the Clinton camp it is therefore I think important to recognize that the mainstream
[46:54.800 --> 47:00.640]  media particularly the New York Times is in possession of evidence of extraordinary corruption
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.640]  at the Clinton Foundation things that have happened since Peter Schweitzer wrote his epic
[47:06.640 --> 47:14.160]  book Clinton Cash so ongoing criminal conspiracies and the media isn't interested in that but Mr.
[47:14.160 --> 47:20.960]  Assange I think has the goods we don't know it could be Benghazi it could be the Clinton Foundation
[47:20.960 --> 47:28.400]  it could be their speeches their paid speeches which I think we both know are thinly described
[47:28.400 --> 47:33.360]  bribes you know Bill Clinton announcing that if Hillary's elected the Clinton Foundation
[47:34.080 --> 47:40.720]  will no longer take contributions from foreign nationals that's like the closing the barn door
[47:40.720 --> 47:45.920]  after the horse has escaped the Clinton's are crony capitalists progressives have figured out
[47:45.920 --> 47:50.640]  they're not progressives they're globalists they're neocons but they're not progressives
[47:51.200 --> 47:56.880]  and the way they gave it to Bernie Sanders without the Vaseline was true in Mr. Assange's
[47:56.880 --> 48:05.920]  first data dump now those on the left call us conspiracy theorists when we say that
[48:05.920 --> 48:12.560]  that's a catch all it's trying that's supposed to discredit you but I submit the idea that Donald
[48:12.560 --> 48:21.760]  Trump and Paul Manafort are traitors to their own country and loyal to Vladimir Putin accusing
[48:21.760 --> 48:28.000]  them of treason now there is a conspiracy theory that's the greatest stretch I've ever heard as
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.160]  far as I'm concerned I am a lifelong anti-communist I happen to know that Vladimir Putin doesn't
[48:34.160 --> 48:40.880]  like Paul Manafort in fact dislikes him because Manafort pressed his client Yanukovych to join
[48:40.880 --> 48:47.520]  the European Union over the objection of the Russians. Now final couple of minutes in this
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.480]  segment Roger and we had the big Trump speech yesterday the media's kind of spinning the
[48:52.480 --> 48:58.160]  narrative that this was a huge apology and what concerns me about it is you have
[48:58.160 --> 49:04.080]  establishment Republicans praising Trump the same people have you know lost the last two elections
[49:04.080 --> 49:08.800]  for adopting this kind of conciliatory tone in this speech yesterday do you think this
[49:08.800 --> 49:13.840]  was a deliberate hiver by Trump or is the speech being mischaracterized by the media
[49:14.720 --> 49:19.840]  mischaracterized I wish they would focus on the content of the speech Trump essentially
[49:19.840 --> 49:25.760]  asserted that he is a leader and he is committed to a reform agenda that he is unafraid to take
[49:25.760 --> 49:30.960]  on the two-party duopoly including those in his own party he disagrees with this was the best
[49:30.960 --> 49:37.920]  speech I have heard him give in this election cycle it was very well delivered and I think the
[49:37.920 --> 49:45.520]  words were more significant this hyper analysis of anything that happens in the Trump campaign
[49:45.520 --> 49:51.760]  doesn't happen in the Clinton campaign the fact that she campaigns for a day and then disappears
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.840]  for sight and then campaigns for a day and disappears from sight because she doesn't have
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.880]  the stamina to stay on her feet for a campaign event and that she can't do a press conference
[50:00.880 --> 50:06.400]  because she is uncapable event I think both physically incapable of taking the rigors
[50:06.400 --> 50:13.840]  nor does she have good answers when I see Joel Berenson on MSNBC saying these questions
[50:13.840 --> 50:18.960]  are beneath contempt and they don't rise to an answer no Joel they do your candidate needs to
[50:18.960 --> 50:25.120]  help going up a flight of stairs she is on video having seizures she is wearing glasses that doctors
[50:25.120 --> 50:31.440]  tell us are related to brain injury she had a traveling physician with her at all times
[50:31.440 --> 50:37.120]  and he clearly had an injection at the ready sorry Joel legitimate questions your candidate
[50:37.120 --> 50:43.280]  old and tired she does not have the stamina or the health to be president of the United States

[54:10.880 --> 54:17.360]  we're back for the final segment of this hour again going back to the news big mainstream media
[54:17.360 --> 54:22.560]  websites are removing comment sections from their articles because studies have shown
[54:22.560 --> 54:28.160]  that those comments have more impact than the content of the article itself they have such
[54:28.160 --> 54:35.120]  contempt for their readers such hatred for free speech that the daily beast time magazine and
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.160]  others are coming out and simply saying we don't welcome your comments anymore it's the arrogance
[54:40.160 --> 54:46.480]  that they do it with absolute sneering arrogance and in fact we had an article out of time magazine
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.920]  yesterday on this very subject how trolls are ruining the internet they're turning the web
[54:51.920 --> 54:56.960]  into a cesspool of aggression and violence but watching them is doing to the rest of us maybe
[54:56.960 --> 55:03.840]  even worse so again it's this narrative that people having free expression on the internet
[55:03.840 --> 55:11.120]  is horrible is aggressive is violent is bullying is intimidating it's cyber violence and that we
[55:11.120 --> 55:18.480]  should eliminate it again they create this hoax that the only quote trolling the only hatred the
[55:18.480 --> 55:23.840]  only bullying on the internet is coming from right wing conservatives now i can show you the death
[55:23.840 --> 55:30.240]  threats and i have done i get every single day from leftist from islamist from black lives matter
[55:30.240 --> 55:37.200]  supporters far greater in volume than anything i've seen from conservatives yes it does happen
[55:37.200 --> 55:43.680]  but to claim the only quote right wing conservatives ascending death threats ascending abuse on the
[55:43.680 --> 55:51.280]  internet is a complete hoax absolute documented media hoax just like the hillary clinton health
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.400]  hoax they took this fake document and then said oh this is a fake document that means all the
[55:56.400 --> 56:01.840]  questions about hillary clinton's health have been debunked well they haven't been debunked you
[56:01.840 --> 56:08.960]  created that media hoax none of us ever cited that fake document as evidence so why do they keep on
[56:08.960 --> 56:14.560]  claiming it why does the clinton campaign hold up this fake document and say look everything you
[56:14.560 --> 56:21.840]  said has been debunked again another massive hoax they're a complete they insult people's
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.680]  intelligence on a daily basis it's absolutely amazing so again we've got daily caller reporting
[56:27.680 --> 56:33.680]  the clinton campaign now says they want to basically eliminate destroy bright bar that it
[56:33.680 --> 56:40.320]  doesn't have a right to exist while the un is about to take over the internet absolutely
[56:40.320 --> 56:45.200]  chilling development let's hit a few final news stories here jewish man stabbed on street in
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.200]  french city of strasbourg an orthodox jewish man has been stabbed on the street in the french
[56:49.200 --> 56:55.280]  city of strasbourg by an attacker reportedly shouting an islamic slogan so you had a muslim
[56:55.280 --> 57:03.200]  guy shouting a la akbar while stabbing a jewish rabbi who was dressed in orthodox jewish clothing
[57:03.200 --> 57:09.120]  what did the police come out and say within what an hour of the attack nothing to do with terrorism
[57:09.120 --> 57:15.440]  not an anti-semitic attack okay you've got a muslim shouting a la akbar stabbing a jewish person
[57:15.440 --> 57:22.240]  and that's not anti-semitic there's a massive cover-up going on with every single one of these
[57:22.240 --> 57:27.920]  attacks in europe we saw it at the football stadium in germany last year cover-up of that attack
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.280]  we saw the rosselsquare stabbing in london again clearly a terrorist attack claimed it was mental
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.880]  illness this attack in strasbourg they claimed within an hour it was mental illness despite
[57:38.880 --> 57:44.080]  all the eyewitness evidence to the contrary we had a cover-up of a car bombing in camden
[57:44.080 --> 57:49.520]  london just a few weeks ago they're covering up these islamist terror attacks because they want
[57:49.520 --> 57:56.320]  to make the whole narrative about islamophobia now we've got the bbc saying that merely mentioning
[57:56.320 --> 58:03.680]  god being critical of sharia law is islamophobic again in line with sally cone cna sharia law
[58:03.680 --> 58:10.640]  is progressive you know honor killings forced child marriage throwing gay people off buildings
[58:10.640 --> 58:16.960]  stoning women to death chopping people's hands off if they steal something that's all under sharia law
[58:16.960 --> 58:23.840]  that's all progressive according to sally cone according to cnn according to the bbc it's another
[58:23.840 --> 58:29.680]  giant media hoax they run them on a daily basis but that's going to wrap it up for this hour

[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:54.480]  his latest report detailing the clinton foundation donations and how of course they've been linked
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:00.080]  to a state department favors now we don't really need anyone to spell this out for us we know this
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:05.040]  is already happening but thank you wane madson we're going to get into the details we're also
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.960]  going to take a look at how george soro says behind the muslim takeover of the west will also be
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:17.520]  speaking with political cartoonist ben garrison i want to get his opinion on how censorship and
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:23.120]  this political correct culture is basically infiltrating every single corridor that we are
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.880]  seeing in our country and you know he dares to go where no one else goes talking about hillary's
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.800]  health and how we're having to prop her up like weekend at bernie's we're also going to get into
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:41.280]  the latest on reports that the us is moving nukes closer to the ukraine alex jones has a special
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:49.360]  report giving us the latest details joe bigs will also be joining me in studio to talk about trump's
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.040]  epic speech this is an epic speech that has the globalists shaking in their boots they have no
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:02.240]  idea how to deal with a trump who has now pivoted he's come out and basically apologize for maybe
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.840]  offending anyone but saying look i'm going to be honest i'm an honest person i'm not a politician
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:14.320]  and that's what you're going to get with me is a president who is going to tell you the truth tell
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:21.120]  you like it is it might not always be pretty and frankly i would take that any day over a president
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:30.080]  who has been lying to us laughing at us he's very snarky and he uh calls out the press and is
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:36.880]  lecturing them how dare you question me i didn't pay a ransom for uh americans for iran and then
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.800]  turns out yes indeed he did pay a ransom trump was right on that once again even though the the
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.520]  press who was being lectured by obama went after donald trump and telling him what a fool he was
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:54.640]  for daring to question his holiness president obama and of course now people are being led
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.640]  right to the slaughter again with hillary clinton who has lied under oath been caught lying under
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:07.440]  oath she basically uh had fbi director james comey almost throwing up in his mouth while he was
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.680]  detailing all of her all of her lies that she said under oath and then had to had to kind of say
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.920]  at the end there well we're not going to go ahead and pursue charges against her but now we are
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:25.200]  hoping that the uh gop is going to be bold and pursue some perjury charges against hillary clinton
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.440]  but you know i really appreciate where donald trump went with his speech he's very positive very
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.760]  inclusive and i like this pivot i like what he's done and the press is going to try to you know
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:44.640]  label this as some sort of a shakeup or something i think this is uh an incredibly positive switch
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:50.400]  up for his campaign i think a lot of people are going to be surprised at how much they agree with
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.160]  his ideology now that donald trump is is working these positive angles there's nothing the press
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:02.080]  is going to be able to do to spin his words um that's what they try to do is sort of spiral
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.840]  everything out of control that way the media and trump that he has to work on spiraling it back
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:14.240]  in the right direction but you know what i think he's gonna destroy them at their own game he's
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:20.160]  going to be a champion of the people he is going to be put america first that's what he said in his
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.360]  speech you know let our children be dreamers too but we're going to have more on that coming up later
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.560]  in the show but right after the break you're going to be hearing a very special report from alex jones
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.840]  he wants to give you the truth because you're not going to hear it from the mainstream media you're
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:39.840]  just going to hear uh the pentagon denying the fact that the us is moving nukes closer to the
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:45.600]  ukraine but we need to get the truth and so alex jones is going to be giving us all of the latest

[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:57.280]  tell these fables and you buy it and spread it to the citizens of your countries and your people
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:04.480]  do not feel a sense of the impending danger this is what worries me how do you not understand
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:11.680]  that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction that is the problem but they pretend
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.680]  like nothing's going on i don't even know how to get through to you people anymore
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:26.160]  Putin will try to destabilize uh ukraine but the ukrainians uh the large majority of ukrainians
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:32.560]  are determined to be independent of of russia well then why are you interfering in our business
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:38.240]  don't meddle in our business sort out your own issues first mr trump declared that he's ready
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:45.680]  to restore full cooperative relations with russia what's so bad about that we all welcome that do you
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:10:08.880]  not in recent years we have seen a cacophony of geopolitical experts historians statisticians
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:20.560]  statesmen come out and warn that the world is hurtling towards major military conflict between
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:26.880]  the united states and russia and that the climate that we see in the world today is very similar to
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:35.120]  what we saw before world war one and world war two vladimir putin has come out multiple times
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:42.320]  in the last six months at press conferences and warned the world that the west under the
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.480]  guise of missile defense systems is moving offensive nuclear weapons up to the border with russia
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:57.760]  i study the facts i know that two years ago george soros bragged on cnn that he
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.800]  had the major part with the state department in overthrowing the elected government of ukraine
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:09.360]  first on ukraine one of the things that many people recognized about you was that you
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:16.800]  during the revolutions of 1989 funded a lot of dissident activities civil society groups in
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:22.320]  eastern europe and poland the czech republic are you doing similar things in ukraine well
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:31.920]  i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent of russia and the foundation
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:41.360]  has been functioning ever since and it played an important part in events now now in the eastern
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:47.760]  area of ukraine that has always been part of russia the Crimea it means the border in russia
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:56.320]  we have proxy armies of nato battling russian troops and the russian losses have been high
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.440]  just last week vladimir putin came out in the press conference and pointed out that Kiev is
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:08.320]  launching basically asymmetrical attacks or what he called terrorism and whether you support russia
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.720]  or putin or don't or whether you're just neutral it should be a major news item here in the united
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.520]  states here's a segment of that news conference it is true that our special forces have foiled an
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:26.800]  attempt by a group of sabotage infiltrators belonging to the ukrainian defense ministries
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:34.480]  intelligence agency who were seeking to penetrate the Crimean territory and in view of these events
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:40.400]  it has become pointless to meet with the ukrain's current authorities at the normandy format
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:47.440]  we have suffered losses as a result of this operation we undoubtedly cannot turn a blind
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.240]  eye to the deaths of our servicemen but i would also like to address our american and european
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:59.360]  partners i think today has become obvious for everyone that kiev's current authorities are
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:05.280]  not seeking ways to solve problems through negotiations but have turned to terrorism instead
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:12.480]  this is a highly troubling development there are no other reasons for conducting such actions
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:19.760]  other than to distract the ukrainian people and divert their attention from the disastrous economic
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:27.680]  situation and the miserable conditions most of them are living in and here we are two years after
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:33.120]  george soros and the state department brag that they overthrew the elected government of ukraine
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:40.080]  and now as nato and western forces mass on the russian border and as russia puts 40 000 troops
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.640]  on its border and goes on high alert and as putin says no more detain no more talk with ukraine
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:54.160]  you are attacking russian citizens in your east zero coverage here in our media unless there's
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.400]  stories saying that i'm a russian agent or that info wars or donald trump have sold out to putin
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:07.840]  no we've sold out to common sense and decency and not having a nuclear war and i see the emails
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:13.920]  that come in in the comments on info wars by a vocal minority saying that i'm a fearmonger
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:20.560]  because i'm concerned about global conflict yes i'm concerned about the west funding al-qaeda and
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:28.160]  isis to take over the middle east and north africa i'm upset about our governments creating thousands
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:35.200]  of trillions of dollars of fake derivatives to buy up the world i'm concerned about the clinton
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:40.720]  foundation taking money from third world dictators and middle eastern governments that
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.920]  oppress women and homosexuals i'm concerned about the laissez faire attitude of our elites
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:52.240]  but i'm even more concerned about the general population because i've had people that i know
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:59.360]  personally say to me alex we've been hearing about nuclear war since the 1960s it's fearmongering
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:07.040]  it's never gonna happen and the new york times makes jokes about fear porn we have the power
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:14.160]  to destroy life on this planet many times over we have promethean fire that will either take us
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:21.440]  the stars or turn this whole planet into a giant tombstone i have three children i study geopolitics
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:28.000]  i'm involved in trying to build a better world i want peace with russia and china i don't want war
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.960]  and i see our very elites that tell us don't worry about war being the ones that gave nuclear
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:38.160]  reactors in north korea so they could create atomic bombs and who gave the missile secrets
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:46.240]  for icbms to china in the 1990s the very people telling us don't worry about all this are the
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:53.040]  very ones that are pushing our world towards the brink of extinction and not just for humanity
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:59.520]  we've seen the haig recently rule against the chinese and the south china sea and we've seen
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:06.320]  china go into a very belligerent tone threatening war with the world whether you support the
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.960]  communist chinese or don't i'm sitting here as an american patriot pointing out that we have
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:18.960]  aircraft carriers and fleets openly lined up against chinese ships in the south china sea in
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:25.440]  the last two months with the people's daily and the president of china saying war with the united
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:35.440]  states is imminent and there's a thousand times more news literally about some american athlete
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.920]  in south america at the olympics who might have lied about being robbed that's the big story
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.840]  and not this world net daily is reporting that six plus trillion dollars is missing from the pentagon
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.840]  the last time cbs news reported the day before 9 11 the two trillion was missing you saw what happened
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:58.560]  and that's just the beginning of what i'm talking about the elite is all basically running to armored
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:04.240]  fortresses and redoubts in new zealand they're going underground it's admitted they're building huge
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.520]  walls from hillary's palace to zuckerbergs around their houses they're acting like it's the end of
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:14.720]  the world while telling us don't worry about it it's a conspiracy theory if you even talk about
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:23.920]  putin discussing nuclear war these are crazy times we alive and i'm simply here ringing the alarm bell
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.360]  saying we've gotten by without a nuclear war so far and we're very close to one right now
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:36.160]  let's have a debate about this instead of whether or not somebody on the olympic team lied about
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:44.560]  being assaulted let's force real issues out there in the open i'm alex jones asking all of you to
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:52.720]  think about the facts to weigh the evidence and to decide is having 50 000 nuclear weapons on this
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:18:01.360]  planet safe is massing trips the russian border a good idea is funding isis and al-qaeda a good idea
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:10.000]  the decision is up to all of us and we should have a serious debate about it the globalists
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.760]  don't want that debate to happen but we're here to force that debate front and center just like
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.800]  we've done about election fraud just like we've done about gmo just like we've done about our
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.000]  government funding isis on every front info wars of the tip of the spear because we have 28 million
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.720]  viewers and listeners just like you are awake and who are involved so my friends it's time to take
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:45.920]  action and stop a new world war and there we have it alex jones with the key intel now we
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.800]  know we just cannot trust the establishment media to give us the facts of what's going on they want
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.880]  to distract us with what color of swimmers hair turned when it was there in the pool at the olympics
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.480]  total propaganda channels and just diverting our attention from the fact that if these nukes are
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:08.720]  put there on the border a risa report warned that isis could steal the nukes in turkey this is
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.240]  absolutely insanity but the establishment wants that bogeyman we've got to have you know russian
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:20.000]  bogeyman there so they can continue to control people and use that fear factor whenever they're

[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:57.840]  product now we're going to shift gears and go to our guest this is ben garrison he is a political
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:04.800]  activist cartoonist um he's a commercial artist fine artist and a libertarian cartoonist now he
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:11.280]  says he's very angry after the 2008 banker bailout so he decided to draw protest cartoons in his
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:17.760]  spare time he began by drawing anti federal reserve and pro ron paul cartoons you've seen
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:24.000]  his work he has very iconic anti new world order artwork but now it seems like uh mr garrison
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.120]  you're dead set on taking out hillary clinton welcome to the show thanks for having me normally i'd
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.560]  be drawing a lot more anti federal reserve cartoons anti big government and anti um
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.600]  um forced vaccination and things such as that but right now it's imperative that we keep this
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:47.440]  creature from returning to the white house because if she gets it back in there now i mean who knows
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.880]  what kind of junk she'll pull on the american people i mean she could end up doing some stuff
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:59.760]  that would make Hitler and Stalin blush right and you know there's kind of a tenant in journalism
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:05.520]  when you're chasing a story if everybody zigs use zag and so it appears like that's exactly
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:10.080]  what you're doing with your artwork because a lot of people would probably go after what they perceive
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.800]  as the low hanging fruit which would be donald trump and we're seeing a lot of this artwork
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:20.880]  making fun of him oh he's he's naked statues are being put up in new york and and things like that
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.200]  but you're you're going after the topics that the media doesn't want to talk about hillary's health
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:33.520]  how the election was rigged let's first just get into one of your latest cartoons weekend at hillary
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:39.120]  east uh where you're you're basically showing how she is having to be propped up and dragged
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:46.240]  into this election well this cartoon is factual it's not that much of an exaggeration i mean
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:52.000]  we've already seen it with our own eyes and um some people or some doctors out there are even
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.840]  starting to say that she has the early onset of dementia well we know we've known for a long time
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:03.680]  that she's already had severe dementia when it comes to ethics she's got ethics dementia so
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:11.040]  i drew this cartoon to to um illustrate that that's more of an illustration rather than just fact to
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:18.960]  me i mean just look at her she could hardly go up the stairs and she's uh she's um gotta be propped
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:27.040]  up on pills she's got her stool right so now she's taking the weekend off she's taking the weekend
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:33.520]  off and obama's golfing while uh while trump is uh going down louisiana to uh help out the
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.720]  flood victims what does that tell you exactly and in fact they've even said that they don't really
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:44.320]  want president obama coming to visit them in louisiana just yet because he takes so much
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.120]  preparation he would take all of the police that are there trying to help the families in need
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.360]  they would have to go protect him so they're like don't even come we don't need you right now
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.480]  and i love how with this with this cartoon the points that you're making is that
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:06.080]  hillary without the dnc without the mainstream media without all of her handlers her presidential
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:13.600]  run would have expired it should have expired she's unfit in so many ways in multi-dimensional
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:20.000]  ways she's not fit physically she's not fit when you look at her track record it's been
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:30.800]  a series of disasters and she's not fit ethically she has uh a long long history of bamboozling and
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:37.840]  and um and um tricking the american public yeah you're you you're never gonna run out
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.360]  oh it's what she has she's a criminal and and she everything she does she leaves a trail of scandal
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:48.800]  and yeah violations and it's just you're never gonna run out of material when it comes to hillary
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:55.600]  clinton we'll be right back with our guest ben garrison tires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:06.240]  network state department 400 million to iran was contingent on us prisoners release the state
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.840]  department admitted thursday that the us would not hand over 400 million in cash die ran until it
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:17.600]  released four american hostages two weeks after president obama insisted the payment was not a
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.920]  ransom state department spokesman john kirby was asked at thursday's press briefing in basic english
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:29.120]  you're saying you wouldn't give them 400 million in cash until the prisoners were released correct
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.480]  that's correct kirby replied in an august fourth press conference president obama said the opposite
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:40.000]  we do not pay ransom we didn't hear and we won't end the future the president told reporters
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.320]  speaking of the january 17 payment and hostage release families know we have a policy that we
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:52.320]  don't pay ransom and the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way defies
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:58.400]  logic obama added at the time well guess what the cat's out of the bag you lied we called it info

[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.560]  and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third party nutraceutical sites
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:38.000]  give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  blow your socks off i haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while but i probably could not
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.360]  have done it without brain force i went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:52.960]  took two more brain force and came in you will find a brain force and other game changing products

[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:28.080]  and welcome back to the alex jones show
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:36.480]  we have been speaking with ben garison ben garison is a political cartoonist his website is g r r r
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:44.320]  graphics dot com that's gr graphics dot com now ben i wanted to kind of get your take as a libertarian
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:51.520]  cartoonist who now says you're actively working to make sure hillary does not get her monstrous
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.640]  hands on the white house what do you think about the never trumpers who would rather have someone
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:02.800]  like hillary clinton who is completely opposite of their supposed conservative ideals they'd rather
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:10.240]  have her give her four more years to wreck this country than get trumpin this is something that
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:15.680]  i've been trying to discuss with my few remaining liberal friends i've had three separate liberal
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:20.960]  friends write me and say i don't like hillary you're right we know she's a liar she's a good liar
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:26.320]  but i have to vote for her because trump is a loose cannon they all said the exact same thing
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:31.760]  trump is a loose cannon and so my retort was well don't we need a loose cannon when the
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:37.520]  corruption is becoming so obvious it's like on display and in your face it's time for a loose
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.960]  cannon to get up there and try to blow out all the garbage that's been deposited in the white
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:50.000]  house and on capitol hill for so many years and so that that's what i tell them but they still insist
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.440]  that she's got experience i said well she's an experienced criminal and what look at the disastrous
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:01.840]  record she had as a secretary of state look at all the even as a senator she managed to get
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:10.320]  into trouble and uh was censored by by the senate so to me the obvious choice is trump not
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.200]  is trump a perfect candidate of course he's not ron paul was a perfect candidate but trump
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:20.080]  actually i i believe he sincerely cares about america and he really does want to make it great
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:26.080]  again whereas hillary will get in there and continue the cronyism and pocket-filling
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.200]  of her of her corrupt buddies that's what she's going to do i mean do you think the leopard's
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.880]  going to change her spots once she gets into the white house no she's going to be even more
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:39.920]  emboldened and that's why that's what we got to keep her out of there now that's why i'm going to
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:46.960]  continue to draw the cartoons to uh to try to uh sway sway a few minds now when i drew that brexit
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:54.640]  cartoon to my surprise i had an avalanche of people writing me mostly from england and they
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.760]  said that that cartoon influenced them and it's like i broke a logjam they're actually able to
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:06.560]  start talking about um how they're objected to uh the eu abuses as well as forced immigration
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:15.840]  by uh muslims and so my cartoon sort of triggered that conversation whereas before they're afraid
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:19.920]  that they'd be called racist they're afraid that they'd be say well i'm a hater but when i drew
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:25.840]  that cartoon it showed up everywhere in europe and i'm still selling a lot of prints today and it's
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:31.280]  like um that's what a cartoon should do that's what a successful cartoon should do it should sway
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:37.200]  minds and and at least the very least generate debate and so i consider that cartoon is my most
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:44.400]  successful cartoon of the year absolutely and so i mean just like i was saying earlier these are the
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:49.600]  things that people need to be sharing on facebook on twitter are these political cartoons and these
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:56.400]  memes they're so powerful it's so easy to just hit send or you know retweet or something like that
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:01.840]  to really get this message out there to let people know that it's okay to ask what the heck is wrong
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:07.520]  with hillary why does she seem so unhealthy why does she have to take days off from her speeches
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:13.120]  why does she need stools to prop her up because she can't even stand uh she's trying to get the
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:19.200]  debates to be a sit-down debate just because just so people won't see how weak she is on her feet
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:26.560]  this is frightening you at all that we have such a powerful media protecting her and and you're
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:35.520]  kind of working at this from with cartoons well i try to watch all sides of the media i mean i even
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:43.680]  watched a lot of cnn during the primaries and um it's just it's just disgusting how the the uh the
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:50.080]  media is supposed to be a watchdog but now there are there are attack dogs for hillary and within
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.960]  a if i give you an example with one 15 minute segment on cnn i heard them call hillary historic
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:02.480]  at least a dozen times at the same time they kept calling trump divisive so it's a really
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:07.280]  a form of brainwashing they're hoping people are so stupid that they could play this met
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:12.720]  jedi mind trick on them you know and and suddenly they're gonna vote for hillary despite all her
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:20.000]  all the obvious crimes and corruption that trail behind her and so this is what's so important
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.120]  about alternative media and increasingly a lot of young people they're not tuning into these the
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:30.240]  major mainstream media channels they're going to get their news from alternative media where they
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:36.400]  can actually find some some truth and and some actual investigative journalism which isn't happening
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:43.120]  on the mainstream media they're just curing the curing the ball for the uh new order uh
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:48.320]  installments the selections it's not really an election it's a selection as far as the the
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:54.160]  democrats go look how rigged it was i mean look how they stole it from bernie sanders uh i heard
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:59.440]  that he may have probably even won in california but they rigged the election the primary rules so
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:05.360]  that the super delegates have the final say and thus they strip away the voice of the people now
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.320]  in this cartoon that you're showing here my older brother actually supported bernie and actually
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.560]  sent him some money and my older brother featured on the upper right and so i included him in there
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:22.400]  and this has to be the biggest political backstabbing in history the way he suddenly went with her and
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.040]  there's something there's something i know behind the scenes that took place whether they roughed
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:32.000]  up bernie or they threatened his family they did something for him to do that because he was well
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.440]  known as a man of integrity that suddenly he's going for hillary and then you know if you look if
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:43.600]  you saw him during the the dnc too he did not look happy and this cartoon here um i was i was
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:50.400]  hoping there would be a lot more outrage uh i guess hillary for the uh the fact that the whole thing
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.960]  was rigged and there was a lot of outrage a lot of bernie supporters wouldn't go to the convention
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.320]  so what did hillary do she puts an ad on craigslist for people for actors to show up and fill seats
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:07.360]  so it's it's um it's all such a cynical ruse on her part and yet she still expects to be
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.120]  president so i want to try to help wake people up and say look don't fall for her Jedi mind
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.560]  track you don't want to vote for her just because she's a woman you know i'm all for having a female
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:24.160]  president but it just can't be her because she she is not on the side of women just look for the
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:31.200]  fact that she accepted 25 million from saudi arabia and look how they treat women there well that
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:37.840]  just proves that she's liberal and loving and she's for women well she's not and she's not really
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.000]  she she claimed she's a progressive sure but what happens when she gets into the into the
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.480]  white house you know all of her all of her campaign promises will end up just being what they are empty
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:57.360]  so she's really she's really uh carrying on barack obama's administration she's really kind
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.280]  of a new con that's why many of the republican new cons would rather vote for hillary than than
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.480]  trump yeah exactly because they know what they're going to get with hillary clinton she is going
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:12.400]  to be the final nail in the coffin here for the west and they're afraid of trump they say you know
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.480]  he is a loose cannon well how can someone be so successful in business have such a well-rounded
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:25.120]  family um no one's had any major scandals this isn't someone who is a loose cannon he's someone
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:31.120]  who obviously has a lot of experience in making difficult decisions employing hundreds of thousands
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:37.600]  of people tens of thousands you know i'm not sure but he's a jobs creator and he speaks his mind he
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  speaks the truth and then here we have a president a current president who's been caught in lie after
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:50.320]  lie and then someone else they're trying to roll in who has been caught in lie after lie so you
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  know it's it's you're really up against a major machine with the pushback well that machine kept
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.480]  abusing the i'm talking about the republican establishment this time but they kept abusing
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:10.720]  the republican supporters so they want to change we wanted we wanted to get the tea party in there
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.400]  and what happened they they they totally discredited the tea party they saw the con team baggers they
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.720]  showed him with gross disrespect and people were angry that their voice was being stripped away
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:28.640]  so here comes here trump comes along and they can't understand why everybody wants trump but well
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:32.720]  because they don't want the same old republican establishment pulling the strings
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:40.240]  so here we have trump who actually wants to help america first rather than the globe globalist first
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:48.160]  he wants to build a wall he wants to have some terrace ntpp and he's thinking about america
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.200]  and its greatness and its prosperity of the people i mean look the one percent to the
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:58.320]  one ten to one percent has more wealth than the bottom 90 percent in america and trump wants to
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:06.160]  bring back some some some jobs to the people and that includes bringing jobs to african americans
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:11.120]  i'm surprised more blacks aren't supporting trump because it seems like every time they they try to
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.720]  get a democrat in there to help them they get kicked in the teeth so i'm hoping that the
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:22.880]  trump will have more hispanic and african american support as well yeah and i think the tide is
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:28.480]  really turning on that as well because with all of this unrest that we're seeing across the country
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:33.680]  they're starting to recognize that this is happening in these in these cities that have
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.720]  been run by democrats for decades and they're starting to understand that it's not just your
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.080]  average white person out in the suburbs that is holding them down it is the policies that have
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:50.160]  been put in place these democratic progressive policies that are stopping them from moving forward
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:55.600]  you know what happened we were really seeing the arising middle class within the african american
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:00.640]  community minority communities and then all of a sudden that completely changed i mean it's it's
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.680]  hard for anyone to make it into the middle class nowadays but i think that the tide is really turning
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:11.200]  with that narrative um they're starting to recognize that it's the policies that are the problem
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:17.840]  so do you do you see yourself um addressing that within your cartoons to to kind of
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:26.160]  talk specifically to say the african american community in particular i'd like to but it's
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:33.520]  it's the overall the overall picture is this and one of the reasons i like trump is he also
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:39.360]  said he wanted to audit the federal reserve and i think that's that's critical yes because that
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:44.560]  that is the heart of darkness in this country we have a dysfunctional immoral money supply
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.200]  and until we can get once we get the audit then we can get on the road to ending the fed and it's
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:58.960]  my hope that trump will end up being like andrew jackson figure now he was also a populist and
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.920]  the establishment really despised him but once he got in there it took him two terms but he
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:11.200]  got rid of the central bankers who knows maybe trump can do the same because we need a total
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.600]  money revolution so to speak we need a debt jubilee i mean look at all the kids who are like
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:24.720]  over one trillion dollars in college debt we have to do something to address that problem because
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:32.080]  we we got the national debt up to almost 20 trillion how long could that keep going what's
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:37.840]  it what's happening is like it's a making a tiny elite crony elite it's not capitalism it's crony
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:42.640]  capitalism they're getting far richer well all the other americans are continuing to get poor
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.640]  so i'd like i'd like to see trump go in there and at least have an audit of the federal reserve
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:55.680]  and he said he was open to that idea so we'll see absolutely and so obviously auditing the fed is
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.480]  very important what else do you see as some key issues that people really should be focusing on
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.360]  what they really should be asking of hillary clinton if and when she ever decides to give a press
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:13.920]  conference i would like to see her well it doesn't matter what they ask her because she's just
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:19.760]  going to answer with empty platitudes you know everything is arranged she's probably not going
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.000]  to have one unless she has control she has to have control of the questions she doesn't like to be
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.800]  surprised but if they could ask her some questions it should be about foreign policy and what she
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:34.880]  plans to do i wish we had a i wish we could get a president like ron paul that could just get us
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:40.400]  out of all the wars in the middle east and i hope trump could do some of that but hillary is far
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:47.360]  more dangerous because she's a war monger she loves war she had you know she um murdered qaddafi
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:54.000]  and you know the laugh about it it's gold i it's gotta it's this is she's far more dangerous than
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.960]  trump and trump has even said that he would be willing to talk to putin whereas hillary's gonna
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.600]  be setting up no fly zones over syria and provoking world war three why because she enjoys it i think
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:09.920]  she enjoys killing people i mean look she's the one who pushed the button on weiko and had that
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:17.680]  disaster she she might have been somebody behind oklahoma city because she's she and just look at
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:22.640]  the dnc guy who got shot in the back of the head i mean i i personally think she's a murderer
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.880]  i think we don't want a murderer like that in the white house because then she could turn into a
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.560]  mass murderer yeah exactly and that's what a lot of people say well she has experience
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:37.840]  and like you point out she has experience in killing people she has experience in the lying
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:43.360]  to people she has experience in working the media and getting them to do her bidding and cover up
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:49.440]  for her she has experience going in and destabilizing countries what do you think about the fact that
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:59.440]  they are really once again propping up russia to be the bogeyman well we already saw that how
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.520]  they went into ukraine and stole the gold it's about it's a globalist want control they don't
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.880]  want anybody to have their own system of money and and now russia is standing in their way now i'm
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:16.640]  not a big fan of putin he's a strong man and a dictator but um trump is much more willing to
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:22.800]  to talk with him and avoid war whereas hillary again i don't know what she's going to end up
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.920]  doing but do we really want somebody who's got the onset of dementia with her finger on the button
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:33.600]  they say trump is the the loose cannon and the dangerous person and dark well hillary's is she's
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:37.920]  the one who's dark and she's the one who can't be trusted with the nuclear football that's for
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:44.480]  sure i mean who knows uh once her health starts to fade i don't know i frankly i don't really
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:49.440]  understand why the globalists even have her installed in the first place if they knew
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:54.480]  that she's held has these ongoing health issues that's one thing i haven't been able to figure
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.960]  out yet maybe alex could figure that out right if she gets in there she's going to have to
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:05.280]  implement the new world order plans asap because who knows how long she'll be around and and it's
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:10.400]  funny how they kind of come after trump how dare he want to open up the lines of communication
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.240]  with putin meanwhile we have a president obama opening up the lines of communication with
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:23.760]  iran and basically setting up them up to have a nuclear power and then lying to our faces saying
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:29.920]  it wasn't uh wasn't uh it wasn't ransom and then a week later we find out yes it was ransom
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:37.120]  and that's an extremely bad precedent to set to send to other countries uh hillary also is
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.080]  going to come after the guns and i'm thinking that's if you've watched her during the primaries
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:47.200]  she's always talking about guns doing this and guns doing that it's almost like the guns somehow
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:51.520]  magically get themselves out of the gun safe go out and kill people and so we have to go after
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:57.600]  those guns she is going to be a lot more hardcore about coming after our guns than obama was obama
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:04.320]  tried a lot of subtleties that didn't work but uh hillary's gonna hillary's gonna be far more
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:09.120]  ruthless because she's always she always gets away with everything and that just encourages
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.400]  encourages her to do worse things right and we're we know that she's gonna tug on america's
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:19.680]  heartstrings with the gun grabbing just like we saw in venezuela when they first had their gun
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:25.920]  round up just a few years ago and it was all about you know we want to be a peaceful peaceful society
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.920]  really it's because they saw the writing on the wall they knew that they were going to be in these
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:36.560]  dire straits and they didn't want an armed angry starving populace and here again they're doing
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:40.640]  another gun round up in venezuela so we know that that's going to be something that's happening here

[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:37.920]  graphics dot com so then what do you think about this we we see now independent film independent
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.880]  artist this is the way that we are getting this message out there this is the way that we're
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:48.400]  having to take it to the streets because we don't get the support now of our supposed free press
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.400]  that's a good point and i encourage everybody to support patriots like what you just mentioned
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:57:01.520]  um but it's also important to do it yourself i encourage all the young people out there a lot
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:07.600]  i've had a lot of young artists write me and i say hey you could be a cartoonist too just fight
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:12.160]  fight that inertia the stuff that's keeping you from not doing it and just get out there and start
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:18.960]  doing it uh and i encourage everybody to be their own a citizen muck raker be their be their own
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:24.640]  squeaky wheel everybody needs everybody can do something everybody has a talent to do something
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:29.360]  and uh don't depend on the mainstream media to tell you the truth anymore they're actually
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:36.640]  actually working hard against our own best interests so my father fought in world war two
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:42.480]  and he was in many battles and then in 2008 when the banker banker bailout occurred i thought to
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.800]  myself well what can i do i never did anything from my country other than pay taxes well what
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:51.440]  can i do well i'm an artist i'll start drawing some cartoons and that's how it started so everybody
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.120]  has a talent out there everybody can do something so support all the patriots who are
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.960]  independent journalists and alternative media but also do some of this stuff yourself even if it's
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:08.000]  just telling your friends and family and try and try to inform the people that are or hypnotized
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.320]  into voting for hilly hillary simply because she's a woman and they want to do something historic
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:18.320]  try to try to inform and sway those people we have to get we all have to sharpen our
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.080]  debate skills and try to talk them out of it yeah and surprisingly a lot of people

[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:46.640]  world wide it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i am lian mackity we've been
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:51.760]  speaking with political cartoonist ben garrison now coming up just after the break we're going to be
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:57.680]  having joe biggs in studio we'll be speaking with investigative reporter wane madson all of that is
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:03.840]  coming up but ben i wanted to kind of talk to you a little bit about what what triggers you how how
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:09.200]  do you get inspired with these cartoons is it just the hullabaloo that's coming out of the media or
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:15.120]  how do you get triggered enough to do something about it well a lot of my ideas just come like
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:19.440]  bolts out of the blue i mean those are the best ideas too i call it vertical thinking they just
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:26.400]  come right down into my brain other ones that are horizontal in nature that takes it takes a lot of
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:34.080]  time to work them out um what i'm surprised that so many people out there i mean i must get like a
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:39.680]  half a dozen every day i get like a half a dozen ideas sent to me by people all over the world they
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:45.680]  all have their own ideas for a political cartoon and and many of them are excellent ideas i just
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.160]  don't have the time to do it i'm not quite there yet where i can make a living doing the cartoons
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.800]  now once upon a time in the golden age of newspapers there are like a thousand paid
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:02:00.240]  editorial cartoonists all around all across the country and then by the 80s it was down to around
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:07.360]  100 and now it's around 30 so the traditional newspaper editorial cartoonist is is going away
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:13.920]  but we're seeing a renaissance of sorts now um on the internet and the alternative alternative
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:20.880]  media on the internet with editorial cartooning so and it's very encouraging to see a few more
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:26.320]  conservative cartoonists out there too because for a very long time the the liberal cartoonists
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:34.240]  had a strangled hold on cartoonists the debate as far as editorial cartoons go and most of them are
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:40.160]  always pretty much they were lazy they were just like well-drawn insults were all they were oh you
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.120]  you like guns you're a redneck oh you you know you you don't like big government you're a racist
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:51.040]  that's what they all boiled down to so but now we're starting to see a few more conservative
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:56.800]  editorial cartoonists such as myself and help have a larger voice on the internet and that's
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:01.040]  very encouraging and once again i want to encourage all you young artists out there and you can do it
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:06.560]  too so get busy yeah absolutely that's kind of what alex is always saying we're always being
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.840]  sent in such great leads such great ideas but we can't be everywhere all at once and it is going to
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:17.680]  take a legion of us to fight against this new world order as we can see they've got all cylinders
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:23.920]  firing and really trying to silence any critics silence conservatives silence libertarians uh
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:29.600]  you know with the name power trying to silence me i sure i sure did face that first thing i found
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.920]  out i said why it weren't any or how come no editorial cartoonists are drawing anti-federal
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:39.040]  reserve cartoons and as soon as i started doing it i found out well i found out why because hey
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:45.120]  i started getting called anti-Semitic and a nazi i started getting called a racist and so anybody
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:52.800]  who's now even slightly right a center you get called far right even you know it's like it's
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:57.920]  an either or situation with the liberals if you're if you're even slightly conservative you're you're
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:03.440]  far right nazi and scott adams i think adilbert fame had that happen to him when he came out and
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.280]  supported trump all sudden he started getting called all these horrific names and people
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:11.360]  were threatening his life and threatening his business so he said okay i support i support
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:16.560]  hillary then he said that in a cynical way but just to get the heat off of me and it worked
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.760]  because people stopped attacking him but with me i'm not going to say that i'm i'm still pretty
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:28.480]  irrational let's stick with trump right and if that's that's exactly it if you are a free thinker

[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:08.560]  questions must be answered why doesn't she have a press conference article by paul joseph watson
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:14.000]  donald trump spokeswoman katrina pierce and told msnbc tuesday that questions surrounding hillary
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.520]  clinton's health must be addressed including why hillary is taking so much time off pierce and
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:25.600]  drew attention to hillary's strange behavior and mannerisms that were featured in our viral video
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:31.040]  in addition to her documented health problems as a result of her fall in 2012 the host then
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:35.440]  claimed that the whole issue had been debunked because of a fake document cited by the clinton
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.080]  campaign which none of the commentators asking questions about hillary's health have been used
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:44.880]  as evidence in addition because hillary's personal physician says she is in good health that's
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:50.240]  apparently an impartial source according to msnbc americans are less convinced a recent
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:56.400]  rasmussen poll found that 59 of them want hillary to release her full medical records just as the

[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:27.120]  jones show i am leon macadoo joining me now is joe bigs and we are going to be breaking down uh
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:32.960]  trump's speech now people are saying donald trump delivered the best speech of his life i want to
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:37.600]  go to this first clip this is where trump lets the people know that he's never going to lie to us
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:48.320]  but to achieve this new american future we must break from the failures of the past
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:58.320]  as you know i'm not a politician
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:05.360]  i've worked in business created a great company created lots of jobs rebuilding neighborhoods
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:13.680]  that's what i've done all of my adult life i've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:22.160]  and i've never been politically correct it takes far too much time
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:34.240]  truthfully it takes far too much time and can often make it more difficult to achieve total
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:43.760]  victory sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues you don't
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:50.320]  choose the right words or you say the wrong thing i have done that
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:10:03.840]  and believe it or not i regret it
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:20.480]  and i do regret it particularly where it may have caused personal pain
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:31.040]  too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues but one thing i can promise you this
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.280]  i will always tell you the truth
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:51.120]  i speak the truth for all of you and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice of which
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:11:01.840]  there are many i speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:10.400]  and that's happening more and more in our country i speak the truth on behalf of the veteran
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:21.440]  who has been denied the medical care they need and the medical care they deserve
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:30.640]  and so many are not making it but they're going to make it if trump becomes president that i
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:42.640]  can tell you they are dying on lines waiting for a doctor we are going to take care of our veterans
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:54.080]  i speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:12:10.000]  in their own country but is instead living with no security and no protection at all
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:25.200]  we will build the wall
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:36.720]  our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:46.080]  Republicans Democrats independence conservatives and liberals who read the newspaper or turn
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:57.280]  on the television and don't hear anyone anyone speaking for them all they hear are insiders
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:02.320]  fighting for other insiders that's what they do
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:11.520]  these are the forgotten men and women in our society and they are angry at so much
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:25.920]  and on so many levels the poverty the unemployment the failing schools the jobs moving to other
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:38.320]  countries i'm fighting for these forgotten Americans wow what an incredible speech i mean
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:43.520]  what a novel idea having a president who's actually four americans and who who says you
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.640]  know what sometimes i might put my foot in my mouth essentially but i'd rather tell you the truth
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:54.080]  then here on the other side we have people that can't even defend their own candidate because
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:58.960]  they know she's not trustworthy she lies again and again and again so let's go to this next clip
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:04.160]  donald trump is pointing out the fact that it's it's due to the reckless decision making by our
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:10.160]  politicians but the reason why this reckless decision making has come about is because they're
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:16.960]  getting personal profit they're gaining from these reckless decisions hillary clinton's mistakes
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:26.480]  destroy innocent lives sacrifice national security and betray the working families of this country
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:37.440]  please remember this i will never put personal profit before national security nobody should
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:50.000]  do it i will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interest which is
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:58.960]  what hillary is doing and they are being appeased i will never support a trade deal that kills
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:10.160]  american jobs i will never ever put the special interest before the national interest
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:20.640]  i will never put a donor before a voter or a lobbyist before a citizen
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:33.040]  instead i will be a champion for the people the establishment media doesn't cover
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:39.440]  what really matters in this country or what's really going on in people's lives
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:49.840]  they will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:55.760]  syllable and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what i said
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:10.880]  just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:20.640]  who got innocent americans like kate steinley killed she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:29.920]  who had been deported five times just imagine if the media spent time and lots of time
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:40.080]  investigating the poverty and joblessness of the inner cities just think about how much
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:48.560]  different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border to our
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:17:02.560]  closing factories or to our failing schools or if the media focused on what dark secrets
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:10.240]  must be hidden in the 33 000 emails that hillary clinton illegally deleted
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:35.520]  thank you instead every story is told from the perspective of the insider it's the narrative
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:43.440]  of the people who rigged the system never the voice of the people it's been rigged against
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:54.800]  believe me so many people suffering for so long in silence no cameras no coverage no outrage from
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:18:02.320]  the media class that seems to get outrage over just about everything else so again
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:08.960]  it's not about me it's never been about me it's been about all the people in this country
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:16.160]  who don't have a voice i am running to be your voice
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:35.120]  thank you i am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:39.760]  that has been waiting and hoping for a better future
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:51.120]  i am glad that i make the powerful and i mean very powerful a little uncomfortable
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:58.640]  now and again including some of the powerful people frankly in my own party because
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:10.160]  it means that i'm fighting for real change real change that's exactly right real change
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:14.160]  because we know exactly what we're going to get if hillary clinton gets in that's donald
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:20.000]  trump saying that he is going to be a champion of the people joe biggs what do you think about
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:26.720]  this speech best speech of his life that's great i mean he really had a good clear message about
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:32.160]  what he wants to do what his vision is and how he's going to do it you know it's it's always funny
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.800]  like every time i go to these events now everyone's screaming build the wall build the wall so
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:41.520]  hopefully he can live up to that one at least because that seems to be the major one that
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:47.440]  everyone major thing everyone wants well he is a jobs creator and that would create a lot of jobs
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:51.680]  building that wall they're already building bricks and latest polls show that most immigrants
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:56.720]  actually back trump on this ideological test so we'll see what happens all right stick around
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:02.240]  we're going to be breaking down more of donald trump's speech coming up technically i wasn't
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:06.320]  invited to this wedding but you can stroll into any event with a camera and people will assume

[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:33.680]  so here is a portion of that speech he said it's the fight of our lives together to save our
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:39.360]  country i refuse to let another generation of american children be excluded from the american
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.960]  dream which is what's happening our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:50.080]  are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:56.240]  opportunities that they deserve let our children be dreamers too so biggs what do you think about
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:00.000]  that i mean you've been there on the ground you've seen in furgus and recently just recently
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:07.120]  getting back from milwaukee a lot of um people are blaming this on systemic racism only ignoring the
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:12.080]  fact that a lot of these cities where we're seeing this uh unrest sort of festering up
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:17.280]  are cities that have been run by democrats and these progressive policies for decades
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:22.960]  it's a democratic plantation there's a lot of it it's ridiculous i mean you go to these different
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:29.280]  places and you you get on the ground and you see so many americans who actually need help
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:36.800]  but they've been stuck in this imprisoned in this camp this democratic system for so long
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:43.040]  and they're so dependent on big government which creates people who don't go out they're not
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:47.120]  entrepreneurs they're not going on creating things they're not they're they're just so dependent
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:51.760]  staying home they want the government to take care of them and it's sad to see that you know for
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:57.760]  once i'd like to see some of these cities like chicago you know milwaukee el Paso a lot of these
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:04.080]  places are democrat run switch it up see how it works out because right now the top seven worst
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:12.400]  cities in america are democrat run cities the main places so that that mean that's the problem
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:17.440]  it's it's not racism it's not anything it's the government sitting here choking you not letting
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:22.320]  you do stuff at all and you know and meanwhile you have no way to survive you're dependent upon
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:26.960]  government for you know all these checks and then what do you do you don't go out so you people are
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.720]  out committing crimes because they have no other way to do it right no way no other way to feed
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:37.040]  their families sometimes and it's really interesting watching the liberal media reporting on these
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.240]  stories and they they have to make it about race they have to make it about the divide and conquer
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:46.560]  because there's no way they can draw attention to the fact that it's actually these liberal policies
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:52.080]  that are so disruptive for these communities and actually holding people back i mean i think
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:57.920]  how little i really knew about politics i wasn't a taught or educated on the whole process so you
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:02.160]  think someone who's really doesn't care that much about going to school doesn't feel like it's for
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:08.160]  them they really don't understand that it's this the political system that's that's the real enemy
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:13.600]  yeah i mean there's great people i mean you before we went out to uh milwaukee there was reports you
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:18.480]  know of reporters pulling out because of the racism was so bad i mean we got out there and walked
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:23.040]  around and people were nice came up to us people just wanted you to talk to them and not judge them
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:28.560]  and not come in there with some you know mindset that they're going to act like a certain way and
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:31.680]  that you're going to be a little apprehensive and scared if you come in there and you you talk to
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:36.880]  these people and you engage in a great conversation we had a guy come up to us and we're talking about
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:42.000]  you know why do you think that milwaukee is one of the poorest cities why do you think it's one of
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.240]  the worst cities in america and the guy is going well it's because of the democrat party and it's
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:50.080]  like people are born into this whole system and he said they just keep voting that way because that's
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:54.000]  the way the family did it and then their kids do it and their kids do it and it just continues and
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.200]  continues to go on but trump's speech right here i like it it really highlights his whole
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:06.400]  slogan america first because you know why is it that we have so many young americans struggling
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:11.920]  to survive to pay off these debts to do all this stuff meanwhile someone can come in from another
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:17.920]  country and can bypass all that stuff get free school get free health care get all this stuff a
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:23.040]  free bus ticket to go somewhere meanwhile we have people who are struggling on a daily basis
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:29.200]  that's why i like trump's slogan america first because we need to take care of every man woman
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:35.520]  and child here that's living here who's doing you know the right thing that's what we need to focus on
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:40.880]  right and of course a lot of these people can begin to see how when you bring in a whole
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:46.400]  illegal class of people that are going to be taking their jobs that they're already struggling to
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.080]  to get those jobs i mean it's only going to get worse for these communities and so i think that
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:56.800]  they're really starting to wake up to the reality of this starting to see that they do need to
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:01.920]  implement some change within their own communities we see people taken to the ground locally on the
[02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:07.280]  local level which that's where the real power begins it's not really even voting for the president
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:13.600]  every four years it's on the local level now when we come back we are going to be playing a special
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:19.600]  report from john bown he is basically going to provide us with a stunning recap of the failed
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:26.080]  obama presidency obama you know he's got one more one more little thing that he's got to do before
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:31.840]  he leaves office he's going to hand over american control of the internet we've we've seen his failures
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:38.400]  before with obama care open borders so just totally stunning as he leaves the office so

[02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:20.000]  what is president obama done with two terms as our commander-in-chief fix the economy nope the
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:26.160]  national debt went from 10.6 trillion to 19 and a half trillion under his watch and obama is the
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:32.800]  only president in history to not see a 3% increase in the gdp healed division as the first black
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:39.440]  president nope america is sitting on a powder keg of anarchy as a result of the linskyite methods
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:45.520]  unleashed by the white house and its lapdog media and the hordes of communist and faux civil rights
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:52.080]  movements under the umbrella of black lives matter attacking their own communities kept america safe
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:58.480]  oh no the united states just surpassed europe in the admittance of muslim refugees 21 percent of
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:04.320]  which that will stop at nothing to foment jihad in our communities as orlando san bernadino
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:10.640]  and 9 11 cast a dark shadow over national security and europe's example serves as a harsh warning for
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:17.200]  the very near future is it getting clear president obama's achievements don't involve you the average
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:23.600]  us citizen b u on the left or the right or in the middle his achievements are applauded by foreign
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:29.760]  bankers and oligarchs whose agenda reads like an instruction manual of the legacy of our 44th
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:35.600]  president of the united states obama came up big on one of his promises he managed to bankrupt the
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:41.680]  coal industry a huge boon to the natural gas industry fracking its way across america his oil
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:46.720]  and gas production has doubled over the past five years the number of earthquakes rattling oklahoma
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:53.040]  has surged until 2008 the state averaged one to two quakes magnitude three or greater per year
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:58.960]  in 2015 it's averaged two per day the coal industry has been devastated by nearly 30
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:05.440]  percent since obama took office the daily caller reports coal use fell in every state but nebraska
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:10.560]  and alaska devastating both the coal power and the coal mining industries and even forcing
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:17.040]  p-body energy the world's largest coal company to declare bankruptcy jobs hemorrhaged under the hugely
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:23.600]  unpopular corporate credit congress obama presided over china has been devastating our manufacturing
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:30.000]  base since 2001 15 years later nothing has been done to counter it in fact everything has been
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:36.320]  done to open the gaping wound john rapaport of no more fake news writes obama is the rockefeller
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:41.840]  globalist man in the white house he's tasked with pushing through congressional ratification of the
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:48.720]  tpp come hell or high water first know that the tpp the trans-pacific partnership is a huge globalist
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:54.720]  trade deal among 12 nations that would phase out thousands of tariffs and set up corporate
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:02.480]  tribunals to punish nations that refuse to import goods e.g toxic pesticides toxic medical drugs
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:08.960]  gmo's etc in short it's a nightmare wiping out tariffs is the cornerstone of the globalist agenda
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:14.320]  it allows companies and industrial countries to move their factories to third world hell holes
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:19.760]  pay slave wages ignore environmental conditions and then export their products back to the
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:27.040]  countries they abandoned with no tariffs no taxes no penalties meanwhile white house mouthpiece
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:33.280]  politico nonchalantly reports president barack obama is taking the fight for the trans-pacific
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:39.440]  partnership trade deal to america's streets the white house is making an all-out push to win
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:45.200]  passage of the deal in the lame duck session of congress organizing 30 events over the congressional
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:50.160]  recess to gin up support for the agreement if that isn't brainwashing i don't know what is
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:55.200]  simultaneously obama's department of commerce is handing over the reins of the internet in
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:01.680]  october to a multinational authority that includes china russia and iran as an olive branch of
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:07.920]  obama's failed foreign policy after the nsa had been discovered spying on world leaders which more
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:14.240]  than likely was the ploy all along globalism is here ladies and gentlemen your very existence
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:20.720]  and that of your descendants is at stake as obama sets up to throw a hail mary of treason

[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:50.960]  are only telling people about uh the olympic swimmers that's the big that's the big news
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:57.520]  ryan locky gate like the biggest store in the world right now is how an olympic swimmer
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:02.880]  lied about being mugged and everyone's covering about how this guy is a liar and he can't be

[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:24.320]  and all the that coverage but they don't want to talk about uh the fact that clinton foundation

[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:22.880]  now joining us bringing some really great reporting exposing what the mainstream media
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:29.360]  darent tell us about the clinton foundation and i really feel like getting this information out
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:35.920]  there wane is going to force them to have to see this pay-to-play slush fund operation that the
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:42.080]  clintons have set up so tell us about your latest report well i'm not sure there's a cause and effect
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:48.800]  relationship here but just i i would note that just a few days after maybe two days after i published
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:55.520]  this list of of key foreign nations and key foreign corporations that had donated to the clinton
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:04.000]  foundation and its various other contrivances uh and and then i showed what those entities received
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:13.040]  in return as a way of favors from the state department um it was just announced uh yesterday
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:22.720]  that the clinton foundation will cease accepting foreign and corporate donations uh if hillary
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:28.720]  clinton becomes the next president so that's uh rather odd that they would have come out with
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:34.640]  come out with that statement you know just after uh that list came out but uh they're in a lot of
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:40.480]  trouble on that oh yeah well didn't they agree that they weren't going to the clinton foundation
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:44.240]  bill clinton wouldn't get involved while hillary clinton was there at the state department so they
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:49.120]  already made that promise yeah one time now all of a sudden we should trust i saw that when i was
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.480]  reading through drudge i was like really i was like you guys already said that once and that
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:58.320]  fell miserably so you expect me to believe this all over again come on and and we are definitely
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:05.120]  driving the narrative there now and and wane with this chart that you have uh really laid it out
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:09.920]  there's no denying it you can go to info wars dot com and look at wane madson's really great
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:16.080]  article at chart clinton foundation donations linked to state department favors and you spell it out
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:21.520]  it's right there in black and white for anyone who doesn't have the time to go through all of these
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:27.280]  additional private emails that have have been released uh prince uh abu dhabi and foreign
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:34.720]  minister of the united arab emirates uh chic abdulla bin zahid al naehan they they donate five million
[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:40.080]  so they get access to hillary rodham clinton at the state department 500 000 environmental
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:46.240]  speech by bill clinton given at the emirates palace hotel uh state clearance for us arm sales
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:53.040]  to algeria there with their donation i mean it just goes on and on and on so what do you think
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:45:00.800]  people really need to understand about let's say the tenio holdings firm for instance well tenio is
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:10.240]  very problematic because the guy who founded this tenio which is a lobbyist slash uh investment firm
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:18.400]  uh slash uh private intelligence company with offices in new york london and elsewhere around
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:25.600]  the world it was started by dug band who had been bill clinton's personal aid uh after clinton left
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:34.160]  office uh so he is very much part of this clinton foundation infrastructure whom abadine was
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:40.240]  basically double dipping getting a state department salary as hillary clinton's personal assistant
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:47.520]  while she was also drawing a paycheck from tenio holdings in new york so uh we have this interlocking
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:54.000]  situation between the clinton foundation mrs clinton at the state department and this private
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:02.560]  entity tenio holdings now i compiled that list from open source information from uh emails that
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:09.760]  have been released the other information uh some of it had been uh hacked into and released some of
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:16.160]  it was in some news reports but uh if i could get that from open source i just wonder what the
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:24.080]  national security agency's finance and commerce branch has in a way of very incriminating uh
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:31.440]  information on the racketeering that was obviously going on the pay-to-play scheme uh run by the
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:37.680]  clinton's uh when hillary clinton was secretary of state uh if i could get that much from open
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:45.120]  source i just have to think that the nsa finance and commerce operation which tracks people to
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:52.080]  wait with they follow the money and they follow the people they must have quite a uh interesting
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:58.720]  database of uh clinton foundation activities the problem is is that we've seen key intelligence
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:05.120]  officers uh retired uh come out and support hillary clinton mike morrell the former acting
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:12.400]  director of the cia uh we've had michael hayden the former nsa and cia director say nice things
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:21.040]  about clinton he's actually showing up on a on a clinton ad right now on television um and um so um
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:26.640]  we got to think that the intelligence agencies are supporting uh the clinton's
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:33.520]  absolutely and as donald trump pointed out in his speech that reckless decision making by the
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:40.080]  politicians has often come about due to personal profit it's not just here in our own country but
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:45.040]  this pay-to-play it's also affecting people in other countries perfect example you point out here
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:52.160]  walmart ink donated five million dollars and in return uh clinton pressured the indian government
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:59.520]  to open up india to walmart which this was an action that was opposed by india's small retailers
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:04.800]  so here you have people they know just like here in our country these small businesses these mom and
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:10.160]  pop shops they get pushed out and shut down as soon as one of these big walmart retailers comes in
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:16.160]  we've also seen haydi and how the people there in haydi are very upset with the way the clinton's
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:21.920]  did or did not uh failed to help them there meanwhile hillary clinton's brother gets
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:29.360]  access to a gold mine there in haydi yeah the the clintons have uh it's one of the worst things
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:35.840]  they've done is they've used haydi which has been devastated by an earthquake by repeated
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:43.920]  hurricanes uh by political upheaval the clintons have used haydi as their personal cash cow
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:50.240]  the poorest country in the western hemisphere used by the clintons as their personal cash cow
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:57.440]  and of course bill clinton uh he's he's operated as the un special envoy for haydi just like his
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:04.320]  wife as secretary of state he used that position to enrich himself uh haydi used to be a net exporter
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:11.120]  of rice for example it's now an importer of this awful bleached rice from arkansas why because the
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:17.920]  arkansas rice growers association has been longtime contributors to the clintons both governor bill
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:23.680]  clinton and his presidential campaigns and then uh hillary clinton and her presidential campaign
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:29.120]  so what happened with haydi's rice industry it was destroyed now they have to import this cheap
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:35.440]  arkansas uh crap uh it's not nutritional whatsoever it's almost like frank and food
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:39.360]  it's it's uh genetically modified look at bill clinton i mean obviously there's something going
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:45.360]  on with the rice there yeah i think he's got his soul sucked out of him though yeah yeah so we went
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:51.840]  and not only had problems with you know condoleezza rice and and now susan rice our national security
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:58.400]  advisor but major problems for haydi with arkansas rice yeah and and people are really beginning to
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:02.960]  hold them to what they said that they were going to do helping these countries i mean haydi
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:09.040]  more than a hundred thousand people died there so many people still are living in tents what did they
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:14.160]  do with all this money besides enrich themselves enrich their own family members and they don't
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:19.680]  want us to ask these questions now wane matz and when we get back i want to ask you you know what
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:25.040]  do you think is is the key the key thing that people should take out of this list what do you
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.640]  really see is a really damaging sort of pay-to-play action here and then we're also going to get into
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:38.480]  uh the george soros story and how soros was giving global grants to fund these muslim migrants uh
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:44.880]  this takeover of the west i mean he has got his claws in so deep here with all of this
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:48.640]  so wane matz and stick around we're going to get to that and you're going to find all the

[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:19.680]  the interest is and welcome back to the alex schoen show i am leon macadoo joined in studio by
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:24.720]  joe biggs rocking out i'm jamming out this is my tune i was actually listening to this one repeat
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:31.200]  last night for quite a bit quite a bit well we are speaking now with our info wars investigative
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:35.600]  journalist wane madsen and we've been talking about uh the coordination between the clinton
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:41.680]  foundation and the state department go to info wars dot com and take a look at this chart as we're
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:47.760]  talking about it uh it's at clinton foundation donations linked to state department favors
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:53.280]  that's the article at info wars dot com now wane what do you think is the key takeaway here um you
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:58.160]  obviously had to sort through a lot of emails and and build this chart but what do you really think
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:05.920]  people should focus on well the fact is is that uh it's like everything the clintons are involved
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:12.960]  with it's for their own personal enrichment uh you remember uh there was there were even reports
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:20.000]  when they left the white house in uh and to the january 2001 that a lot of the white house uh
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:26.560]  deck uh decorations and the china the facts went went with them i i wonder if she gets
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:31.920]  elected in november whether they'll be returning some of those to the white house but um but
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:37.760]  yeah this is just a it's a constant theme with the clintons it's it's what's good for them
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:44.080]  and uh and you know and everyone else can really just go to blazes as far as they're concerned
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:48.880]  the other thing they do is when they get in trouble you notice they always surround themselves with
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:55.040]  all these uh aides and and advisors and then when when they get caught they blame the aides and
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:56:00.960]  advisors so oh look kuma abadi might think she's on solid ground with hillary clinton today but
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:07.360]  that may not be the case uh you know in a couple months if there's any kind of investigation
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:12.880]  of what went on same thing with duck bandit tenio the clintons will throw their own friends
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:19.840]  under the bus i mean james mcdougal uh today today worse than under the bus today on usay
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:25.120]  today they post an article clinton told fbi that colin powell advised her to use her personal
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.840]  email so there you go again deflecting and try to duck and dodge and and put the blame on someone
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:35.840]  else like look you're the head of state you're an adult human being in a professional job you
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:39.440]  know what the hell you're doing you know right from wrong stop trying to put it on someone else
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:44.400]  leave colin powell alone grandma she's just like oh i'm a sweet little old grandma now and i just
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:51.120]  don't it's amazing we can have an entire private server we can have an entire room just full of
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:57.440]  articles of every criminal thing she's ever done her and her husband and no one wants to talk about
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:03.280]  it they want to talk about a swimmer or a dead gorilla or you know some new rap video or something
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:09.280]  like it's ridiculous meanwhile guess what the president's playing golf and donald trump is
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:13.920]  personally helping people down to louisiana that are victims of all these floods going on
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:18.080]  he actually told people today that didn't have flood insurance that he would donate to them
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:24.000]  to help them out that's presidential right they they told the president current president don't
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:27.840]  even clinton clinton would go down there and say donate to our foundation will help you guys out
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:34.560]  and then they're gonna buy some new stuff he also went up the george w bush we remember after
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:42.240]  katrina the closest look he got of louisiana was from air force one at around 30 000 feet well
[02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:47.840]  that's the thing though people attacked bush for that but no one's really attacking obama the fact
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:54.240]  that he's out playing golf no one's no one's like even touching that i don't get it well he's actually
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:59.200]  been having to i mean i i know i know it takes away from the whole thing but still though the
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:03.280]  fact that i know i know it makes it more difficult for the first responders and all that trying to
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:07.760]  do the job down there yeah but still though like you know what put the golf clubs away you played
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:12.480]  enough golf man do your job all the time it's like oh there's another beheading oh there's a flood
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:17.680]  well i'm sorry i gotta i gotta go play golf that's well that's his go to but luckily we only have a

[03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:51.120]  phone lines to take your calls here at the bottom half now we have been speaking with info wars
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:56.400]  investigative journalist wane madson right before the break we were really kind of getting into the
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:01.920]  coordination between the clinton foundation and the state department but now i want to shift gears
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:09.200]  and talk about george soros now he is got his little meddling hands and everything and now
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:16.080]  thanks to some new leaks some activists we see that he's behind the muslim takeover of the west
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:23.440]  so wane madson give us the details well very interesting uh internal soros foundation report
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:29.920]  was leaked i guess as a result of a of a hacking uh incident and and you know it really doesn't
[03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:37.040]  matter to me whether it's russian hackers or it's wiki leaks or it's you know gucifer 2.0 3.0
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:43.760]  whatever that is all about as long as we get these documents this is the transparency by the way
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:49.920]  that mr obama promised us when he became president of course we never saw it we as a matter of fact
[03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:55.840]  we saw more whistleblowers go to prison under obama than any other of his predecessors since
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:02:03.680]  woodrow wilson combined uh and um so uh we've got this internal report and i really think that this
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:11.360]  it would surprise me is that soros's people and he of course who funds these operations
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:18.240]  we're talking about taking advantage of migration corridors and two initially were cited from
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:24.960]  um central america and mexico into the united states and from the middle east and north africa
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:31.760]  into europe this is the first time we've seen a linkage between the migration into the united
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:38.480]  states by mostly hispanics and the migration into europe from the middle east by mostly muslims
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:44.960]  you know if donald trump plays his cards on this one right he can link the issue of the wall
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:49.360]  so what he also has said is that hillary clinton will become another angle of merkel
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:55.040]  she of course allowed all these people over a million to come into europe if he can if he
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:03:01.760]  can link it well we we know that soros's document it does link the two and he also then talks in
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:07.440]  the in the document about creating new corridors including one that's managed by one of the co
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:15.280]  authors of the report and that is from eurasia into um russia and europe so this is what he's
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:23.920]  doing he's advocating illegal massive migration on a global scale to basically change the ethnic
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:29.360]  makeup of various countries as we see what happened what's happening in europe and is what's
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:36.320]  happening in the united states and uh i think this is an amazing revelation from this document
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:43.600]  as i say it links in the past people said we can't link uh hispanic migration into the united
[03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:49.680]  states to what's going on in europe yes you can if you read this soros document it's it's clear cut
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:56.000]  that the two uh illegal migrations are linked and there's other migrations um that have been
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:02.480]  started and others that are planned well wow and i it's funny because i see a lot of people
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:09.280]  uh they must be sock puppets they must be trolls but they come out and and say george soros is a
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:15.200]  good guy and he's just trying to give the little people the money and the funds that they need to
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:21.040]  help take down the globalists the elitists that that want to rule their countries that's why he's
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:26.960]  destabilizing these nations well i'll tell you yeah there's a lot of people and think tanks and
[03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:33.360]  policy laundry operations in washington london and around the world whose salaries are dependent
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:40.960]  on mr soros uh so you take king's gold you do the king's bidding right no exactly and this is and
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:46.000]  that's exactly why we've seen a lot of activists going to the trump rallies going after him rather
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:51.680]  than going after their actual opponent at the time hillary clinton and that's why we see what happened
[03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:56.160]  uh there with bernie sanders stick around we'll be right back after the break speaking with more
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:05:05.760]  on george soros state department 400 million to iran was contingent on u.s prisoners release the
[03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:11.200]  state department admitted thursday that the u.s would not hand over 400 million in cash to iran
[03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:17.200]  until it released four american hostages two weeks after president obama insisted the payment was not
[03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:23.200]  a ransom state department spokesman john kerby was asked at thursday's press briefing in basic
[03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:28.400]  english you're saying you wouldn't give them 400 million in cash until the prisoners were released
[03:05:28.400 --> 03:05:33.760]  correct that's correct kerby replied in an august fourth press conference president obama said the
[03:05:33.760 --> 03:05:39.760]  opposite we do not pay ransom we didn't hear and we won't end the future the president told reporters
[03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:46.080]  speaking of the january 17 payment and hostage release families know we have a policy that we
[03:05:46.080 --> 03:05:52.000]  don't pay ransom and the notion that we would somehow start now in this high profile way defies
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:58.080]  logic obama added at the time well guess what the cat's out of the bag you lied we called it info
[03:05:58.080 --> 03:06:02.880]  wars dot com dot a group you developed living defense for us it took you over a year to do it
[03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:08.720]  why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me
[03:06:08.720 --> 03:06:14.240]  the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my
[03:06:14.240 --> 03:06:20.480]  system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to

[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:34.080]  there you are the resistance thank you so much for joining us here into this fourth hour now we
[03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:40.240]  have been speaking with our investigative journalist wane madson talking about george soros how he's
[03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:46.560]  got his meddling hands and everything and key takeaway from this report is is is how he's given
[03:08:46.560 --> 03:08:52.560]  these global grants to open up the floodgates for this illegal mass migration we're seeing how
[03:08:52.560 --> 03:08:59.280]  that's destroying europe and a lot of people whether they want to admit it or not are actually in
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:08.960]  support of donald trump's plans to a build the wall but also curb this open migration from people
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:14.000]  from these countries with terrorist highs that we have to make sure that they are ideologically
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:22.320]  lined up with american values so wane get into these global grants well when you read this leak
[03:09:22.320 --> 03:09:32.080]  soros report it's interesting i put basically put all these organizations these ngos are all involved
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:40.320]  in basically trying to change national immigration law to either weaken it or get rid of it or
[03:09:40.320 --> 03:09:46.480]  telling people how to evade it how to evade border controls now one of the key individuals
[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:51.920]  that the soros people is working with is a guy named peter southerland that may not be a household
[03:09:51.920 --> 03:09:57.840]  named to a lot of people but he is the former director of gatt that was the forerunner to
[03:09:57.840 --> 03:10:04.880]  the world trade organization he's now the un special envoy for for refugees and migration
[03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:13.600]  he's also a former chairman of goldman sacks international okay so you know who who was
[03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:18.800]  hillary giving all those speeches for making all that money goldman sacks uh heidi cruz and
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:24.400]  as she worked for goldman sacks she got booed basically by people who was also also yelling
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:30.080]  goldman sacks at the convention in cleveland people are starting to wake up to this but when
[03:10:30.080 --> 03:10:36.000]  you see this report you see you know who are these players that are involved and basically
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:42.320]  they're undermining national sovereignty by basically saying look you can get around border
[03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:48.400]  controls we can weaken these immigration laws to allow this mass migration what's the end goal
[03:10:48.400 --> 03:10:54.480]  well we know what merkel is her goal in germany is to get more cheap labor but what she's going
[03:10:54.480 --> 03:11:02.080]  to sacrifice for that is the german nation as we've known it a basically a christian
[03:11:03.120 --> 03:11:09.200]  democratic not not the party which he's the head of but a christian and democratic nation
[03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:19.200]  with a you know strong tradition of culture which will all come crashing down with this
[03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:24.800]  influx of muslims who by the way they're not they're not going to be changing their religion
[03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:32.240]  they're looking in germany to change its ways to become more like a sharia law state uh and
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:39.040]  that's going to cause major problems in germany and other european countries um and uh the only
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:46.320]  thing i can see stopping this is it went the if you see where soros puts his money he hates populist
[03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:53.280]  uh parties he hates he hates the uk independence party in the brexit he hates people like boris
[03:11:53.280 --> 03:11:58.640]  johnson the new foreign secretary britain he hates le penne in france he hates he hates the
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:04.880]  alternative for deutschland the anti immigration party in germany if we can if we see these parties
[03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:11.920]  come to political power that may start to spell the end of mr soros absolutely and of course

[03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:19.120]  how this immigration is terrible and it's going to be terrible for the lives of minorities look
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:28.320]  how badly things are going under decades of democratic leadership look at the schools look

[03:24:07.400 --> 03:24:14.400]  read up get my way one day
[03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:35.400]  I will spare you the singing us in from the break as alex jones you are listening to the alex jones show I am here leah macadoo with the great patriot joe biggs now joe when I watch the film america and there's a lot of things in this movie that kind of help you put yourself in the scenario of what's
[03:24:35.400 --> 03:24:50.400]  going to happen when the grid goes down what are you going to do when you want to prepare it really made me realize that I don't want to have a hipster boyfriend there when the stuff hits the fan I want the guy that knows what he's going to do
[03:24:50.400 --> 03:25:03.400]  I want to get it there's like some smoking hot chicks in Austin and they got these hipster boyfriends and I'm like you know what when things go down what's this guy going to do he can't even load a gun he don't even know what a firing pin is or he doesn't even know what a
[03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:17.400]  shot group is you know like get in your shooting stance that's like he can't even get in the shooting stance because his pants are so tight that it's cut off the circulation and he's just like throwing donuts like he doesn't know what's going on like that's what you want come on
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:37.400]  you can't grow a pair with that tight but what you need to do is grow your own food right and get some solar panels and be ready to do something if it does happen you know the chances of an EMP attacker pretty good the chances of just complete and total collapse is good
[03:25:37.400 --> 03:25:50.400]  people need to get back to their roots you know learn to hunt learn to clean learn to do that fill dressing learn to you know how to store that meat you know get go buy the storage food that we already have seeds all this stuff I mean we've got tons of stuff at the
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:26:03.400]  infor store that you can get storeable foods that'll last you know forever that tastes amazing think about all those people in Louisiana right now people that were stranded on the highway for days anyone living on the golf course really that could be a victim of a
[03:26:03.400 --> 03:26:16.400]  hurricane that come but those are people that really needed to have these supplies be prepared for something like that because when you have to cut off that transport when the trucks can't get in to bring you food how are you going to feed yourselves
[03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:32.400]  and if you're if your town is three feet underwater well there goes your crops I get stopped by TSA every flight I'm about to fly again tonight to go to Kentucky to a shooting competition but I always carry tools that I need in case the plane goes down and I somehow survive
[03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:42.400]  you know in the miraculous you know the if a miracle happens I somehow survive a plane crash I'm gonna have flashlights and all this stuff but regardless I'm going to a new area where I don't have all my stuff
[03:26:42.400 --> 03:26:57.400]  I have like a bug out bag that I take with me on every trip it's got tools you some food snacks water all this stuff you've got to be prepared all the time especially if you travel as much as I do you can just you know depend on having that stuff at your house only
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:08.400]  but it's definitely something important have an American puts out a really good positive message it makes you think outside of the box you know it kind of takes you out of that complacency that you've kind of been in for some time
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:22.400]  and really get out there and think about alright what if this does happen and then you can evaluate where you are now you're living situation what you have are you prepared at all you know I think a lot of families are going to leave from that movie and did leave from that movie going man
[03:27:22.400 --> 03:27:35.400]  if something happens we are prepared let's go start getting prepared let's look into this and let's find out what we can do when it really kind of highlights for a lot of the social justice warrior girls out there because here in the film
[03:27:35.400 --> 03:27:50.400]  I believe it was Mike Norris's daughter if I'm not mistaken I know well no actually I think she was one of the bad asses in the film but so this social justice warrior girl she has this kind of hipster boyfriend he's super cool and when the stuff goes down he's nowhere to be found
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:55.400]  and she realizes like well you know maybe I didn't need to get myself a feminist boyfriend
[03:27:55.400 --> 03:28:01.400]  well she had to go back to her first boyfriend which was an army soldier that actually knew how to get out there
[03:28:01.400 --> 03:28:15.400]  took care of her and took care of her family and knew what to do so we're talking about the film American it is now being sold exclusively at the info wars store this is the new film by Chuck Norris's son Mike Norris and Gary Haven
[03:28:15.400 --> 03:28:27.400]  Gary Haven is a really incredible incredible person who wanted to put his own money behind getting this message out there this film exposes the new world order takeover what would you do if the grid goes down
[03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:41.400]  it's a great tool to help wake up your family and your friends and Alex Jones is running a special right now when you buy two copies of American you can get four Alex Jones films for free police state four police state trilogy
[03:28:41.400 --> 03:28:52.400]  Alex says give these extras out as stocking stuffers take them to the library let people rent these films for free kind of break open their minds of what would they do are they prepared
[03:28:52.400 --> 03:29:07.400]  and we really ask that you not only support this operation but you also support independent films out there people that are putting their money their lives on the line to expose the globalist and help us take this fight to the next level
[03:29:07.400 --> 03:29:17.400]  so that is the new American American film you can get it exclusively at the infowarstore.com right now that's for the exclusive release of American
[03:29:17.400 --> 03:29:23.400]  and for all you ladies out there that are dating hipsters remember if the apocalypse happens you're screwed
[03:29:23.400 --> 03:29:33.400]  oh it's it's true I mean it really has put it in perspective for me like I'm a tough guy I don't I don't like you you know when you're like burping and stuff like that
[03:29:33.400 --> 03:29:49.400]  I don't hold back I am who I am all the time well and we appreciate it Joe Biggs everyone out there all right well when we get back we're going to be talking about more of Hillary's lies and the mainstream media's denies stick around
[03:29:49.400 --> 03:29:59.400]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:59.400 --> 03:30:08.400]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com Trump spokeswoman Hillary health questions must be answered why doesn't she have a press conference article by Paul Joseph Watson
[03:30:08.400 --> 03:30:19.400]  Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pearson told MSNBC Tuesday that questions surrounding Hillary Clinton's health must be addressed including why Hillary is taking so much time off
[03:30:19.400 --> 03:30:30.400]  Pearson drew attention to Hillary's strange behavior and mannerisms that were featured in our viral video in addition to her documented health problems as a result of her fall in 2012
[03:30:30.400 --> 03:30:41.400]  the host then claimed that the whole issue had been debunked because of a fake document cited by the Clinton campaign which none of the commentators asking questions about Hillary's health have been used as evidence
[03:30:41.400 --> 03:30:49.400]  and that's the reason why Hillary is taking so much time off because Hillary's personal physician says she is in good health that's apparently an impartial source according to MSNBC
[03:30:49.400 --> 03:31:00.400]  Americans are less convinced a recent Rasmussen poll found that 59% of them want Hillary to release her full medical records just as the media pressure John McCain back in 2008
[03:31:00.400 --> 03:31:15.400]  in 2012 info wars life vitamin B12 formulation most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body that's why for real results so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections

[03:33:00.400 --> 03:33:20.400]  he's going the distance he's going for speed she's all alone all alone in a time of need because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course he's fighting and fighting and riding on his horse he's going the distance
[03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:34.400]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[03:33:34.400 --> 03:33:55.400]  now one of the things that we've been kind of preparing for this year is with ut of course they just this will be the kind of inaugural campus carry coming into effect this semester a lot of people have been raising
[03:33:55.400 --> 03:34:08.400]  concerns what's going to happen you know what I think is going to happen is a lot more females are going to feel safe on campus knowing that they can walk around at night and they are not going to be victims to some of the attacks
[03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:20.400]  like we saw a girl was actually murdered on ut campus last year so I think we're going to be seeing a lot of changes but it's it's setting a precedent so what's going on at other gun free campuses across the nation
[03:34:20.400 --> 03:34:35.400]  well this is an article things by bry Bart says students rob the gunpoint on gun free campus says ironically the robbery at gunpoint is the second high profile criminal use of guns on the fsu campus in less than two years
[03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:50.400]  a gunman opened fire outside fsu central library on november twenty twenty fourteen and then a concealed carry permit holder was close enough to take out the gunman in the incident but was barred from carrying a gun because of a gun free campus law
[03:34:50.400 --> 03:35:05.400]  come on you know and it's funny campus care has been in effect now for a little bit and there's been no shootings nothing's going on it's just like when we had open carry come out here in texas it was like everyone thought there was going to be like all these like western movies like everyone's gun tote and
[03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:20.400]  like you know three or four guns on their side and you're going to see that everywhere you're going to hear like little bush is going to roll by or whatever you know tumbleweed it's it's it's the whole point of this stuff is the freedom to have it if you want it you should be able to have it most people aren't going to be out
[03:35:20.400 --> 03:35:34.400]  brandishing guns and open carrying or anything like this can be more concealed I mean it's this is all hoopla didn't the criminals see the signs there that said it was a gun free zone well no they can't read the criminals right well I mean
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:47.400]  maybe that's maybe that's what's been going on this entire time that they just can't read they can't read we have to teach them to read the signs and then then crime will stop that's it we need to really get this grassroots movement going to teach criminals
[03:35:47.400 --> 03:35:59.400]  how to read I think that'll solve everything well except meanwhile we have overly educated people like Hillary Clinton doing it criminality on a mass scale and then so let's look at take a look at what's going on in
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:12.400]  Venezuela now we've talked about how just a few years ago they started grabbing the guns but they were doing it because you know they were wanting to evolve and just you know let's bring peace to the streets everyone Mr. and Mrs.
[03:36:12.400 --> 03:36:30.400]  Venezuela turn in your guns well really what was happening other people in power knew that things were really about to take a turn for the worse and they wanted to disarm those people because they knew that they were going to be hungry they're going to be angry they're going to be getting desperate now we have reports
[03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:45.400]  that they're having to travel like 18 hours to another country just to get food to feed their family in Venezuela today some people broke into the zoo and murdered a horse and ate it wow because that's how hungry they are and yet we have
[03:36:45.400 --> 03:36:54.400]  tons of people here in America that want socialism and socialism is what the first step towards communism and what is communism look at Venezuela.
[03:36:54.400 --> 03:37:12.400]  Right and so now the socialist president there of course has many opponents that want to see his ouster because he's ruling over this country that's just like in great despair there's rioting looting poaching like you mentioned so now what they've done is they are destroying
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:24.400]  thousands of guns they're crushing them chopping them up nearly 2000 shot guns and that's why I need to go do this shooting competition for that for all those guns that were that were brutally murdered for no reason they did nothing at all.
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:33.400]  Well and that's what they that's this is the the narrative that they're pushing let me let me know if this sounds familiar we're going to bring disarmament and peace.
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:47.400]  Sorry there isn't going to be any peace until you are able to get your economy stabilized you're able to feed these people and I think I need to get over to the east coast right now immediately and build a raft and try to make my way to
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:38:00.400]  Venezuela to escape all this freedom we have in America because you know it's so great over there communism is amazing I think we should just all put our money in into a pot let's build a raft and let's go over there now so we can before we you know before we get killed over here.
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:12.400]  We just trust that if we give our socialist government even more power more money they'll take care of us and they'll make sure to divvy up all the good look at look what happens in the government.
[03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:15.400]  Milwaukee Ferguson look at all these places.
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:28.400]  The government you know it is over it's ridiculous it's not going to get any better they're getting rich putting a lot of money in their pockets but they're not bringing any jobs to the economy and they're sitting safely in the suburbs while their city is burning down
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:32.400]  and the Queen's taking all the money from everywhere all over the country Hillary Clinton.
[03:38:32.400 --> 03:38:33.400]  Right.
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:50.400]  You know this is funny I just want to talk about this really so there's a magazine called Glamour I guess and you base off this article alone I never want to look at this magazine ever again but it says yes it's sexist to speculate about Hillary Clinton's health are you serious like that sexist.
[03:38:50.400 --> 03:39:03.400]  Someone is powerful position in our country she is going to be making really important decisions that are going to affect us all it matters if she is going to die.
[03:39:03.400 --> 03:39:17.400]  A year after getting put in or if she is mentally competent enough you know is she going to go have a seizure while she's trying to give her and speaking to that do and I actually have worked on a report while we're Milwaukee and he's finished editing it's going to be out Saturday.
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:27.400]  There really go in detail about Hillary Clinton's health and whether or not we should have someone like that running a little bit of information about Senator Tim K and her VP pick.
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:35.400]  So it's going to be a it'll be a very good report but I mean we've got statues of a neck and Donald Trump all over.
[03:39:35.400 --> 03:39:37.400]  That's a different location.
[03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:44.400]  Yeah that I mean but that's that's okay but I can't say that she's a horrible human being and point out everything she's ever done wrong.
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:52.400]  Right well every single election cycle that's what they do especially if someone is an older candidate they want to see their health records you know.
[03:39:52.400 --> 03:39:56.400]  Trump 70 could probably run a marathon right now he never sleeps.
[03:39:56.400 --> 03:40:05.400]  The guys out right now you know volunteering in Louisiana helping people who have gone through hell and she's taking a four day break right now because she's old.
[03:40:05.400 --> 03:40:06.400]  She's weak.
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:08.400]  She's decrepit.
[03:40:08.400 --> 03:40:09.400]  She's haggard.
[03:40:09.400 --> 03:40:12.400]  She's just her body's being consumed by evil.
[03:40:12.400 --> 03:40:18.400]  Now I'd love to point out how here we have this naked Trump statue everywhere but there was another artist.
[03:40:18.400 --> 03:40:20.400]  I believe he was an Australian artist.
[03:40:20.400 --> 03:40:31.400]  He had an image of Hillary Clinton in like a string bikini and they forced him to take it down as soon as he posted that on Twitter or I'm sorry Instagram his account was suspended.
[03:40:31.400 --> 03:40:33.400]  So you can put up growth.
[03:40:33.400 --> 03:40:40.400]  Is that the one that was statues of Donald Trump but don't dare feature is that the one that went back and then he painted like a job saying a burqa all over it.
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:44.400]  What Alex has to call a beekeeper suit.
[03:40:44.400 --> 03:40:45.400]  Exactly.
[03:40:45.400 --> 03:40:46.400]  It was too provocative.
[03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:47.400]  How dare you.
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:49.400]  That's very very sexist.
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:54.400]  Meanwhile art is supposed to be a protected form of speech.
[03:40:54.400 --> 03:40:55.400]  But anyone can.
[03:40:55.400 --> 03:40:56.400]  Everyone goes and makes fun of him.
[03:40:56.400 --> 03:40:58.400]  But you don't see him getting.
[03:40:58.400 --> 03:41:00.400]  You don't see him getting bartered over it.
[03:41:00.400 --> 03:41:03.400]  Like this guy literally takes it from the left from the right.
[03:41:03.400 --> 03:41:07.400]  Like he's getting hit on every single media outlet out there except for us.
[03:41:07.400 --> 03:41:10.400]  Right bar you know Michael Savage Drudge.
[03:41:10.400 --> 03:41:14.400]  I mean but 90% of these people out there attacking him all the time.
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:19.400]  It's just the same BS sexist this racist that but look at all this stuff we have on Hillary.
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:31.400]  I mean actual real things that we should be upset about their argument is getting neutralized just like we saw them wear out the term racist to the point where now it's just kind of become a joke where we kind of everyone teases each other in the hall.
[03:41:31.400 --> 03:41:34.400]  Everything's racist and now everything's going to be sexist.
[03:41:34.400 --> 03:41:40.400]  It's going to wear thin people are getting sick and tired of being policed with this political correctness.
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:54.400]  Meanwhile there are actual things that it's not just Hillary's health but it's also how is she going to handle this position of power if if she get how is she going to keep a country.
[03:41:54.400 --> 03:41:58.400]  Going when she couldn't even control her own husband.
[03:41:58.400 --> 03:42:05.400]  Well when she lies under oath again and again and again now we have after Trump's epic speech that he gave.
[03:42:05.400 --> 03:42:11.400]  Politico comes out and they say regretful Trump pivots 107 days late.
[03:42:11.400 --> 03:42:19.400]  So they're they're saying well great that he delivered one of the most comprehensive on message rationales for his candidacy to date.
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:21.400]  But it's too late.
[03:42:21.400 --> 03:42:23.400]  Sorry Trump the damage is already done.
[03:42:23.400 --> 03:42:28.400]  What about Hillary Clinton coming out and apologizing for being wrong.
[03:42:28.400 --> 03:42:37.400]  Has she come out yet and apologize to lying to the American people about her server apologizing to the families for lying to them about what happened in Benghazi.
[03:42:37.400 --> 03:42:39.400]  You know what does she do.
[03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:42.400]  She points the finger at Colin Powell.
[03:42:42.400 --> 03:42:49.400]  You know it says he's the one that told me to set up my personal email like really that's the first we've heard of it.
[03:42:49.400 --> 03:42:57.400]  I just don't get this. How can you lie this much to people on camera on camera and be caught.
[03:42:57.400 --> 03:43:04.400]  And she's being caught and we've made videos showing her being caught and people still will vote for.
[03:43:04.400 --> 03:43:06.400]  Well that was a they had me at the end of the day.
[03:43:06.400 --> 03:43:11.400]  Do you have to hate Hillary Clinton or do you sometimes just have to look at these stupid people that have been dumbed down.
[03:43:11.400 --> 03:43:15.400]  Like that's who we should be mad at like how do you even like wake up in the morning.
[03:43:15.400 --> 03:43:20.400]  How do you function knowing that you actually truly believe Hillary Clinton is a good candidate.
[03:43:20.400 --> 03:43:26.400]  When you have every reason possibly shown we go over it every day to tell you why you shouldn't.
[03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:28.400]  And you can look it up for yourself.
[03:43:28.400 --> 03:43:31.400]  There's like like you Google things why it like Trump's bad.
[03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:33.400]  It's like sexist race blah blah blah who cares.
[03:43:33.400 --> 03:43:37.400]  But there's like movies being made right now like all these documentaries are coming out.
[03:43:37.400 --> 03:43:40.400]  If Trump was bad someone make a documentary about how Trump's so bad.
[03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:46.400]  Right. He was never racist sexist xenophobic ever until he tried to run against the Democrats.
[03:43:46.400 --> 03:43:49.400]  And that is that's their go to.
[03:43:49.400 --> 03:43:55.400]  That's what they use are those buzzwords those terms because they've weaponized those terms and they only use it.
[03:43:55.400 --> 03:43:58.400]  They only use it when they need to take out their opponents.
[03:43:58.400 --> 03:44:05.400]  Perfect example of this if we could possibly queue up the video was the top Democratic Hillary supporter.
[03:44:05.400 --> 03:44:08.400]  She was asked several times but but do you trust Hillary.
[03:44:08.400 --> 03:44:10.400]  I mean do you think she's trustworthy.
[03:44:10.400 --> 03:44:15.400]  And she just she had her her talking points memorized of what she would say.
[03:44:15.400 --> 03:44:24.400]  I mean even people in her own party can't sit there and lie to themselves and say yeah she's trustworthy or yeah I believe her.
[03:44:24.400 --> 03:44:29.400]  They just go on and say well she's got a lot of experience.
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:31.400]  I want to make an analogy real quick.
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:35.400]  Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party is like the human centipede.
[03:44:35.400 --> 03:44:46.400]  You know all the people got so together and she just eats all this stuff and is just you know just dumping all this stuff and the rest of people are just eating it up and they're just passing on to the next person like they're completely fine.
[03:44:46.400 --> 03:44:53.400]  Meanwhile the Democrat Party is dying because they're all like leeched on to her and they're just eating all this crap coming out of her.
[03:44:53.400 --> 03:44:59.400]  That's basically but I have never seen that movie thankfully because I didn't want that burned into my brain.
[03:44:59.400 --> 03:45:02.400]  Well now you have Hillary Clinton's face on the front of the human centipede.
[03:45:02.400 --> 03:45:05.400]  We need to give that to Ben Garrison so he can make a cartoon.
[03:45:05.400 --> 03:45:07.400]  So let's go ahead and go to the video.
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:12.400]  This is what Hillary Clinton's own party struggles with defending her.
[03:45:12.400 --> 03:45:20.400]  At 64% of voters in a recent CNN or C poll believe Clinton is not honest or trustworthy and asked three times.
[03:45:20.400 --> 03:45:22.400]  Hassan would not give her opinion.
[03:45:22.400 --> 03:45:24.400]  Do you think that she's honest and trustworthy?
[03:45:24.400 --> 03:45:32.400]  I support Hillary Clinton for the presidency because her experience and her record demonstrate that she's qualified to hold the job.
[03:45:32.400 --> 03:45:33.400]  Do you think she's honest?
[03:45:33.400 --> 03:45:41.400]  She has a critical, critical plan among others for making college more affordable.
[03:45:41.400 --> 03:45:43.400]  But do you think that she's trustworthy?
[03:45:43.400 --> 03:45:44.400]  Or they program that robot out.
[03:45:44.400 --> 03:45:51.400]  I think that she has demonstrated a commitment always to something beyond herself bigger than herself.
[03:45:51.400 --> 03:45:56.400]  That's like, that's artificial intelligence.
[03:45:56.400 --> 03:45:57.400]  How uncomfortable for her.
[03:45:57.400 --> 03:46:05.400]  Her programming, she was having a fight through that, like, must not answer whether or not I think Hillary Clinton is trustworthy.
[03:46:05.400 --> 03:46:07.400]  Issued talking points.
[03:46:07.400 --> 03:46:08.400]  Geez Louise.
[03:46:08.400 --> 03:46:09.400]  I mean, but that's how it is.
[03:46:09.400 --> 03:46:17.400]  They can just program these talking points into their political operatives and they don't really expect that they're ever going to get questioned on these things.
[03:46:17.400 --> 03:46:22.400]  For the most part, the media is shilling for Hillary Clinton.
[03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:26.400]  That's why they got to make all that money through their foundation so they can pay all these people to lie.
[03:46:26.400 --> 03:46:28.400]  That lady was fighting back from being honest.
[03:46:28.400 --> 03:46:33.400]  You knew if she even said anything outside of her talking point that it was going to be like, no, no, no.
[03:46:33.400 --> 03:46:38.400]  And then she was just going to walk off the stage and just kind of feel better.
[03:46:38.400 --> 03:46:43.400]  But I mean, there's got to be a big check that was written for her to stay online, stay on topic.
[03:46:43.400 --> 03:46:51.400]  It's like what position was put in Hillary Clinton's White House if she just comes out here and makes a fool of herself for Hillary Clinton.
[03:46:51.400 --> 03:46:59.400]  I mean, this lady now she has no credibility because she was totally embarrassed there on CNN.
[03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:12.400]  I mean, so it's just this is going to continue on if Hillary Clinton does get elected, except for we're probably going to see, you know, Twitter now, one of the last social media outlets where you could kind of go
[03:47:12.400 --> 03:47:16.400]  and see that it was going to be truthful reporting because it's in real time.
[03:47:16.400 --> 03:47:21.400]  Well, now they're just in time for a Clinton presidency working on a new filter.
[03:47:21.400 --> 03:47:23.400]  So it's going to just like Facebook.
[03:47:23.400 --> 03:47:32.400]  It's only going to give you news and information that you appear to really like, not the real-time facts, not the real-time news.
[03:47:32.400 --> 03:47:37.400]  And they're calling it an anti-harassment quality filter, but I don't want to filter.
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:40.400]  It's called a mute and a block.
[03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:44.400]  If I don't like what you have to say, I mute you and block you immediately.
[03:47:44.400 --> 03:47:48.400]  I don't need some government tool telling me what kind of information I can act.
[03:47:48.400 --> 03:47:50.400]  I mean, I don't even block people that much.
[03:47:50.400 --> 03:47:51.400]  I mean, it's only just if it's annoying.
[03:47:51.400 --> 03:47:53.400]  I mean, if I disagree with you, I'm not going to block you.
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:56.400]  I kind of like to laugh at people's stupid responses.
[03:47:56.400 --> 03:47:57.400]  I think it's hilarious.
[03:47:57.400 --> 03:48:01.400]  I mean, I did block Montel Williams, whatever his name is.
[03:48:01.400 --> 03:48:02.400]  Montel Williams.
[03:48:02.400 --> 03:48:03.400]  Yeah, that guy's annoying.
[03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:04.400]  Yeah, he and his fans.
[03:48:04.400 --> 03:48:10.400]  I know it's just like, I can't deal with the trolls while we're talking about Twitter.
[03:48:10.400 --> 03:48:13.400]  You guys can follow myself on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at Leanne McAdoo.
[03:48:13.400 --> 03:48:14.400]  You're Rambo Biggs, right?
[03:48:14.400 --> 03:48:16.400]  Yup, at Rambo Biggs, Twitter.com.
[03:48:16.400 --> 03:48:17.400]  And you heard it here.
[03:48:17.400 --> 03:48:18.400]  He enjoys the harassment.
[03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:20.400]  Oh yeah, it doesn't bother me.
[03:48:20.400 --> 03:48:21.400]  Go for it.
[03:48:21.400 --> 03:48:23.400]  It's actually like good training.
[03:48:23.400 --> 03:48:27.400]  Like, man, I take, you know, notes from these trolls sometimes.
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:28.400]  I'm like, man, I really got to set my game up.
[03:48:28.400 --> 03:48:29.400]  This guy's good.
[03:48:29.400 --> 03:48:30.400]  Kind of learn from it.
[03:48:30.400 --> 03:48:33.400]  Yeah, you get some good defensive talking points there.
[03:48:33.400 --> 03:48:41.400]  Actually, I do believe that Paul Joseph Watson just got the Twitter check mark.
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:42.400]  So he's just been verified.
[03:48:42.400 --> 03:48:47.400]  And of course, you know that they're doing that to make him, now they control, now they're
[03:48:47.400 --> 03:48:49.400]  going to say, listen, you're verified now.
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:51.400]  So check your privilege.
[03:48:51.400 --> 03:48:56.400]  Don't be too, don't be too bold there with what you say.
[03:48:56.400 --> 03:48:57.400]  Don't offend.
[03:48:57.400 --> 03:48:59.400]  I was wondering if he was there ever going to give it to him.
[03:48:59.400 --> 03:49:00.400]  They just did this this week.
[03:49:00.400 --> 03:49:03.400]  So Paul Joseph Watson, of course, he was happy about it.
[03:49:03.400 --> 03:49:07.400]  But at the same time, he's like, they think this is going to keep me in line.
[03:49:07.400 --> 03:49:08.400]  It's not going to work.
[03:49:08.400 --> 03:49:13.400]  So we've got, you know, Alex was really smart for setting up his own independent operation
[03:49:13.400 --> 03:49:17.400]  years ago where he could have sole control over what he does.
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:21.400]  He doesn't have to get talking points from anyone telling him how to report or, you know,
[03:49:21.400 --> 03:49:28.400]  what way to run the news or how our teleprompter needs to read because we are teleprompter free here.
[03:49:28.400 --> 03:49:29.400]  Excellent.
[03:49:29.400 --> 03:49:33.400]  Well, Joe Bates, you're going to be with me here for the next five minutes.
[03:49:33.400 --> 03:49:38.400]  But I know tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News, we're going to have a lot of really great
[03:49:38.400 --> 03:49:46.400]  in-depth reporting, more on Trump's epic speech and also the GOP prepping for a tough
[03:49:46.400 --> 03:49:48.400]  perjury case against Hillary Clinton.
[03:49:48.400 --> 03:49:51.400]  So this is now, they have so much evidence.
[03:49:51.400 --> 03:49:57.400]  They're saying it could take mere weeks to get a perjury case against Hillary Clinton.
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:05.400]  We've seen it there with our own eyes and ears with her lies buttressed against FBI director
[03:50:05.400 --> 03:50:07.400]  James Comey's statements.
[03:50:07.400 --> 03:50:09.400]  What did you think about that?
[03:50:09.400 --> 03:50:13.400]  Where he's basically spelling out the case against Hillary Clinton and then at the end,
[03:50:13.400 --> 03:50:15.400]  you're thinking, wow, they're really going to do it.
[03:50:15.400 --> 03:50:16.400]  They're going to come after her.
[03:50:16.400 --> 03:50:17.400]  Hillary for prison.
[03:50:17.400 --> 03:50:19.400]  And then he's like, God, no, forget it.
[03:50:19.400 --> 03:50:20.400]  He didn't want to die.
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:23.400]  I mean, everyone knows about the Clinton body count.
[03:50:23.400 --> 03:50:25.400]  That's no joke.
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:31.400]  There's been three or four that have been added to the list since the RNC.
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:35.400]  I think he was probably threatened or something like that.
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:38.400]  And it's kind of like, no one's going to prosecute because no one wants to die.
[03:50:38.400 --> 03:50:39.400]  Yeah.
[03:50:39.400 --> 03:50:43.400]  Same thing we saw with Bernie Sanders, who was like, we got to take out the establishment.
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:45.400]  But both for Hillary.
[03:50:45.400 --> 03:50:47.400]  People are dying, but Trump's sexist.
[03:50:47.400 --> 03:50:50.400]  I'm going to go to my vacation home with your money.
[03:50:50.400 --> 03:50:51.400]  Thanks, guys.

[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:24.400]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:54:24.400 --> 03:54:27.400]  Here in the last segment, Joe Biggs joins me.
[03:54:27.400 --> 03:54:28.400]  I am Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[03:54:28.400 --> 03:54:31.400]  Now, here's a story that we've got up at infowars.com right now.
[03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:33.400]  Paul Joseph Watson writes,
[03:54:33.400 --> 03:54:38.400]  Gang members chant Black Lives Matter while beating up white victims.
[03:54:38.400 --> 03:54:40.400]  So this is another racist hate crime.
[03:54:40.400 --> 03:54:43.400]  It's going to receive very little media attention.
[03:54:43.400 --> 03:54:46.400]  So this was gang members in Charleston.
[03:54:46.400 --> 03:54:50.400]  I guess they were beating up a white victim as part of an initiation ritual.
[03:54:50.400 --> 03:54:55.400]  And this story has received zero national media attention.
[03:54:55.400 --> 03:55:01.400]  So I guess the gentleman that was beaten up posted a video on Facebook
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:06.400]  relating how he was driving home before picking someone up to help them get home.
[03:55:06.400 --> 03:55:09.400]  A woman was frantically waving her arms on the side of the road.
[03:55:09.400 --> 03:55:11.400]  He offered her a ride.
[03:55:11.400 --> 03:55:17.400]  And when he arrived at the destination, his passenger stole the tip money he had on his counter.
[03:55:17.400 --> 03:55:21.400]  And when he exited the vehicle, he was immediately surrounded by two Black men
[03:55:21.400 --> 03:55:23.400]  and had a gun put to his head.
[03:55:23.400 --> 03:55:27.400]  A member of the gang ordered the other gang members to shoot him
[03:55:27.400 --> 03:55:31.400]  before he was able to snatch away the gun and run back to his truck.
[03:55:31.400 --> 03:55:34.400]  Other members of the gang were there waiting for him
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:39.400]  and subjected him to a brutal beatdown that was part of a gang initiation.
[03:55:39.400 --> 03:55:41.400]  And he says it was a setup.
[03:55:41.400 --> 03:55:42.400]  And of course it is.
[03:55:42.400 --> 03:55:47.400]  You know, there was another story that came out the other day about two teenagers
[03:55:47.400 --> 03:55:52.400]  who beat up a good Samaritan after he helped them get their car out of a ditch.
[03:55:52.400 --> 03:55:55.400]  Then they shot him and killed him.
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:56:01.400]  And so, I mean, it's getting to the point where we can't ignore this violence that is kind of creeping up.
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:03.400]  Had something happen to me.
[03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:06.400]  Just trying to do a good deed out there and they're getting hurt.
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:10.400]  I was at this bar in Austin and I was going out to my truck to get something
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:12.400]  and this car pulls up right behind me.
[03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:14.400]  It's like one of the morning.
[03:56:14.400 --> 03:56:15.400]  This car pulls up.
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:19.400]  This guy gets out and has a knife and comes up to me and he goes,
[03:56:19.400 --> 03:56:20.400]  I need your wallet.
[03:56:20.400 --> 03:56:23.400]  I was like, well, I actually just came out to my truck to get my wallet.
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:24.400]  And then I kind of said it all scared.
[03:56:24.400 --> 03:56:26.400]  I was like, well, my wallet's inside my truck.
[03:56:26.400 --> 03:56:28.400]  Can I just get it for you?
[03:56:28.400 --> 03:56:30.400]  And my truck is an arsenal.
[03:56:30.400 --> 03:56:32.400]  My truck is an arsenal.
[03:56:32.400 --> 03:56:38.400]  And I pulled out my Glock at you and put that threaded barrel right against his forehead.
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:44.400]  And I told him that next time he should learn to rethink life's decisions and go get a job
[03:56:44.400 --> 03:56:46.400]  and do something with his life.
[03:56:46.400 --> 03:56:48.400]  I'm going to give him a chance to live today.
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:52.400]  And I told him and his girlfriend to get the hell out of there.
[03:56:52.400 --> 03:56:53.400]  Wow.
[03:56:53.400 --> 03:56:57.400]  Needless to say that guy peed himself and got back into his car and left.
[03:56:57.400 --> 03:57:01.400]  And maybe he looks at life with a whole new set of eyes.
[03:57:01.400 --> 03:57:03.400]  Who knows if not, if I run into him again.
[03:57:03.400 --> 03:57:06.400]  And of course that situation could have ended up totally differently.
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:07.400]  Yeah, he would have been dead.
[03:57:07.400 --> 03:57:09.400]  He would have been a different person.
[03:57:09.400 --> 03:57:10.400]  Oh yeah, with another person.
[03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:11.400]  No, me.
[03:57:11.400 --> 03:57:15.400]  With him or with you, I mean, it could have ended up totally a different scenario.
[03:57:15.400 --> 03:57:16.400]  But I mean, that's it.
[03:57:16.400 --> 03:57:21.400]  The media, they can't deny the fact that there is some stuff going on here in this country.
[03:57:21.400 --> 03:57:31.400]  And by covering it up, by saying that it's a lone, not a lone wolf, but just a lone situation with this, the knockout game.
[03:57:31.400 --> 03:57:36.400]  Then you have people that they're just not prepared to be dealing with these situations.
[03:57:36.400 --> 03:57:44.400]  Or you get those emails sent out like, hey girls, be sure that you watch when you're getting to your car at a parking lot at night.
[03:57:44.400 --> 03:57:48.400]  Because here's this new scam that they're trying to do with women.
[03:57:48.400 --> 03:57:54.400]  And here in the media, they're failing to let people know that there's a new crime kind of going down.
[03:57:54.400 --> 03:57:57.400]  That it's like, good Samaritans, beware.
[03:57:57.400 --> 03:57:59.400]  This is really dangerous.
[03:57:59.400 --> 03:58:05.400]  Well, Joe Biggs, thank you so much for joining me here in the third and fourth hour.
[03:58:05.400 --> 03:58:08.400]  I know you're going to have a lot of fun out shooting some guns.
[03:58:08.400 --> 03:58:09.400]  Pew Pew.
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:10.400]  For America.
[03:58:10.400 --> 03:58:13.400]  And for all those poor guns that lost their lives in Venezuela.
[03:58:13.400 --> 03:58:16.400]  I'm going to drink to those guys tonight.
[03:58:16.400 --> 03:58:18.400]  Well, that is wonderful.
[03:58:18.400 --> 03:58:22.400]  We really appreciate your part you're doing for America.
[03:58:22.400 --> 03:58:26.400]  And everyone out there, please tune into the Info Wars Nightly News tonight.
