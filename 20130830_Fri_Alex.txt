[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:28.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we are getting conflicting
[00:28.000 --> 00:41.640]  reports on whether or not President Barack Obama is going to launch a bombing raid or
[00:41.640 --> 00:53.680]  raids on Syria now officially in all the polls the whole narrative that Assad launched the
[00:53.680 --> 01:05.240]  chemical attack has officially imploded and we have the Associated Press writer who we've
[01:05.240 --> 01:11.800]  confirmed is an Associated Press writer writing for a separate syndicator interviewing multiple
[01:11.800 --> 01:18.880]  rebels who have admitted responsibility for the chemical weapons attack you've got world
[01:18.880 --> 01:27.440]  at daily with video on official jihadi websites showing them loading mortars up on artillery
[01:27.440 --> 01:34.120]  to fire chemicals you have the Saudi Arabian ambassador and and that's not even the one
[01:34.120 --> 01:41.080]  in telegraph by the way we reported on days ago it's down the telegraph threatening Russia
[01:41.080 --> 01:45.960]  to activate al Qaeda they control in Chechnya and other areas and to attack the Olympics
[01:45.960 --> 01:53.800]  that are coming up in Russia if they don't play ball and we posted this video last night
[01:53.800 --> 02:01.920]  and literally no one has given this any attention but there's now an article out today from
[02:01.920 --> 02:11.040]  story leak dot com and we have it mirrored upon info wars dot com Ron Paul Syria chemical
[02:11.040 --> 02:16.320]  attack a false flag and we're going to play that clip coming up in the next segment he
[02:16.320 --> 02:22.720]  said this a couple days ago on Neil Cavuto and the headline is why are we on the side
[02:22.720 --> 02:26.640]  of al Qaeda we have a separate article this morning with that headline about the same
[02:26.640 --> 02:33.680]  video by the way Ron Paul was almost a few weeks ago and said the former congressman
[02:33.680 --> 02:43.520]  said that he was worried that he was worried about some type of false flag being used we
[02:43.520 --> 02:47.000]  wrote a story about it then but this is a big deal this is on Fox News you can't ignore
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.280]  this and just the whole narrative is unraveling you got world net daily writing about it you
[02:52.280 --> 02:58.960]  got drudge report linking to stuff that's covering it you've got info wars covering
[02:58.960 --> 03:05.120]  it you've got everybody I talked to on the street is like Alex I used to think you were
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.480]  a cook I mean this happened to me this morning on the hiking bike trail hey man I used to
[03:09.480 --> 03:14.680]  think you were nuts you know I've I'm a retired army officer and I gotta tell you our government
[03:14.680 --> 03:18.560]  really does run out guide and they really are staging all this stuff and why would
[03:18.560 --> 03:23.040]  a saw it do that why would he attack with chemicals don't he'll get bombarded I tell
[03:23.040 --> 03:29.320]  you Obama wants to distract us what's going on people are really getting it and this shows
[03:29.320 --> 03:39.720]  we have hope on so many on so many fronts that that that fool me once shame on me no
[03:39.720 --> 03:48.600]  not really the old saying is fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me well
[03:48.600 --> 03:53.120]  we've been fooled over and over and over and over and over again and people now are on
[03:53.120 --> 03:58.680]  to the tricks they're on to the tricks and whether it's global warming and we've got
[03:58.680 --> 04:05.400]  to all pay Al Gore money or the Statue of Liberty's gonna be underwater or whether it is political
[04:05.400 --> 04:11.640]  correctness it's really radical authoritarianism masquerading as as as justice people are really
[04:11.640 --> 04:19.240]  getting it just like the poll three days ago the Washington Post reported on the Reuters
[04:19.240 --> 04:25.200]  poll only 9% of respondents back the Obama administration and they're playing to intervene
[04:25.200 --> 04:31.000]  here's the problem this is imploded to kind of hit me this morning this is imploded so
[04:31.000 --> 04:42.360]  bad and it's such an embarrassment for the system they may go ahead through bravada and
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.640]  false hubris they may go ahead with this attack just to say we did the right thing it doesn't
[04:45.640 --> 04:51.440]  matter what you say and maybe even stage some terror attacks blaming it on the side because
[04:51.440 --> 04:58.000]  if they lose credibility on this it could implode on every level so that's what my gut
[04:58.000 --> 05:04.720]  tells me protecting your home with a security system is a must but when it comes to protecting

[08:44.560 --> 08:50.000]  we come back sunday's four to six p.m. central with a live sunday broadcast now i was intending
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.040]  to take this sunday off and put together a partially original broadcast i was going
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.680]  to tape some of it today i was going to add in some nightly news interviews we're going
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.760]  to have that show waiting in the wings for the sunday broadcast four to six p.m. but
[09:04.760 --> 09:11.800]  if there are missile strikes or fighter bomber strikes cruise missile strikes on syria today
[09:11.800 --> 09:19.080]  tomorrow or sunday i will be live and by the way i've volunteers to come in on monday david
[09:19.080 --> 09:23.040]  night wants to come in on monday he always has a great job sitting in one of the info
[09:23.040 --> 09:27.400]  where his nightly news reporters does a great job sitting in on the syndicated broadcast
[09:27.400 --> 09:35.000]  david night will be live monday but if there's been a strike i will be here live on monday
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.520]  i will already be here on monday but i need to take that day off from radio to work on
[09:40.520 --> 09:47.640]  obama deception to that undoubtedly will be the most powerful film ever made and i said
[09:47.640 --> 09:52.920]  earlier in the week i would announce the specific days of when it's coming out i will do it
[09:52.920 --> 09:58.160]  today at twelve thirty i will announce and i'm not doing that to push it off i need to
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.440]  meet with the guys actually and and just double check the dates i've got them in my mind but
[10:02.440 --> 10:06.280]  i want to double check them on the calendar double check with the manufacturers it'll
[10:06.280 --> 10:09.880]  be printing them up and everything now we're still making the film right now we'll be doing
[10:09.880 --> 10:17.520]  it until uh up until the end of october uh there's just so much we're putting into it
[10:17.520 --> 10:21.960]  you there's never been a film like this i mean it is unbelievable i almost don't even
[10:21.960 --> 10:25.960]  want to hype it up because last time they had the fbi show up here asking about the
[10:25.960 --> 10:31.280]  obama deception five days before it was going to come out contacting our servers contacting
[10:31.280 --> 10:35.360]  companies that we have servers with and calling my crew members and they were really freaked
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.720]  out about it and i guess they had some metric because it later got watched tens of millions
[10:39.720 --> 10:46.240]  of times knowing there was a big buildup or something and so i just launched it early
[10:46.240 --> 10:55.960]  i just released it for free early uh so this was really really devastating uh and the graphics
[10:55.960 --> 11:01.680]  the material the information the angles we go with because there's such a big ocean of
[11:01.680 --> 11:06.600]  corruption you got to go with an angle and we're not spinning it to make obama and the
[11:06.600 --> 11:14.640]  globalists look bad they're so bad it's like how do you take thousands of horrible things
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.960]  they've done and hundreds and hundreds of confirmed lies and over a hundred impeachable
[11:18.960 --> 11:24.960]  offenses on record and try to show all that and not just make it a film where you're reading
[11:24.960 --> 11:30.120]  out the sins of the new world order for eternity as they commit more even faster than you can
[11:30.120 --> 11:38.720]  do it i mean it is it is unbelievable the stuff we've got is just unbelievable i've
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.560]  been up here till like 10 o'clock at night almost every night and and and i and i wouldn't
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.080]  be doing this and not seeing my children i love taking my kids to play putt putt golf
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.680]  i love taking them to play laser tag i love taking them for hikes i love taking them fishing
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.560]  i love taking them to visit friends you know they got boats and jet skis and stuff i love
[11:56.560 --> 12:01.640]  taking them to visit family and go camping i absolutely love sitting in the backyard
[12:01.640 --> 12:07.760]  jumping on the trampoline shooting BB guns i absolutely love sitting on the couch and
[12:07.760 --> 12:15.040]  watching an old you know fifties doris day you know movie with jack lemon i literally
[12:15.040 --> 12:22.640]  see my kids about 10 hours a week now about an hour in the morning and a couple hours
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.600]  on the weekend and the reason i'm talking about myself here is i realize they have no
[12:27.600 --> 12:35.560]  future if i don't fully commit and do everything i can but then there is the catch 22 of you
[12:35.560 --> 12:40.600]  get so overwrought and so hyped up i turn into like a gibbering chimpanzee at the time
[12:40.600 --> 12:45.240]  on the air but i know people can put up with that now enough talking about myself these
[12:45.240 --> 12:51.680]  are the times that do try men and women souls and it is the best of times it is the worst
[12:51.680 --> 12:59.880]  of times on so many fronts obviously we're going to get into the serious situation front
[12:59.880 --> 13:05.280]  and center paul watson is joining us with bombshell info in the next segment then joll
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.800]  scowls and world affairs brief editor incredible geopolitical mind he's going to be popping
[13:09.800 --> 13:16.240]  in from an airport he's going through tsa i think right now or he's a pilot he may be
[13:16.240 --> 13:19.160]  flying himself i don't know he just said he's got to get to the airport and then he can
[13:19.160 --> 13:25.120]  call us so that's coming up and we're going to then have open phones in the second and
[13:25.120 --> 13:29.720]  third hour today i'll do my best to actually go to your calls and not get sidetracked
[13:29.720 --> 13:36.400]  off into rabbit trails here but folks know that when negative news is going on and we've
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.040]  got bad news i will tell you the bad news i don't get up here and surely it's something
[13:41.040 --> 13:47.200]  that's a devastating victory for liberty if it isn't a devastating victory for liberty
[13:47.200 --> 13:59.600]  but everything together shows me a ultra massive sea change a turning of the lake a turning
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.840]  of the political ocean of the political tides and there is a tide in the affairs of men
[14:04.840 --> 14:15.280]  when taken at the flood leads on to fortune as shakespeare wrote in his piece on the
[14:15.280 --> 14:22.440]  roman times of julius caesar and our fortune is liberty in our time justice in our time
[14:22.440 --> 14:27.280]  to turn the criminal tide and let me tell you there is a tide in the affairs of men
[14:27.280 --> 14:32.720]  when taken at the flood leads on to fortune we are on that wave we've caught the wave
[14:32.720 --> 14:38.800]  we are surfing the apocalypse ladies and gentlemen this is the real deal so get your
[14:38.800 --> 14:49.600]  game face on get in the zone and we can turn things around if you believe the self-fulfilling
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.440]  prophecy put out by the globalist run churches in the last 150 years that it's always the
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.360]  end of the world and there's no reason to fight evil we're doomed whether it's the
[14:59.360 --> 15:03.960]  end of the world down the road or not and the antichrist and all that it doesn't matter
[15:03.960 --> 15:09.920]  justice be done may the heavens fall duty is ours consequences belong to god duty is
[15:09.920 --> 15:24.720]  like a mountain death is like wings it comes you can't stop it and so we have like atlas
[15:24.720 --> 15:36.800]  duty on our shoulders but it is empowering to do the right thing and that is when you
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.680]  will be fulfilled and I just hate to keep going back to that but the whole madison
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.640]  avenue whole world system is about you're going to be fulfilled when you do what we
[15:46.640 --> 15:53.320]  say you're going to be fulfilled when you sign on to our agenda and that will fulfill
[15:53.320 --> 15:58.240]  you well it doesn't fulfill you it's the opposite because if you're fulfilled you don't need
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.600]  them if you're confident and know that you're morals and who you are and what you stand
[16:02.600 --> 16:08.840]  for and your integrity is your greatest possession then all the rest of the stuff cannot affect
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.400]  you and you cannot be bought that's why the globalists want us impoverished in a permanent
[16:14.400 --> 16:22.720]  peasant class that's why they want us dependent because they want us to be absolutely undeveloped
[16:22.720 --> 16:27.200]  they want an arrested development they want to destroy our free will they are afraid of
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.160]  your potential they know how beautiful humans are they know how powerful we are and so they've
[16:32.160 --> 16:37.480]  wrecked us in the last 70-80 years under the psych warfare systems of Edward Bernays and
[16:37.480 --> 16:42.280]  Joseph Goebbels and all the others who all wrote books bragging about their sciences
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.200]  this is all there for you to learn I'm here telling you all their tricks I've read their
[16:46.200 --> 16:51.920]  books I study their latest operations I'm here saying I don't have all the answers they
[16:51.920 --> 16:57.400]  act like we're all idiots and are operating in plain view I've simply got the glasses
[16:57.400 --> 17:04.920]  on like they live I can see it I can see formaldehyde face looking at me and I don't like it
[17:04.920 --> 17:09.440]  and all I gotta do is get you to put the glasses on and you're not gonna be following what
[17:09.440 --> 17:14.200]  I say you're not gonna be an Alex Jones cult member you're going to have glasses on folks
[17:14.200 --> 17:20.040]  just look around you stop thinking it's work to be informed stop thinking it's it's it's
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.520]  bad to know what's going on the world it's work to be ignorant it's work to not be informed
[17:25.520 --> 17:34.440]  it's work to not get stuff organized it's work to lay down if you were walking through
[17:34.440 --> 17:39.720]  northern Canada and a bunch of wolves came along if you act scared they're gonna chase
[17:39.720 --> 17:43.880]  you down and they're gonna eat you but if you start charging them and foaming at the
[17:43.880 --> 17:51.360]  mouth they're gonna run crying and fear even if they're starving in most cases it is the
[17:51.360 --> 17:56.680]  spirit of liberty that will dispel the spirit of tyranny do you understand it is a spirit
[17:56.680 --> 18:01.000]  and I know I said this earlier in the week it's just more and more I realize we've got
[18:01.000 --> 18:07.440]  to have the spirit of people that are free and then that will animate us but God is not
[18:07.440 --> 18:12.720]  like the New World Order the power of the universe that flows out of God that flows
[18:12.720 --> 18:20.960]  out of justice respects free will you've got to want to be empowered you've got to want
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.200]  to get past your fear you've got to want to stand against tyrants now what's coming
[18:25.200 --> 18:34.240]  up today because it is bombshell on top of bombshell on top of bombshell Ron Paul has
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.320]  gone on Fox News and it's getting no attention it's up on info wars.com it's up on story
[18:39.320 --> 18:46.000]  leak.com Ron Paul's Syria chemical attack a false flag that is an exact quote we're
[18:46.000 --> 18:53.920]  gonna play that coming up that video is up on info wars.com right now now expanding
[18:53.920 --> 19:02.720]  on that bombshell Paul Watson has an AP writer rebels admit responsibility for chemical weapons
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.120]  attack said Saudi Arabia gave it to him and the story fits exactly with the type of mortars
[19:08.120 --> 19:11.920]  but this is only one of the events we know there's been other chemical attacks and the
[19:11.920 --> 19:17.080]  rebels filming themselves with the mortar shells at least three other times that's why this
[19:17.080 --> 19:24.240]  is so frustrating is this is hiding in plain view like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco

[24:08.880 --> 24:15.440]  pretender what if I say I will never surrender we are back live on this Friday Worldwide
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.760]  edition headlines at info wars dot com rebels admit responsibility for chemical weapons
[24:20.760 --> 24:28.080]  attack and during the break we're backing it up on the on the recording system CNN was
[24:28.080 --> 24:34.200]  reporting another chemical attack in Syria what did I say at the start of the show I
[24:34.200 --> 24:40.400]  think Obama will launch another false flag or his controllers will to get the new bombing
[24:40.400 --> 24:45.080]  operation going because as everybody turns against him and as people say it's fake and
[24:45.080 --> 24:49.880]  his mainline news ask why are we with al qaeda and Ron Paul goes on Fox News says it's a
[24:49.880 --> 24:54.960]  false flag staged attack as all this comes out they'll have to have a new event to change
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.680]  the subject about the old event that's how their psychology works and it just broke on
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.040]  CNN in fact we can back that up on the tape back there on the DVR I want to show where
[25:05.040 --> 25:12.040]  they had it on the screen there it is reports of another chemical attack Syrian opposition
[25:12.040 --> 25:18.680]  group claims it happened Monday now and the truth is the rebels are uploading videos constantly
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.240]  of themselves they got caught three separate times before this launching chemical attacks
[25:24.240 --> 25:28.640]  they got caught by the foreign press it's never in the news here joining us briefly
[25:28.640 --> 25:34.400]  as Paul Watson from London who broke the story in the international media it already came
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.680]  out with this AP writer who couldn't get it I guess published in AP so he wrote it for
[25:38.680 --> 25:44.360]  another wire a respected reporter who's over there that would talk to multiple rebels by
[25:44.360 --> 25:50.480]  name who admitted in one case they were given it by Saudi Arabia and it blew up on them
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.280]  so joining us is Paul Watson Paul this this whole thing is unraveling fast but I think
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.160]  they're going to stage something in fact it may have already happened to try to change
[26:00.160 --> 26:05.800]  the subject onto the new event Paul Watson well I mean they've been completely discredited
[26:05.800 --> 26:12.000]  Alex he had the so-called intelligence that Assad was behind the attack it consisted of
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.160]  the Syrian Defense Ministry making panic phone calls to the chemical weapons department demanding
[26:18.160 --> 26:22.880]  answers as to what happened in the attack last week if they were behind the attack if
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.120]  they had ordered it why would they be calling up panic saying what else going on to their
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.600]  own chemical weapons department then he had this bombshell story today which you know
[26:32.600 --> 26:38.440]  imagine if a member of the Syrian government had admitted to an AP reporter that Assad was
[26:38.440 --> 26:44.280]  behind the chemical weapons attack it will be all over the news instantly you know instead
[26:44.280 --> 26:50.680]  today they're obsessing about a Facebook post by Assad's 11 year old son if it's even true
[26:50.680 --> 26:57.080]  yeah and this story is being completely ignored and basically a reporter who reports for the
[26:57.080 --> 27:05.440]  AP has done work with BBC news NPR salon dot com called Dale Gavlak visited the area
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.760]  in Ghouta that was hit by the chemical weapons incident last week in Syria talked to the
[27:10.760 --> 27:17.880]  rebels there they told her directly they were given the chemical weapons by Saudi intelligence
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.600]  Prince Bandar bin Sultan arranged it all he of course is the guy who threatened Putin
[27:23.600 --> 27:29.440]  with terrorist attacks on the Olympics next year if he didn't abandon support for Syria
[27:29.440 --> 27:34.600]  the rebels told this AP reporter they were given the chemical weapons they weren't given
[27:34.600 --> 27:39.560]  training on how to handle them apparently the plan was initially to give them to Jabhat
[27:39.560 --> 27:44.080]  Jabhat al-Nuzra which of course is the Al Qaeda terrorist group that we're supporting over
[27:44.080 --> 27:50.560]  there but they got given to the rebels instead who mishandled them there was an explosion
[27:50.560 --> 27:55.760]  12 rebels were killed instantly and then we had this chemical weapons incident which led
[27:55.760 --> 28:01.000]  to all the horrific injuries that we saw the hundreds injured and dead so one of them told
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.960]  a quote we were very curious about these arms and unfortunately some of the fighters handled
[28:05.960 --> 28:12.160]  the weapons improperly and set off the explosions one militant told this associate press reporter
[28:12.160 --> 28:16.960]  and she quotes numerous others who say the same thing she quotes by name abdel money
[28:16.960 --> 28:22.560]  in the father of one of the rebels who confirms that the chemical weapons exploded in a tunnel
[28:22.560 --> 28:27.760]  killed 12 rebels and led to this chemical weapons incident which has been blamed on
[28:27.760 --> 28:34.000]  Assad and used as the pretext for you know tomahawk cruise missile attacks so it's a
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.360]  bombshell story the organization behind it is called mint news I believe it's mint press
[28:41.360 --> 28:47.000]  news and it's it's a legitimate organization based in minnesota minnesota posted a profile
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.920]  on them last year they've got numerous credible journalists working for them the one who wrote
[28:51.920 --> 28:56.760]  this story has done work for bbc associated press I linked to it in the article I want
[28:56.760 --> 29:00.600]  to get them on absolutely I want to get them on but it's not just this report this fits
[29:00.600 --> 29:06.680]  in with the rebels who are so unprofessional that they brag when they do this I mean they
[29:06.680 --> 29:10.800]  really think they're good guys they're very gullible they're being given this and they
[29:10.800 --> 29:16.760]  you know they in other attacks they loaded up and fire it and cheer bin laden while they
[29:16.760 --> 29:22.120]  do it let me ask you this your parliament just voted down but still they're saying cameron
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.600]  can block it I want to come back and do three or four minutes more with you about cameron
[29:26.600 --> 29:31.120]  specifically and your parliament voting down an attack but now they're saying he can go
[29:31.120 --> 29:35.760]  ahead with it regardless just like Obama says he can do it without congress we have a hundred
[29:35.760 --> 29:40.880]  and fifty members of congress demanding a vote on Syria I want to get your take on that briefly
[29:40.880 --> 29:44.800]  then we're going to get Joel scowls in the world affairs brief to break down from on
[29:44.800 --> 29:51.280]  the road what he thinks is going on will there be an attack this weekend we're on the march
[29:51.280 --> 30:02.320]  the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network are we choosing our own destiny
[30:02.320 --> 30:06.560]  or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has
[30:06.560 --> 30:12.840]  had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars have been spent privately

[33:37.800 --> 33:42.400]  they're getting ready to have a carrier someone come out and make a statement let's punch
[33:42.400 --> 33:47.480]  that up on screen that state department shopper folks there it is and they've got a live video
[33:47.480 --> 33:55.560]  feed up there as you can see preparing for a statement CNN just started announcing about
[33:55.560 --> 34:02.320]  12 minutes ago that there have been new chemical attacks now they're saying five days ago in
[34:02.320 --> 34:07.880]  monday on monday and I've been saying yesterday and today just because I know these people
[34:07.880 --> 34:13.080]  operate if they've been caught in other false flags they'll launch a new one maybe even
[34:13.080 --> 34:20.160]  bigger and say Assad did that and say that's it and that's the talking point on all the
[34:20.160 --> 34:26.960]  control press CNN MSNBC you name it is we've got hundreds of thousands dead 100 200 no
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.440]  one knows and we've got to do something it's terrible this is happening when the west started
[34:31.440 --> 34:37.320]  this two and a half years ago you got more russian ships massing more us ships massing
[34:37.320 --> 34:44.440]  I have seen the public support for this totally implode worldwide nine percent approval rating
[34:44.440 --> 34:51.160]  and Reuters polls germany england voting it down france warmongering that's how weird
[34:51.160 --> 34:56.040]  this is france is like foaming at the mouth to take over libya and egypt and syria i'm
[34:56.040 --> 34:59.560]  going to ask joel scowls when we get him on from world affairs brief the editor what's
[34:59.560 --> 35:05.000]  happening with that but this is also about being a political distraction domestically
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.600]  but it's more than that it's about taking over the entire middle east to encircle russia
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.720]  and again our government's been hijacked by globalists our media is like are you for america
[35:14.720 --> 35:20.080]  or for russia i'm for not going and starting preemptive wars and being the bad guy for
[35:20.080 --> 35:26.400]  globalists especially so paul watson finishing up your parliament voted this down by what
[35:26.400 --> 35:31.880]  16 votes but now they're saying that they may still strike because england won't surrender
[35:31.880 --> 35:38.480]  or retreat surrender from something started by the west surrender from you know a 15 year
[35:38.480 --> 35:43.720]  old sitting on top of five year old beating him up i mean this is this is all these countries
[35:43.720 --> 35:49.440]  dozens of countries in nato and saudi arabia and cutter and and and and all ganged up on
[35:49.440 --> 35:55.600]  syria to take it out syria is winning the world starting to root for the underdog even
[35:55.600 --> 36:00.680]  if Assad's not a great guy compared to al qaeda he's wonderful in a nutshell where do you see
[36:00.680 --> 36:06.520]  this going and what's your gut tell you do you think there's going to be an attack yeah
[36:06.520 --> 36:11.840]  there's going to be some kind of limited attack just so obama can save face on his ridiculous
[36:11.840 --> 36:17.680]  red line comment and the pet the places they're going to attack in demascus are amidst the
[36:17.680 --> 36:22.320]  civilian population all the military targets are right next to the civilian population
[36:22.320 --> 36:26.700]  so when they say it's going to be surgical no it's not it's going to kill innocent people
[36:26.700 --> 36:31.280]  you know it is but the thing about the vote in the uk was it was the first time since
[36:31.280 --> 36:38.840]  1782 that a british prime minister has lost a vote on war so it was completely unprecedented
[36:38.840 --> 36:43.720]  now david kameron's accusing the people who voted against it as siding with russia so
[36:43.720 --> 36:50.040]  it's back to the old reds under the bed rhetoric i guess and then the the damning thing is the
[36:50.040 --> 36:54.360]  mainstream media won't report on a story like this that we just talked about and the only
[36:54.360 --> 36:59.480]  people to report on it apart from us is the voice of russia so we have to rely on russian
[36:59.480 --> 37:04.000]  state media just to try and get a little bit of truth from the opposite side of the equation
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.880]  so it's pathetic it's another damning indictment of the mainstream media and again our north
[37:09.880 --> 37:16.800]  star is the truth our jobs easy we don't have special interest we simply think what is justice
[37:16.800 --> 37:24.040]  what is right what is good for freedom worldwide what is common organic law and we follow that
[37:24.040 --> 37:31.960]  as our north star as our rudder as our guide and it is so sad to see to see this unfolding
[37:31.960 --> 37:37.480]  but i've got a stack of news here where despite a hundred and fifty members of congress demanding
[37:37.480 --> 37:43.960]  a vote on syria and that's being picked up by the associated press and others despite
[37:43.960 --> 37:50.880]  that paul obama saying i don't even need anybody's approval i'm just going to go ahead with
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.600]  all of this because it's the right thing to do and what do you think kerry's going to
[37:55.600 --> 38:03.520]  say whenever he totals out on the stage from what i've read he's going to outline the intelligence
[38:03.520 --> 38:08.320]  that they found to blame the attack on a side even as it comes out that the rebels admit
[38:08.320 --> 38:15.640]  responsibility for it and it's amazing the fact that they argue this is not about regime
[38:15.640 --> 38:21.440]  change wesley clark was told in the weeks after 9 11 by wolfowitz by other pentagon
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.760]  officials these seven countries are on the list you know libya iraq syria they were
[38:26.760 --> 38:31.560]  all on there brookings institute last year said we need some humanitarian crisis to
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.680]  go in and topple Assad in syria of course it's about regime change it's about it's been
[38:35.680 --> 38:42.160]  about regime change for the best part of 15 years so to claim it's not again they're
[38:42.160 --> 38:50.120]  laying out their backsides and people are going to die because of it paul so many other
[38:50.120 --> 38:55.920]  facets to this if this attack does take place iran has said they're going to probably block
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.120]  the street of ormos blocking about a third of the world's oil supply or more some estimates
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.400]  are as high as 40 percent there'll obviously be huge riots and things happening that may
[39:07.400 --> 39:12.960]  even block the sue s canal blocking another 10 percent iran's also saying they're going
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.800]  to fire medium range missiles at israel israel has said if they're hit with medium range
[39:16.800 --> 39:23.040]  missiles they're going to nuke iran obviously when that happens is all the nuclear experts
[39:23.040 --> 39:29.360]  have said then there will probably be a larger nuclear war and that's why most analysts that
[39:29.360 --> 39:35.400]  we've had on here but even members of the british defense establishment that's general
[39:35.400 --> 39:41.720]  dem see the chairman joint chiefs of staff dr. paul craig roberts so many others have
[39:41.720 --> 39:47.680]  all dr. coursey they all say this is probably the most dangerous time since the cuban missile
[39:47.680 --> 39:53.680]  crisis and the yuppies out there partying and acting silly and also the dumb obama
[39:53.680 --> 39:58.080]  supporters and neocons that want war that i don't think they have any idea how much
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.680]  danger we're in because the iranians have shown they'll do what they say the russians
[40:02.680 --> 40:07.760]  have shown they'll do what they say and i think the world realizes if they don't stand
[40:07.760 --> 40:13.080]  up the the golden sacks run governments globalist run governments are going to continue bringing
[40:13.080 --> 40:18.520]  rebels into their countries and trying to overthrow the governments and so it's just
[40:18.520 --> 40:25.080]  not marriage what we're facing well i think that assads reluctance to actually defend
[40:25.080 --> 40:30.600]  his own country don't forget that israel already attacked syria with two airstrikes
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.080]  within the past six months and they did nothing about it this time i don't think they're going
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.880]  to do nothing about it if there is an attack then asard has indicated that he will attack
[40:39.880 --> 40:44.560]  israel in response to that israel has said we're going to go into demascus is going to
[40:44.560 --> 40:50.200]  be regime change so you know then all the fun of the fair begins it's absolutely ludicrous
[40:50.200 --> 40:56.000]  suggestion that to save face for obama and their justification they're going to carry
[40:56.000 --> 41:02.000]  out limited surgical airstrikes it's complete insanity ran paul yesterday said it could start
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.040]  a war with russia numerous experts have said it could be the start of world war three and
[41:07.040 --> 41:11.600]  it's everybody else is abandoning it but obama's saying i'm the dictator i'm going to go ahead
[41:11.600 --> 41:15.960]  anyway ignore congress ignore the u n ignore all the other countries in the world because
[41:15.960 --> 41:22.280]  you know he's the dictator amazing paul we'll be here covering it live sunday and live
[41:22.280 --> 41:27.200]  monday live sunday if it happens money regardless we're going to be live here i'm going to be
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.080]  at the office working on obama deception to probably pop into the show that david night's
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.400]  going to be david night's going to be sitting in here at the info wars dot com studios
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.760]  in austin texas you know it's not just north korea that's targeting austin where i live
[41:39.760 --> 41:44.080]  it's the russians and everybody else but regardless if you live in a big city or near
[41:44.080 --> 41:50.520]  a military base in europe in the uk in the united states in australia you're going to
[41:50.520 --> 41:54.360]  be hit with nuclear weapons when all this goes down the russians have twelve thousand
[41:54.360 --> 42:00.920]  high-tech new weapons uh... thousands of medium range and tactical weapons so it's over fourteen
[42:00.920 --> 42:04.960]  thousand united states has conservatively ten thousand probably more like fifty thousand
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.120]  i mean that what they tell the public is not what's going on uh... and all sorts of space
[42:09.120 --> 42:16.120]  based d u saba platforms and a lot of other really nasty stuff and uh... the banksters
[42:16.120 --> 42:21.280]  never lose they always just get more more they can get away with anything and i think
[42:21.280 --> 42:26.120]  this is the classic disaster when these people think they're unstoppable and again i'm not
[42:26.120 --> 42:33.520]  anti-israel it's it's always the flavor does your the cause does your the cause celeb
[42:33.520 --> 42:38.440]  nothing's more trendy and i even hear pro-israel people that i've known over the years on radio
[42:38.440 --> 42:44.120]  now bad-mouthing israel and making little attacks on israel i know israel's run by corrupt
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.680]  globalist that are the same as every other major nation is used as a set piece for the
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.360]  globalist create destabilization everywhere and play different groups off against each
[42:52.360 --> 42:56.400]  other it's just like i'm not against the saudi arabian people but their government is incredibly
[42:56.400 --> 43:00.560]  evil involved in all this or the german people or the or the french people have a horrible
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.240]  socialist leadership but i'm not against them or the the people of the uk i can't stand
[43:04.240 --> 43:09.280]  your monarchy and your corrupt elites and uh... the uh... labor on top of it that acts like
[43:09.280 --> 43:14.320]  their anti-monarchy to play the part of you know left cover for that but the people of
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.080]  uk are wonderful folks same thing for canadiens it it we the people need to come together
[43:19.080 --> 43:26.320]  for truth and justice and say no to this because the u n it run by the rothschilds the rockeffellers
[43:26.320 --> 43:32.120]  and others on record that's who paid to set it up who also helped set up israel are are
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.720]  are are are creating this dialectic again where they fund all the different sides and
[43:37.720 --> 43:42.520]  i know i say this probably about three four times a day because it's so important folks
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.560]  full spectrum dominance is where the globalists try to fund all the sides and then out of
[43:48.560 --> 43:54.720]  the crisis consolidate more power and it's so obvious what's happening here and people
[43:54.720 --> 43:58.160]  in israel should be asking the same question americans are asking and people in the uk are
[43:58.160 --> 44:02.960]  asking and the good news is that's now happening you can pull up the articles you know does
[44:02.960 --> 44:08.600]  obama know he's funding al qaeda in syria and ran paul and ron paul are bringing it
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.960]  up and we're bringing it up at info wars dot com and drudge report dot com is bringing
[44:12.960 --> 44:22.960]  it up so we're forcing an across the board major debate about this folks and so we need
[44:22.960 --> 44:28.920]  to continue but i i i really want to see a bigger debate in israel on this in fact maybe
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.840]  next hour i should open the phones up for people that are in syria or who are in israel
[44:33.840 --> 44:39.560]  or who are in jordan or in iraq or in egypt to give us your take on this paradox because
[44:39.560 --> 44:44.040]  it's not really a paradox once you understand the arms makers the big banks the security
[44:44.040 --> 44:49.200]  complex that's consolidating the world economy right now needs big wars to bring in world
[44:49.200 --> 44:55.680]  government closing comments paul watson well i mean we got to remember that the people who
[44:55.680 --> 44:59.920]  are going to be dying as a result of these wars however limited are going to be civilians
[44:59.920 --> 45:03.960]  they're also going to be troops they're going to be syrian troops but they've got brothers
[45:03.960 --> 45:09.920]  sisters mothers and fathers they've got children so it's not just about you know toppling Assad
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.280]  it's about the fact that more people are going to die in fact there was an academic study
[45:14.280 --> 45:20.760]  came out a couple of days ago that showed military interventions on behalf of rebel factions
[45:20.760 --> 45:26.320]  increase civilian deaths by 40 percent and then you've only got to look at what happened
[45:26.320 --> 45:32.000]  in libya two years ago again same thing sending the al-qaeda terrorist topple gadafi libya
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.120]  now their economy has collapsed it was a complete hellhole run by jihadist gangs putting black
[45:38.120 --> 45:43.000]  people in concentration camps torturing them to death this doesn't work it's never worked
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.360]  and it's not going to work now so because it's not meant to work it's meant to wreck
[45:46.360 --> 45:50.160]  things and take them over paul watson great job we will talk to you soon my friend

[54:18.160 --> 54:29.600]  well i think getting to the truth of it and that's what we're not getting to
[54:30.160 --> 54:36.320]  because when saddam hussein used the gases some of the products were bought from us and he was
[54:36.320 --> 54:41.840]  still our ally so you can't ignore that no i don't i think it's a false flag i think really
[54:41.840 --> 54:47.520]  indeed and nobody knows if if indeed he was slaughtering people by the thousands uh you
[54:47.520 --> 54:52.160]  know with poison gas you know that's a different story but that isn't the case matter of fact
[54:52.160 --> 54:57.920]  a hundred thousand deaths of the case and it's not you know the implication is that a sod
[54:57.920 --> 55:02.960]  committed a hundred thousand killings there are a lot of factional there why don't we ask
[55:02.960 --> 55:08.080]  you know about the al-qaeda why are we on the side of the al-qaeda right now so i think the web
[55:08.080 --> 55:12.880]  they want the weapons the weapons the rebels want the weapons there's a bunch of people and they
[55:12.880 --> 55:17.680]  all kind of part of it and this is the test for we're gonna play that full clip come out the next
[55:17.680 --> 55:26.240]  hour and then send in but uh there you go there is ron paul talking about a false flag
[55:27.760 --> 55:31.760]  and we're joined for this segment and a little bit of the nexus he's about to get him an airplane
[55:31.760 --> 55:38.160]  by the editor of world affairs brief great geopolitical mind joel scowles and joel what is
[55:38.160 --> 55:42.400]  your breakdown on what's really happening do you think there's going to be a limited strike attack
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.160]  will it be bigger and what do you think will come out of it or will there not be a strike
[55:46.160 --> 55:50.960]  and do you think this is a false flag with the rebels well it's definitely a false flag with
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.800]  the rebels to alex there is no way that a sod knowing that the u.s is just itching for an excuse
[55:56.800 --> 56:04.240]  to invade or to to attack would use a chemical weapon a homebrew one single weapon to kill
[56:04.240 --> 56:09.840]  a few people within his own neighborhood it's just impossible to think that an intelligent
[56:09.840 --> 56:16.480]  rational being would just hand the u.s an excuse this was clearly a homebrew rocket
[56:16.480 --> 56:21.600]  created by the rebels or fed to them by black operations you know there's lots of sources
[56:21.600 --> 56:28.160]  of nerve gas the u.s has around they can manufacture they can you know make it look like a mixture of
[56:28.160 --> 56:35.440]  many others uh this is a dramatic false flag operation justified this now that said i think
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.800]  it's important to realize that the situation is changing dramatically against the united states
[56:40.800 --> 56:46.240]  intent i'm completely convinced they were intending to launch two to three hundred cruise
[56:46.240 --> 56:52.800]  missiles and do a massive strike against this but public support is waning fast congress is
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.320]  getting upset it's a great news that the british parliament just said no to david cameron leaving
[56:58.320 --> 57:03.840]  the u.s hanging out there alone without u.n support you know they're really big as globalist on
[57:03.840 --> 57:10.160]  and getting u.n backing all that god is yes men and nato and the u.s and the u.s people simply
[57:10.160 --> 57:16.080]  aren't buying it i have said this whole week and i want to see if you agree with me that this shows
[57:16.080 --> 57:20.960]  one of the biggest collapses in the new world order anglo-american establishments propaganda
[57:20.960 --> 57:27.680]  fronts it's been over 150 years or almost 200 since since the british parliament ever voted
[57:27.680 --> 57:35.120]  down a war they're calling it absolutely unprecedented and i see this really as a route
[57:35.120 --> 57:40.240]  but it's when the globalists are cornered as you know that they tend to then stage something even
[57:40.240 --> 57:47.760]  bigger yeah this is something they won't take no no to what's the only thing that is up in the
[57:47.760 --> 57:52.720]  air right now is whether or not they'll do a limited strike this weekend before the g20 summit they
[57:52.720 --> 57:58.320]  don't want to be in a full war with uh bladimir poogen having the bully pulpit there at the gm
[57:58.320 --> 58:04.480]  summit in moscow and being able to criticize the us so they've been downplaying this to look for
[58:04.480 --> 58:10.800]  just uh you know maybe a couple of dozen surgical strikes uh this weekend then they would quit for
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.520]  the g20 summit and then they'd hit it full on later on because you see if they hit it too hard
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.040]  Assad thinks that he's bringing back to the wall then he's tempted to start to launch his missiles
[58:21.040 --> 58:27.840]  at uh you know in a use of a lose them type thing with israel i think the propaganda or the diplomatic
[58:27.840 --> 58:33.840]  statements that uh carrie put out today or yesterday that we're not attempting to overthrow
[58:33.840 --> 58:39.360]  Assad big lie they want to stay there stay there carrie speaking now we'll be back

[59:58.720 --> 01:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:28.240]  ladies and gentlemen we're watching the state department's website and it has carry speaking
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.600]  live they're saying but cnn says they have a live feed minutes after there's no carry show show the
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.480]  state department site and then let's flip over uh to cnn to show people what we're talking about
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:45.040]  oh he finally came out so how much that's the state department site then you flip over to cnn
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.800]  and it's not there so they say carry's about to speak but he just came out like three minutes ago
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:57.680]  and started speaking and then that just shows how delayed it is that is bizarre that man i tell you
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:03.440]  cnn is so jacked i mean they are so manipulative wow uh we're going to continue here to try to
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.400]  figure out exactly what's happening jules calzen from world affairs brief the editor over there
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.840]  military man a great political mind in my view that's why we have him joining us i agree with
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.880]  you i think they'll probably do some really small thing to say phase and say see we did something
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.240]  and then ramp it up because that's the drumbeat we've got to do something we've got to do something
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.680]  hundreds of thousands are dying never pointing out the global started this uh but the collapse of
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.960]  confidence in them brazinski's back out again this week saying this he said the alternative media
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:41.040]  is the cause of this and that they're losing control he's hitting the panic button to the cfr
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.240]  what does that signify well they're going to have to manage this uh because the the wave of opposition
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.000]  is growing uh that's why they're going to have to come out with some manufactured false information
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.880]  to justify this to get the people back on board the longer they delay the worse it's going to be
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.960]  before i get on this plane let me just get in this very important point though i think
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.880]  glenn beck is wrong this is not going to run into world war three russia's giving every sign
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.160]  labrov said we are not going to attack anyone meaning we're not going to war green light to
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:22.000]  the u.s to kick us out they're posturing appearing to uh you know make a play but if they wanted to
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.760]  stop the rush the u.s from going into israel they just had to simply put two fighter squadrons into
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.480]  the syrian air bases and they wouldn't touch them and they're not doing that shows russia's not serious
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:40.480]  about defending syria uh they're russia and china not ready to go to war this may well
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.160]  and very probably will turn in the big middle east war that i've been predicting because if
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.680]  Assad is forced to retaliate with everything he's got aran will join him then israel gets
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.720]  and us gets to attack aran without having to provoke it with the first strike as aran as
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.120]  israel was planning to do what you said they've always been trying to sucker them into this
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.160]  but how can they morally attack countries and then they defend themselves and sell water wars
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:13.360]  i guess this is just a total uh position where america becomes the bad guy well this is a total
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.520]  propaganda blitz i was cringing on what i listened to npr yesterday moralized them just lied true
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:27.600]  tea said obama's got himself into a box uh he's put a red line down he left theory attack uh
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:34.080]  with chemical weapons earlier this year and he did it again i mean she lied both times the u.s
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.600]  cleared theory on the first attack and said it was the rebels we need to do a bald-faced lie like
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.680]  that is just incredible amazing uh we've only got a minute left y'all let you get on that plane
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.360]  if there is a limited strike when do you expect to take place saturday or sunday after the un
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.280]  inspectors are pulled well you know even that is a little bit chancey now because of the fact that
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:03.280]  everybody's demanding in congress that you wait for the un obama may be forced to wait
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:10.000]  and so uh i would give it only a 50 50 chance but if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen probably
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.240]  sunday or monday try to clear out could go into tuesday if they want it over with for uh the
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:22.160]  wednesday summit start joel scowles in world affairs brief thank you so much for spending
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:30.080]  time with us in closing um uh it does this signal a major reversal though of the uh globalist element
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:38.240]  of the new world order not a reversal they're really powerful okay so it's something they've
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.440]  got to manage all right we'll uh we'll talk to you very soon thank you joel thank you all right

[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:27.760]  from austin texas alex jones ladies and gentlemen one big shine that you're living in an authoritarian
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.920]  country is if you have government involved in domestic propaganda government involved funding
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:41.520]  private media and private media basically becomes covert state-run media just having state-run
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:47.360]  media is a really bad sign but when it's covert state-run media where there's supposedly groups
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.920]  that are independent but they're not you know you're in trouble and cnn because i've been there
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.320]  multiple times over the years in different parts of the country but mainly in new york
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:06.640]  and and other cable networks are moving towards having nothing live basically and more than 10
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:14.240]  minutes before kerry went out on cnn and we have both the feeds more than 10 minutes before they
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.520]  were saying live they had live on the screen showing the reporters sitting there waiting
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.440]  for him to come out and speak at the state department he was on the state department
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:30.240]  website streaming live it said live and i said this must be a mistake same blue tie same speech
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:37.280]  we have it let's let's let's go to the feed of him 10 minutes separate so if you're watching on tv
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:45.200]  right now we have kerry kerry up in the left-hand top corner uh at the state department feed and
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.880]  you have him on cnn 10 minutes separate can we fade them both up with both feeds so they can
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.680]  hear the him talking over himself not a scratch not a travel this is about a cut not a concern
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:07.280]  because we draw a rose of death lined up in burial shrouds the white linen unstained by a single drop
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.520]  of blood this is state department instead of being tucked safely in their beds at home we are the
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:21.200]  united states of america we are the country that is tried not always successfully okay now let's go
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.600]  to the singing and fade massage gas and surrounded by parents and grandparents who had suffered the
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:38.160]  same fate the united states government now knows that at least 1429 syrians were killed in this
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:48.000]  attack including at least 426 children even the first responders the doctors nurses and
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.240]  all right fade that down for a minute so john kerry is is is 10 minutes separated not not 30
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.960]  seconds or a minute or whatever not the internet lagging you would think the internet would be
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:08.640]  behind okay no this is 10 minute separation that's what they're doing now to make sure nothing goes
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:15.840]  out that they don't want out showing that there's actually concern in the power structure that kerry
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.440]  may say something they don't want put out there and that there's different competing factions
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:31.040]  and i was told that by insiders earlier in the week and it was dr corcy that also on the show
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.760]  talked about seeing his speech and that it appeared he'd had his wings clipped and of course he has
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.200]  amazing sources so i'm telling you when they delay the secretary of state because in media you want
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:47.120]  to have the feed live the first feed they always carry cabinet head speeches live the president
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:55.280]  speeches live to have him delayed 10 minutes on cnn is unbelievable and something is going on here
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.640]  and by the way i have seen myself live multiple times but i've seen the tapes of it on youtube
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.640]  many times we're on c-span if someone goes i'm bringing up classified info the fema camps
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:13.280]  well you know there's three trillion missing from the pentagon and we've been told not to
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.000]  it it'll literally they will cut the feed ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.720]  that's why they have the eas alert system which they now admit controls all radio all tv all
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:33.280]  internet they're forcing obama text onto my dad's cell phone onto my cell phone into my dad's email
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:39.840]  he didn't sign up for it uh in local government's doing it scaring people turning their phones on it
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.800]  three a.m. and l.a. to give them alerts this is the big brother control system and i've got my
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.600]  reporters over there writing notes on what he's saying a transcript will be out soon but basically
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.760]  they're getting ready to bring out another fake dossier that's what they're publishing with the
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:01.360]  exact number of dead all their cooked up witnesses to say what happened and it looks like they may
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:07.840]  go ahead with a limited bombardment that's what it's leaning towards with cruise missiles of a side
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:14.640]  as a political diversion from nsa gate irs gate persecution of the tea party gate persecution of
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.960]  the pro-life group gate telling them what to pray and they can't protest for babies that's
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:26.320]  mainstream news fast and furious been gauzy all the cylindra energy scams all the incredible
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.520]  corruption the white house trying to start race wars all these scandals his imploding
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.800]  approval ratings the fact that obama shipped the jobs to china using taxpayer money to pay for it
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:42.560]  the fact they're shutting down our power plants the fact that obama care raises taxes on people
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:49.280]  it was 30 000 or more now it's 20 000 or more and uh and and increases the prices doubling and
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:58.480]  on and on and on they need this political diversion and we've got the secretary of state here you know
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.200]  fade him up and i'll talk over him with his with his baloney pieces let's go to the state department
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:08.240]  piece uh where he's just longing for peace yeah does not necessarily bring it about
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:16.080]  and history would judge us all see extraordinarily harsh peace if we turn to blind eye to a
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.200]  dictator's wanton use of weapons of mass destruction now it's all against all warnings
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:29.920]  against all common understanding of decency these things we do know we also know that we
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.400]  have a president who does what he says that he will do oh really and he has said very clearly
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.760]  that whatever decision he makes in syria it will bear no resemblance to afghanistan
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:48.400]  iraq or even livia that means it will not involve any boots on the ground only does his
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:55.520]  lie it will not be open-ended and it will not assume responsibility for civil war that is
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:59.200]  already well underway there's already commandos in the country for two years the president has
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.640]  been clear any action that he might decide to take will be limited and tailored response
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.120]  to i turn it down for a minute that i the reason they faded it up is right before
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.560]  or he said that he said that you know the u n can't galvanize action obama will have to
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:22.240]  so again when the u n won't do what they want because of the russia china vetoes then they
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.160]  flip back and say well we'll do it and then congress says no you got to come to us to do it
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.480]  and they say well we don't need you either i mean why do we need anything then if we have obama
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.920]  i mean he can just he can just make all the decisions that's what i'm telling you this
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.360]  transformation is about the executive not even obama but the executive becoming a dictatorship
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.640]  becoming a dictatorial that's what dictatorship means they do what they want without checks and
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:50.000]  balances now let's go back to 10 minutes earlier let's go back to cnn where they're 10 minutes
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  earlier because they're delaying it here it is we're a thug and a murderer like bashar alasad
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.480]  can gas thousands of his own you go back to the future here even after the united states and our
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:09.360]  allies said no and then the world does nothing about it there will be no end to the test of our
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:16.080]  resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.240]  this matters oh hold on he just walked off go back to the state department's borders go back
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.000]  to the state department uh he's just walked away like all the reporters are leaving
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.800]  look the state department video just closed and now let's time it let's time it from 12
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:43.440]  from 12 16 it's 35 now but it was about 12 16 20 when the doors closed 12 16 20 let's go back
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:51.040]  to cnn now and see how long they had it delayed let's go back to cnn was stopped from those weapons
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:58.640]  current or future use well will they remember that the world stood aside and created impunity
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.560]  so our concern is that we let you do this you have impunity about some far off land
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.680]  oceans away this is hitler type stuff that's not what this is about our concern with the cause of
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.080]  the defense when you go around attacking a bunch of countries for no reason choices for you stir up
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.560]  rebellions in them and then invade them that's what hitler did all over europe and our interests in the
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:28.800]  world in danzig it is also profound in toland about who we are in the united states of america
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.320]  no we're not we're globalist running world order commander's tried not all in austria and then
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:40.720]  everywhere that it died to honor a set of universal values around which we have organized
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:46.480]  our universal values and our aspirations occasion five-year-olds under federal mandate out of our
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.600]  conscience how to have this crime against came a state on air this crime against the most fundamental

[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:03.040]  this matters to us and it matters to matter to you you've got the moral high ground matters to
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:08.160]  where we are we've got to do this we had to put al-qaeda in there two and a half years ago
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:14.240]  we had to do this we're the good guys here if nothing is done it matters if the world that's

[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:09.120]  you know i thought i was living in the twilight zone one of the guys that rewound the dvr like
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.480]  10 minutes to show a clip where they were saying there have been new chemical attacks and that's
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.800]  why it was super delayed it was still delayed a couple minutes which is weird but so it wasn't
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.680]  completely live but it wasn't 10 minutes separate from it but chris jordan was writing down notes
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.720]  as my other reporters were a while i was talking over carry and i've got my reporters in there
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.680]  with a transcript now doing stories on it but there's all sorts of contradictions doctors without
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:38.160]  borders on their side is saying 300 something dead carry is saying 1400 close to 1400 so we're
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:44.240]  going to get a story out on that but chris you had some interesting points you wrote down some of
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.640]  the things he said tell folks about that well a couple of the things that he said the main one
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:55.680]  was that uh the un cannot bring the world to act as it should in a situation like this so
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:03.360]  we need to act um regardless of what the un says it also said uh rather carry also said no it said
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.760]  you're right oh that's proper english it it said it's like you're speaking of rachel matt out it
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:14.560]  said you know it said that the un cannot give us any information that we do not already know even
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.240]  though he again verified the fact that we still don't know who used the chemical weapons that we
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.400]  have no positive what else did it say uh that the us makes its own decisions on its own time
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:34.160]  regardless of what the un says well simply amazing and uh what what do you guys make of ron paul coming
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.560]  out and saying he thinks this is a false flag over there and then and then an ap reporter saying i
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.720]  talked to a bunch of the rebels they admit they're the ones doing it world net daily three days ago
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:48.960]  video of the rebels Allah Allah Allah you know open lot and we love you firing it death to Assad
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:54.000]  i mean this is insane and now carry in two different speeches this week says well we don't
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.960]  know who did it well but but then today just in the parts i saw he goes we know Assad did it he's
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.880]  bad but then later he says we don't know who did it and that it's inconsequential and it's
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:11.040]  inconsequential well thank you for that it's it's like rumsfeld uh with all of his double speak but
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:19.840]  even worse we know they're known unknowns knowns but we do not know those unknowns or well however
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.840]  he would tongue twister uh the whole deal let's go ahead and go to this ron paul clip this is up
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.040]  on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com ron paul serial chemical attack a false flag
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.080]  this is a very important story please retweet this put it on your facebook get it out to people
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:44.160]  because the world is waking up to this the british parliament it's been over 200 years it was 1787 i
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:50.160]  think uh is what watson said on air since the last time the british parliament uh voted down a prime
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.280]  minister's request for war authorization but now he's saying well i don't need that then we may
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:02.240]  still strike and the french i meant to ask scousen this when he was on jill scousen why are the french
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:10.720]  warmongering like this why i guess uh their communist leader who's been caught with you know
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:16.320]  swiss bank accounts and stuff with hundred percent taxes on the middle class hundred percent those
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:21.600]  are the socialists because they're all exempt they're all a bunch of bureaucratic pigs and now
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:28.320]  they want to launch a war of humanitarian action why don't we give them all peace prizes let's give
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.440]  the al-qaeda forces peace prizes that are burning down churches i shouldn't joke about it they probably
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:39.520]  will why don't they put the nobel peace prize symbol on the bombs on the cruise missiles
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.640]  because this is you know war is peace care even said that he said you know sometimes we just can't
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:52.800]  hope for peace we've got to do this for peace that is war is peace 1984 unbelievable let's
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:59.840]  go to ron paul talking about false flags well i think getting to the truth of it and that's what
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.320]  we're not getting to because when saddam hussein used the gases some of the products were bought
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:12.320]  from us and he was still our ally so you can't ignore that no i don't i think it's a false flag i
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:18.160]  think really indeed and nobody knows if indeed he was slaughtering people by the thousands
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:22.800]  you know with poison gas you know that's a different story but that isn't the case
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.840]  matter of fact a hundred thousand deaths of the case and it's not you know the implication is
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:33.520]  that a sod committed a hundred thousand killings there are a lot of factions out there why don't
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.800]  we ask you know about the al-qaeda why are we on the side of the al-qaeda god i love that man so i
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.520]  think the way i love that the weapons the weapons the rebels want the weapons there's a bunch of
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.920]  people in there that's part of it yeah al-qaeda 60 percent of it and and and by the way conservatively
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:57.200]  ron effector even more now ron paul is always conservative the hundred thousand number is
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:03.280]  over a year old last time i checked i think it's i think some estimates are approaching 200 000
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.360]  dead and and most estimates they've got studies we had some of them on the air a few days ago
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.520]  uh that are being put up by independent uh groups that most of it is the al-qaeda force is doing it
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.560]  i mean the army is fighting jihadis pouring in from all sides they've been backing them off
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.320]  and then obama goes if there's nerve gas i'll attack and then these nerve gas attacks start
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.480]  and then the jihadis are so arrogant they shoot the video of themselves doing it i want to get
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.760]  your take on this if you're in the middle east so i'm going to get the general phone number i

[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:26.160]  info wars dot com again red link at the top ron paul syrian chemical attack a false flag
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.880]  uh also another report paul wassen put out a shocking story that could derail attack on syria
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:38.640]  will the mainstream media ignore a story that could derail the march to war and that is the
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.440]  story put out by ap reporter um talking to people on the ground that the chemical attack was launched
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:49.360]  by the rebels yep world that daily got the videos of it four days ago folks a child taken because dad
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:54.880]  read a gun magazine i'm not kidding that's actually confirmed in court documents can read that article
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:01.840]  the persecution and purge of gun owners accelerates uh individual morality is the last firewall against
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.080]  psychopathic takeover daniel taylor wrote a great article that basically mirrors what i was saying
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:11.840]  here yesterday uh so liberty minds think alike again there's the article i mentioned rebels had
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:17.680]  met responsibility for chemical weapons attack 25 quotes about the coming war was syria that every
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:26.880]  american should see uh also and we have reports uh ron paul why are we on the side of al-qaeda in syria
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:33.760]  we already played that clip uh so that is just some uh of the news and information and again we
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:38.800]  we have loaded flooded phone lines just keep calling till we get to you because other people
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.000]  are calling you aren't calling from the middle east so it's hard to get to you you have to go
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.800]  through 10 callers calling in from america before we can get through to people calling from
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.840]  the middle east please folks don't call if you're not in the middle east okay i know we don't screen

[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.200]  i hope that there isn't a strike this weekend and i hope things don't get out of hand
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  but this is definitely a dangerous road we're going down it's a miracle we haven't had a
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:14.160]  nuclear war a bio war a chemical war on a wide scale yet uh and people think because it hasn't
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.240]  happened yet it isn't going to happen let me tell you tyranny has happened in places in china
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:26.080]  where some estimates mal killed over 80 million people uh the ci estimates 64 million uh you know

[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.760]  for the balance of the broadcast interspersed with some other economic and geopolitical and
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:35.200]  globalist news we're going to be breaking down and also the whole immigration reform situation
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:39.600]  but first let's take calls to at least the bottom of the hour to get to a lot of these folks
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:46.320]  we're going to go to uh john and israel on syria then we'll go to amir in iran and then we'll go to
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:54.080]  steven uh in nord dakota just was on an airbase i want to talk about b ones that tie into all this
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:58.480]  yeah that's my word the b ones been going over the middle east uh but john and israel what is
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:07.440]  your take on this whole situation uh how you doing alex good question well uh i can tell you that
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:14.240]  about 60 of us don't have gas masks i can tell you there's about a five hour wait to get a gas mask
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:20.480]  i personally don't have a gas mask but i don't think i can hear you now no no no i'm listening
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:26.320]  to you but so i'm from i'm from the u.s actually and i came here about 15 years ago on vacation
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.040]  and i ended up staying great place great beaches great women great food great everything
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:39.360]  but uh the people um i don't know they're not so nervous i would say not too nervous not overly
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:45.120]  nervous well i guess that's because israel has been in a continual state of some form of war
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:50.640]  since it was founded so i guess i mean is that why people are calm people are calm also the newer
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.480]  generation they're born just like in the states with everything they have the malls they have the
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:59.360]  food they have the brand names they're just spoiled so they feel like they're in a bubble
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.880]  they feel like they're in a bubble you got that right some say because you know his blood is on
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:10.400]  the side of asa that in a way it's good because his blood is against israel but obviously we
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:15.920]  know that the rebels obviously hate us just as much if not more so you know well yeah i mean
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:20.720]  saudi arabia is the big dog and they've got 80 percent of islam behind them being you know the
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:26.560]  place of mecca and being sunnis and so yeah saudi arabia wants to take out iran so they
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:31.680]  want to work israel into that position but i mean hey if there's a nuclear war down the road
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.720]  it doesn't matter how many nukes israel scott or how many iran ash this is not a good idea
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.160]  that's why i'm personally against it and thank goodness for your show and i spread the word
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:47.040]  because of you to as many people as i can i have a prison planet tv membership i drink
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:52.800]  be a young jeffrey product joe wallach all because of you and we love you here and i must say
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:58.240]  you are number one and thank you for everything you do well thank you sir i mean well one nice
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:04.320]  things are i mean is the media over there saying because some israeli papers say the strike saturday
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.120]  they are pulling out peacekeepers saturday i mean what's the what's the word there are people
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:16.720]  expecting a strike a limited strike or no strike people don't really know the truth i think the
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.600]  media here must be obviously state run i think the israelis and the americans must be pretty
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.320]  in cahoots and just about everything you know i don't know what to tell you people don't know
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:30.480]  they know who's going to win it's going to be the weapons sales salesmen and folks and the
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.720]  politicians everywhere that's real complex you got that right my friend all right i appreciate
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:41.120]  you calling me thank you all right let's talk to amir in iran he wants to talk about syria
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:48.240]  amir thanks for calling there's no problem alex is honest to talk to you and i just want to let
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:56.640]  you know like nobody really can call from iran directly i actually live in Austin but i i'm from
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:06.240]  iran and i've been there a few years ago and i'm just i just want to let you know i recently
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:15.520]  watched a video from youtube and if you have a pen to write down this and look look up in youtube
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:23.600]  and find this video it has a really good information you already might watch that but it's called the
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:32.560]  truth about the middle east let me ask you a question let me ask you a question i have been
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.000]  invited many times on press tv out of england but also in iran i've gone a few times but they always
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  call up like 30 minutes before they want me on and that's why i can't ever do it but i'll go on any
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.480]  big tv network and put out the truth you know i've been on japanese british russian you name it
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:53.360]  canadian you know chilean brazilian and i've been criticized for going on iran television but i mean
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:50:01.520]  you're saying people can't call to the us from iran even on ip phones they do call they do call
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:08.480]  but all the call is the monitor and especially if it goes to us and i'm just saying if you
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:16.000]  would take somebody can call directly from them basically most people would call you they live
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:22.720]  in the us or different part of europe they can call but from iran the call would be monitored and
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:31.040]  they definitely would get in trouble by government and that's what most calls most cases is monitored
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.760]  sure sure sure let me ask you real quick let me ask you a question so in iranian limit in austin
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:43.760]  texas what do you think of this whole situation i mean do you think it's going to be bad i recently

[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:50.560]  slaughter of christians and mass it is going to turn out bad one way or another and what this
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:55.600]  is really all about is global domination by financial and corporate interests that want to
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:02.400]  control the entire planet and they're not going to let any number of dead civilians stand in the
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:08.400]  way because after all there's too many people anyway according to their world view and i run into
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.840]  trendies and yuppies will even say well there are too many people well how about you get killed then
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:21.280]  how about your kids die oh no it's not a threat i'll call the police no i'm saying
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:27.520]  how can you be so immoral and i'll tell you why they're not even so much immoral they have never
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:33.600]  lived if someone hasn't been abused if someone hasn't been robbed if someone hasn't had bad
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:36.800]  things happen to them and i'm not saying it's good to have bad things happen to you but it's
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.800]  like what nichi said that which does not kill you only makes you stronger i have noticed that
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:50.240]  sheltered coddled people become incredibly self-centered incredibly arrogant and incredibly
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:58.000]  bloodthirsty and they start thinking of themselves as the establishment when you're not but look at
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.320]  the establishment they're coddled they're insulated they're separated from the people
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.960]  i mean oh my goodness their securities paramount everybody else can just roll over and die well
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:14.480]  you know what when you build a world like that everybody's security gets lost tyrants throughout
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:19.360]  history always set up systems that end up destroying them or their children so the
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.960]  globalist are their own worst enemy ladies and gentlemen i want to go to your phone calls we've
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:33.040]  got a bunch of callers calling in it's open phones now we took some foreign calls 800-259-9231
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.360]  and we'll go to your calls james we have other callers saying this i want to talk about v2
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:44.720]  bombers left missouri yesterday one was leaving montana last week and crash as well i have that
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:49.440]  story here so yeah they're moving those around which that's the type of thing you'd use against the
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:54.240]  russians uh what is your take on this sir and tell folks about those bombers leaving
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:03.120]  yeah the town of belton probably uh about 30 miles from whiteman air force base i'm a
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:09.840]  physician and have a practice near there in about 6 p.m central time yesterday i don't know
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:14.800]  what how many planes would be in a squadron but we seem flying around all the time practicing
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.520]  and usually there's two bombers at the most when they're when they're practicing but at least five
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:25.040]  bombers left yesterday heading east and then my wife called me this morning when i was doing
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:30.720]  rounds and said that she it's an unmistakable engine sound that they have and there appeared
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:36.080]  that there was several more that left this early this morning um there hasn't been any reports of
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.640]  anything on the news that i've heard as of yet but uh there was at least five that i've yeah yeah
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:46.080]  i was called by a family friend i've known uh in west texas were summer stations he said they left
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:52.800]  last week in the early morning about five a.m and woke uh woke him up some others stationed out west
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:57.680]  left last week and one crashed because these things are falling apart they they were crashing
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:01.440]  back in the 80s when they first came out they're a great weapon system when they actually work but
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:06.800]  they're they're i don't get the whole history of the b1 bomber but it's very interesting the large
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:13.840]  batwing fighter medium range bomber uh and it's made for delivering nuclear payloads obviously uh
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:18.640]  and the fact that they're all going east this is pretty serious what do you think's going on total
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:25.200]  mobilization that he i've since he's going in alone he's more likely moving the bombers out
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:29.120]  there since uh we're not having help from the uk and it makes more sense that they would be moving
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.920]  these bombers into a position to to do whatever they need to do you have anything else you'd
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:41.840]  like to add um not just something that's not right about this stay there stay there you are

[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:30.560]  by the way i do this all the time because i'm taking calls i got so much going on
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:37.360]  and then later i hear it and realize i said the opposite sometimes i flip things around i'm no
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:41.760]  weapons expert but i've seen discovery channel shows about it and i was a kid would watch it on
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:47.280]  the news when they would crash and things the b1 bomber is swept wing not bat wing
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:54.480]  and i'm always calling it bat wing instead of swept wing when i know the complete difference the
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:01:00.400]  point is as it goes faster the wings can be brought in to the sides of the aircraft
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:04.400]  and when those things get deployed overseas
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:10.160]  i mean you know it's a serious situation
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:21.520]  and they definitely have been crashing crash landing exploding you name it in the last week
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.880]  in fact b1 bomber crashes in southeast montana cbs news
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:33.760]  perhaps we can pull that article up for folks but they're keeping it very very quiet while
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.120]  they've been having emergency landings of them crashes you name it it's because they've got the whole
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:45.280]  fleet moving to the east coast they've probably left the united states we don't know that because
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:51.200]  that's all secretive and classified and that would be something they would use for a high altitude
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:57.280]  strike on syria and again i'm no weapons expert air force folks can call in if they can get in on
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:04.000]  air but generally if they're just taking a low and medium level type military targets they would use
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.240]  cruise missiles but when they really want to drop big bunker busting bombs say on the top
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:17.440]  military brass or Assad it would be something like a b1 bomber or they would use a b1 bomber
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:24.160]  if they were wanting to drop nukes because that's what it was originally designed for was to race
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:31.200]  over into europe under the radar it was meant to fly low with ground following radar uh and nuke
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:37.200]  the russians so i don't know it's just it's really bad i mean believe me they wouldn't be
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:41.200]  moving those over there if they weren't thinking about using them from all the military people
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.680]  i've talked to and the research i've done with this swept wing fighter and if they're being
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:51.440]  moved over there you can bet the the b2s the stealth bombers are being moved around and we'll
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.360]  get some calls on that but james you wanted to make one other point you said you thought
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:00.560]  something was suspicious when the break cut you off well yeah and these are the b2 bombers and this
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.440]  is the only base in the united states that they're that they're at at whiteman and during the iraq war
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:10.480]  they flew them non-stop uh from from whiteman and it takes about 12 hours to get there so if they
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:15.360]  would have left uh yesterday afternoon it would have gotten there the early morning hours i was
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:19.200]  possibly expecting to strike with them early this morning but maybe they're just moving
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:25.680]  them over there to position them excuse me um but no they absolutely so this is b2 bombers
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:31.360]  this is the b2 but not the b1 it is the b2 stealth bomber that's based at at whiteman yeah because
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:36.000]  i've had b ones on the mind since i heard about them taking off from a base they're at in west
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.880]  texas and then one crashing last week uh in montana so so so you have seen the b2s leaving
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.920]  and in numbers uh larger than they normally do with training and you didn't see them come back
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:53.760]  that is correct uh and it was normal i mean they make a very distinctive sound i've seen them in
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:57.920]  air shows and i'm a i'm a private pilot so i've seen them around and i know the sound that they
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:03.360]  make this is much much uh louder noise that's why i'm shocked that nobody has talked about this on
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:08.160]  the news but they're there i saw at least five of them leave they and i stayed outside watching
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:13.360]  because we would have heard them come back that that many they never came back and maybe they're
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.720]  just doing training missions i i don't know but this it's awfully suspicious that and then then
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.720]  it happened again this morning where they were leaving since my wife said that they were definitely
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:29.280]  leaving they they did not they weren't returning from from their flight and they can fly non-stop
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:36.160]  from from missouri uh to wherever they need to go wow well what do you think's going on what's
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:40.240]  your god tell you i think they've they're moving them over in position either they're expecting
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:46.320]  a war with with russia or possibly as you said to to to uh bomb the heck out of syria uh because
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:50.560]  they can do it from high altitude and with precision without sure anybody even knowing
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:56.160]  sure wow thank you so much for that call uh we're getting a lot of calls about b1s and b2s leaving
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:00.240]  can we do some searches i know you are to see if any of that's in the news we'll be back

[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:35.760]  now about an hour and a half ago if you just joined us the communist network
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:43.520]  seeing in came out and reported that a shot had launched another chemical attack on monday
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:50.080]  that they hadn't told us about we reported on that baloney on wednesday now they're saying
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:56.640]  there's been new chemical attacks today and that's on a bunch of channels i just saw it on
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:01.920]  seeing it out here msnb seeing there they were telling me in the back office it's on fox news
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:11.360]  more us warships arrive in the region another one showed up today obama is set to speak on syria
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.000]  in minutes so he's probably
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:22.080]  he's probably gonna announce they're gonna attack him he'll probably give a sod because it makes
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:30.320]  him look like he's wired up or something you'll probably give a sod two days or something to
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:39.840]  give up and leave if i had to guess uh or there's going to be more action so as soon as l
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:43.040]  president a the dear leader
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:52.960]  as soon as he comes on we will we will go to it so so kerry was there to come out and say we
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:57.040]  know a sod did it then add the proviso i have the transcript right here that we don't know who did it
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:00.320]  that's that new thing they do
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:08.320]  it's so bizarre where they'll have it both ways like we know he did it but we don't know who did
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:13.680]  it but we got to attack him regardless because the war is terrible and people are dying acting
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:18.160]  like a sod killed everybody when it's about the people of that nation that had the west come in
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:25.120]  with foreign rebels to blow the daylights out of every police station every military base every
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:33.440]  mosque that's not suny imagine the shiite mosque the wahhabis are going after them the al qaeda
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:41.200]  wahhabis are going after the minority zoa lasters the jews the christians it is unprecedented and
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:47.040]  then they get up there and talk about moral authority you know i was intended to a rebroadcast
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:51.200]  sunday and everybody's getting edited and put together i was going to tape some stuff for it i
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.560]  don't think that's going to be happening i think we're going to be live this sunday
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:11:00.160]  four to six p.m in fact we just need to go ahead and decide that and i'll be live in here on monday
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.600]  uh regardless with david night riding shotgun with me uh if there's not an attack uh
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:12.560]  i just don't even know anymore i've got so much going on my head i can hardly even think if you
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:18.240]  know what i mean i mean this is outrageous to see them where they can inject rebels into a country
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:24.400]  two and a half years later talk about the disaster as if somebody else did it and then get caught
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:29.920]  as ron paul said on fox news staging false flags video of the jihadis loading the chemicals
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:36.640]  ap reporters saying oh the rebels admit they did it because the rebels are just a bunch of riff raff
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:43.440]  people say well wait i mean al qaeda like loves america and works for the cia the cia opens the
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:48.960]  door for them to come in and gives them the weapons israel does that nato does that saudi arabia
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:52.320]  is really hawn showing it more than anybody else they're they're running the show
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:12:00.320]  so and it's so frustrating to see this happening and then i have one of my friends call me from
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:06.640]  out in west texas where they have the b1 station the old swept wing i was calling a bat wing
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:12.960]  earlier the swept wing fighters the nuclear strike fighters uh or medium-sized bombers not really
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:22.400]  fighters uh and then now we've got reports coming in of up in missouri and areas of the b2 bombers
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:27.680]  taking off i'd like to check that i know we're looking at the chemical weapons news is there any
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:32.240]  news about what's being deployed i mean the british uses reporting fighters and things are
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:40.400]  being deployed to cyprus which is about 95 miles away from the coast of syria and most of the targets
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:46.320]  you got four u.s missile cruisers now they're before we're there yesterday one more arrived today
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:53.760]  you've got massive buildup of us troops in jordan's going back months ago that's a big
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:57.200]  controversy why they won't leave that the jordanians are asking why are they here
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:02.320]  they came in for a drill what there's us troops deployed into the gaza area i mean they're getting
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:08.240]  ready for something big and i hope this doesn't happen all right i said i'd go to your phone calls
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:14.960]  the toll free number to join us if you have seen b2 bombers taking off b1 bombers uh if you have
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:18.640]  family that's deployed over there if you have a breakdown of what you think's going to happen
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:28.160]  the good news is for the first time in over 200 years the british parliament voted down a request
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:35.440]  to authorize war by the prime minister france is running around of course being contrary begging
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:40.880]  for an attack saying they absolutely must have one that's in the news today uh just bizarre behavior
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:50.560]  out of the frogs and then uh you've got uh carry caught lying over and over again uh you've got
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.240]  nine percent approval ratings for this to happen and i guess they've got to launch a war in a way
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.640]  as i feared at the start of the show today because they need to cover up the fact that all of the
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:06.800]  confidence in them is imploding and the dollars on the verge of collapsing because of over printing
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:11.520]  and uh derivatives and and and this war will actually make the dollar go up
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:16.720]  because everybody will rush in trying to prop it up and do it out of fear but
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:21.920]  long term even short term this is a disaster and and at the start of the show i saw the whole
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:26.560]  world turn against this attack and americans wake up and be against it and 150 plus members of
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:31.200]  congress republican and democrat say you can't do this this is unconstitutional you've got to come
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:38.080]  to us and so i'm thinking man this looks like we may not have this nightmare happen but it doesn't
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:46.560]  seem to matter because the new world order wants to do what they want to do and obama is set to speak
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:52.080]  in minutes now sometimes it takes longer but we'll see what happens we're going to follow this
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:57.120]  and on the nightly news tonight seven o'clock central but uh many analysts believe this could
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:05.600]  trigger world war three absolutely incredible and i'm we'll also have to take calls go over the
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:14.240]  transcript of uh the remarks by carrey on syria and again here's the guardian war planes massing
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:19.120]  and cypress's tensions rise i mean this is a serious situation and i believe our callers
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:25.120]  because i have a friend that called me about it in west texas with the with the b ones that's why
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:31.520]  i kept conflating it with the b twos and now we're getting calls saying the same thing
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:38.240]  so we haven't confirmed that yet though let's go to kyle in oma hall then we'll go to pauline
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:42.880]  jack and others uh go ahead you're on the air kyle what's your take on this situation
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:48.320]  god bless you in your broadcast and i pray for your family and everybody involved in telling
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:54.640]  it true it's the big deal um i believe uh just like few years back we did that first uh missile
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:59.840]  defense uh in israel with that to see how we would protect against the missile launched
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:05.200]  anywhere towards any of our troops or our allies so when we move the asian pacific fleet and we
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:10.320]  move all these people over there do we have several of those missile defense set up like that where
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:14.800]  basically we're trying to flex on russia and see if they're gonna try to go all out war against
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:19.840]  that's a good point and not just the patria that's been around for decades over there they've brought
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:26.560]  in the iron dome they've used some of the hezbollah and hamas rocket attacks to try to test it but
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:31.360]  those are so low level it's it's it's it's it's had mixed results according to what i've read
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:36.560]  certainly not a missile technician uh so i'd have to talk to military experts about that but yeah
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:44.320]  look they need a world war or a larger regional war at least to get us out of that well to get
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.040]  everybody to go along with the tyranny and then they may not even have to stage terror attacks if
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:54.480]  they attack iran iran's definitely probably got some sleeper cells and then that'll just be great
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:58.640]  the globalists don't care they're all in armored fortresses anyways so what if we get killed they
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:03.680]  get to grandstand as heroes and once we get in a war they know most americans and europeans
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:07.920]  even if our government starts it we'll get behind it because that's the primitive programming in a
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:12.960]  human that if your chief starts a war it doesn't matter if you agree with it you got to get your
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:17.440]  spear get ready to fight because the enemy's coming but but but the enemy is the people running our
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:22.240]  government and then they use some outside enemy as the pretext to get us to go along with it
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:26.320]  so that's the full spectrum dominance good to hear from me kyle pauline in colorada
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:32.640]  you're on the air go ahead hey alex how's it going pretty good um i just wanted to let you know i
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:39.280]  i drove two hours yesterday to go speak to my congressman congressman polis and ask him specifically
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:45.840]  because i'm in the overpass of colorado here and ask him specifically why it was congress wasn't uh
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:54.720]  you know consulted before uh obama is going to strike syria and he had no uh he had no
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:18:02.880]  reasonable explanation he basically said oh well the past few wars uh congress wasn't wasn't consulted
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:07.840]  yeah so so so that's like saying if the cops busted a serial killer and he said look i killed
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:13.520]  20 people and now you caught me on the 21st it's okay because i did it before they're saying precedent
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:20.080]  exactly now now we get our orders from nato not from not from the bill of rights in the and the
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:27.120]  congress well and the hypocrite hypocrite hypocrisy was handing out a pocket constitution
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:34.960]  that's the front door you know it's just ridiculous well that's that's packaging over reality that's
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:41.520]  form over function that's that's what they do and a large portion of the public does not even know
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:46.640]  what planet they're on and that's why the globalists are going ahead with this but uh you know to
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:53.120]  certain point they just can't get away with everything and i hear you i wonder you know i'm
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:59.200]  confused because they're acting so erratically and now three days now putin hasn't said a word
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:05.520]  what do you think is gonna happen he's backing down and not saying anything now so i'd like to
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:10.080]  know what do you think well i mean here's the deal again there is no russia there is no america
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:15.680]  there is no england there is no japan they're all run by less than 500 corporations that are bigger
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:20.400]  than governments and that are anti-free market and they are sitting back playing the countries
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:25.920]  off against each other russia is full of globalist corporations and other factions and they may have
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:29.600]  even made a deal and i'm not saying this has happened but this is how it works where they're
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:35.440]  going to let them have syria i mean russia could flip and totally join the new world order completely
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:41.360]  tomorrow that's like the the globalists go in as dr roberts talked about a few days ago
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:46.160]  and they hire all the communist officials in china to be corporate officials on their boards
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:54.960]  see it's a corporate infiltration a corporate espionage a corporate takeover a financial world
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:03.120]  government will be right back with more calls and we're waiting for obama's speech there's a huge

[02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:24.240]  and we will go to that as soon as that happens and and to get his announcement it may just be
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.880]  more of a build-up or he may say you know you've got to leave a solder i'm going to hit you in 48
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:34.640]  hours i mean who knows we'll certainly find out soon but you know obama didn't make those decisions
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:41.040]  the foreign banks that run this country did kurt nimo just put up an article carry misrepresent
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:45.360]  syria chemical war dead i just walked into kurt and i said kurt that's a great article you wrote
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:50.400]  but why don't we change the headline to what he originally was talking about having it carry lies
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:25:00.240]  about the number of chemical war dead and then have the sub headline from the doctors without
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:08.160]  borders that doctors without borders said 300 to 400 children died the number they say is 426
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:18.640]  versus the 1429 i mean there it is their report their new report that he's citing says 426 not
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:27.120]  1429 in fact you just basically put a one another digit a one in front of that and again that's all
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:33.120]  a lie too to begin with i mean it's just it's incredible it's incredible to be watching this
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:40.720]  this happened uh carries out here um oh so now carry is correcting himself
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:53.440]  so we're going to be uh going over all of that in fact the way he spun it was he said 426 were
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:26:03.120]  children out of 1429 but the report says that it's 400 something i mean and and that that is even
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:08.320]  arguing about things that don't matter the west started this they've clearly about been behind
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:12.800]  the false flags like ron paul said it's not just alex jones saying this i mean i've got
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:19.040]  major newspapers like the independent saying does obama know he's giving arms al qaeda of course
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:27.760]  they know it's like asking um you know john wane when he was 70 years old john wane did
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:34.960]  you know you've starred in westerns i mean it's just it's just beggars the the mind of what they
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:42.960]  get away with i mean with bush and the wmds it came out that was a certified premeditated fraud
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:47.760]  but but at least he went to congress in the un and they had some fake dossiers or something
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:53.200]  still that set the precedent to invade anybody that has powerful weapons saying only the globalists
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.600]  can have them i mean what a dangerous precedent that is we know what the globalists want for
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:02.880]  this country is obama coming out yet they keep saying a few minutes a few minutes and see how
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:08.800]  these narcissist imperial globalist control our lives where we have to everything's about what are
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:11.920]  they going to do with interest rates what are they going to do with the economy what are they
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:16.880]  going to do with a war in a free nation in a free world you're not supposed to be living moment to
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:22.880]  moment heartbeat to heartbeat breath to breath about what they're doing they want to be the center
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:27.360]  of the universe they want to control everything let's go to zack in california and then we'll
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:32.640]  go to everybody else that's patiently holding uh what's your take on this stuff zack hey it's
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:38.720]  nice to talk to you alex first time caller um i think that uh all the double talks that
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:46.800]  kerry's doing coming back he has to correct his previous statement delay cnn um add that delayed
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:54.080]  the fee from the state department to make sure that nothing's going on it all shows that internally
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.560]  there's a new world border of these elite bankers they are fighting amongst each other and then i
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:06.880]  think that they're they're scrambling for scraps on the table right now and they don't realize in
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:16.320]  their own arrogance that they are going to slit their own throat what's your take on that look i
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:25.920]  just think the whole thing is is one giant mess and i i think they don't know exactly what they're
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:29.520]  going to do i mean they may have just made the decision they thought they could just sell this
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:34.240]  and play the part of heroes and launch their operation what do you think about what you just
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:41.200]  said well there is a there was a comment a caller a guest made recently that said there is no real
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:47.600]  policy that every action that's taken outside of the state is a reaction to some kind of internal
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:54.320]  turmoil and um i think that the fighting that they're constantly building push constantly in the
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:29:01.440]  and every corner they're getting shut down they cannot win for losing right now and uh approval
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:10.960]  rate of the u.s people um and how stab that is and uh the the british government and how parliament
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:18.320]  has been you know the u.s not allowing it with that vetoes from russia and china but um i think
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:23.600]  these people have built an empire on stand and it's crumbling in front of us and and this is their
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:30.320]  most dangerous time because they're willing to do anything to make their their jack i a hundred
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:36.160]  percent agree with what you said absolutely i mean i in my gut i can feel the danger and i can
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:45.040]  intellectually geopolitically see that the danger is there i can close my eyes you know if i wasn't
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:49.680]  politically aware and you can just feel the danger we'll be back with more calls straight
[02:29:49.680 --> 02:30:02.000]  ahead we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network are we choosing

[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:46.640]  if this is spelled right mutica am i pronouncing that right uh from texas go ahead
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:58.640]  you know i did yeah anyway um i had a few things uh it's the first time i've ever called you but um
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:06.880]  a few things i'm a local austin musician but i heard this morning on the power first of all the
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:15.440]  only way to conquer this darkness is with the light and not to shot not to hide underneath a table
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:23.120]  and tomorrow there's going to be an anti war in syria rally downtown starting at 10 o'clock at the
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:34.240]  capital grounds so i encourage everyone to go down and rally against this for one thing for another
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:40.000]  thing you know there's several prophecies in the bible that speak of this time very specifically
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:47.200]  and uh it just all is them preparing for their false messiah and the greatest deception of
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:54.240]  peace that ever will come so we need to wake up america and repent and get on our knees and
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:03.200]  stand for the truth i agree with you i agree this is shadows and and and the foretaste of biblical
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:07.200]  things in the future but a lot of people are using that as a cop out they're saying jesus
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:11.280]  is about to come back before it all happened so when the antichrist shows up they're going to
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:16.960]  think he is the christ which is the great delusion they're given uh but uh but but but even if you
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:21.600]  don't believe in all that this is dangerous for everybody good to hear from you i appreciate you
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:28.320]  calling oh you want to say something else go ahead yeah just on a funny or uh take it at for
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:33.520]  what it's worth weird kind of note uh this morning on the power hour this lady called in and she was
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:40.560]  talking about the numbers of the days of the year and august 31st is the 243rd day and if you
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:50.320]  divide that by 365 point whatever two four three five six whatever it allegedly comes out to 666
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:56.000]  so she thinks that on tomorrow there's going to be some kind of attack but i would say like
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  if that is at all true that maybe it would be more like on their calendar which the Sabbath
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:07.760]  and tomorrow would start today at six so maybe tonight at midnight well i'll say this i'll say
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:11.920]  this i don't follow all the numerology and i appreciate your call but the globalists are into
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:17.040]  it and they're weird right and they're always doing things yes good to talk to you we're going to
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:25.920]  move along now uh to logan logan you're on the air you say you're a b one b uh bomber technician
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:30.160]  and i was hearing those are going to be retired but then they've been flying them out
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:36.480]  east and one crash last week uh what word do you have on b1 bombers or b2 bombers being moved
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:43.600]  into the european theater well alex i can tell you that they've been saying for a long time
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:48.400]  they're going to get rid of the b1 but time and time again it proves to be one of the best bombers
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:54.160]  we actually have it almost even how performs the b2 which is a much newer plane i mean the
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:38:01.120]  radar cross sections are insanely small for such a huge plane goes ridiculously fast i mean it's
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.440]  faster than i tell you you look up it'll say it goes just above month one i can tell you
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:09.920]  that that's false it goes much faster than that sure real speeds are always classified like they
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:15.360]  say aircraft carriers go 40 knots and the word is some of them go 100 if you can believe it but go
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:20.640]  ahead right but i will tell you they were going to close down the base i was working at uh a few
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:25.040]  years ago and it comes up every so often but they use those for operation odyssey dawn if you remember
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:32.560]  that one in libya now they flew directly from the continental united states over to libya bomb
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:38.320]  came right back without landing unprecedented i mean that's a long flight outperformed everything
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:43.760]  i mean it was ridiculous and after that they they realized the brass said this is a plane we need to
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:49.760]  use the radar you you can't you don't pick this thing up on radar unless they want you to see it
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:54.640]  but that's what it comes down to you you cannot i've worked in the radar systems there even for
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:39:00.640]  being seven you know from the 1970s radar today has a lot of problems it they're still here in
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:05.840]  22 now is that because it didn't really have a lot of stealth attributes like the b2 right because
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:13.760]  it flies low or are you saying it has stealth capabilities when it's flying high both wow
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:19.920]  it it's all about radar just scrambling signals you know giving erroneous signal oh i get it you're
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:24.960]  saying it's got radar jammers on it and false signals okay i get that yeah that's that's
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:29.760]  baby stuff compared to what this thing has this thing can fry radar systems
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:37.280]  just flying around it can fly other fly other planes radar systems as long as it's close enough
[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:45.600]  yeah this thing is a power plant of just military ability and if you have any other
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:49.760]  questions i'd be happy to answer them no no no that's very interesting i mean what do you think
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:53.680]  about the word that they're all being moved to the we don't know they left the us i'm sure they did
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:40:00.640]  that they're being moved out to the east coast b1s and b2s well they would move them down to the
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.480]  gang the georgia international guard that's what they run out of on the east coast i was in the
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:09.600]  the middle of the continent there's flying out there they'll fly them into one of the bases out
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:14.960]  there uh in the middle east probably in iraq or afghanistan do some quick maintenance on you
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:20.960]  know tighten the bolts some screws and then fly them right out there run them ops run them right
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:28.800]  back before anyone could even button their pants up it they're quick they're quiet their payloads
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:34.640]  are very large compared to any other planet size yeah well would they be using that for would they
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:39.360]  be using that to take out the military command and bunkers and a sod because i mean it's either
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:46.160]  that or nukes right oh yeah i'm this plane is nuclear capable i mean that's one but yes they
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:53.280]  could easily take out entire city probably entire city blocks if you had four or five of them you
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:59.840]  could take out half a city with just one maybe two passes this thing is a very intense piece of
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:05.120]  equipment that people really don't know about and i just heard you talking about i figured i get my
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:09.760]  input sure i was just bumbling around what i've seen on discovery channel and stuff they had four
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:15.200]  that you live before had one fly over with its wings out and it turned over the city and started
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:19.920]  sweeping them back and what turned on its afterburners and blasted off it is a really neat looking plane
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:24.880]  uh but it's in the hands of the new world order so i appreciate your call we're still waiting for
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:30.880]  obama as his lordship seeing is like obama to speak in minutes it's like carry this week spoke
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:35.040]  like 30 minutes after they said he was we'll continue to track it all here live on the radio
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:42.400]  folks uh mike and canada what's your take on the situation sir yeah how are you doing pretty good
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:50.640]  um my first time calling um thank you for calling talk right into your telephone for me
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:42:00.240]  i am okay can you hear me better now yes sir go ahead okay my question is um is there any way the
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:06.000]  military can actually like stand down on their own without you know just going out there and
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:11.040]  killing people just like that like i used to think that people people should have morals
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:16.720]  you know like when they say go do something and you see that it's not right you should be able to
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:23.520]  say okay you know what at least ask questions or something because um all indication is saying
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:29.360]  that this is a false flag ron paul came out and said it there's a bunch of videos on youtube
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:34.480]  pointing out that it is not right to go into syria and still they're pushing forward for that
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:40.320]  and it's because they need a political diversion and they want to take over every sovereign nation
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:44.880]  whether that country be good bad or indifferent and i appreciate your calls her great question
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:55.760]  morally the soldiers i'm sorry go ahead okay and and because i'm i'm just thinking because
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:01.280]  really i think the congress has to give the authority for them to go into war
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:07.120]  and if they don't get that authority then the military should at least ask questions because
[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:13.440]  this is about human beings right people neglect the fact that uh when you go to war you actually
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:19.040]  hurt people i mean he's being sold so much the news that when you hear like a thousand people
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:24.640]  is dead like a thousand people just died yesterday it doesn't really make any sense anymore like people
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:30.080]  don't see like i remember back in the days when you hear like ten people died it's like you get this
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:35.200]  cold chills down your spine like ten people just lost their lives now you can hear like a thousand
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:41.440]  people just died yesterday that's right nothing folks have been desensitized they've been desensitized
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:49.040]  playing it like it's it's it's normal now and that is why uh the military these are individuals
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:56.720]  like these are young kids like 21 22 and they are going in there to hurt people and i have a
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:01.920]  i have a family member in the marines special in afghanistan right now and i usually ask them
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:08.720]  what do you think i mean when you go out there how do you feel and it's basically like everybody
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:16.160]  just have the same feeling like um it's just a game kind of they just switched to this mode
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:21.520]  where the whole of being of being a human being has been taken out of them and they just feel like
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:28.080]  machines carrying out orders now i think that should be brought back because this is human
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:33.920]  lives we're talking about and they should think about that anytime they want to go out and general
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:40.000]  mike i hear you and i appreciate your call thank you so much um again the point you make is central
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.160]  to everything the military is compartmentalized and they're given these manuals to follow the
[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:52.000]  constitution the bill of rights that explain their duties and up until really even the 80s it said
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:57.840]  don't follow illegal orders hear examples they don't really have those anymore or they have
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:03.040]  more like a synopsis instead the manuals are all about how george washington's bad i'm not
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:09.520]  joking if you're a new listener this came out last weekend if you're a gun owner if you believe
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:14.640]  in small government or want to make the world a better place that's a quote that's a quote i'm
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:20.000]  not joking this sounds this sounds absurd as it sounds like i'm being satirical i'm not
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.880]  that you're a bad person and they do that to find out if you're a good person so they can drum you
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:32.240]  out so they can get rid of you they want either really stupid people or psychopathic people
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:36.240]  or mercenary types it'll do whatever they're told they want that across the board and you feel like
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:41.520]  they're part of the winning team and love the status and the glitz they believe in the sexiness of
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:47.520]  being an enforcer okay whether you're a corporate enforcer or a police enforcer whatever the case
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:55.360]  is that's what they're converting over to in a propaganda state an absolute total propaganda
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:01.040]  state now if you go back 15 years ago or more there were multiple cases of where they try to
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:06.000]  give anthrac shots to the troops and it was so deadly it killed a bunch of people and finally
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:11.760]  the doctors it was at one base in colorado it happened everywhere but one base in colorado
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:18.400]  all the major doctors said this is killing people and giving them epilepsy this is really dangerous
[02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:23.680]  whatever's in this port and down anthrac shot we're not giving it and they started court
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:28.960]  marshaling a bunch of them they said good court marshaling it all came out they had to back off
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:33.600]  then they tried it again more people stood up they had to back off again this happened a couple
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:40.880]  times since about 2000 so i guess 13 years or so and it happened previous to that too so i guess
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:47.440]  it's three times so they had to say no they had to the court marshal got started and then the doctors
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:52.720]  in the army in that case there was also some air force doctors they then got still kicked out but
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:58.960]  with an honorable discharge but they saved a lot of people that's because they were the experts
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:03.600]  they medically saw what it was doing they didn't like hurting their fellow members of the military
[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:08.400]  and fellow americans they said no they said fine go ahead and court marshallist the system had to
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:15.600]  back off same thing happened in 2002 with the smallpox shot that was causing an autoimmune
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:20.880]  response and people would have like an asthmatic event who never had it and would turn blue and
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:28.320]  pass out and you'd have to be you know basically tricked to be able to live also others would have
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:33.040]  a heart attack because an autoimmune response in the heart in the ventricles bunch of remember a
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:38.000]  couple reporters took it and had heart attacks and died you young people i mean this is a big deal
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.400]  folks uh and it wasn't just a regular smallpox batch from the 70s it was something really weird
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:48.800]  and you and you're saying what does this have to do with following orders on a war
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:54.320]  or you've got to just say no but people been taught i heard the austin police chief our
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:58.960]  days of aid who want to get back on here this morning on five down a am our local affiliate
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:05.440]  i heard him say word for word the austin police 100 of the time do nothing wrong
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:13.040]  this is a quote they're all good and you better do what they say even if the order is wrong
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:19.440]  or you may be killed now under common law bill of rights constitution all the court rulings
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:24.240]  it's on record that if a cop comes to your house to try to beat your brains out for no reason or
[02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:28.480]  rape you or you know pull over your daughter and make her have sex with you there's all these famous
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:32.960]  cases sitting outside a topless bar pulling over women saying i'm taking a gel for drunk driving if
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:38.080]  you don't have sex with me those cases are all all famous including in austin where i live and here's
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:43.760]  the police chief who comes off real slick with with he had to be trained in propaganda to say this
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:50.080]  our police officers 100 percent of the time are good 100 percent of the time if they shoot someone
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:55.200]  with deadly force it's because they didn't follow an order and whether that order is right or wrong
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:49:02.000]  you better follow it it's like a death threat on air to everybody it was chilling it was it like
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:09.760]  eight eight eight ten this morning him and sergeant sam were on there back we need to call them and
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:14.480]  get that they're nice folks they'll give it to us and i'm not trying to go after the the police
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:20.720]  chief here i don't think he's an evil person his dad was a famous anti-communist gun runner we know
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:25.440]  that we know he worked for then you know clearly probably an intelligence agency i don't know this
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:30.400]  next time i'm in i'm gonna ask him but i've looked more into asa veda and the guys come from nowhere
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:35.680]  to be the police chief over the 10th largest city in the u.s it was 11th it's set to be number 10
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:40.640]  and i mean and i'm listening to this i'm like man this is psyops there's no doubt all that slick
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:45.680]  talk and that charm stuff i'm calling him out i don't think he's a communist he got mad when i
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:51.440]  said that earlier you gotta move back to cuba he is some type of psyop guy because i'm listening to
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:59.120]  this and the way he's delivering it was really slick but really creepy because again i don't
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:03.440]  want to just hate the austin police on average they have been a better police force statistically
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:10.080]  and when i've seen them many other forces but as the city gets bigger and as pressures get bigger
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:14.240]  and as federal training comes in man they're killing people all the time they're acting like
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:22.720]  crazy people some of the special units they've got our thugs are creepy and to say 100 of our
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:29.200]  officers are good people and they always use lethal force properly anybody knows that's bull i
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:35.280]  mean i mean i'll guarantee if i was a cop and i've got a lot of restraint myself in my life
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:39.280]  i'll guarantee i'd probably go you know i don't want that job i i shouldn't be a cop
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:44.320]  i'll tell you right now i don't want to deal with some drunk lady and you know domestic
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:48.480]  dispute and people fighting with each other and stuff i'd probably get i mean you know the whole
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:57.440]  point is don't sit there and say that that the austin police department is 100 perfect i mean that
[02:50:57.440 --> 02:51:04.400]  is literal baloney we'll be back amino acids are the building blocks of proteins amino acids have

[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:26.000]  it uh minutes ago so here is obama's uh bumbling statement uh from a round table meeting with some
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:31.520]  foreign leaders here it is obviously i'm very grateful to have my fellow presidents here as
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:37.440]  well as the vice president before i begin i want to say a few words about the situation in syria
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:45.840]  as you've seen today we've released our unclassified assessment detailing the high confidence
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:52.080]  that the syrian regime carried out a chemical weapons attack that killed well over a thousand
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:58.160]  people i have high confidence you did it scumbag this is ron paul images that shocked us all
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:06.960]  this kind of attack is a challenge to the world we cannot accept a world where women and children
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:14.320]  and innocent civilians are gassed on they cannot accept a world this kind of attack
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:19.440]  threatens our national security interests did you start a war and probably get it well
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:25.440]  instead and i'm sick of these people against the use of chemical weapons by further threatening
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:32.800]  problems allies of ours in the region like israel and turkey and jordan uh and it increases the
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:38.320]  risk that chemical weapons will be used in the future and fall into the hands of terraces
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:47.840]  noise in there against us so i have said before and i meant what i said that the world has an
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:56.480]  obligation to make sure that we maintain the norm against the use of chemical weapons now i have
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:04.960]  not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:17.200]  i have had my military my military look at a wide range of options my military we have an anti-gun
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:25.040]  anti god anti-american anti-free speech piece of trash it's his military with yeah because
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:30.880]  congress didn't consult it i guess it is and i guess it is in no event are we considering
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:37.680]  any kind of military action that would involve boots on the ground an msnbc says your kids belong
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:49.280]  to them too uh but we are looking at the possibility of a limited narrow uh act okay so they're looking
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:54.240]  to do an aspirin factory bombing like obama would do when drudge report exposed what he was doing
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:57:00.560]  with his cigars so uh you know the international community gets caught doing stuff with cigars
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:05.440]  you got to kill a bunch of people at factory make an aspirin both again or blow up some iraq you
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:11.120]  she did that to an operation fox whatever it was uh commitment we're not considering any
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:17.680]  boots on the ground approach chicago mobster runs america is consider options that meet the narrow
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:23.440]  concern around chemical weapons oh the narrow concern this is small it's not a good uh a solely
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:28.880]  military solution to the underlying conflict and tragedy that's taking place that you started with
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:34.640]  brzezinski uh this is the guy who's the front man for the people that started in addition to this
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:42.400]  civil war uh unclassified and he sits up there after he and his team did this grandstanding
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:48.320]  today i mean how much more bold do i have to take that same classified briefing uh to members of
[02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:52.320]  congress uh as well as our international why do they always delay everything they do now
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:56.400]  in case he like turns into a vampire or something to the american people as uh because you know i
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:02.080]  already said wash live underneath the uh the u n building according to msnbc i never said that
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:08.400]  but it's not as well uh president uh i mean look at these idiots look at this more on next to it
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:13.280]  all a bunch of narcissistic control freaks done on them who'd love to destroy the planet that
[02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:17.920]  these countries that they represent all share very deep time i mean look at the war criminal
