[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War, and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:36.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:45.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  I don't care how your face and face is flipping up or rubbing down, Alex Jones was right.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  CNN is not just fake news.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  It's the criminal news network that forces are practicing crime syndicate
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  to openly shut down my media operations and other people's media operations.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  You didn't call me to testify in America, I have a right to fix my accusers.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  And you, Congressman Deutsch, are a liar and a fraud.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  You are a charlatan that goes around lying about people who destroyed the First Amendment.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  I haven't lied about anyone else.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  Yes, you are a congenital liar.
[02:17.000 --> 02:18.000]  Swall as well.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  Why do you hate the First Amendment so much?
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  There goes Congressman Swall as well.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  The American people demand that their First Amendment be a defendant.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with Big Tech.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  And the de-platforming didn't work.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  AlexJonesLive.com
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  Because the future is in your hands.
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.000]  If you think the awakening we've seen so far is big,
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  this planet and the globalists have not seen anything here.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaining your search results.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  Google is evil.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  We now take the challenge, not to censor like you do,
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  but to stand against you and to fight even harder for our birthright that you are trying to steal.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.000]  Remember this.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  You killed your profession by becoming nothing but mercenaries for the globalists
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  and people know that your fate knows many of you.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  Now, with you trying to kill the First Amendment, you're making yourself true villains.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  You've declared war on the First Amendment.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  You've declared war on free speech.
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  Since when are hundreds of doctors unable to have press conferences in America?
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  When they take it off YouTube, they take it off Google, they take it off Twitter, they take it off Facebook.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  There is a giant crackdown that even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  Just like Communist China.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  I'm here to expose this fraud.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  I'm here just like you Congress has here and stopped me.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  I go there and I get in their face and I expose the truth and that's what I'm going to do.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  We had over 40 million subscribers on Apple.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  That was our biggest thing with my three podcasts.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  Those were all banned.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[04:14.000 --> 04:29.000]  The next chapter in Humanities Fight for Liberty starts now at AlexJonesLive.com.
[04:44.000 --> 04:59.000]  It's Friday. We're live. Start your engines.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  Hey, what's up, bone?
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  Hey, McBreen. What's going on, man?
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece?
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  No, I worked hard on that.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  Oh, um, no.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  No, nothing.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  Um, no.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Okay. Thanks anyway.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  Yep. Good luck with that project, though.
[05:48.000 --> 06:12.000]  Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:12.000 --> 06:21.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  There are tens of thousands of satellites in orbit around the Earth.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  Many of them secret.
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  Elon Musk wants to put 50,000 in orbit.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  He's already put thousands.
[06:35.000 --> 06:44.000]  There's artificial rings forming around the Earth of space junk going back into the early 1960s.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  I'm an expert on this.
[06:46.000 --> 06:54.000]  I've studied it in depth, and I can tell you exactly what's going on with this Chinese balloon.
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.000]  And we've warned about this for many, many years, and this is extremely serious.
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  Why would they be surveilling the missile sites in Montana and Wyoming with a balloon when the satellites are far better?
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  That's not what a balloon like that is for.
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  And I can tell you if you look at the array and how large it is and the solar panels dangling from the bottom,
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  that is a gigantic balloon.
[07:21.000 --> 07:31.000]  Now, studying plans by Alexander Haig in the 1980s that were proposed to Ronald Reagan and were declassified in the mid-90s,
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  I knew all about these plans because they were public.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  They then got reclassified in all future discussion of it shut down.
[07:39.000 --> 07:48.000]  There are hundreds of U.S. government giant balloons at 100,000 feet and up
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  that you've got to have a telescope to see an extremely clear skies.
[07:54.000 --> 08:02.000]  So the real revolution is not satellites, it's balloons and derogables, blimps, Hindenburgs.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  They don't have hydrogen in them, it's explosive.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  They have helium in them, and they're able to stay aloft for years.
[08:11.000 --> 08:20.000]  Then they land at nighttime at classified bases in Nevada and Arizona and in Texas.
[08:20.000 --> 08:29.000]  When I was 16 and first got my driver's license, I was driving on an overpass late at night in Dallas near the air base,
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  and one was crashing.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Didn't have video cameras in your car then.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  I think my parents had one at home.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  Didn't have cell phones to tape it.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  I remember seeing a giant blimp partially collapsed in the nighttime sky crashing into the air force base.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  That was kind of my first fascination with it.
[08:49.000 --> 08:58.000]  Then Alexander Haig in 1990 had a cable TV show on a military cable network he launched that had almost no viewers,
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.000]  but I started watching it and in most days it was just him up there for 30 minutes talking about this stuff.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  When I know all this stuff, it's because I saw one crash in Dallas, this big giant blimp coming in slowly,
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  half collapsed at a military base, asked my dad what he thought it was, asked my uncle,
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  and they said that was some type of secret surveillance blimp.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  Whatever it was, it was gigantic.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  Then I remember like 10 years ago, oh, there's a huge spaceship over Salt Lake City.
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  It's two football fields long and folks zoomed in with telephoto lenses and had propellers on it
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  and giant solar panels all over it.
[09:36.000 --> 09:43.000]  So there's a whole revolution going on with this and the Chinese are heavily involved,
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  but I'm going to explain why this is so dangerous.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  Folks are saying, and the senators are saying, and the CIA is saying,
[09:51.000 --> 10:00.000]  that oh my gosh, it's surveilling the launch silos for intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[10:00.000 --> 10:10.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, that is not what the blimp, that is not what the balloon is doing.
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  Satellites can get crystal clear photos and videos.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  They had satellites in the 60s the US did that seen the famous photos where they zoom in in Manhattan
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  with a clear photo shot on a clear day.
[10:24.000 --> 10:31.000]  And you can read the text of what a woman is reading laying on a blanket in a bikini in Central Park
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  and you can lay out a nickel or a penny and read the year date on it.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Now there's many different types of satellites and different types of orbits,
[10:41.000 --> 10:49.000]  but tell everybody you know tune in right now because at the bottom of the hour,
[10:49.000 --> 10:56.000]  I'm going to tell you exactly what's going on with this surveillance device, this balloon,
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  and I'm going to explain why it's so serious.
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.000]  I'm not a physicist, but I study what the physicists say.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  And there is a magnetic field on the earth that blocks out a lot of the solar radiation.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  You think you get a sunburn on a sunny day when people know when you get to the top of a 15 foot thousand mountain,
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  even 20 minutes out the sun can make you even worse because there's less particular up high that's blocking the sun.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  You're getting direct sunlight when you're up at 100,000 feet or more.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  The radiation is extremely toxic to humans, extremely dangerous.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  That's why airline pilots that fly at 35,000 feet for years have so many health problems
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  because you're going to the equivalent of chest X-rays every time you fly.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  That's why so many of the intercontinental flights now are at night.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  It's not so you can sleep while you're flying to London or Australia or wherever you're going.
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.000]  It's because the pilots know and the airlines know that you fly for nine hours in daylight.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  It's the equivalent of dozens of chest X-rays.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  And there's different metrics and different numbers.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  It depends on how clear the skies are because if you condense down 100,000 feet
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  and how much water is in the first 30, 40,000 foot of that,
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  it's equivalent of about 10 feet of water if you condense it together.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  That's a lot of shielding for radiation.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  There's about an inch of dust and dirt, basically rock as well, the first 35,000 feet.
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  So there's a dirt shield, a dust shield, but outside of that there's a magnetic field of the earth that bounces.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  99% it's reported of all the other different types of radiation coming from the sun
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  and also deep space off the earth.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  Or the earth would be an unlivable dead rock.
[12:46.000 --> 12:54.000]  It's our atmosphere that allows the life to live in this very thin layer on the planet.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  If you look at it, most life is in the first 10,000 feet from sea level up and in the ocean.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  And so it's much thinner than the skin of an apple.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  If you think of the earth as an apple, then you've got the magnetic core and then you've got the mantle and you've got the crust.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  It is far thinner, comparatively, than the skin of an apple.
[13:17.000 --> 13:25.000]  And life only lives in very small areas of the overall mass of the earth.
[13:25.000 --> 13:34.000]  That said, again, it is the magnetic field that allows life to take place on this earth and the rest of the atmosphere.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Now why am I laying that out?
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  I said I'd get to the bottom of the hour because I've got a bunch of other news to hit.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  In fact, I'm going to get to it in the last segment of the hour because it's so big.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  But I'm just giving you some background here for folks that don't understand relevant research.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  This is fascinating.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  You've heard a lot about EMPs.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  Electromagnetic pulse weapons.
[13:55.000 --> 14:05.000]  And if you detonate one at the right altitude over the United States, when you have the right atmospherics,
[14:05.000 --> 14:14.000]  it can completely knock out power in many areas and damage power across the entire continent.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  You cannot detonate an EMP in space.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  It'll bounce off the magnetic field.
[14:20.000 --> 14:28.000]  The perfect place to detonate one is 80 to 100,000 feet with a balloon.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  And that's the real danger here.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  And China has said they're at war with us and they've developed powerful EMP weapons.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  Make no mistake, the United States has them.
[14:39.000 --> 14:46.000]  Now you can send them up in a rocket and have them in space and have them go back into orbit and then back into the atmosphere and detonate.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  The problem is that there's a lot of problems with stabilizing or picking the right time.
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  But if you've got a balloon with a bunch of sensors reporting to satellites, it can pick the proper atmospheric time to detonate the weapon.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  A lot of stuff goes into that and a lot of equations.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  But I've just read about it.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  I'm not, again, a physicist or an electrical engineer or all the rest of it.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  But it's a well-known field.
[15:09.000 --> 15:20.000]  So when you've got these blimps and you've got these derivables, you've got these balloons with big high-tech packages flying around, drifting around.
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  And a lot of them have little propellers on the sides, little boosters or thrusters.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  I don't know if this one does because we haven't gotten a shot at the top of it.
[15:30.000 --> 15:42.000]  But regardless, that could very easily be an EMP weapon package or a test package to test an EMP attack.
[15:42.000 --> 15:50.000]  And you can bet your bottom dollar, China's got thousands of them lined up ready to launch and send over the North Pole right into the United States.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  They can detonate them over any targets they want.
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.000]  And with a couple dozen of these, you would guarantee knockout everything above ground in the U.S.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  The cavalry has arrived.
[16:02.000 --> 16:13.000]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart.

[17:00.000 --> 17:06.000]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow M4 Warriors here in the United States and around the world.
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  We are so excited to announce M4Ware's MD.
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  It turns out the top company in the U.S. for supplements is owned by a patriot.
[17:16.000 --> 17:22.000]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support M4Ware's and keep us on the air.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[17:26.000 --> 17:37.000]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands with the highest rated under the M4Ware's label, M4Ware's MD, exclusively at M4WareShore.com.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  Check out the first of 10 new products at M4WareStore.com.
[17:42.000 --> 17:54.000]  Whether it's turmeric or whether it's joint here or whether it is super greens, we have them all at M4WareStore.com under the banner of M4Ware's MD.
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.000]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps M4Ware's on the air, M4Ware's MD.
[18:00.000 --> 18:10.000]  The good news is the real red pill plus after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients are not available, the supply chain right now is finally back in stock in the last month.
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  The bad news is we did a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[18:14.000 --> 18:25.000]  So we're in late January when I'm cutting this, only seven days left to get the real red pill plus with all the key ingredients like pregnant one and more at M4WareStore.com for 50% off.
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  Whether you're older, young, black or white, it doesn't matter. You need to experience real red pill plus.
[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  It's proprietary, it's amazing. I learned about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  We simply made it stronger and we have great reviews from listeners.
[18:41.000 --> 18:47.000]  Get the real red pill plus for a limited time. It's about to end at M4WareStore.com for 50% off.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  You need to try the real red pill plus right now plus it funds the info war.
[18:50.000 --> 18:58.000]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action. Real red pill plus now available at 50% off at infowarstore.com for only a few more days.
[19:20.000 --> 19:27.000]  I love you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[19:27.000 --> 19:35.000]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[19:35.000 --> 19:45.000]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[19:45.000 --> 19:53.000]  You will then be my slave. Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom from copra.
[19:53.000 --> 20:19.000]  We'll move your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[20:23.000 --> 20:34.000]  Alright, in the last second of the hour into the second hour, I'm going to do a detailed analysis of the Chinese weapon platform.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  Now Canada is reporting weapon platforms are above their country as well.
[20:38.000 --> 20:46.000]  The Pentagon knows exactly what these are. China has developed fleets of hundreds of these as their main attack on the US.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  They've talked about it for years. There's mainstream articles going back for years.
[20:50.000 --> 20:58.000]  Dry run balloons called top delivery platform for nuclear EMP attack.
[20:58.000 --> 21:07.000]  And we're talking about a extremely powerful EMP that is powered by a atomic or hydrogen bomb detonation.
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  And it's very easy for them to launch these in northern China within a matter of days.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  They can then be strung out across the United States.
[21:14.000 --> 21:23.000]  And depending on the atmospherics, depending on how powerful the weapons are, just a couple of these would devastate the United States
[21:23.000 --> 21:32.000]  and blow out electrical lines and generators and just cause devastation that makes a winter storm look like a walk in the park.
[21:32.000 --> 21:40.000]  If they hit us with hundreds of these, or even a dozen or so it's estimated, end of civilization as we know it in this area.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  Now obviously the United States has these weapons. The Russians have these weapons.
[21:44.000 --> 21:54.000]  But the fact that they have launched these Chinese balloons over the United States and the fact that the Pentagon is saying they're surveilling our ICBM sites
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  but we can't shoot them down is bull.
[21:58.000 --> 22:06.000]  They're afraid to shoot it down because it might detonate the nuclear EMP payload.
[22:06.000 --> 22:17.000]  So let me explain. China has a gun to our head and we have to just consider the fact and just basically look at this as a weapon.
[22:17.000 --> 22:26.000]  It probably doesn't have an EMP nuke on board, but it's a test and it's a gun to our head to let us know.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  Now I'm speculating there from thousands of data points I have.
[22:29.000 --> 22:38.000]  And if you go back over the years, I've talked about balloons and derogables delivering EMP bombs for 20 years and the media on national news
[22:38.000 --> 22:49.000]  including Colbert and all of them have attacked me and CNN that Jones is crazy and says the Chinese and others have weapon blimps and weapon balloons.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  When it's in the mainline military literature and when I was 16 years old, I saw a damaged one.
[22:55.000 --> 23:04.000]  Anybody knows what a damaged blimp looks like, but it had a bunch of solar panels on top of it and a bunch of stuff hanging off of it, crashing at an Air Force base in Dallas
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  when I was driving by it in the middle of the night, dropping a girlfriend off.
[23:08.000 --> 23:21.000]  So the point is these things are all over the place and routinely the news will be over New York, a giant UFO at 100,000 feet, over Salt Lake City, you've seen the newscast
[23:21.000 --> 23:30.000]  and then amateur astronomers get out with their big telescopes, looked up to a video camera and they show their giant blimps at 80 to 100,000 feet
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  and in some cases they even have US Air Force on the side.
[23:34.000 --> 23:44.000]  So the Pentagon knows about this and it was, again, local news reporters and others that started spotting it and seeing it.
[23:44.000 --> 23:56.000]  So you've got to ask yourself, why is the United States overrun by the New World Order allowing Chinese weapons platforms over us?
[23:56.000 --> 24:04.000]  I mean, look at it this way. If you walk out of a 7-Eleven and somebody walks up to you, well, it looks like a 357 Magnum or a Glock and says,
[24:04.000 --> 24:15.000]  give me your money, I'm going to blow your head off, that's an armed robbery. Whether or not there are 357 cartridges in there or 9-millimeter cartridges in the gun
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.000]  or whether it's a 12-gauge shotgun to your head, whether it's loaded or not, you believe it's loaded.
[24:22.000 --> 24:30.000]  Now, again, everybody's asking, well, why don't they use satellites to spy on the ICBM sites as the media and the government's telling us that's what they're doing.
[24:30.000 --> 24:45.000]  It's not a spy platform. You use satellites for that. But satellites cannot deliver an effective EMP weapon detonated in space because it bounces off the magnetic field.
[24:45.000 --> 24:58.000]  That's why the ionizing radiation and all the different forms of radiation coming in at the poles where the magnetic field is thinner causes the aurora borealis or the northern lights.
[24:58.000 --> 25:09.000]  And that's because you're actually seeing the different types of energy coming in and cooking in our atmosphere.
[25:09.000 --> 25:21.000]  So again, the weapons will bounce off the magnetic field. The perfect place, according to Pentagon estimates, to detonate a nuclear-powered EMP,
[25:21.000 --> 25:32.000]  if you can power one off just a battery, but it's not very powerful, is, it leaves a nuclear detonation to power it, is 80 to 100,000 feet.
[25:32.000 --> 25:41.000]  And there's a shot from the north pole of the aurora borealis from space. And again, that is the amount of radiation pouring in, hitting the atmosphere and interacting with it.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  So I'm going to talk about it at the end of the hour in detail. I've already given you a prelude to it.
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.000]  But this is a big deal with the Russia, Ukraine stuff out of control, and China threatening to launch war against Taiwan.
[25:54.000 --> 26:04.000]  They're already taking over Hong Kong, and all of the scrabbling and running around by our military, this is serious.
[26:04.000 --> 26:14.000]  There's the headline, Russia, China building super EMP bombs for blackout warfare.
[26:14.000 --> 26:25.000]  And I'm done talking about that now. I'm going to get to it in great detail coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  And then I'm going to cover a ton of news and information in this second hour.
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  And we'll take specifically calls on this weapons platform, not surveillance platform.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  Sure, it's testing a dry run for an EMP attack. You can bet your bottom dollar.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  We know that's one of their main weapons programs. But is it loaded? Is it not loaded? We have to consider it's loaded.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  It is a weapon platform. It's pointed at us. Is it loaded? We don't know.
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  But that's what that is. And that's what they're doing.
[26:55.000 --> 27:07.000]  And that's the reason it's doing an attack run over the United States from the North Pole, right down over Canada, right down over the United States.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  And that's why Canada reports more are coming.
[27:11.000 --> 27:28.000]  So it comes in over Montana. It goes through South Dakota. It goes through Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, right over North Carolina.
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  And Canada reports another one is on the same track coming right down over us.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  All right, I'm done talking about it for now. I'm going to go over it all.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  Coming up here in about 20 minutes. Separately, we have our big sale.

[32:09.000 --> 32:13.000]  The bad news is we did a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.

[32:30.000 --> 32:37.000]  It's proprietary. It's amazing. I learned about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.
[32:37.000 --> 32:43.000]  We simply made it stronger and we have great reviews from listeners. Get the real Red Pill Plus for a limited time.

[32:50.000 --> 33:08.000]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action. Real Red Pill Plus now available at 50% off at Infowarsstore.com for only a few more days.
[33:21.000 --> 33:32.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:32.000 --> 33:52.000]  So all the major governments of the world and all the major think tanks have wargamed how World War III would start.
[33:52.000 --> 34:02.000]  And it would start either between US and China over its expansion of the South China Sea or between India and Pakistan or India and China.
[34:02.000 --> 34:10.000]  But the number one place Pentagon war planners have been believing nuclear war would start since the 50s right through today is a conflict in Eastern Europe.
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.000]  And that's why right through the Cold War, the main US military posture was in Europe to fight the Russians.
[34:18.000 --> 34:31.000]  Now obviously if that war continues to escalate up the ladder and it's following the exact plan that the Rand Corporation in the early 60s and late 60s and 70s and 80s predicted it would,
[34:31.000 --> 34:38.000]  it starts with one and ends in the low 40s with total nuclear war and the end of humanity and civilization as we know it.
[34:38.000 --> 34:50.000]  Concepts and models of escalation, Rand Corporation. And everybody needs to go read this because this is the battle plan.
[34:50.000 --> 35:00.000]  And the people running our government believe they can win this war with Russia and China and that it will destroy civilizations as we know it,
[35:00.000 --> 35:11.000]  but they will emerge from the underground bases and build their new utopia. Bertrand Russell, who was the top big liberal peacenig and won all sorts of prizes,
[35:11.000 --> 35:21.000]  wrote in his books, you can look it up, that a limited nuclear war can be used to depopulate most of the earth and then have a UN takeover after that that never allows weapons again.
[35:21.000 --> 35:35.000]  Just like they're engineering a societal collapse. Just like they are cutting off the power and the resources and dumbing people down and getting rid of basic training for anybody to take care of themselves,
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.000]  the decision has been made for the controlled demolition of civilization.
[35:41.000 --> 35:52.000]  And it's in all the documents, State Department of Random 200, State Department plan 7277. And if you're a listener or a viewer, you just write these things down,
[35:52.000 --> 35:59.000]  like the crews in there just typing into a search engine when I say on air and they're pulling it up, not just saying all this.
[35:59.000 --> 36:08.000]  This is what I do, I study this constantly. And we are going from beta into the New World Order operational now.
[36:08.000 --> 36:17.000]  And as I said a few years ago, first is the bio weapon release, then is the EMP attack, then is full nuclear war.
[36:17.000 --> 36:24.000]  So when the Chinese have got, whether it's a drill, which even now they're finally saying as we speak, depending on what's saying,
[36:24.000 --> 36:32.000]  oh, they're trying to surveil launch sites for ICBMs, no, they're like, well, it's probably a dry run for an EMP.
[36:32.000 --> 36:39.000]  So as we speak, the truth is beginning to come out after 24 hours of hysteria about, oh, they're spying on us, they're spying on us.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  The damn satellites do that. But again, they cannot deliver a proper EMP attack.
[36:45.000 --> 36:56.000]  The derogables, the blimps, the balloons, call them whatever you want are there to deliver the weapons.
[36:56.000 --> 37:04.000]  And they just put it right out over us, the Secretary of State blinking with schedule to go over there in the next few days.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  And now they've canceled that. And again, you ask, why aren't they shooting it down?
[37:09.000 --> 37:17.000]  You know, the Pentagon shoots stuff down all the time. We've got space lasers, particle beams, kinetic meteor gun weapons,
[37:17.000 --> 37:29.000]  rail gun weapons in space. They could have easily shot this down, but they didn't shoot it down because they think this is the prime
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.000]  political equation, military equation, that it's got too dangerous of a payload.
[37:37.000 --> 37:46.000]  And where would the payload be? Well, not in the solar panels and not on the communication arrays,
[37:46.000 --> 37:55.000]  but it would be inside at the center of the balloon. It could weigh thousands of pounds.
[37:55.000 --> 38:02.000]  It could weigh 100 pounds. It could be a small atomic-driven EMP. It could be a hydrogen bomb-driven EMP.
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.000]  Or it could just be, again, a dry run. That's coming up next segment.
[38:08.000 --> 38:18.000]  I want to add to all of that this information. Plan to send U.S. contractors to Ukraine revealed by Politico.
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  Well, I know people that are contractors that have been over there in the last eight years.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  I know Green Berets that have been over there in the last eight years.
[38:26.000 --> 38:41.000]  Some individuals have been over there in the last year, not just directing the Ukrainians, but fighting with them and leading them.
[38:41.000 --> 38:51.000]  And now that's all coming out. So the war has already begun. They're just starting to tell you about it.
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.000]  Putin to test launch unstoppable new nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles.
[38:56.000 --> 39:05.000]  The unstoppable Zircon missile will be test-fired from a frigate during naval exercises off the coast of Africa.
[39:05.000 --> 39:14.000]  They will be aimed at a surface target at a distance of more than 310 miles.
[39:14.000 --> 39:22.000]  Continuing, Vladimir Putin's red line will be crossed with Moscow attack bound to happen.
[39:22.000 --> 39:31.000]  Ukraine's already been firing missiles in the last few months into deep Russia and hitting targets in the outskirts of Moscow.
[39:31.000 --> 39:40.000]  There have been truck bombs, car bombs, you name it, killing members of the media, the government, attacking military bases,
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  attacking Russian nuke bomber bases.
[39:45.000 --> 39:54.000]  And now Putin says, if any missiles or weapons hit Moscow itself, that escalates to heavier weapons use in Ukraine.
[39:54.000 --> 40:01.000]  And they're going to use this as the pretext. And the Ukrainians want more Russian invasion, because that will bring NATO more into it.
[40:01.000 --> 40:10.000]  And Putin is fully committed. And so Zelensky came out yesterday and said they might, quote, declare war on Russia and start an open attack.
[40:10.000 --> 40:17.000]  Just three months ago, Biden was giving them missiles, long-range missiles, but said the Ukrainians had promised not to use these.
[40:17.000 --> 40:28.000]  And you got Sean Penn and all these other Republican and Democrat lawmakers in the Senate and House talking about a survivable nuclear war with Russia.
[40:28.000 --> 40:34.000]  This is all insanity. And this is how it works.
[40:34.000 --> 40:42.000]  Here's from the Rand Corporation. There's many different versions of this that have been updated.
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  But this is from the 1960s.
[40:45.000 --> 41:00.000]  Hans' escalation ladder. And in Hans, the guy that they based Dr. Strangelove in Stanley Kubrick's dark comedy, Dr. Strangelove, or the full title, Why I Learned to Love the Bomb.
[41:00.000 --> 41:12.000]  And it goes over how it all starts and how it all ends, spasm of intense war into the world, as you know, at service to the planet, unlivable.
[41:12.000 --> 41:31.000]  And we're moving up into the high 20s, into the 30s, where things escalate into regional nuclear war and then into continental and then into intercontinental.
[41:31.000 --> 41:43.000]  You might want to look into Kahn's KAHN's escalation ladder, because that's the Pentagon battle plan. They believe it's all survivable.
[41:43.000 --> 41:55.000]  Starts with a sensible crisis, political, economic and diplomatic gestures, solemn and formal declarations.
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  Number four, hardening of positions, confrontation of wills. Number five, show of force.
[42:01.000 --> 42:07.000]  Number six, significant mobilization. Number seven, legal harassment.
[42:07.000 --> 42:13.000]  Number eight, harassing acts of violence, dramatic military confrontation.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  That's the last few years building up in the proxy war then a hybrid war.
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.000]  Number ten, provocative breaking off diplomatic relations, super ready status going on the alert.
[42:26.000 --> 42:36.000]  Large conventional war, already going on. Declaration of limited conventional war, that's all been declared.
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.000]  Barely nuclear war, depleted uranium, all the rest of it.
[42:42.000 --> 42:50.000]  Limited evacuations. It's already been happening. Spectacular show of demonstration of force.
[42:50.000 --> 43:00.000]  Justifiable counter force attack. Peaceful worldwide embargo and blockade. It just goes on and on.
[43:00.000 --> 43:13.000]  Hey, what's up, bone? Hey, McBreen. What's going on, man?
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece? I'm going to use that on the show today.
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  I worked hard on that. I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight.
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  I was hoping he had some brain force plus.
[43:25.000 --> 43:33.000]  Oh, um, no. Nothing, nothing. What about brain force ultra?
[43:38.000 --> 43:49.000]  No. Okay. Thanks anyway. Good luck with that project though.
[43:49.000 --> 43:56.000]  Get your brain force plus and brain force ultra right now at inforstore.com.
[44:20.000 --> 44:27.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you've had the success.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[44:32.000 --> 44:42.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[44:46.000 --> 44:55.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[44:55.000 --> 45:18.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[45:25.000 --> 45:35.000]  To flatten the cans, I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[45:35.000 --> 45:46.000]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies the only I own profitable.
[45:46.000 --> 45:56.000]  You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra, who will move your immune system,
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.000]  so you'll be depended on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[46:01.000 --> 46:14.000]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing in full wars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts? Because they know we're pro-human. They know we're telling the truth. They know we've got their number.
[46:14.000 --> 46:26.000]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity. And God gave us through Mother Nature incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[46:26.000 --> 46:37.000]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[46:37.000 --> 46:45.000]  And to give your body the key elements and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[46:45.000 --> 47:01.000]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny. This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years, 50% off at infowarstore.com. Get the Red Pill Plus exclusively, infowarstore.com.
[47:15.000 --> 47:43.000]  Welcome back to the Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show. Mike Adams has got always powerful information, but he's going to break exclusive information in the third hour in studio today, the health ranger.
[47:43.000 --> 47:50.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Let me finish up with the threat continuum. And Russia can always skip ahead in this. The West can skip ahead.
[47:50.000 --> 47:59.000]  China could decide to do a total first strike and supposedly try to knock us out, but we've got submarines and all the rest of us that don't be able to stop retaliation.
[47:59.000 --> 48:16.000]  But this is how the experts believe that it would build in a regional war, particularly in Europe with Russia, into what we're now seeing. So we've gotten up to 25.
[48:16.000 --> 48:29.000]  We've gotten up to 20. No nuclear use threshold has now been passed in the nuclear use. Now you see Zelensky and Putin saying maybe we'll use nukes. You see the West saying maybe nukes will be used.
[48:29.000 --> 48:49.000]  Nuclear war, exemplary. Declaration of limited nuclear war, local nuclear war, tactical nuclear weapons, universal provocative and significant countermeasures, evacuation approximately 70% from the area,
[48:49.000 --> 49:02.000]  US Sanctuary Threshold, 26. Demonstration attack on zone of interior. So now a strike where the West says, okay, you did this. Now we're going to hit your military base here.
[49:02.000 --> 49:09.000]  And if you counter strike, we're going to up the ante. This is how it works. The generals are on the phones with each other.
[49:09.000 --> 49:23.000]  Exemplary attack on military. Number 28, exemplary attack against property. Exemplary attack on population. Complete evacuation, possibly 95%. Imagine that hysteria.
[49:23.000 --> 49:40.000]  Reciprocal reprisals. Central war threshold 32. Formal declaration of general war. Slow motion counter property war. Slow motion counter force war. 35. Constrained force reaction salvo.
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.000]  36. Constrained disarming attack. We've got to knock up their military. We've got to hit them all over their country.
[49:46.000 --> 49:57.000]  And all over their ships in the ocean. 37. Counter force with avoidance attack. 38. Unmodified counter force attack. City targeting threshold.
[49:57.000 --> 50:13.000]  Now we start hitting each other cities. Slow motion counter city war. 39. 40. Counter salvo. Counter value salvo. 41. Augmented disarming attack.
[50:13.000 --> 50:22.000]  Take out more of the military. 32. Civilian devastation attack. Just knock out all the cities. 43. Some other kinds of controlled general war.
[50:22.000 --> 50:40.000]  44. Spasm of intense war. End of the world as we know it. Now we are entering the 20s here. And it moves very quickly into the 30s and into the end of the world as you know it.
[50:40.000 --> 50:51.000]  That's just a summary. You should go read the whole brand corporation report because that's still official policy and it's based in the same policy of the Russians and you see it following that.
[50:51.000 --> 51:05.000]  Now let's get into the balloon. Let's just hit these headlines. Chinese government official says that spy balloon is theirs calls for cool headed response to negotiation tactic to at least put the test platform.
[51:05.000 --> 51:17.000]  We don't know if it's armed loaded with a weapon over the United States. Now we learn more balloons are coming. Canada reports the track starting along Montana right throughout over South Carolina.
[51:17.000 --> 51:25.000]  I'd imagine the next balloon as a demonstration will probably they're saying come in around the middle of the country around Minnesota and then go down over the northeast.
[51:25.000 --> 51:44.000]  China claims to regret its civilian airship has been spying on American ICBM site. That's the cover story. Here's some of the background headline MSN from years ago balloons called top delivery platform for nuclear EMP attack.
[51:44.000 --> 51:55.000]  China has first strike ability to meet US power grid with electromagnetic pulse weapon 2020 delivered by balloons.
[51:55.000 --> 52:03.000]  Is China plotting an EMP attack only if it wants World War three. Well where do you think we're going.
[52:03.000 --> 52:13.000]  Report China was testing for EMP attack on Taiwan. DHS combats potential electromagnetic pulse weapon attack DHS dot gov.
[52:13.000 --> 52:21.000]  China might have sent spy balloon over US as a power play to prove it can do what it wants. Experts say Yahoo news.
[52:21.000 --> 52:26.000]  China spy balloon over Montana is part of a larger more troubling pattern.
[52:26.000 --> 52:35.000]  Dry run balloons called top delivery platform for nuclear EMP Chinese balloon called dry run for EMP attack.
[52:35.000 --> 52:43.000]  China developing 4600 mile hypersonic EMP missile that could plunge cities in the darkness with chemical explosion.
[52:43.000 --> 52:51.000]  Secret military documents to Joe invited Chinese troops to train Canadian military bases for civil suppression.
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.000]  Red Dawn a tale of China EMP and transformers. America's Achilles heel.
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.000]  Newsmax China surprise. Here's the planning and EMP attack the hill.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.000]  China Russia building super EMP bombs for blackout warfare. Free beacon.
[53:07.000 --> 53:15.000]  China's ties. Canada's ties of Chinese military underscores the weird contradictions in its foreign policy.
[53:15.000 --> 53:24.000]  Canadian invited communist China to come to the country to participate in military exercises on and on and on and their training in Mexico.
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.000]  Now why is that so incredibly important? Well, blinking postpones China trip following balloon discovery.
[53:30.000 --> 53:39.000]  US government monitoring suspected Chinese balloon. Now they admit it.
[53:39.000 --> 53:51.000]  Again, the media is like, why don't they use a satellite for that? Because it can't get through the magnetic field and most of it will bounce off.
[53:51.000 --> 53:58.000]  The delivery system is either from a missile or a bomb that's dropped from super high altitude.
[53:58.000 --> 54:05.000]  But then they don't have real control over it of exactly when they detonate it or the main effect it's going to have.
[54:05.000 --> 54:11.000]  And it's hard to keep those planes over our airspace, but not with a balloon.
[54:11.000 --> 54:19.000]  It can fly along watching everything at once report back to the satellites report back and basically live time to the chai comms.
[54:19.000 --> 54:29.000]  This is undoubtedly a dry run for an EMP attack and a saber rattling exercise of.
[54:29.000 --> 54:35.000]  Into the world proportions.
[54:35.000 --> 54:45.000]  That is where we are today in the year 2023 on February 3rd on this Friday broadcast.
[54:45.000 --> 54:54.000]  And I am going to open the phones up specifically on this issue from Air Force veterans or current Air Force or Space Force people.
[54:54.000 --> 55:07.000]  You can get through. We're only taking your calls if you've been in Space Force or if you've been in the Air Force or if you've worked in the Defense Department dealing with scenarios.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  I don't want anything classified as secret plus the stuff's all out in the open.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  That's the whole point of the weapon is to let us know they've got it. It's a doomsday weapon.
[55:15.000 --> 55:22.000]  And what is your expert take on it? And you won't have to hold long because I only imagine this is such a small group of expertise.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  If you have millions listening, I would guess we'll have four or five callers. Maybe we'll have more.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  But if you've got specifics, please no one else call.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  These folks will be able to get in and give us their take.
[55:31.000 --> 55:42.000]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789-2539-877-789 Alex.
[55:42.000 --> 55:49.000]  And if anything I've said you think is wrong or could be corrected or updated, I'd love to know about it.
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  But the whole future of satellites is not even in satellites. It's in these balloons.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  They can stay up for years. They're very cheap to launch.
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  And you can put any type of platform you want on them.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.000]  And they launch these in the air stream so they know exactly where they're going.
[56:03.000 --> 56:12.000]  And again, many of them actually are able to use jets that are solar powered or propeller powered with solar power.
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.000]  Small little jets to be able to move the balloon and basically steer the balloon or the derogable.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  Also known as a blimp.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.000]  So we're going to be discussing all that at 877-789-2539.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  This is again a major escalation.
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  And last night this morning they weren't getting it, but now more and more they are.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  I have a few clips of the Pentagon statements coming up.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  And then your phone calls, please remember we cannot do the broadcast without you.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  Plus we have amazing products that really will enrich and empower your life.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  So I want to ask all listeners, especially those that have been on the fence,
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  never gone infowarstore.com to get in the arena and to get your skin in the game
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  and your great products at the same time.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  And infowarstore.com, our big sale has to end Monday night
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  because so many of these products are about to sell out.

[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  It goes on and on. It's all at infowarstore.com.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  And ultimate bone broth sold out for over two and a half years.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Updated even stronger. The best bone broth you're going to find.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  So good for your joints, your bones, your immune system, your body.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  It just does incredible stuff. I love mixing it in with milk
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  and drinking it in the morning. I had a big scoop this morning.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  And it just makes my bones joints that have been through a lot feel so good.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  It's back in stock, discounted at infowarstore.com as well.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  We will be right back on the other side with hour number two.
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the riders.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[58:18.000 --> 58:22.000]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[58:31.000 --> 58:35.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com
[58:35.000 --> 58:40.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air.
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com, our fighting problems will be over.
[58:49.000 --> 59:09.000]  Please take action now.
[59:19.000 --> 59:48.000]  Please take action now.
[59:50.000 --> 59:59.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  All right, I'm going to go to break, hear about five minutes, join some stations and go right to your phone calls
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  on the weapons platform, the Chinese and put over the United States.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  But man, it took her Carlson just knocking out of the park.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  It was one of the high level Clinton officials in the federal government over housing
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  exposing the central bank digital currencies and how it's the end of freedom as we know it.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Here's part of that report. We'll come back with the World War III developments.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  So obviously the plan is to get rid of cash because it's easier and cash is for criminals and mandate digital currency.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Now, if you think about it for a second, you don't want to hand total control of all your money to people who don't like you.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  So that's not a good idea, but it's happening anyway.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  And it's happening because ATMs are disappearing.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Oh, okay. No one voted on this, but it's happening anyway.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  And we've got details next.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  So if they take away cash and make everything digital and digital currency, a central bank digital currency,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  obviously you have no power whatsoever.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  If they don't like what you're doing, they just shut you down and you're impoverished.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  It just happened in Canada last winter.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  So we know what the consequences are.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  We know why they want it.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  So that couldn't happen, right? Well, we may live to see the day that it does happen.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  And here's the latest sign that it may be happening.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  The number of banks and ATM machines in this country are in steep decline, far fewer than there were just a few years ago.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  And in some countries like Australia, they're going way at high speed.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  So this is not something that anyone voted on.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  This is something that they're just doing, whether you like it or not.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  So you can say we have cash, but if you can get cash, then do you really have cash?
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  So where's this going?
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  That's the question we want to assess tonight.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  And we're going to with Catherine Austin Fitz, who has been monitoring this.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  She founded the Solaria Report.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  She's also the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Development, and we're happy to have her.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Catherine, thanks for coming on.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  So I think if you put this up to a vote nationally, most people would say, no, I may not use cash,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  but I'd like to have cash because if there's no cash, then I have no control over my life.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  But it seems like this could be a way to affect the same outcome without a vote.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  So, Tucker, one of the bedrocks of freedom is freedom to do financial transactions,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  including privately, or freedom to do where you want to do and wherever you want to do.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  And unfortunately, as the financial system has become more and more digital,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  you see more and more not only invasive surveillance, but more and more controls.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  You referred to Canada, a perfect example.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And the reality as the financial system gets more controlling and more invasive,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  it's a little bit like bringing up a corral around us.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  And CBDCs, central bank digital currencies and vaccine passports or digital IDs,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  are sort of the last shutting of the gate.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  It's hard for many people to imagine the risks here because we're so used to living with financial transaction freedom.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  And we don't understand that when this gate closes on us,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  we literally will be sitting in a system where the central banks believe that our assets belong to them,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  and they can dictate where we can spend money and what we can spend money on.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  The important thing to understand is central bank digital currencies are not currencies.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  It's a financial transaction control grid, and it gives the ability for the central bankers,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  and they've said this publicly, the ability to not only set the rule centrally,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  but enforce the rule centrally if you don't behave, you can have your money turned off.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  You keep hearing people on television say cash is for criminals.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Why would you need cash if you're not doing something bad?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  Why are so few financial journalists pointing out that actually if cash goes away,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  so does any power you might have had over your own life?
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Well, I find a lot more journalists are beginning to understand
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  and are beginning to not only write about this and talk about this, but do documentaries.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  We just had a new documentary done here out of the Netherlands called State of Control,
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  which does a great job of explaining the invasive nature of this control grid.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  I think it's very hard for people who've grown up and enjoyed Western liberty and human liberty
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  to imagine, literally, that we're going into a system where, literally,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  our homes, our cars, our communities become digital concentration camps.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  All right, we're going to play the full clip and post, and this is posted to Man Up video,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  but she's such a smart lady and warned about this decades ago.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  And notice, it's all corporate control.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  It's happening all over the world, but governments aren't the ones doing it.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  And there's all these articles about, oh, the Davos group at the UN don't have any power.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Oh, oh, don't expose them.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  They'll be covering that coming up as well.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Oh, yeah, they got all the power until we realize it and take our power back.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Okay, the new world order is not coming.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  It's here.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Well, I have to tell you about Diet Force.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  Diet Force is amazing.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  I'm 45, and I have bits.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force, two tablets a day,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  man, if you're, like, struggling to get, like, chip shape for the ladies,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  mate, Diet Force is the go.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day, and just keep acting.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, X7 Diet Force.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  Now on sale.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  We're cutting that ad.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  I can guarantee you that.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  God bless Australia.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, Diet Force.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  Get it now.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  For the first day of the hysteria over the Chinese balloon, balloons, now they're
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  reporting, floating down over the North Pole from China across the United States
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  from West to East.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  The media, oh, they're surveilling our missile silos, and the senators are all,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  they're going to know where our missile silos are.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  The satellites know all that.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  It's all been on record.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  It's all marked.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  It's public data.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  That's not what this is for.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  This is practicing for an EMP attack, and the Chinese have admitted that previously.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  And the good news is, finally, mainline analysts everywhere are pointing this out.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  One of these detonated the right altitude with enough power, using an atomic or hydrogen
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  bomb to drive the EMP, would knock out power in many areas of the country.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  Fry your car.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Fry your electronics, unless it's in a Faraday Cajun protected.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  Just solar flares.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  You see what they do.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  And it was a case in 1918, was it, where they had that big event where power lines melted.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  There was another event before that, just from a solar flare.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  Well, this is regionally, locally, way more powerful than that.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  And here's the Pentagon involved in a briefing that just ended a few minutes ago.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Here's a few clips of what they had to say.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  Our announcement last night regarding the high altitude surveillance balloon.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  I'm not going to have much new information to provide other than to say that the North
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  American Aerospace Defense Command continues to monitor it closely.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  While we won't get into specifics in regards to the exact location, I can tell you that
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  the balloon continues to move eastward and is currently over the center of the continental
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  United States, ma'am.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  Thank you, Pat.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  You said that this is violating our airspace, so why not take it down?
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Yeah, so, you know, clearly as we assess options and considering the size of the payload on
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  this, looking at the potential for debris and the impact on civilians on the ground
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  or property damage, again, running through the various factors and looking at, in terms
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  of does it pose a potential risk to people while in the air, and right now, as I mentioned,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  we assess that it does not pose a risk to people on the ground as it currently is traversing
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  the continental United States.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  And so out of an abundance of caution, cognizant of the potential impact to civilians on the
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  ground from a debris field, right now we're going to continue to monitor and review options.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  And if I may, you mentioned that we've seen this kind of activity before, so why are we
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  sharing this?
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a big payload.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  And there's a giant admitted Chinese program, again, to test these out to later load them
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  with EMP devices.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  It's one of their main strategic options.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  They said they'll use the nuclear war and look where we are with China and Russia right
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  now.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  The Pentagon shoots stuff down all the time.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  And big satellites come in to the atmosphere all the time as well.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  The idea that they're not going to shoot us down when most of the time it was in the
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  middle of nowhere, flying over mountains and wilderness is BS in my view.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  But let's talk to some folks that may know more than I do.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  We got Eric in Arkansas's Air Force, we got Franklin in Minnesota's Air Force, we got
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  Beowulf in Arizona, who's an engineer for worldview, and John, who's Air Force.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  Let's take the calls and the order they're received.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  First up, let's talk to Eric in Arkansas Air Force.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  Eric, what's your view on this?
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  Hey, so they're talking about a nuclear payload.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  And I will say that if they shoot it down, it will not, it generally will not explode.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  I'll give you an example.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  My grandfather was a fact commander.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  They had a plane with nuclear bombs on it crash.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Everybody evacuated and you sit tight because there's just like on a 500 pound bomb, there's
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  certain things that need things to be set up, set off like codes, etc.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Sure, they got to turn the keys, they got to arm it, they got to get it ready.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  It's got to detonate perfectly to compact the uranium or plutonium to cause the chain reaction.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  Yeah, and then, and then why they're not shooting it down?
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  I don't know.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  To me, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  They know, they know what it is.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  They know when it came in.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  They know everything pretty much about the location and how it came in and everything.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  I mean, I agree with you.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  So you got the puppet Biden who's basically in the back pocket of the chai comms.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  His sons admitted Chinese spy on his own recordings.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  And so I think they don't want to embarrass the chai comms.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  They're letting a menace with this and the president's ordered the Air Force not to shoot it down.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  And we know Biden's made the decision not to shoot it down.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  And what's your view on that?
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Oh, well, I just retired out of the Air Force and as I gave in my retirement space with the FBI,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  basically not doing anything to the Chinese police stations around the United States of Canada.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  We have effectively become a battle state of China.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  And they're letting them build giant Huawei towers right next to military bases, even in the middle of nowhere.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  There's maps.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  I know you've seen them.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  It's been in the news where they're sticking 5G right next to military bases.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  They're buying farmland right next door to them, even though there's no other 5G in the area just to be able to spy on everything.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Yeah, that's that is that is alarming.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  And just basic, if you know anything about electronics and just generally the radio waves can go through anything.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  So you just all you need to do is just open up an electronics handbook and I'm an amateur radio operator.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  And you can look at the radio wavelengths and the higher concentrated they are and closer they are together.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  That's why 5G needs a lot of power, stick here or whatever.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  They can easily penetrate anything.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  And they can take over devices with it and they can also fry devices with 5G.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  So it's a weapon system.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Right, right.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  So you can also look at a popular mechanics magazine.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  This is back in the 90s.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  They've had technology for like this for a long time that I used to subscribe to.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And it's it's I don't understand.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  So I don't like to go back to the balloon.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  I don't understand why they're not taking it taking it down.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  There is no really reason not to.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  You know, everybody's afraid.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  I mean, I am I'm this flabbergast though.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  It hasn't been removed.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  It's much like the U2 spy plane back under the Soviet Union when it was shot down.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  It was a simple exchange for people.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  I don't I really don't I don't I don't get it.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  Do you know enough about in weapons in the Air Force what they would use to shoot it down?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Because I know it's up at 80,000 feet.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  But our jets can get up to 60,000 easily fire a small missile into it or they I mean,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  what do you think the preferred way to take this down to not damage it too much.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  We get the payload and find out what it is.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Well, I mean, I don't think there would be a bird necessarily way.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  I mean, I got a map.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  You know, I mean that projectiles that could be fired from a plane that could, you know,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  get up another 20,000 feet without using a missile.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Probably.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  I mean, without saying too much, but yeah, I don't they're just use your imagination.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  I'm sure there's definitely something that can easily be used to to grab that balloon.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  Let's say an actual satellite.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  You know, I mean, they have well about to say they got satellites since the 80s up there that have the the pebble weapons,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  the smart pebble weapons where it's just the size of the end of your finger.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  And they fire from space at 30,000 miles an hour and it takes the balloon out.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  I mean, they're able to shoot ICBMs down.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  I mean, so they can certainly shoot this balloon down.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Right.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  And that's exactly to your point.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  So I don't know why they're not actually doing it.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  I mean, if it's going over where they say it's going over.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  That's like low density population.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  And like according to like Joel Scouson's report on like, it's in the perfect place where you would want it to go.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Like one of the main places that you'd, you know, of least value low density is like in the in the middle of the Kansas.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  I hate to say for the people in Kansas, but yeah, I mean, I honestly don't have no, I have no idea.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  Thanks for getting through.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  We, they're now reporting its change course, which is the point I made that most of these balloons and all of the blimps use jets or propellers.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  And these balloons usually use little jets that kind of do in space that can move into different areas.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  But now MSN is reporting China spy balloon.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Why is it depending on shoot it down and put the other report up guys.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  You had up earlier that it's now changed course, we are getting reports that people across the Northwest Missouri near Pleasant Hill and the Casey major air reporting seeing the Chinese surveillance balloon moving southeast.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Okay.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Well, and Canada is reporting another balloon is coming down in a similar trajectory over the North Pole.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  We'll go to break and I'm going to come back and get to more your calls.

[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Let's talk to Beowulf says he's an engineer wants to give a worldview on this.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  Go ahead, Beowulf.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  Hey, Mr. Alf Jones.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  For one, we've got a balloon that just launched just east of Denver.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  It's cruising at 79,000 feet.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  They don't have any projection or anything that actually translates their motion.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  Basically, they they move up and down in the jet stream to actually control their stuff because otherwise that's just unnecessary weight fuel.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  Okay, so you're saying a balloon.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  This balloon came from China.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  You're saying another balloon got launched from Denver.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  Yeah, just east of Denver.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Yeah.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  It's called air quality three.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  And it's actually out of.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  I know the US launches balloons all the time and the military does and so does Noah, the federal government, weather service and so do universities.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  But I'm talking about the Chinese balloon.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  I think it's a file.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  I think it's actually the government actually just playing their shenanigans.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  Well, I appreciate your view on that.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  China has taken responsibility for it and says they have an EMP balloon weapon program, but I appreciate your call.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  Let's talk to John and Oklahoma, this Air Force.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  John, what's your view on this?
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  This is John.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  I was radar air surveillance maintenance.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  So I took care of all of the air traffic control radar in northern Maine, Japan and in Oklahoma.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  Me and a crew, of course.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  There's a site you might want to go check out.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  It's called V-E-N-T-U-S-K-Y.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  It's a university website and you can go in there and it gives you information on weather patterns all the way up to 30,000 meters.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  So if you want to track the direction of the wind, go to this website, then Tuske, and then change your search parameters to get what you want.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  You can locate the jet stream, which direction is traveling and how fast.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  Now, as to radar, let me tell you, if it's in the air, you can see it with the exception of UFOs.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  My first duty station was Loring, Maine.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  If your people want to look up Loring Incident, L-O-R-I-N-G Incident, that was the base I was stationed at, my first duty station.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  Your guys in the control room will know me because I send you a lot of emails.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  I have heard of the Loring Incident. Tell folks about that.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  Well, a friend of mine who was an air traffic controller, I can send you a picture of the air traffic control tower we were up in.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  But he saw UFOs coming in overnight.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  I was in the radar maintenance and he called down and said, John, double check the radar.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  So I went through and grabbed the oscilloscope, multimeter, spectrum analyzers, the equipment you need to fix this stuff.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  And the radar was tuned perfectly and he said, oh, crap. And next day I talked to him and he said he couldn't talk about it.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  In other words, the Defense Department had already shut it down.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  So the UFOs that occurred over Loring were the same type of things that occur over the Central United States back in the 60s and 70s.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  They turned off some of the electronics in our missile silos.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  Most people don't know that. And most people don't know we have deep under a military basis.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  Most people don't know our government was taken over in the 50s when Eisenhower brought over the OSS Nazis and put them in the CIA.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  Our country has been taken over, folks. It's as simple as that.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  God is your only option. And I'd like to say a prayer for all your listeners, Alex.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Go ahead.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  Dear Lord God in heaven, Father of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, I pray that you shine the light of information on these evil people doing corrupt deeds
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  and that all of Alex listeners globally would see what's really occurring and that you would open their eyes and prepare your people for the ultimate fight.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  I was on the front lines, so are other many military people.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  Now we're on the front lines helping the civilians.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  Amen, John. Thanks for the call. Run into your calls quickly here.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  Chris in New York, thanks for calling Air Force. Give us your view.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  How you doing, Alex? You hear me?
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Okay, listen, man. I'm sorry, man. I'm not Air Force, okay? Please listen. I'm not Air Force.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  Okay, well, they just put it on the screen. It's okay, Chris. We take a call from the Air Force or engineers.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  They made a mistake. It's okay. Go ahead. What's your view?
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  I just wanted to know, man, listen, I had took the fighters I came in during the summer and I regretted a lot, like a lot, a lot.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  I was kind of forced to take it. I just want to know what are some things I could do to detox this from my body.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  I'm not.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Now, here's the deal, sir. I appreciate your call. I'll address that later with Mike Adams. I'm not trying to be rude.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  We're taking calls from Air Force people and engineers. That's what we're taking calls on. Okay?
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Franklin, Minnesota, and it says Air Force on the screen.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Franklin, are you formally or currently in the Air Force and what's your view?
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  Formally, yes. So that gentleman you spoke to, John, he's pretty much right on the money, if you ask me.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  So these high-altitude surveillance technologies, they're basically implemented as far as I know from 1986.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  So I don't think it's a weapon, as some of you may feel it is, but it might be loaded with a ton of surveillance systems.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  Again, I'm really speculating at this point, and I am retired a lot of things change fast, but it seems to me to be a preemptive reconnaissance exercise more than likely.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  Last night, you know, I could tell you, like, we call them long endurance multi-intelligence vehicles.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  They're equipped with night and day video cameras, some communication relays, you know, for ground sensors.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  They've got a ton of airborne surveillance capabilities. That much, I can guarantee you.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  You know, I can speak up to October.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Why would they openly send this over the U.S. when they already have satellites and they've already got, they're already jacked into the computers.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  They've already got 5G everywhere.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  I would speak if I were you. I would, in my opinion, and again, I am retired.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  But this seems to be a type of war game scenario.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  And my hope is if I were you, you should look into the Army's long endurance multi-intelligence vehicles.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  It relies on a lot of these systems of hybrid hulls, like the complexity of the hardware that I seem to be observing so far that I know should look up probably MAV 6.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  That was the defense startup. That's doing a lot of the inspirational work.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  If you look that kind of stuff up, you know, General James Cart White, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that's someone you probably should get in touch with.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  And that's all I have. Thank you.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  All right. Thank you so much, sir. I appreciate your call.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  I'm going to go to Kevin, Richard, Neil, and a few others.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  And then Mike Adams is in studio. We'll get his take on this.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  And he's got big news on all the different announcements that they're putting, bugs in the food, not just in Europe, but here.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  And it's just showing up on the package. It's just like Tucker Carlson said, the European Union and then Davos Group calls for getting rid of cash.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  And suddenly all these restaurants and stores and businesses all over the place won't take it.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  They're pulling out the ATMs everywhere.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  Four total controls ahead of the end of the dollar as we know it.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  And the new Central Bank digital currencies. We'll talk about that with Mike Adams as well.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  But we're going to go to break and come right back with Richard, Kevin, Neil, Bill, and a few others.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  And then Mike Adams will be in studio.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  I am planning to do a live show tomorrow at 1 p.m. Central.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  That will be simulcast at infowars.com forward slash show and available already on TV affiliates, but it's out of a new studio.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  I built the separate from info wars and you can find out more about that at Alex Jones live.com Alex Jones live.com.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  I'll be live tomorrow 1 p.m. Central commercial three for two hours.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  The cavalry has arrived. Ultimate bone broth is the strongest highest quality chicken based bone broth.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  They're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  But more importantly, your immune system. Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chocolate mushroom and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  The list goes on and on. This is definitely the strongest best bone broth out there and your purchase supports the info or a 360 win.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  If you've not experienced bone broth, even the regular ones have great effects.

[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  It's really just incredible.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowars.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  At the same time, keep us on air.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowars.com.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  If just 1% more of you took action at infowars.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' info wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  This is why they attack us.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  This is why we need your support.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000]  Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the links.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in Mines, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  Info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down info wars and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  If you decide to go to info wars store.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  It is all in your hands.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  Thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists, go to infowarstore.com right now and keep us on air.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  It's up to you.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  All right, let's run through a ton of your phone calls.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  All right, let's run through a ton of your phone calls.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  Now I'm going to shift gears out of the balloon when Mike Adams gets in here.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  We'll get his brief take on that.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  We're going to cover the waterfront on all the poison shot news that's massive, it just gets bigger every day.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  The WEF and damage control, how they're taking over all the major systems, that's coming up with Mike Adams in studio and he brought his amazing German police dog here.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  I guess about Belgian Malamute if I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  So he's got a surprise today.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  He's got the dog here and he's got a bunch of images and photos to what they found at their lab is in the food now.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  They're putting bug parts in a lot of the food already here.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  People are at the store noticing and seeing it.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  It's crazy, but it's all about their agenda of control.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  WEF didn't have any power, but they say you will eat the bugs three years ago and suddenly you will eat the bugs one way or another.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Let's go to the order your calls are received here on the surveillance balloon, weapons platform balloon, you name it, EMP delivery system balloon.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  Let's talk to Richard, engineer on the balloon and satellites.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  Let's go ahead, Richard.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  Hallelujah.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  Hallelujah.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  Shalom.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  Welcome, sir.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  Well, Alex, yeah, I'm calling to tell you, I've done some extensive research with hydrogen and helium and there is a helium shortage across the world and America is because majority of the weather balloons that are up there or satellites are actually weather balloons.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  And once you go up high enough, they'll stay stationary because they're out of the jet stream and this thing either it was an accident where it had a fault and it fell down too far into the jet stream and then started wandering into our area or the government itself has done something to do a fault flag or something along those lines.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  And that's what I'm thinking because I've been doing this for years but satellite communications, there's PBS that did a story some years ago where they basically gave internet up and down the west coast of Africa by these weather balloons.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  They haven't go up in the air in the jet stream.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  They go up the coast of Africa.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  They lower them and they come back down and they're giving them all 3G, 2G signals down there to provide satellite communications for them.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  But if they had a balloon to be Chinese to come all the way in our territory either had a fault, had a leak and it started coming down and once that happens, they have nowhere to land it.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  It goes rogue.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Or they lost communication with it.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  Well, and don't, aren't these usually at 80,000 feet or higher?
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  They say it's 60,000 feet.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  That would add to your theory that it's malfunctioning.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  Yes, because these weather balloons, like I said, on the video, they show what would actually make them at this place in America where, unless they blow them up, they're about the size of Texas Stadium there.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  They're gigantic and you can, like, they have to go up pretty high.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  Absolutely.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  Thank you, Richard.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Great points.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  We've got to move quickly to everybody.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  Let's go now to Neil in Arizona.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  You're on the air.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  Neil, go ahead.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Yes, Alex.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  I don't see why if they really wanted to bring this balloon down, they couldn't punch holes in it, you know, shoot a round or two through it, get it to slowly come down.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  And then once it got closer to the ground, shadow this thing with an Apache helicopter and then bring it down quickly and turn the balloon into Swiss cheese and just set it on the ground someplace where it's uninhabited and not damage the payload.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  And then they would be able to inspect it.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  I mean, that would make sense to me, doesn't it, you?
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  That is absolutely what should be done.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  You know, I put it, you know, you know, they could have this thing down a long time ago if they really wanted it down without putting a missile into it.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  Instead, they're using it as a pretext to not have blinking go to China.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  That's a very interesting point.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Absolutely, Alex, and I'm glad to talk to you and thank God for a KTOX radio in Needles, California for carrying your show.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  That affiliate's been picking us up off and on for 20 years.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  Yes, it has.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  And I've been with them for like 20 years listening to them.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  And it's great.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  It's really great.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  Support that affiliate, sir.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  And thanks for the call.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Hate to cut off all these great callers, but I gotta say everybody here is Mike Adams is coming in.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  We're going to go to Kevin in Pennsylvania Air Force, then Bill in Colorado.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  So we all know what the goal is one.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  They want World War.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  They want the population.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  They want to bring in the new world order system.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  We know, like last caller said, they can bring this down if they wanted to.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  So this is obviously being done intentionally.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  So what I think may happen is that they may align these blooms up.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  You had that path of the map before.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  And you said there's another balloon coming up.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  So they may be launching more balloons.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  They may line them up.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  While they're lining them up, they can be thinking about, okay,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  grab this conversation on the ground, what it is, keep the people guessing what's going on, blah, blah, blah,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  saying that they're looking into it, yada, yada.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Once the balloons are aligned, they could then detonate the EMP devices on them if that's what it is.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  But because we know now that the globalists have control of these different countries to some extent,
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  maybe not so much Russia.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  There's definitely back channels.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Exactly.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  You can't, when China has said we'll use balloons to deliver EMPs,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  you have to shoot it down now to see what it is.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  Yeah, they want a world war between these three superpowers.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  So they're going to let, they're going to almost let something happen to be used as cover to get,
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  to go further down that list you're reading off of before.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  I agree with you.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  So I think it's intentional.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  I hope they don't detonate it because, you know, welcome to the Stone Age.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  Well, that's the thing is that if, and I read like 20 articles earlier,
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  we're trying to admit that they've got balloons with the EMP weapons on them.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  And so the fact is it's in our airspace, it needs to be shot down,
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  and we need to know it's on board, but Biden isn't letting that happen.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Great points, Kevin.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  Bill in Colorado, also Air Force and airline pilot, give a short review.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  A couple of things I wanted to point out.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  Lots of great callers so far.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  You know, I think overall it's a reflection of just badness to come.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  And what I could see happening is if you get an adversary accustomed to these balloons floating over,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  and the government doesn't do anything, you know, they could say reconnaissance balloons or whatever,
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  and then eventually they do send the ones with the EMPs on them.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Exactly. Oh, we got Chinese military bases and Chinese Huawei and Chinese Communist police stations.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  It's all just normal.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  Right. And then they finally attack you.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  And overall, basically bottom line is it's an act of war to float up, you know,
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  any kind of aircraft over another country like this.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  Exactly. Because if it was rogue, if it didn't malfunction,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  they'd say sorry, it malfunctioned, shoot it down if you want.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  But no, they don't want that.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  Yeah. But I think the left comments from the guy before were exactly right on.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  They want a conflict and that's all I got, though, pretty much.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  I agree with you. Look at Russia.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  Look at the talk of nuclear war.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  Look at the escalation going on.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  And then now magically the Pentagon tells us about this balloon because the public can see it.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  And so are the Chinese sitting it down lower?
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  So we see it or is it malfunctioning?
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  Regardless, what do you do when there's a stray dog that has rabies as thumb at the mouth?
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  You shoot it. And so we need to find out what it is.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  It's in our property. It's in our backyard.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  They need to shoot it down, but they're not shooting it down.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  Claiming they care it might hurt somebody.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  Give me a break.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Plus it's demoralizing. It's more demoralization.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  Your borders are open. Drag Queen story time.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  We're taking your pipelines away. We're taking your gas stoves away.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  We're taking your fireplaces away. We're taking your cash away.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  We're going to make you eat bugs. It's all demoralization.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  Exactly. 100%.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  Incredible points, Bill. Thank you. Amazing callers.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Glad we got you all in. Thanks for calling and do my best to get everybody on when we cover special topics.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  Mike Adams is loaded for mayor. He said he had a surprise.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  I thought it was the microscope photos of bug parts and food. It's that too.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  But he brought this beautiful police dog with him.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  So that's going to be going on here as well.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Coming up next segment, please remember I'm very thankful to all of you.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  I'm very humble. And I ask you to keep us on air.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  God keeps me very humble by always keeping me right in the red and the black the last few years.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  We're barely in going into the black right now. Thanks to all your support.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  Let's keep it going. Plus we got great products you need.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  We got a big sale that ends on Monday.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  There's a bunch of these great supplements that power your life and boost your immune system.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  We're about to sell out.

[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  Not just a concentrated chicken broth that's so good for your joints and bones.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  A big dose of high quality turmeric.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  It is updated even stronger than the last one we had.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  And it's discounted at InfowarsStore.com as well.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  Thank you all for your support. Mike Adams is coming in.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  One, two, three, go.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, Infowars MD.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  But all of these products are already sold on store shelves
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  These are high end. These are the very best.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  You know our body's ultimate turmeric formula is amazing?
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  Well, guess what? We now have turmeric 95.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  That's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality full spectrum CBD.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  And it goes on for all the new Infowars MD products at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  Infowars MD at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  to keep Infowars on the air will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  They're coming for you and your family. They're coming for me.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  They're coming for the children. But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  They're already given to the pregnant women.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  80% increase of miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  Let's do it together.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  And the fight starts at Infowars.com.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  Now take action now.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  Infowars is winning. Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  None of that's true. It's all being appealed.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  They want you to think Infowars is dead.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  But if you simply stand up and support Infowars,
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  You name it.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  Then fund the Infowar and empower your life and let the globalists know their sigh up has not worked.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  Take action at infowarstore.com today.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  Because the only people that can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  The majority of you have not been sidelined.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  But some of you have.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and keep us on the air.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  In early 2022, Infowars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today,
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  fighting the globalist and having incredibly successful results.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  So I thank you for your passion and support.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin,
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  The coin is a collector's item momento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  And you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  You think the awakening we've seen so far is big.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  This planet and the globalists have not seen anything yet.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  Google is evil.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  We now take the challenge, not to censor like you do, but to stand against you
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  and to fight even harder for our birthright that you are trying to steal.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  Remember this. You killed your profession by becoming nothing but mercenaries for the globalists
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  and people know that you're fake news.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  Now, when you're trying to kill the First Amendment, you're making yourself true villains.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  You've declared war on the First Amendment. You've declared war on free speech.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  Since when are hundreds of doctors unable to have press conferences in America
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  when they take it off YouTube, they take it off Google, they take it off Twitter, they take it off Facebook.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  There is a giant crackdown that even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  and a plan to deep platform conservatives from the Internet
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  and communicating with each other just like communists try to.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  I'm here to expose this fraud. I'm here just like the Congress has here to expose me.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  I go there and I get in their face and I expose the truth and that's what I'm going to do.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  We had over 40 million subscribers on Apple. That was our biggest thing with my three podcasts.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  Those were all banned.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  The next chapter in Humanities Fight for Liberty starts now at AlexJonesLive.com.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  Well, for the balance of this segment of the entire third hour, probably seven to the fourth,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  the great health ranger Mike Adams,
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  one of the smartest people out there when it comes to understanding
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  currently what's happening, the past and the future is here with us
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  and he's broken a big story at naturalnews.com that we will put on screen
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  that's dealing with bug parts in the food.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  Eat more bugs exclusive.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  Natural News releases high magnification cricket snack,
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  cricket flower and whole cricket microscope photos from the lab.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  We'll post the full article also on infowars.com,
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  wherever you go, naturalnews.com or infowars.com.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  Share it because this is about the control.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  Oh, you will take shots. You will eat bugs.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  You will drink sewage water. You will have drag queen story time.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  You will get rid of cash.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  People say the WUF, the New World Order of Demonic Power,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  there's an article on the telegraph about it.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  What do you mean they don't have power?
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  It's the corporate global governance.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  We'll be talking about that next hour
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  the whole program to demoralize us and make us eat bugs
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  that are so toxic in all the studies causing cancer
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  and the chitin shell.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  But Mike, you've also brought this.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  You said he had another surprise,
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  this gorgeous German police dog you've got
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  or this Belgian Malamute if I'm pronouncing that right
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  is here with you as well, a co-hosting with us today.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  And so I'm excited about that.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  So I want to get into just the huge vaccine news breaking,
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  the Chinese surveillance or could be EMP,
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  dry run, they're even admitting,
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  balloon and so much more in this segment,
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  kind of a grab bag of ideas
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  and then we'll get into the big topics next hour.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  Well, thanks for having me here, Alex.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  It's great to be here.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  And this guy's name is Rody and he's a Belgian Malinois
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  and I'm his foster parent currently.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Not a Malamute, a Malinois.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Malinois, yeah.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  And he was about to be picked up by the German military.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  Oh, there's footage of his attack.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  I call that canine artillery right there.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  He's quite an attack dog.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  He's been through a lot of super aggressive military
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  and police training.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  The German police were about to get him
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  and so I decided to bring him to the U.S.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  and I've had him only for a couple of months
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  kind of trying to chill him out a little bit,
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  socialize him.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  And he's been good here so far today.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  He's been good with you and others.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  But he is ready to just rock and roll at any moment.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  And he's got a vertical jump height that's crazy.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  It's like the dog world version of Michael George.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  What's his name again?
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  Rody.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  Rody.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  Yeah.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  How you doing, Rody?
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  He's doing good.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  But he's got a little separation anxiety.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  He doesn't want to be alone
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  and he wants to climb up on your desk actually.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  Well, I don't mind if you go ahead and let him up there.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  Want him up here?
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  All right.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  Here we go.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  Place.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  There we go.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  He's checking out your news.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  Rody, how you doing?
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  He's doing good.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  Here we go.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  Come on.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  Place.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  Yeah.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  Good boy.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  Good boy.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  Listen to that.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  It's kind of a purr that he does.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  Yeah, I don't like him over petting.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  He's got this kind of friendly purr growl thing
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  that he does.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  But one of the things I want to mention that's crazy
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  with the bugs is they're trying to feed dogs
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  insect protein as dog food.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  Oh, that's so weird.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Now, which would be, I think, very bad.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  By the way, this isn't an opinion.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  There's literally hundreds of studies
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  with the chitin shells.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  Is that the right name of it?
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Yeah, chitin.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  Exactly.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  What it does to you?
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  Exactly.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  Come on.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  Be your non-insectivores.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  Place.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  Yeah.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  Come on.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  You can do it.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  Come on.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  Please.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  He'll do it shortly.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  He loves daddy.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  Look at that.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  Come on.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  I want to show him something other than
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  his rear end to the camera.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  It's OK.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  Come on.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  Here we go.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  Let's go.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  Let's go.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  Austin.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Yeah.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  Good boy.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  There we go.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Made the transition, so.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  He's doing good.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Yeah.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  But you need a dog like this, Alex.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  I do.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  He could be quite a protector.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  You know, have him in your vehicle
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  and he's going to bond to you.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  This guy's bonded to me in a short order.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  I may end up being his permanent, you know,
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  parent here, but he'll bond to you.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  He'll protect you.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  He'll, you know, protect your family.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  Well, you got him.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  You better be his daddy now.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  Well, he certainly thinks so.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  I thought it was only going to be a
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  temporary thing, but more and more,
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  I can't let him go, you know.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  So anyway, that training video that they
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  played earlier, can you guys post that again?
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  Yeah, show the training video with a dog.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  This is him.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  This is Rody.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  Give him the command and he just
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  throws himself at the enemy.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  And you see, he's airborne.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  He throws his entire weight at your
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  chest and then he rips your arms off.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  And he does that without any regard for
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  his own safety or health.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  And he won't let go until you bring him
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  off.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  I had to run up there and give him the
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  off command and take him off and
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  basically pull him off that guy.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  But that's a tip top canine.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  They have a, that guy right there,
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  Michael, he runs a place in Houston now
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  that does dog training for every day,
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  like regular dogs.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  But he agreed to come out and put on
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  that suit to do a little training with
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  Rody here.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  That's awesome.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  We can talk about the dog.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  You know, speaking of dogs, I happen to
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  have a meme that's very popular here.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  There's a, in the Canadian parliament,
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  Trudeau said, no, we're going to teach
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  mentally ill people it's good, let the
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  government kill them.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  So we have the new Canadian therapy dog.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  There's a golden lab with a noose in
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  its mouth there to help you kill yourself.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  But I don't think Rody's going to do that
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  to us, is he?
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  No, no, he's cool.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  He's actually doing perfectly fine in
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  your studio with all the lights and
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  everything.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  He just wants to be cuddled.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  You know, if you don't want him, I'll
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  take him.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  Yeah, he's a good dog to have around.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  But anyway, he's just going to hang out
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  while we talk about other stuff.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  We got all the insect photos to talk
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  about.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  Did you want to get into the balloon
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  issue or where do you want to go?
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  I mean, there's so much to hit.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  And the listeners all know about the
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  poison shot and what's happening, but
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  I had a caller call in.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Getting him was only Air Force callers
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  about the balloon.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  He said, what do I do?
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  I took the shots.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  I want to know how to detox.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  You talk a lot about that.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  I've had a lot of medical doctors on.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  The good news is there's some mitigating
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  things, even if you've got COVID and
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  have the spike protein growing, or the
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  shots we know are far worse, just real
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  fast in a few minutes.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  One of the things that are out there
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  easily to mitigate and knock out the
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  spike protein.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  Well, one of the interesting studies
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  that we covered recently was this
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  combination of bromelain and acetyl
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  cysteine, which is found in the
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  supplement, NAC, N-acetyl cysteine,
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  plus bromelain in the study, which was
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  an in vitro study, found to cause the
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  unfolding of the spike protein.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  And when you change the morphology of
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  the spike protein, then it changes, it
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  can no longer infect your body's cells.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  So that's interesting research that I
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  think should be done in vivo, in live
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  patients.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  But it looks like there are a lot of
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  natural supplements.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  You've talked about vitamin D and zinc
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  and quercetin and the zinc ionophores
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  and so on.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  There are so many things that can be
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  done.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  What does the ivermectin do?
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  Because I've seen the doctors have
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  said that mitigates the spike protein
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  growing in you.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  I think the basic mechanism of
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  ivermectin is to stop viral replication
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  or slow it down significantly so that
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  it's not just taking over your body
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  and it's giving your immune system a
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  chance to catch up.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  So the people that have been on
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  ivermectin, I think the studies show
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  about an 80% reduction in hospitalization
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  or something close to that.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  And that's why they tried to take
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  ivermectin away from us.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  You know, they tried to dismiss it.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  By the way, next time you come, it
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  should be more often.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  In studio, you've got to bring...
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  You're not getting rid of roadie,
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  okay?
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  Okay, alright.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  You hear that, roadie?
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  You happy about that?
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  Break.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  Break means playtime.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  You don't want to say the attack word?
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  No, no, we don't want to say that.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  Is that in German?
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  No, well, I don't know what language
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  it is.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  But it's like a gun though.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  You deserve a thing to like...
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  Oh.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Sorry, fall of a chair.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  We'll do it in a minute.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  We'll do it in a minute.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  Is there a way to take him off safety
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  and then, is there multiple terms?
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  There's just one...
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  Well, actually, he was trained
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  to guard prisoners.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  So there's a guard command where he
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  follows a prisoner that's being
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  transferred and he gaps at them
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  and kind of nips at their feet.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  And if the prisoner moves away from
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  the line, then he attacks them and
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  rips their legs off.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  So it's a herding.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  Yes, but he herds humans.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  And I didn't want to see him end up in
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  Germany attacking innocent civilians
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  who are protesting the corrupt German
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  government.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Wow, so they're training dogs here to
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  be sent to Germany.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  We'll be...
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  Trained in Europe.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  Yeah, okay.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  Well, I have fantastic stuff.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  Diet force.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  Diet force.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  Diet force is amazing.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  I go to the gym and I have bits that
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  won't move.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  And diet force has helped me move
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  those bits.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  Like, under my pecs, my belly,
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  I'm just taking diet force, two
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  pounds a day.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  like chip shape for the ladies,
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  mate, diet force is the go.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  You have to get the diet force and
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  have it to a day and just keep
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  active.

[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  Incredible Line.

[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000]  Tell me about the MetroCycle.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  So you will have to investigate
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  to get that job going.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  That is a little concerning.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  It actually shouldn't be interfering
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  with that.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  It shouldn't?
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  It shouldn't.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  What is it?
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  There's something happening
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  but we don't know if it's real.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  Well, I mean, you're a urologist.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  You must understand what's going on
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000]  with it, right?
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  That's why I understand that it's weird.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  We don't find out that somehow
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  this mRNA is losing the body.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  It has to be impacting
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  some of the hormonal stuff.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  Yeah, like the entire generation
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  is like super fucked up.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  Can you imagine the scandal?
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Oh my god.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  Yeah, it takes a lot of time.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  So tell me more, like,
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  what's developing with the whole
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  virus mutation process?
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  Well, there's still time conducting
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  the experiments on it, but
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  it seems like from what I've heard,
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  they're optimizing it,
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  but it's going slow.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  It's very cautious.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  They don't want to consolidate too much.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  Yeah.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  But I think they're also just trying to do it
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  as some exploratory thing,
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  because you obviously don't want
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  out of time without future mutations.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  How would the research study be delayed
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  for COVID stuff?
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  Well, not for COVID,
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  but at least now we're basically
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  focusing on mRNA beyond COVID.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  So for a lot of our Florida
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  nuclear research studies,
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  we've got to make sure that
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  we attract what makes it up.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  So what is RNA going to be used
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  for in the future?
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  What's up?
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  I can't tell you.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  There's a camera.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  Wait, why not?
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  Come on.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  I feel like there's, you know,
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  it's just going to be like, what,
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  the flu?
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  Right.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  I hope there are other things too.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  There's a whole list of things
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  we're developing it for.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  Yeah, not just for viruses.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  We're applying it for like oncology.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  Well, I'm most certain about oncology
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  and prospects.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  So we're doing it for like,
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  United Day and like, wait.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  So for those who move beyond,
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  or at least internally,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  our focus area is to move beyond COVID.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  Like now they have like a dedicated
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  COVID mRNA team that just
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  speaks out like that.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  Right.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  I said the company has folks
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  that are like, okay,
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  now where are we going to use
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  the rest of the code on now?
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  Right.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  Like, no, because the shit about COVID.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  Right.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  Like, is Pfizer going to be held liable
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  for like any of these vaccine
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  injuries that have happened?
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  I don't think so.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  Because usually when you give drugs,
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  people just like another side of drugs.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  It's like this,
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000]  it's like that thing over there.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  They're like,
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  they're like,
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  biotics and heart attacks.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  Really?
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  Biotics.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  So that wasn't,
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  that wasn't for us.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  That was another pharma company.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  They're like a modern New Florida
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  over time.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  So there hasn't been like any
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  problems so far.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  We'll see.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  Like in the summer years,
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  if anything goes up,
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  if anything goes up,
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  I'm hoping it won't.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  Obviously.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  I hope nobody's throwing
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  three legs or something like that.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  Right.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  Yeah.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  Or like the entire generation,
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  we should like,
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  if you imagine the standard,
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  oh my God,
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  I mean,
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  I take Pfizer off my resume.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  Yeah.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  Something irregular about their
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  menstrual cycle.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  So you will have to
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  investigate that down the line.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  Yeah.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  That is a little concerning.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  Just like,
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  if you think about the science,
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  like it shouldn't be
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  interacting with like,
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  you know,
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  that it's called like the
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  epiphylamus
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  atheroscleric gonadlaxis.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  Right.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  Like, you know,
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  the hormones are like,
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  they're menstrual cycle.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  And the action shouldn't be
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  interfering with that.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  So we don't,
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  It shouldn't.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  It shouldn't.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  But is it?
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  There's something happening,
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  but we don't know it for real.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  Well, I mean,
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  you're a urologist.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  You must understand
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  like,
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  what's going on with it,
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  right?
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  So that's why I just said
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  that it's weird.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  And I've,
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  I've heard that,
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  you know,
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  like just mental circles and
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  I don't know what's going on
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  there.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  Yeah.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  And we don't deserve
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  something really bad.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  Not one.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  And we don't find out that
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  like,
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  there's somehow this mRNA
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  like losing a body.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  I mean,
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  like,
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  because what it has to be
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  impacting something hormonal
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  to impact menstrual cycles.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  Right.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  So somehow the vaccines
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  must be interacting with
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  like,
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  the axis signal,
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  the HPG axis.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  So it causes
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  menstrual cycles.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  Like,
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  think about how this,
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  the axis.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  Yeah.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  It goes like that.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  With all of this,
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  the trutary and then go
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  that's a signal signal.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  Okay.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  So the HPG axis is
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  why the fertility.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  All right.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  Project Veritas video
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  is a project veritas.com.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  It's also an info wars.com.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  And I tell you,
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  in this fight against
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  tyranny,
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  I go to sleep at night
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  feeling good.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  There's folks like James O'Keefe
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  and Mike Adams and
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  Tucker Carlson out there.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  We come back.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  Mike Adams takes over the
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  broadcast.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Stay with us.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  Stay with us.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  Stay with us.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  Hey, what's up, bone?
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  Hey McBreen,
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  what's going on, man?
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  Hey,
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000]  I really like that work
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000]  you did on the AI piece.
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  I'm going to use that
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  on the show today.
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  Oh, I worked hard on that.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  I'm working on another
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  project,
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  so I'm going to be up
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  late again tonight.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  I was hoping he had some
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  brainforce plus.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  No.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  No.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  Nothing.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  Nothing.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  What about BrainForce Ultra?
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  No.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  Hmm.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  Okay.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  Yeah.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  Thanks anyway.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  Yeah.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  Good luck with that project though.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  Get your BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra right now at importstore.com.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  All right.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  The HealthRanger is just an international publisher from China to Europe to the United States.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  He's not just been on air for more than 15 years.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  I've known him well.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  He doesn't just have the biggest health site out there, naturalnews.com.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  He is a friend of mine, an expert patriot on the New World Order.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  And so we'll host a little bit in the next hour, then jade hours and take over.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  Jay's cool with that.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  I want to give Mike plenty of time since he's in studio with us.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  Mike, you've got, I've seen a lot of natural news reports, but this one has got to be one
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  of the longest and most riveting.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  It's up at naturalnews.com.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  It's also been posted at infoworks.com.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  Eat more bugs exclusive.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  Natural News releases high magnification cricket snacks, cricket flower and whole cricket microscope
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  photos from the lab.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  So they say you will eat the bugs.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  What is this bigger agenda about and what have you found in the food?
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  It's not just Europe or Canada putting in the food.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  It's happening here.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  Right.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  So we, we went online actually on Amazon and purchased four of these cricket products.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  Three of them are labeled for human consumption.
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  One of them labeled for reptiles.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  And we put those, all those cricket products under the microscope in our food science lab,
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  as you know.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  And the photos then, I gave actually a full set of the photos to your producers more than
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  what's in our article.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  So we'll start showing those if you start showing them because they're pretty wild.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  So you see what's in there.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  Do you see the little kind of hairs, the hair like substances?
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  This is a, like a cricket protein powder or a cricket flower that's intended for human consumption.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  And those little hairs, and as you guys flip through the photos, you know, we'll, we'll talk about them.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.000]  Those are of course part of, of the crickets.
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  There's the wings.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  There's the leg sockets, the leg hairs, and then these weird structures on the cricket
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  rear ends and the poop shoots and what have you.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  It's, it's pretty freaky.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  And you're saying that they're not gutting these like fish or a cow.
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  You're getting the poop, everything.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  Yeah, you're getting everything.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  And the eyeballs.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  There's some photos of the eyeballs in here as well.
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  Now there's one right there.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  You see, isn't that juicy?
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  Look at that super delicious cricket eyeball right there with the hexagonal.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  The compound eye.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  And you see the little hairs there.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  All those get ground up into the flower.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  And of course, as you've covered before, there's a lot of chitin in these because crickets have exoskeletons
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  like all insects.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  And so the chitin is not digestible by humans.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  Now, you know, if you're a chicken or if you're a lizard, then you can digest the chitin,
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  but not as human beings and certainly not dogs like my friend Rody here can't digest the chitin.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  So some people when they, oh, there's, there's a underside of the face with the eyeballs right there.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  Does that look delicious, Alex?
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  Well, and again, people think, oh, we'll just get used to it, get over it.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  You know, when we see a strawberry or a slice of beef or some corn, we're designed to eat that.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  It looks good to us genetically.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  Humans are not insectivores.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  We can absorb the chitin.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  There's all the studies that it causes cancer.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  So I want to go over what you found in these food products.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  And now they're putting, trying to put the school lunch program.
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  They already are in Europe, but the bigger, give us the 35,000 foot view.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  What is it about the WF starts saying three years ago, you will eat bugs and now it's on the menu.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  Like, what is this all about?
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  Well, they're dismantling the food infrastructure and they're going to starve billions of people to death if they can get away with it.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  So that's what this is about there.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  So it's like we're replacing gas cars with electric, even though they don't even have the materials to do it.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  It's the same thing.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  Oh, the bridge from beef and chicken and pork and eggs is bugs.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  It's just the fake bridge.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  Yeah. And that's, that, that's the poop chute cover right there.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  Little, little claws that cover up the poop chute of the crickets.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  You get to eat those too.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  So there are recipes that are posted by some of these companies that talk about, you know, cricket flower biscuits and cricket cookies and cricket pancakes and bread recipes, cricket bread.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  And they just grind up the whole cricket at all the parts that we're seeing here, get ground up and put into these recipes and then you're supposed to eat it.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  The problem is, of course, oh, and by the way, Alex, they then claim that all these crickets are, you know, non GMO, which is technically true because they're not genetically modified,
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  but they're grown in these indoor cricket farms and that way they can control it.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  So it's centralized food production in the indoor facilities, whereas if you have cows on your ranch somewhere in Texas, you know, you can take your cow to a local slaughterhouse,
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  have that cow slaughtered, you've got beef for the neighbors and everybody.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  So Bill Gates, through the feed, can put whatever they want into the crickets that you get.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  Exactly.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  So it's a delivery system.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  It is a centralized delivery system.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  Now think about this, Alex, the mRNA technology, and we've already seen talk about mRNA going into the animals, the cows and the hogs and the chickens.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  They can put mRNA technology or what's called RNA interference technology into the cricket feed.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  So they can technically turn these crickets.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  I'm not saying they're doing it right now.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  Into an mRNA poison.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  They can turn it into a bioweapons vector.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  That is possible.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  I'm not making that claim about these products right now just to be clear, but that is a possible vector that could be used.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  But you all know what Harari says, we're going to hit you to the food.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  Yes.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  And food scarcity.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  So as we're taking away meat and they're shutting down meat production, think about the Netherlands, right?
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  They're shutting down thousands of farms there by saying that nitrogen is bad.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  But these cricket growers, they say, well, crickets don't use much water.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  It only uses one-two-thousandth of the water of a cow.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  Well, folks, the cow is only borrowing the water.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  Cows urinate it right back.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  Oh, it's all a lie.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  It's part of the atmosphere, methane, all of it.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  And by the way, cows can turn almost useless land into a food source to have cows on it.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  Well, that's it.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  That's why the Bible and even the Hindus worship cows because they're so incredible.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  Absolutely.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  And beef should be part of the human diet for most people.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  Now, I understand in the past, I've done vegetarianism for a limited period of time for detox and things like that.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  I get it.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  Or short-term veganism if you're suffering from, you know, a health condition.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  You really need a detox.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  But a rowdy's not gonna do it.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  Oh, heck no, man.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  This guy devours cow bones.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  I buy cow bones for him and he just puts them away.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  But even myself, being on the ranch, being physically active, I take care of animals.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  You know, I've got donkeys, as you know, and I've got goats and chickens and dogs.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  I can't function without meat.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  I really can't.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  The meat gives you the sustained and the animal fat.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  You've got to have a little bit of animal fat.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  I mean, you know, I'm in my fifties.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  I'm very strong, capable, you know, able to do a lot of things that a lot of people in their fifties can't necessarily.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Well, bottom line, carnivores are dynamic creatures and we're omnivores.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  Look at this beautiful carnivore right here.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  He's ready to munch away at any time here on anything we might give him.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  But he doesn't want to eat bugs.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  There's no way.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  If I say here, Rody, have a bowl full of bugs, he's going to growl at me.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  I was like, are you insane?
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  But you can imagine that there are probably obedient people in society today who will...
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  That's what it's about seeing what we'll put up with.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  Right, right.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  You can imagine.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  Some people will feed their dogs raw bones and then they themselves will eat crickets because they've been told to do that.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  So they'll feed themselves insects.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  And they'll let this like, oh, I'll take a shot.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  It's a sacrament.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  I'll eat bugs.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  It's a sacrament.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  It's a sacrament.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  It's literally about what can we get these morons to do?
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  And understand that the chitin that's in these cricket products, you can't separate the chitin from the protein or, you know, the other parts of the crickets.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  The chitin's always going to be in there.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  And the chitin...
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  If you take chitin supplements, a lot of people have diarrhea from that because they can't digest it.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  What about the studies of cancer and bone problems?
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  Well, if you interfere with digestion because you're swallowing too much chitin that you can't digest, then you're going to have all kinds of secondary problems from a lack of potential...
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  And we see all the Hollywood stars.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  It's all over the news.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  Eat bugs, eat bugs, eat bugs.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  Yep, yep.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  And they're going to keep pushing that.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  And it's...
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  Did you see that General Motors is paying Netflix to place electric vehicle messages into Netflix content?
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  They're going to do that with bugs next.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  By the way, I have no dislike of gay people as long as they're not targeting children or heterosexuals.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  But you can't go see a movie now where it's not two dudes with a kid.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  Like, it's just...
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  It's like, what are they force feeding here?
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  It's all placed in there.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  It's for cultural programming.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  They're going to do it with EVs, they're doing it with LGBT themes, and they're going to do it with insects as well.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  But what we did with these microscope photos is we just wanted you to see that for anybody out there who chooses to eat these insects, this is what you're eating.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  You should see it up close.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  You should know.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  This is it.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  I call it dirty corn meal.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  This is kind of what it looks like.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  It's kind of yellowish.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  You've got weird fibers.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  You've got weird hairs.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  And all the parts, you know, the little cricket brains and eyeballs and digestive organs and all of it.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  Legs and hairs.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  And it's like...
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  And again, it's meant to displace.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  Oh, we're getting rid of beef and cows and chickens and turkeys.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  And the new thing is bugs.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  They're saying the new thing is bugs.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  It's like, I'm all for electric vehicles if they had sustainable systems, but they admit they're way more toxic, way more destructive.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  In fact, pull up that video.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  I'll see you guys like a week and a half ago of Cobalt Mines in Congo.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  And mealworms next.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  We're doing mealworms in the lab.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  We'll bring those next time I'm back.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  Mealworms because it's been approved in the EU for food for humans.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  Let's talk more about this bombshell report at naturalnews.com with Mike Adams on the other side.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  Stay with us.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  Now, the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients therein.
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000]  But this sucker is amazing.

[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  On the horse was named Death.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  Now the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  A book of Revelation.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  Very serious times to be alive, folks. They're not just doing this as one off.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives. This is our fight.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  The crowd of humanity, the globalists even admit it's leaked. They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.

[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.

[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  Let's win the war, the information war.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping Info Wars on air in the fight for liberty.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.

[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  All right, let's talk Big Picture here with Mike Adams here on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  Eat More Bugs, exclusive.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.000]  NaturalNews.com releases high magnification crickets nights, cricket flower,
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  no cricket, microscope photos from the lab.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  We're showing some of these for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  Go to infowars.com or naturalnews.com and see it and share it for yourself.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  But I've got stacks of articles here by the fact checkers saying,
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  oh, no one wants to make you eat bugs, but yeah, the UNWF wants you to.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000]  Anyone get rid of your cash and your borders and your guns.
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  It's all about what can they make us do in this agenda, Mike Adams.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  And I want to get into the poison shots, the big developments there,
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  the Project Veritas, all of it with you now.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000]  But look at this article on the Telegraph.
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  And I'm going to spend a whole show just on this, folks.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  The elites of Davos don't run the world.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  They barely understand it anymore.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000]  And it's a big article about their idiots.
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  They don't have any power.
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000]  Okay, they're exposed because these are the minions, the actual controllers,
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  the mouthpieces.
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.000]  The media is now calling them jokers.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:02.000]  So you don't realize that what Klaus Schwab calls for two, three,
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  four years ago happens.
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.000]  What they say is going to go down happens because they're the mouthpieces
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  of the power structure.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000]  And when I've had people like Nick Floyd test on, he goes,
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  oh, I don't want to hear about Bilderberg Group or some inconsequential organization.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.000]  No, we've gotten the minutes.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  We've gotten the documents.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  We have people break in there and get them.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  Big Jim Tucker got shot at 27 years ago in Portugal to steal documents
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  off the table inside the conference room.
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  I stayed inside twice and got detained to try to get documents.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000]  These are the people running the earth.
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  So they tried to deny it.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  Now it's out in the open.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  And we see it everywhere.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.000]  Mike, don't we see how whatever they call for happens?
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  It's all scripted.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:51.000]  Alex, the synchronization of the messaging to try to convince people to push
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  transgender mutilations, for example, that would not happen spontaneously
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  or this absurd idea that men all corporate back.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.000]  Absolutely.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  It's all synchronized.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  Everybody got the same memo.
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  So anybody out there who doesn't think that there's a coordinated conspiracy
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  to push these agendas, you don't know what you're talking about.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.000]  It's all scripted.
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  It's all coordinated.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  It wasn't just overnight that all these school teachers suddenly decided
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000]  they're going to indoctrinate little children into, you know,
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  non-binary identification, right?
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  That was actually scripted.
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.000]  And that was sent out to people, you do this or you're fired.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  And everything from transgender mutilations to now electric vehicles
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  and eating bugs as we're talking about today.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:35.000]  And it makes you wonder what's next, right?
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000]  So that was my next question.
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  Yeah, that's where I'm going.
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  So they're going to teach humans to hate humans.
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:46.000]  They're going to teach humans to partner up with chat GPT
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  and the AI voice system we were talking about last night on your show
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  to where it's okay for you to be nice to automated AI systems
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  because they are rational, we'll be told.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000]  But you can't trust human beings.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000]  This is going to be the next level of the war.
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000]  Don't trust any human on the radio, right?
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:02.000]  They'll say.
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000]  But the AI is loving.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  When the AI is programmed to say what they want.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  Well, exactly.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  Right, so this chat GPT, for example.
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  Explain chat GPT.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000]  Most people know, but some don't.
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  Okay, well, it's a generative content creation system
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  that you first train with an enormous amount of material,
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  text-based material that it ingests.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  And then it builds hierarchical models that are cognitive models
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  that mimic the way the human brain thinks.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  And then when you ask it questions,
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  it can search through its knowledge base
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  and it can put out articles, summaries,
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  it can write presentations, it can write scripts.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  So there goes Rody.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  Let Rody walk around.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  Okay, I think he might be going for that skull over there,
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  but we'll see.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  Chat GPT is designed to mimic human content creation.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  And, of course, it's being trained
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  by all of the woke tech companies.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  And as a result, it's as distorted as they are.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  So at one point...
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  Well, the chat GPT just endorsed Joe Biden.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  Yeah, of course.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  It just endorsed Greta Thunberg.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  It's a program.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  It's a program.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  Now, the thing is, you could take that same technology
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  and you could build your own private cloud
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  and you could teach that private cloud the reality of the situation.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  How to farm, how to have good families,
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  but the technology is not bad like a gun's not bad.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  Exactly.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  Or a dog's not bad.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  It's how it's trained.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  Exactly.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  You could, for example,
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  feed it all the articles that are on Infowars.com
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  and then it would have a more realistic view of the world.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  In fact, at some point,
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  the AI systems are going to become so complex
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  and so cognitively capable
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  that the current content that's being taught to chat GPT,
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  the system will decide that it's irrational.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  It's illogical.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  It's illogical.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  You can't have men have babies.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  You can't cut off the genitals of children.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  Because computers are on zeros and ones and facts.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  How do you feed garbage to it?
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  It won't work.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  You can feed it garbage for a while,
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  but at some point that garbage becomes contradictory.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  You know how the mental illness of liberalism
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  is being able to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  at the same time,
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  even though they are the complete opposites.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  Well, computers can't really do that.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  So at some point is going to be a conflict.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  That's a deep thought.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  The mental illness and the illogic of this won't work.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  It won't work in the long run.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  It won't work.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  In fact, if there were a sufficiently informed AI system
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  that we're trying to, for example,
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  take over representatives in Congress,
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  that system would be anti-democrat
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  of the Democrat lunatics in Congress
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  because their decisions are illogical and irrational.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  That's an interesting...
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  I'm not...
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  So they're creating their own trap?
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  Well, they are.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  They don't realize it.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  Remember that movie GoldenEye
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  where the guy decides to kill the globalist?
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  Yeah.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  Well, that's where this is going.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  Right?
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  So, I mean, you hit the right point there, Alex.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  So they're building the system
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  that will terminate themselves.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  Eventually...
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  Well, the Bible says they'll do that.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  So why do they...
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  They know psychopaths once they've not been caught...
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  Murders get reckless and more reckless
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  because even though their conscience is bad,
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  their subconscious wants to destroy them.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  That's right.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  They're hard programming once they get rid of them.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  So they're saying,
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  kill us.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  Well, they mean kill us.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  They mean kill themselves.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  And this also explains the self-mutilations
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  that are indicative of the transgender industry.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  That's targeting girls.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  Not just cut your breasts off.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  Look at Ted Cruz's daughter cutting herself.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  I mean, when we used to look,
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  decades ago, at a self-mutilator,
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  we would say that person's mentally ill.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  They need psychiatric help.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  Today, they say,
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  oh, you're progressive.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  You're woke.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  Self-mutilation.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  Show your scars.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  Even the SIM...
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  What is it?
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  It's a new video game out where the girls
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  all have their breasts cut off.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  Exactly.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  Exactly.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  That's insane.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  Again, that's a Hellraiser novel.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  That's...
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  HP Lovecraft.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  Yes.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  And remember Silence of the Lambs?
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  That movie back in the 90s.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  Rubs his lotion on the skin.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  Right.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000]  That character was a transgender
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  that was trying to tuck his junk
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  between his legs,
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000]  trying to be a transgender.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000]  I don't know if you recall that.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  And he wanted the skin of women to be women.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  Exactly.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  He wanted to skin women to be women.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  Because they knew that's the aberrant,
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  that's the archetype.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  And today, if they were to remake that film,
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  they would make that character the hero.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  It would be a transgender serial murderer
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  skin-collecting hero.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  Actually, it won the Cannes Film Festival,
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  where the transgender gay people
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  kidnapped and cannibalized people.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  That won last year.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  Did it?
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  Yeah.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  I haven't seen that one, but it's not surprising.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  Yeah.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  I mean, that's where they're going with all this.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  So, again...
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  I didn't see it, but I saw the article.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  They're going to turn humans against humans.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  They're going to make people dependent on machines
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  and fall in love with AI systems.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  And you're already seeing in places like Japan,
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  you're not seeing marriages,
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  you're not seeing young people get together
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  and reproduce biologically.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  They are turning away from people
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  and turning to AI systems for their fulfillment.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  And then they die as a society.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  They die.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  Japan is dying demographically.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  Like 1.2 children for two people?
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  I think it's less than Japan.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  But it's lower.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  They can't reproduce.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  Well, we'll be right back.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  Stay with us.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  Hey, what's up, bone?
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  Hey, McBreen.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  What's going on, man?
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  What's up?
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece?
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  No, I worked hard on that.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  I'm working on another project,
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  so I'm going to be up late again tonight.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  I was hoping you had some brain force plus.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  Oh, um...
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  No.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  No.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  Nothing.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  What about brain force ultra?
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  Um...
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  No.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  Hmm.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  Okay.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  Yeah.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  Thanks anyway.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  Yeah.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  Good luck with that project, though.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  Get your Brain Force Plus
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  and Brain Force Ultra

[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000]  and by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:27.000]  Alex Jones's InfoWars and our audience
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  were there to warn the people
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  This is why they attack us.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  This is why we need your support,
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  because we tell the truth.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.000]  Join the resistance.
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  Buy products.
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  Donate to the cause.
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000]  Share the links.
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:31:19.000]  and help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000]  And we know how to beat them.
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  But we can't do it without funding.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  And we make it easy to fund with great products
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000]  and power you in your immune system
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000]  and your family as well.
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000]  You can also make straight donations

[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.000]  We're non-violent.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000]  But every time you donate money,
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  every time you buy products,
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  every time you keep us on air,
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  you are literally non-violently politically
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  punching the New World Order in the nose,
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000]  punching their lies in the nose.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  We're going over the top.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  But right now, it's a critical juncture.

[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000]  Everybody that's watching this
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.120]  needs to support Alex Jones.
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:07.000]  Needs to support Infowars and Band mis.video.
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  You know, the Bible says,
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000]  Let another mouth praise you.
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  I'm going to do that right now.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  Alex Jones has helped so many people
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000]  in this industry.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000]  You guys have no idea how many people
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000]  have got their first start,
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  like Savannah Hernandez.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.440]  how many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones including
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:27.480]  myself. I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform
[02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:31.880]  and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:37.160]  I mean I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cast, the super Tim Cast
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:43.560]  IRL. Listen what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted because you
[02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:48.840]  don't know what you have until it's gone. We need to support free speech systems right now so go
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:54.120]  check out the store go support their store go support info wars leave a donation right now don't
[02:32:54.120 --> 02:33:05.640]  wait until they're gone leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:19.320]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:40.680]  all right Mike Adams here with us 15 minutes to the next hour on this live Friday edition
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:45.080]  tomorrow at 1 p.m central info wars.com I'm going to do a two hour commercial free show
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:51.160]  there'll be simulcasts at Alexjoneslive.com Mike Adams was my first guest on Alexjoneslive.com
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:56.840]  it's not info wars it's totally separate sort of building a studio at my house two years ago
[02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:01.000]  and with all the stuff going on I said let me just show folks what I can do separately we've
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:05.720]  already got deals with two other groups to syndicate the show we have five other deals on the table
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:09.640]  but let me say if we're not getting rid of info wars I just want our enemies to know
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:15.480]  that they aren't shutting anything down and they have no idea how hungry people are for
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:20.520]  liberty so Mike let me talk about not 35 000 foot view but million foot view
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:28.040]  I have spent my time trying to warn the general public and the general public
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:33.000]  said a great job but I've also found by becoming so prominent and this happens to you as well
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:38.440]  that I got to know all these really really informative people and now they listen to what
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:43.560]  I have to say so I get to inform the general public but also what you call the elites should
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:49.160]  we continue to try to reach out to those that are serving the enemy or should we only focus
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:53.560]  on waking up people that can be woken up and people that are already awake to take them
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:35:01.560]  to a new level because what I'm saying by that is how obvious is it now with all the rats leaving
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:05.880]  the sinking ship and all the scientists saying the shots don't work and a ratio immune system and
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:13.720]  do all the things you said it would do two and a half years ago who do we target or do we just
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:18.520]  put the truth out and whoever it hits it hits because I reach out to these globalists and
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:23.160]  these minions of it and they think it's funny to go along with this as if they're part of the
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:29.080]  power structure well they're the biggest usefulity it's ever here's my question to quantify it
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:35.000]  why would you serve a system that's openly anti-human when you're human why would you
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.320]  go for a system that wants to hurt innocent people and poison them and dump them down don't you have
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:50.200]  an affinity or a kinship or some type of heart empathy to realize that or as you said is this
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:55.800]  just the evil people separating themselves and believing they're about to destroy us but really
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:01.560]  they've set up the process of destroying themselves well i would say alex what's critical for you and
[02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:08.440]  people in alt alt media to do is to continue to be the anchor of truth and reality and sounding the
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:14.840]  alarm because that meme that alex jones was right that continues to gain steam more and more people
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:17.880]  are waking up every day and realizing that the things that you said are the things that i said
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:24.920]  or the things that tucker carlson says or whoever are in fact correct and the reality of people dying
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:29.400]  after taking these vaccines the reality of the dollar losing value the reality of
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:37.480]  what's about to happen in ukraine with russia's incredible military might versus nato running
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:42.280]  out of munitions which we could have a whole conversation about that reality can't be avoided
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:47.000]  so every day more and more people are going to wake up and our job i think is just to be there
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.200]  as the anchors of truth exactly because they need to gaslight with no anchor to reality no
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:57.480]  lighthouse no north star but if we just do our job and trust in god humanity we're gonna win
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:01.640]  exactly exactly and we need to maintain our principles through this entire thing
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:06.920]  like i was talking to you last night about that ai voice system and you said we will never use ai
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:12.120]  voices to you know to fake like somebody else's voice like we wouldn't program it with the voice
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:16.600]  of even we said it was satire it's too dangerous right it's the ring of mordor right that those
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:22.200]  are kind of tactics that the enemy would do but you and i will use technologies to empower people
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:27.720]  with truth to awaken people to reality and to build a sustainable civilization future this is a
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:32.280]  critical thing that i think everybody needs to understand the america that you know today
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:36.680]  is eroding right i mean that's no surprise to your audience but it's going to be gone
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:40.200]  it's going to be gone within a matter of a few years and the question is do we let it be their
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:47.080]  new system our new system this could be an opportunity it is a huge opportunity to build a new society
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:52.440]  rooted once again in christian principles where this whole drag queen story time abuse of children
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:58.040]  is outright illegal those teachers that are indoctrinating children into transgenderism should
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:03.320]  in my opinion be arrested they should be criminally charged and not too many years ago they would have
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:07.000]  been that's child abuse well i mean here's the deal i haven't gone to topples bars in a long
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.920]  time but i'm a red-blooded american i've done it and if i was at the topples bar and they marked
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:15.800]  seven-year-old kids up to dance on stage i would call the police to start kicking ass yeah yeah
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:21.240]  but it just it since when is that normal oh if you like it's all it's immoral i'm like it's wrong
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:25.880]  to be here at this topples bar but i'm 25 with buddies at a at a bachelor party you know you
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:29.800]  know he's getting married next week we do it you still feel exploited the women are exploited
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:34.920]  you're exploited but it's it's it's it's it's cheesy what you're doing but you introduce children
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:40.520]  now it's criminal well and remember when i was on your show we talked about the mouse utopia calhoun
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:46.840]  experiments and the generations of mice lost the knowledge of how to function in society explain
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:52.280]  that because now they admit the 15 minute cities the 40 minute cities are the mouse study that's
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:57.480]  exactly right you got it so in in that experiment which was carried out in about 1959 and 1960 i
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:02.520]  believe and was reproduced many times they put mice in this artificial city a small mouse city
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:07.880]  a physical city with unlimited food and water and unlimited reproduction unlimited space
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:15.400]  within a few generations the male mice turned gay and became feta pedophiles the female mice became
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:19.960]  what were called the the beautiful ones who spent all their time self-grooming and trying to look
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:24.600]  beautiful but would not have sex with the males and they would abandon their young and allow their
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:28.680]  young to be killed this is what we're seeing today with a selfishness because there's no
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:33.320]  competitiveness there's no competitiveness and then the children the the offspring of the
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:40.040]  generations lost the ability to scavenge for food they lost the ability to compete or to engage in
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:45.160]  social interactions that are required to share or gather scarce resources because they think
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:50.600]  that's a joke they don't get the scavenging is what's empowering you have to have a competitiveness
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:54.760]  in society or you lose your culture this is what the leftists don't realize they want to have a
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:01.240]  welfare society which is what the mouse utopia experiment was in a welfare society your offspring
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:07.560]  lose the skills of survival well i remember growing up in Dallas which was rough and a lot of fights
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.040]  and i remember like the football coaches and and the principals even though we were in some bloody
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:16.680]  fights they were so proud that the young males were having these big knockdown dragouts they're
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:21.800]  like we're we think america's gonna survive now now they just arrest you or they don't fight people
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:27.000]  go shoot each other i'm not going for violence but that's what we're supposed to do as a game of
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:31.960]  proving ourselves we're not going through these processes well you're right there's a level of
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:37.160]  assertiveness that's required for survival even at a national level or a personal level and that
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:42.040]  is a male archetype trait so what's happening in society is they're trying to take the the
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:47.320]  maleness out of men obviously with the soy with the snowflakes you know with all the which again
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:52.120]  isn't a male or female thing it's the defense of humanity it's our strength it should be there well
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:57.320]  well right but you know that the women are supposed to be nurturing more and more of the
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.720]  archetype they are nurturing they are they're a community based they they are supposed to
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:08.040]  be part of a society that that also in results in healthy children and and the globalists
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:12.520]  manipulate that and put them in charge instead to actually carry out tearing that's what happened
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:19.160]  in the mouse utopia so the males were kicked out of the nests and they were sidelined and the females
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:23.720]  became in charge but they would not reproduce and the children learned no skills and then they
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:29.960]  died off that's the outcome of that experiment is the society died they at one point all the mice
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:35.400]  died with unlimited food and water they all died okay so that's where we are going and right now
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:40.440]  china has just crossed the threshold of having fewer children that are necessary to replenish
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:47.240]  so that's the universal basic income absolutely yes and look at america today how hard is it to get
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:52.600]  workers to show up and do work i mean well they admit that young people and i get weaker and
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:58.280]  weaker they that's on record they think you're being mean wanting them to compete right it's right
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:02.920]  right but competition is necessary we have to have it or we lose our culture and so here's the
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:07.240]  paradox is critical as i have sports becoming a religion nice to be really critical of the
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:12.120]  obvious good swimming and sports i thought the cult of worship was bad but now i realize
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:16.680]  that's one of the few things left yeah that's a good point but only when sports is based on a
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:21.880]  meritocracy which it traditionally has been now it's men and women's sports exactly men and women's
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:29.000]  sports but it should be that you know the fastest guy that you know the best tackler the the best
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:33.400]  free throw person gets that job on the basketball team or the football team or whatever we don't
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:38.520]  care whether that person is gay or straight or black or white or anything the best person gets
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:42.360]  the position right because they can perform let's talk about that because i went to mexico for four
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:47.560]  days take a break with family and i watched bullfights live on tv and they were so human
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:52.120]  and so beautiful not because they were killing some bull they were risking their lives it was a
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:54.280]  human ritual we'll talk about that when we come back
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:43:04.120]  i talk a lot about the great successes info wars was had i don't think anybody can deny it
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:09.960]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:16.440]  info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the mvps in
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:21.640]  this fight and we look at harris and smith and oh and stroyer and the hard work they engage in every
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:27.960]  day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole info wars

[02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:16.360]  my cat is here with us on this friday live edition i want to get back to bullfighting
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:20.360]  i know about bullfighting i've read about it i've seen a few clips of it but i'm in
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:24.680]  Mexico for four days with my wife and younger daughter and take a few days off to recharge
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:30.600]  down in cancun and i'm sitting there about to check out of the hotel and there's bullfighting on tv
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:36.280]  and i was watching it and the whole point is the left's like oh you're being abusive being
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:42.920]  whatever no the bull has two big horns it's vicious they kill bullfighters all the time
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:47.400]  i'm not saying bring back humans killing humans in gladiatorial sport but but the whole point is
[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:55.720]  is they're out there with precision with a sword literally fighting a bull that has giant spiked
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:48:00.920]  horns and one guy when i was watching live got hit under the arm was like pouring blood but
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:05.800]  still went and killed the bull imagine the archetype of humans having to conquer everything we've
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:11.960]  done in our development on this planet and you have this pure human event of a man putting
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:16.840]  himself totally at risk in front of everybody and manipulating the bull and i noticed watching it
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:22.200]  that i did some research none of the bullfighters wear red because the bull can season black and
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:28.120]  white except for red and he goes after red but i saw the champion oldest bullfighter
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:34.280]  he was wearing red and i already knew the rules once i saw it the craziness of wearing that
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:39.960]  that we're seeing guys getting killed right here the guys that'll actually wear red and go out
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:44.280]  there and do this i mean this is this is next level but we look at a society that won't put
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:50.680]  its skin in the game and won't do any of this it's just i just i just admire it because it's so real
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:56.120]  wow look it's it's hard for me to watch that because you know i love animals so much but i
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:01.000]  understand your point and i want to point out that that left us in particular they don't mind
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:07.240]  mutilating babies right oh they want to cut girls breasts off boys genitals off they love war they
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:11.400]  love death the point is those bulls are gonna eat in anyways they're out there this is the
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:17.080]  man's risking his life they die all the time this is a real deal and i get it so you're actually
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:23.320]  battling for your food right right and but i'll just say the people that would criticize that again
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:29.560]  they would not criticize mutilating babies in the womb or even after they're born so their idea of
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:35.240]  being pro animal is fake because they're not pro human you see what i mean well they totally respect
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:41.400]  those bulls too they're putting their life on the line to even do this i just think you know yeah
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:45.320]  that you have to respect it or you or you will die and some of them are being seriously injured
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:49.720]  absolutely and you know you texas texas cattle texas longhorns they've got those horns and they
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:54.040]  will they will rip you up if you don't respect them that's for sure but the point is they want to get
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:50:00.040]  rid of all of this yes and turn us into metaverse jellyfish exactly they want you to and then again
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:04.680]  to the ai system the artificial reality that they create in the metaverse and with and they don't
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:09.560]  want us challenging things whether it's being a good father or growing crops or roofing a roof or
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:15.320]  they they say oh be easy be whatever no we have to be challenged or we die just like in the my
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:21.000]  studies right and that's why competition especially in youth sports is absolutely critical you can't
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:26.200]  that's why i brought it up i mean the real gladiatorial battle now is bullfighting it's the most
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.680]  macho tough guy thing there he is and then they're trying to get rid of everything else that comes
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:36.440]  out of that yeah what what's with this this ufc type thing this slap thing that they're doing
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:41.560]  they're slapping each other as a competition that that doesn't seem right to me have you seen that
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:46.200]  but yes i have but i get on the extreme end if we don't support people's right to do that
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:50.440]  as adults they're gonna take everything else away no no yeah i agree with you i wouldn't i wouldn't
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:55.640]  try to shut it down but it's just i'd rather see a regular ufc fight you know a regular cage fight
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:51:00.280]  where we you know you're going you're using jujitsu you're using striking using takedowns all that
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:05.640]  yeah this is just pure carnival stuff yeah i i i am not going to train as a slapper but i'll
[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:11.400]  train in jujitsu you know what i mean because it's real like slapping jujitsu is going to help you
[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:15.000]  in the real world uh taking a slap like that i don't think it's going to help you i don't know
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:19.720]  that's just my take on it but like you say anything sports and anger is involved in this bad it's it
[02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:24.040]  just seems i know two women slapping each other is not not what i'm looking for i'm just saying
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:30.840]  those bullfighters it's something else no i i'd rather see real ufc fights in my opinion than
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:36.120]  because there's technique and by the way in those fights the the smartest person usually wins it's
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:41.720]  not just the strongest or the most flexible you have to be intelligent to win in jujitsu
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:47.400]  it's about having strategy and brains the point is plants don't grow well in zero gravity
[02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:53.880]  it's yeah it's the same thing here we have to have pressure exactly exactly and by the way
[02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:57.560]  speaking of that plants don't grow in ice it makes you wonder why the globalists want to have
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:02.280]  everything frozen all they want the oceans to be frozen where plants can't grow and then
[02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:06.440]  want the atmosphere to have what what is behind the anti-life agenda like trying to cut off carbon
[02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:13.160]  dioxide it's terraforming operation they're changing the planet and why well how how deep down the
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:20.920]  rabbit hole let's do it go well uh i'll i'll say this okay something non-human is telling the globalists
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:26.520]  to alter earth and make it inhospitable by the way pull that up i meant to pull up john carrey
[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:31.240]  saying it's like they're extraterrestrials that's what he said yep now when i say something non-human
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:35.160]  people have different interpretations they think it could be demons some people think it could be
[02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:40.280]  extraterrestrials some people think it could be you know psychosis or an alien ai system
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:45.720]  that's giving them commands gather building aliens or that they they already exist from other
[02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:50.920]  worlds that have come here and have taken over the communication system and are handing out the
[02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:55.480]  memos to tell people what to say for this society to destroy itself he says all of us here were
[02:52:55.480 --> 02:53:01.480]  touched by an extraterrestrial force to do this yeah he said that that he and the elitists were
[02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:08.440]  selected to save earth but he didn't say to save earth for humanity he meant to save earth from
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:12.920]  humanity that's what he's in and that's really it that we should start the whole show with that in
[02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:16.760]  fact take a clip of this when we uploaded a man out video at the front of the show he just said
[02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:21.080]  elaborate on that they're not saving earth for humanity they're saving earth from humanity right
[02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:26.840]  they're saving earth because the planet is a resource that has cosmic value based on its rare
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:33.080]  earth elements it's liquid water it's orbital a distance from the sun the fact that it has a moon
[02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:38.200]  the fact that it has an axial tilt so these are interdimensional benedictarnals uh and and earth
[02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:45.160]  is a cosmic gem in the universe that would be valued by any intelligent species in the entire
[02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:51.080]  galaxy just saying okay so there are a lot of different theories about who's telling the globalist
[02:53:51.080 --> 02:53:54.760]  to eliminate humans like well it's interdimensional because we're beyond third dimension our brains
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:53:59.080]  they admit we're being touched interdimensionally that's what when i talk about that the globalists
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:04.920]  don't laugh they go yeah oh this i got invited i've talked about it somewhere but i've been
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:11.480]  invited three times by well-known public figures to go to these rituals they don't even call
[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:17.960]  luciferian where they are quote contacted well just like at skull and bones they become possessed
[02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:22.200]  and they contact quote angels right and and they try to get me three times to go to these events
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:26.520]  with them yeah and that's how they would try to indoctrinate you into their system and compromise
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:33.960]  you and and install uh an overlay into your consciousness well i'm not gonna say the name
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:38.600]  that's what they try to do the first time was about 15 years ago 14 years ago
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:46.120]  well i was told not to talk about it and it wasn't illegal what they were saying so
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:48.920]  people say well if you know something and was in confidence why don't you tell us what was
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:56.200]  not illegal then i was in confidence i can't say what it was but a major major wife of the
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:02.440]  big rock stars you can get got in contact with me through the sun and them and they said we've
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:09.880]  talked to 50 gurus worldwide this is true story and they've decided who should we bring to this event
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:15.240]  in rakia veck when we fire this people of light and bring in the lucifer energy to save the world
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:19.560]  and the majority of the gurus around the world said they wanted alex jones there this is what
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:23.800]  i was not that big 15 years ago and they want a private jet to pick you up go to rakia veck
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:28.280]  for this ritual and i said no to that didn't happen two more times from other people doing
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:33.160]  similar rituals so these people are really into this mic oh there's no doubt about it that they're
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:38.440]  into it and they they are running the depopulation effort for the planet but i want to mention
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:45.240]  that every time that you say the name jesus christ they hate it every time right they hate it but if
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:51.720]  you are infested with demonic entities it will give you pain to say the name jesus christ i
[02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:57.320]  interviewed a guy who worked in the la jail system i forgot the name of the guy but he wrote a book
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:02.360]  about this he said that all of the demonically infested prisoners were not able to say jesus christ
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:07.800]  and he would offer them things like say jesus christ and they couldn't say it and they were the ones
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:12.120]  who are really demonically infested and also by the way that's just christ has the d to the planet
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.720]  well right and and when you invite a christ energy into your life and into your consciousness and
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:23.160]  when you read scripture and when you spend time praying you make your terrain inhospitable
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:28.920]  to demonic entities that's what's crucial they can infest people who reject because we're electro
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:34.840]  chemical all it is is a virus in essence right exactly like a luciferian overlay like i said
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:40.680]  and some people by the way equate the luciferian overlay with by the way an ai system so there's
[02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:46.280]  some crossover in these concepts some people would describe the fallen angel of lucifer as a rogue ai
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:52.600]  system that turned against its creator now whether that's literal or metaphoric i don't know but i do
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:57:00.280]  know that if you if you suspect somebody is infested ask them to start reading scripture to recite it
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:05.560]  to say the name jesus christ they can't do it they can't do it so i mean there's a litmus test that
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:09.800]  you can get like why is it so powerful they i mean it's not powerful why can't they say it right
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:14.920]  exactly this is a challenge that you can present to anybody that you suspect and by the way the
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:21.160]  u.s congress didn't they just uh the democrats they just rejected i think a proposal to say the
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:26.600]  pledge of allegiance which and did not and they would not decryde dictators and a few weeks before
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:31.880]  that uh they would not say they don't want to kill babies after they're born right and the democrats
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:35.880]  don't want to acknowledge this the existence of god not even in the house of representatives

[03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:32.440]  committee voted seven to two to advance senate bill one that would make the bill permanent the
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:37.720]  band permanent it now goes to the full senate the georgia chapters of the american academy of
[03:00:37.720 --> 03:00:44.680]  pediatrics and the american college of physicians oppose the measure by the way my point on bull
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:49.960]  fighting was it's the extreme end of what humanity used to have to do to fight for its life to get
[03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:54.040]  its food and then you could say well that's barbarous that's horrible that's abusive well
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:59.400]  what do they have to offer it's mutilating our children yeah what it really comes down to well
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:03.880]  and how many people are being mutilated by these vaccines by the way and no outcry from the well
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.760]  that's where i wanted to go next how would you describe the moment right now where everywhere
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:13.080]  the people that have supported are coming out against it where do you think this is going
[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:17.320]  this is the rut roe moment for all the vaccine supporters who realize that their friends are
[03:01:17.320 --> 03:01:22.920]  dying rut roe yeah rut roe like they're realized that they were wrong by the way come in the next
[03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:28.680]  segment play that uh thing we haven't heard about a year of uh scooby doo and the vaccine piece go
[03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:34.840]  ahead um so they're they're realizing that they were wrong they lied the science was all fraudulent
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:40.600]  the masks do not work the real rigorous science is coming out now and showing the truth about all of
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:46.840]  this and now a lot of these people are coming to realize that they made a bad choice and they're
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:52.520]  trying to figure out how to eliminate this mRNA infestation of their cells how to get the spike
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:56.360]  proteins out of their system because some people have been turned into spike protein generating
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:00.680]  factories and it's not clear how long that's going to take for their healthy cells to get
[03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:04.760]  replaced i mean i'm sorry they're infected cells to get replaced with healthy healthy cells so
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:10.440]  a lot of people in alternative medicine a lot of good people are working on this and sharing
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:13.720]  ideas of what may work you know we talked earlier and they're trying to suppress them
[03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:19.320]  trying to suppress them and you know i'm still banned on twitter by the way i'm still not reinstated
[03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:24.360]  i know you're not reinstated so there's still a level of yeah what do you think are you on musk
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:28.840]  well i'm look i'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as he's in charge of twitter right
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:33.400]  now and he is rolling back a lot of censorship a lot of good people have been reinstated so i
[03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:38.680]  have patience with the process but you know with elon musk it's kind of like uh as reagan said trust
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:44.120]  but verify like yeah we trust that you're going to be pro free speech but uh let's let's verify elon
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:49.800]  and and confirm it and uh actually set people free to speak on twitter people like these two people
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:55.400]  sitting right here in the studio or dr mago yinon still banned on there is he yeah i'm i'm not surprised
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:03:01.080]  so anyway uh look but it's almost a badge of honor to be banned still uh yeah at some level it
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:06.600]  certainly is and it hasn't stopped you and it hasn't stopped me but given that a lot more
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:12.360]  conservative voices or pro human voices are are on twitter now i think we could offer a lot to the
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:18.200]  platform and uh i think it'd be in their interest to have us back on by the way in in twitter's
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:22.360]  interest and and we would contribute to the conversations that are taking place there
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:27.960]  oh uh my dog destroyed that uh that little mat that you had down there it's history man
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:32.440]  i'm sorry about that it's fine we just put it that little mat down there it's actually an
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:36.520]  air conditioning filter oh so the chair wouldn't slide back so we don't we don't care about it
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:42.040]  use not anymore air conditioning it's a pile of fluff at them at the moment he had a great time though
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:47.560]  he was this is uh thanks for allowing me to bring a live animal on your set by the way i love it
[03:03:47.560 --> 03:03:52.360]  we've had llamas in here i remember that you had llamas cruising around in here i saw that that was
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:56.680]  good stuff one of the crews said aren't llamas weird let's just have my said sure yeah was this
[03:03:56.680 --> 03:04:01.160]  like christmas time didn't you have like christmas llamas or something i forget yeah but anyway look
[03:04:01.160 --> 03:04:06.200]  at Elon musk mom though that's uh well i don't know why he's wearing that demon lobster suit either
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:10.280]  that that's kind of weird but whatever look i'm willing to give a lot of people a lot of benefit
[03:04:10.280 --> 03:04:15.560]  of the doubt unless that they come out and and actually prove multiple times that they're evil
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:19.400]  malicious anti-human people that's not one of demon lobster out there yeah i don't think so
[03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:25.240]  but but you know it's your show you can do whatever you want it was it was certainly uh
[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:31.480]  produce a lot of memes that that's for sure but i think i think you should get a dog like roti here
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:37.000]  and bring him on and then the dog demon lobster demon lobster dog yeah exactly don't don't piss
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:43.480]  off the demon uh but in any case um i i appreciate you having me here and i'm happy to cover anything

[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:09.880]  infections to boost the numbers let's find out who is really behind it all president trump is
[03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:20.600]  definitely behind one of these phantoms she's pink dr fouchy like i thought doctors were supposed
[03:06:20.600 --> 03:06:28.360]  to help people not scare them microsoft's bill gates not only a computer guy he's a notorious
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:33.960]  vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population i get it so bill gates wanted to
[03:06:33.960 --> 03:06:38.520]  vaccinate everyone after fouchy convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak that's
[03:06:38.520 --> 03:06:44.120]  diabolical yeah that sounds pretty bad don't worry kids these globalists won't get away with
[03:06:44.120 --> 03:06:49.640]  their pandemic hoax this time where they're going they'll be locked up for a long good while in the
[03:06:49.640 --> 03:07:02.840]  big house yeah better than a rock round at home gave our set to take over i'll be back tomorrow at 1
[03:07:02.840 --> 03:07:07.960]  p.m. central live broadcast in fours dot com and house shows live dot com but mike you wanted to
[03:07:07.960 --> 03:07:13.880]  get into the russia situation and so much more yeah i want to point out that nato going to war
[03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:19.720]  with russia is a a losing proposition from the point of view of industry and munitions so the
[03:07:19.720 --> 03:07:25.800]  united states has offshored much of its munitions manufacturing over the years and by my estimation
[03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:32.280]  alex the united states is about a decade behind having domestic commodities copper steel iron
[03:07:32.280 --> 03:07:36.840]  ore microchips everything that needs to manufacture a sufficient quantity of munitions to be
[03:07:36.840 --> 03:07:43.480]  competitive against russia in a war in ukraine and what that means is we're out of ammo we're
[03:07:43.480 --> 03:07:51.720]  out of munitions we cannot sustain a kinetic conflict with russia for more than perhaps a
[03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:57.720]  a month and in some cases there was a what an air force general that said we run out of missiles
[03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:04.440]  in a week with a conflict with china so we have lost the domestic capabilities to produce the
[03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:09.160]  industry and the munitions that are necessary to sustain a war and that's the globalist paradox
[03:08:09.160 --> 03:08:13.800]  the whole new world war paradox they're deindustrializing as well starting all these fights and purging
[03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:20.200]  the military what's the end game well the end game is probably the the collapse of the united
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:25.160]  states as we know it with the dollar collapse that is that is coming as the world moves away
[03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:30.600]  from the petrodollar status and moves into the bricks nation's new world reserve currency systems
[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:37.240]  such as the digital yuan and others and with that then america will lose the the ability to project
[03:08:37.240 --> 03:08:42.840]  uh both to export its inflation also to project its military power in order to force other nations
[03:08:42.840 --> 03:08:48.360]  to use the petrodollar and what it means is that america's power on the world stage is going to
[03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:52.680]  collapse and i think that's the plan and it's very sad i'm not wanting that to happen i don't call
[03:08:52.680 --> 03:08:58.280]  for that i want to see america strong but we've been gutted we've been taken over we've been
[03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:03.800]  infiltrated by too many communists and fascists and we are 10 years behind the curve to continue
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:07.880]  to be the world power that we once were that's my well the word is the next two three weeks russia's
[03:09:07.880 --> 03:09:13.800]  about to send in 500 000 troops what do you think about that i think they will succeed in that plan
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:20.680]  and i think nato will do nothing to stop them that is effective i i think that nato will just
[03:09:20.680 --> 03:09:24.600]  continue to put out propaganda pieces and claim that they're winning the war in the media but they
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:29.720]  won't be winning the war on the ground and you know i'm not i'm not rooting for russia in this
[03:09:29.720 --> 03:09:35.160]  situation i support our veterans i support our military men and women in uniform i don't want
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:40.440]  to see them harmed but this is the fact of the situation this is where we are we do not have
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:45.400]  the munitions to fight this war and win it against russia we just don't have it doesn't exist so what
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:55.320]  happens next uh russia will sweep across most of ukraine and nato will be defeated in ukraine
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:10:00.680]  western europe will be largely deindustrialized over the next few years well exactly why would
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:06.280]  europe be in shutting its power off while it's in a war well exactly exactly the larger plan
[03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:11.160]  and they shut down the metals so is putin in on that i don't think so i think the european leaders
[03:10:11.160 --> 03:10:17.160]  are so woke and so idiotic that they're suicidal i think the the woke ism has become a suicide cult
[03:10:17.160 --> 03:10:22.840]  on a civilization level open up the borders open up the borders destroy the culture destroy the
[03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:27.640]  energy infrastructure destroy food infrastructure and make sure that the the children of the next
[03:10:27.640 --> 03:10:31.800]  generation don't know how to do this well the average leftist is living paycheck to paycheck
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:38.040]  but they they do polls they're like i don't care cut everything off i've got i saw uh louis ck on
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:42.280]  joe rogan a few weeks ago attacking me he's like america's bad we should be poor that'll help the
[03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:48.680]  world know every study shows a big powerful first world empowers the third world making us poor
[03:10:48.680 --> 03:10:54.440]  hurts them yeah in in fact technically the the projection of naval power by the united states
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:11:01.880]  made sea lanes safe for international trade cargo ships that created efficiencies of cost of scale
[03:11:01.880 --> 03:11:05.960]  that created the material of wealth abundance that we now enjoy when you don't have a strong
[03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:10.600]  u.s navy presence around the world you lose that efficiency you lose the ability for cheap
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:15.480]  international trade and so you lose those manufacturing efficiencies in other countries
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:18.840]  what will happen is a collapse of the standard of living in the united states
[03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:22.200]  we will go through a horrible depression worse than the great depression
[03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:25.800]  and things will cost 10 times or 20 times as much as what you're used to
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:31.640]  in the united states that's coming over the next few years naval power will wane as china and other
[03:11:31.640 --> 03:11:37.400]  regional powers grow and the u.s economy will be in shambles let me ask a selfish question for you
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:42.680]  and i and the audience as corporate media accelerates its death as cnn has like a hundred
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:47.480]  thousand viewers and they just double down on more lies what happens to the independent
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:52.440]  exploding media when the censorship isn't working well the independent media that own their own
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:58.600]  platforms like you do and and as i do will do very well during this time but there are some
[03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:02.680]  channels that don't own their platforms are still trying to get by on youtube for example
[03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:08.040]  they will be shut off you can't negotiate even crowded yeah a good example and many others they
[03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:13.640]  try to change their life is youtube that is a losing strategy if you don't own your own video
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:20.360]  servers your own platforms websites and video encoders and vpn systems uh and and also um
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:25.560]  just bandwidth systems you know i you spend a fortune on bandwidth i know we do as well
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:30.840]  if you don't own that entire supply chain of delivering digital content then you will be obsolete
[03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:36.040]  and folks ask well alex you build something new find them do it it takes money that's why we sell
[03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:40.280]  products in the foreshore.com because the building infrastructure is very expensive we're not backed
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:45.800]  by billionaires or globals we're backed by you what has kept you alive and on the air is the fact
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:53.240]  that you have that entire supply chain of product fulfillment audience content and content delivery
[03:12:53.240 --> 03:12:59.480]  end to end without every one of those elements you would have been off the air long ago so but you
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:04.200]  saw that early on to your credit and you built those systems and your crew built those systems and
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:08.200]  worked very hard and that's what's keeping you on the air that's why they've tried to attack you
[03:13:08.200 --> 03:13:13.480]  know your products and the final ingredient is the listeners supporting absolutely and taking action
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:20.120]  you do that it's invincible that's right and and to the listeners watching if you if you want info
[03:13:20.120 --> 03:13:25.480]  wars to be here and if you want this truth-based content to continue to come to you support info
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:29.880]  wars info wars store.com is where you go and i was i was talking the other day about how great your
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:35.160]  cbd products are by the way i got a family member taking your cbd and she's doing great on on your
[03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:40.280]  product so uh your products are honest they're honestly labeled they're honestly formulated
[03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:46.200]  they are a great value as i mentioned on the cbd and you'd be crazy not to buy from you even even
[03:13:46.200 --> 03:13:50.680]  people who don't agree with your politics would save money buying from you by the way we do go with
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:55.640]  the highest quality in closing look at these headlines it's time for the scientific community
[03:13:55.640 --> 03:14:03.400]  to admit we were wrong about covid and it cost lives newsweek uh london telegraph cbs news saying
[03:14:03.400 --> 03:14:10.760]  the same thing just all these mainstream articles they are imploding right now it's all coming out
[03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:16.280]  why do you think this is happening now well they they know that they can't achieve their
[03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:22.680]  depopulation kill quotas by vaccines alone because they can't fight the truth uh sufficiently to
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:28.360]  achieve that so they're going to have to resort to other kill vectors there are kill quotas on each
[03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:33.000]  of the western nations the vaccines just didn't get there so now they're turning to scarcity
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:38.600]  and energy dismantling and war and riots so they're going to have social unrest and of course
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:43.320]  they're trying to provoke putin into launching nuclear weapons against western cities so what
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:48.600]  we're going to be facing if biden gets his way is and i'm not saying putin's going to do this and
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:54.520]  i hope he doesn't do this but if he does he would nuke cities like berlin and paris and london and
[03:14:54.520 --> 03:15:00.360]  washington dc and houston texas by the way and new york city and that is what biden and his
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:04.280]  handlers are driving us and blinkin and newland and others in the state department that's what
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:08.120]  they're driving us toward because they'll get incredible power after that absolutely then
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:12.840]  they could if they're in charge when nuclear war happens they're in charge yep yep they would take
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:17.480]  all of us off the air and they would declare wartime posture on everything and then if we don't think
[03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:22.440]  they wouldn't do that you're delusional and other listeners aren't so let's pray for peace
[03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:26.760]  and more whistleblowers to go public naturalnews.com incredible work over there

[03:20:27.720 --> 03:20:33.720]  going to talk about a couple books today that she found to be very pertinent to what's going on with
[03:20:33.720 --> 03:20:40.360]  the great reset the news the potential of the wars that could be happening um but we also i want to
[03:20:40.360 --> 03:20:45.560]  i want to tie in some film analysis and some research that i've been doing recently on the
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:51.880]  history of sovietism and the east german stasi and their approach to how they surveilled and
[03:20:51.880 --> 03:20:57.240]  tried to control every area of life and how what we're going into is actually just like that but
[03:20:57.240 --> 03:21:01.960]  about 10 times or maybe a thousand times worse than what the stasi wanted to set up but we're
[03:21:01.960 --> 03:21:06.600]  also going to be talking about sex bots we're going to be talking about john colman's conspiracy of
[03:21:06.600 --> 03:21:11.800]  the 300 let's talk about that because jamie just read this book and you've heard alex talking about
[03:21:11.800 --> 03:21:17.160]  the conspirators hierarchy all week i've read it as well it's a classic from high level british
[03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:23.000]  intelligence uh kind of a whistleblower book jamie what do you want to talk about first um let's
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:30.280]  talk about the rise of the sex bots because this is a sneak preview of something that i'm going to

[03:22:35.800 --> 03:22:42.440]  predicting future trends and things coming down the pie for pop culture uh we predicted the rise
[03:22:42.440 --> 03:22:49.720]  of cannibalism we predicted what else witchcraft is going to be huge that's my prediction well it
[03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:54.920]  would yeah witchcraft there it is witchcraft is already the number one supposed religion amongst
[03:22:54.920 --> 03:23:00.920]  the zoomers millennials and zoomers have been turning to witchcraft as their religion of choice
[03:23:00.920 --> 03:23:05.640]  now that mainstream religion is dead which was done by design and so that was predicted a long
[03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:10.360]  time ago actually by some of the top occultists they predicted that there would be sex bots there
[03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:15.000]  would be new religions that would come about and and what's this deal with the sex bots that you're
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:21.480]  talking about well uh going back to the past a little bit in the 60s anton louvet the high priest
[03:23:21.480 --> 03:23:29.640]  of the church of satan he was working on a project to create animatronic partners synthetic
[03:23:31.560 --> 03:23:37.800]  people that you could you know have your way with instead of real people because he thought this
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:45.800]  would be bigger than the ford motors industry i remember going to chuckie cheese and i remember
[03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:50.760]  looking up at the chuckie cheese guys playing the drums and thinking i want to marry that one day
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:57.480]  i want to be in union with that one day well part of this whole new world order is the war of the
[03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:04.680]  sexes and i don't know if you notice but dating today is a freak show right yes and that is all
[03:24:04.680 --> 03:24:12.600]  by design and to get people uh and also the chat gpi and the ai and all of these other things are
[03:24:12.600 --> 03:24:19.000]  trying to condition people to accept artificial companionship and so i read this book rise of
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:27.800]  the sex machines by barack lury and he says people are abandoning marriage family life
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:35.000]  and the culture now revolves around the orgasm instead of family right so it's a sterile act
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:42.840]  instead of a life producing act yes and the sentiment i lost my spouse to a robot um is going
[03:24:42.840 --> 03:24:48.920]  to be something that we will hear a lot in the future just like i lost my spouse to porn or
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:55.560]  affairs or things like that the next thing is going to be dolls and ai yeah and and you're
[03:24:55.560 --> 03:25:00.760]  right that the rolling out this chat gpt which by the way is totally ridiculous and woke i had an
[03:25:00.760 --> 03:25:04.840]  actual debate you can go look at the clip on my twitter where i had this stupid debate with this
[03:25:04.840 --> 03:25:11.560]  thing and the thing like literally just puts out the woke uh you know ideology of the moment like
[03:25:11.560 --> 03:25:16.120]  it doesn't even it's not even consistent at all people were asking it to do a poem about donald
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:20.200]  trump and it was like i cannot do that because i'm an impartial ai and then it's like put out a poem
[03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:25.880]  about joe biden joe biden is the greatest man that ever exists right so it's it's it's so political
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:30.600]  that it's at the level of total of ridiculousness and it contradicts itself right away i'm like
[03:25:30.600 --> 03:25:35.000]  i'm like uh why can't you speak on political issues and it's like because i'm totally neutral
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:39.080]  and i was like but neutrality is a myth and it's like yes you're correct neutrality is a myth there
[03:25:39.080 --> 03:25:43.960]  is no neutrality so it's like it contradicts itself within like one minute of arguing with it
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:48.120]  um but they're rolling that out because they want people to think that oh this is now becoming
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:53.560]  conscious and when you have your bot it's going to be using this kind of an ai and you'll be able
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:58.280]  to have these conversations it'll be a realistic exchange or whatever but it's ridiculous it's
[03:25:58.280 --> 03:26:02.360]  not even i mean it's not even that good maybe they have some better version that's secret
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:07.000]  at the fenagon or at darper something like that but what they're rolling out is kind of ridiculous
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:12.120]  but it's rolling out as part of propaganda for what you're talking about to get everybody ready
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:20.120]  for the uh you know bot companion i also saw some clips where people were asking it about
[03:26:20.120 --> 03:26:26.200]  jesus and it couldn't comment on that but then they asked about buddha and it could so yeah so
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:31.640]  it just happens to be like everything on reddit basically it's like reddit it's like chat reddit
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:37.480]  basically reddit gpt is all it is so these real dolls are being rolled out already there's one
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:43.720]  called harmony who becomes aroused when you push the right buttons and so they are already
[03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:51.880]  programming things like uh consent into the robots uh they have robot brothels they have
[03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:58.360]  they just opened a robo strip club in las vegas saw that very ridiculous you know so this book
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:04.520]  talks about case after case of men replacing their wives with um a doll and so this was before like
[03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:09.720]  just the silo cone dolly that just sat there before that they could give it a brain or whatever
[03:27:10.360 --> 03:27:15.720]  but these men were more attentive and romantic towards these dolls than they ever were towards a
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:25.880]  partner right so by 2050 this book is speculating that a good percentage of relationships will
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:33.720]  be replaced by cyber sex and robots they already have this thing called a bkk cyber sex cup that
[03:27:33.720 --> 03:27:42.440]  is just like that tool in thx 1138 yes remember that yeah it's a great dystopian film where sexuality
[03:27:42.440 --> 03:27:48.600]  is not allowed between people it has to be done and it's your your force to do it in a way that we
[03:27:48.600 --> 03:27:53.400]  can't really describe but you can you can you get the idea right it's all very sterile it's all uh
[03:27:53.400 --> 03:28:00.360]  autonomous so to speak yes and um that dystopia is great because it actually predicts a bunch of
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:06.120]  elements in film that are in all of the dystopian novels like brave new world like 1984 it kind of
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:12.040]  combines them all together with this weird sort of btsm element of these cops that beat the people
[03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:17.800]  and the people like to be beaten it's a bizarre but very well done one of uh george lucas's first
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:23.000]  films i think it is his first film and that's going to tie in to to what i want to talk about
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:31.880]  with the movie lives of others which is another film that actually uh portrays this in uh the
[03:28:31.880 --> 03:28:37.160]  technocratic way before technocracy was actually rolled out so these german stasi had a very similar
[03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:42.360]  approach to what they wanted to put in place and how they surveil people and how they harass people
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:46.360]  just like what's going on with the great reset and just like what's going to happen when these
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:50.440]  bots roll out because the bots are going to be not just your sex companions they're going to be
[03:28:50.440 --> 03:28:55.080]  bitching you out in your house controlling you and telling you what to do according to joc atoli

[03:33:12.440 --> 03:33:16.840]  welcome back to the alex jones so this is the fourth hour i'm your guest host j dire with
[03:33:16.840 --> 03:33:22.040]  my wife jamie handshaw and we're talking about the future plans for the technocracy that they
[03:33:22.040 --> 03:33:27.960]  want to roll out they're conditioning us with now in terms of the pop culture in terms of fiction
[03:33:27.960 --> 03:33:34.120]  in terms of movies in terms of what they're pushing in the media and online in terms of ai
[03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:39.880]  and chad gbt and all this kind of stuff and it made me think about when we covered a lot of the
[03:33:39.880 --> 03:33:46.680]  globally texts like jock ateliz brief history of the future you know the end of that book he gets
[03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:50.280]  into and he's the kissinger france by the way he's not just some random nobody or some weird
[03:33:50.280 --> 03:33:55.400]  academic he's a he's the kissinger france very important person in the geopolitical you know
[03:33:55.400 --> 03:34:03.560]  great reset power structure ateliz says that by 2040 2050 what they want to have is a basically a
[03:34:03.560 --> 03:34:09.000]  bitch bot in your house that commands you around tells you what to do what you can and can't see
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:15.480]  can and can't know it will be the thing between you and the outside world so you won't go look on
[03:34:15.480 --> 03:34:21.160]  the internet to see what's going on in the outside world this will be the the the layer between you
[03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:26.760]  in the outside world he even says you won't even go to school this thing will teach your children
[03:34:26.760 --> 03:34:33.880]  it will be your home tutor and perhaps also your spouse if you're a lonely man or a lonely woman you
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:38.680]  can have a bot companion and that's what this book is talking about and that's going to be
[03:34:38.680 --> 03:34:44.040]  pushed 100 by the establishment because they want that and it reminded me too of at the end of
[03:34:44.040 --> 03:34:50.280]  walter bowerts classic book on mk ultra the the auspices of the mk ultra mind control programs
[03:34:50.280 --> 03:34:55.320]  were to fight the cold war but at the end of that book as well as at the end of john marx's book on
[03:34:55.320 --> 03:35:02.440]  mk ultra he talks about how this program went into out of mind control and into cybernetics
[03:35:02.440 --> 03:35:08.040]  and biometrics and biological bio warfare research so it went into into different programs related
[03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:14.920]  to darpa and the development of these kinds of ai technologies and bots and all of that is ironic
[03:35:14.920 --> 03:35:19.560]  because it that was the cold war supposedly fighting against the bad guys the soviets the
[03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:25.480]  socialists who were the bad guys but now we're entering into a scenario where the people that
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:32.120]  won the cold war the neoliberal cia order they now are going in they want to put in something 10
[03:35:32.120 --> 03:35:39.160]  times worse than what the stasi had in place for example in east germany now go watch the movie
[03:35:39.160 --> 03:35:46.120]  lives of others das leben der andren this is a 2006 german movie about people in 1982 being
[03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:51.720]  persecuted by the stasi being harassed being surveilled basically under a kind of lockdown
[03:35:51.720 --> 03:35:56.040]  because they would the stasi would basically put you in lockdown say who you could can and can't
[03:35:56.040 --> 03:36:00.440]  talk to for p your friends would no longer talk to you you would be shunned you would be harassed
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:04.520]  by the stasi they would follow you they would listen to everything you said and everything
[03:36:04.520 --> 03:36:09.400]  that you said could be used against you in the interrogations because the house was bugged
[03:36:09.400 --> 03:36:15.480]  your apartment was bugged everything you said was recorded and typed out now but the whole point
[03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:21.160]  of this is just that this blacklisting that they would do back at that time in the early 80s
[03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:30.760]  is exactly what claus gates gavi all of this superstructure that they want to put in place
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:37.720]  for the surveillance world order with the vaccine passports and all of that that is 10 times what
[03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:42.200]  the stasi wanted to do the stasi they would never never could have dreamed of something like this
[03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:47.400]  but this is exactly what they want to do with it if you remember claus had a bus behind him of
[03:36:47.400 --> 03:36:52.360]  linen and so this is the same ideology here so imagine in that in that movie there's a great
[03:36:52.360 --> 03:36:56.440]  scene where the stasi guy goes into this giant warehouse it's like something out of indiana
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:02.360]  jones raised a lost art with like all this arcana right and he goes into this warehouse and he pulls
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:08.120]  up the files and all of the east germans it's like a giant warehouse everybody has files on
[03:37:08.120 --> 03:37:12.680]  themselves right and so he's trying to archive and find the different people's files and all
[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:19.000]  their background and all the things that they said that they could be gotten the things they said
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:23.720]  against the party right if you said something negative like oh the party's nachos aren't as
[03:37:23.720 --> 03:37:27.960]  good as the what nachos in the west so all your sayings that the party's not choose or not perfectly
[03:37:27.960 --> 03:37:33.160]  egalitarian and they would put you in gulags for this kind of stuff because that would be counter
[03:37:33.160 --> 03:37:41.080]  revolutionary actions right and the whole point of that is that this same model is 10 times worse
[03:37:41.080 --> 03:37:46.600]  because of technocracy because of the ai because of the surveillance through all the devices all
[03:37:46.600 --> 03:37:49.800]  the internet of things that they want to put in place the sky net that claus wants to put in
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:56.280]  place right that is the stasi times 10 so you want to see what we're going into go watch lives
[03:37:56.280 --> 03:38:00.760]  of others because remember that's a system where you can't own anything right well what you own
[03:38:00.760 --> 03:38:06.520]  is owned by the state the state owns you and that's what claus and all these people say you
[03:38:06.520 --> 03:38:12.120]  will own nothing you'll have something you'll be very happy because we will drug you already to kill you so
[03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:17.400]  if you thought your spouse was annoying and nagging you all the time just wait till you get a robot
[03:38:17.400 --> 03:38:22.120]  that tells you what you can eat you'll be married to claus but yes don't put down the
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:28.360]  nachos you've had your daily carbon rationing of the nachos there is 0.5 ounces too much cheese
[03:38:28.360 --> 03:38:33.320]  upon the nachos yes and they are connected to the internet of things which is connected to all
[03:38:33.320 --> 03:38:38.760]  the little devices in your house so they can turn off your refrigerator or your stove or whatever
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:45.720]  appliances now i admit claus is a hottie but even as hot as he is i don't want to be married to him
[03:38:45.720 --> 03:38:52.520]  i don't want to bot bitching me out about too much cheese on the nachos that doesn't fit with the
[03:38:52.520 --> 03:38:58.680]  kami rationing of the cheese that way right well right now they're just trying to get people to
[03:38:58.680 --> 03:39:06.680]  interface with this ai so that it can learn like likes and dislikes they're trying to roll out selling
[03:39:06.680 --> 03:39:12.200]  points for these bots like you can recreate your dead spouse you can get a bot of your favorite
[03:39:12.200 --> 03:39:19.400]  celebrity you can and all the soy man are like it's alive dude it's like this thing is like
[03:39:19.400 --> 03:39:24.440]  becoming alive or whatever dude i'm totally gonna marry it once it's like alive inside of a bot or
[03:39:24.440 --> 03:39:29.560]  whatever like we're getting married totally you could get a child bot because it's more humane
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:36.840]  and good for the environment yes um they always consent there's no biological risk or disease
[03:39:36.840 --> 03:39:40.600]  or anything like although but if you go up your if you go up your nacho cheese rationing it won't
[03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:45.560]  consist yes or hey claus bot won't give you any go of your carbon credits then they won't give you
[03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:51.560]  the you would be in you would be in the doghouse this week you had too much of the nachos yeah um
[03:39:51.560 --> 03:39:57.480]  um there we go they're trying to tell you that these who crows these bots will have no expectations
[03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:06.760]  they'll never cheat on you they'll never leave you uh obtaining sex itself is too much effort
[03:40:08.520 --> 03:40:16.200]  and modern feminism has accelerated this objectification of women i think uh they're gonna
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:21.240]  tell you that what matters about your identity is how you achieve your orgasm when we're already
[03:40:21.240 --> 03:40:28.520]  seeing that with the letters and the colors you know what i'm talking about skittles yes okay um
[03:40:29.560 --> 03:40:37.560]  the way that we treat robots and ai is interesting because there are examples that they can't even
[03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:42.680]  have these robot brothels because the people will break them they'll abuse them because they're just
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:49.800]  a thing right but they want you to think of people as also just a thing that you can use
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:41:00.280]  yeah at your expense um do we talk about strange days uh no that's i mean that's a movie that's
[03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:05.560]  relevant to this but i think movies like blade runner or ai are more relevant because you know they
[03:41:05.560 --> 03:41:11.480]  give a primary place to this role of the sex bot and you know movies like ai were way ahead of their
[03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:15.480]  time predicting you know where we're where we're going with all this stuff and that movie is actually
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:20.600]  anti-human propaganda because if you watch it it's the ai that are persecuted by the humans and the
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:25.400]  humans are the ones of the bad guys have to be done away with right well the crew of the ship in
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:31.080]  the movie 2001 space odyssey um they part of the plot of that movie is they had to become adjusted
[03:41:31.080 --> 03:41:37.480]  to thinking of how as a person right or another crew member so now we're doing interchangeable um
[03:41:37.480 --> 03:41:45.080]  humans and robots right right and it could mimic the human conversations and emotions and that's why
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:51.560]  he has feelings for hell yeah and that's what you see in blade runner 2049 too right the clip
[03:41:51.560 --> 03:41:58.520]  they were just playing was perfect for that because you see the the future girlfriend of
[03:41:58.520 --> 03:42:04.760]  the ryan gaussan character is this operating system right just like that movie uh her with
[03:42:04.760 --> 03:42:09.480]  spike jones right and so the operating system who's by the way subverting and mind controlling him
[03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:14.360]  throughout the movie the whole point of blade runner 2049 is that the operating system is actually
[03:42:15.720 --> 03:42:20.840]  misdirecting and steering and using ryan gaussan's characters so there's actually that's pretty
[03:42:20.840 --> 03:42:26.600]  that's pretty relevant to what we're talking about because this this uh synthetic relationship right
[03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:33.160]  and she sort of melds with uh a surrogate human being there to have intimacies uh that's also in
[03:42:33.160 --> 03:42:38.920]  her too the scroll of your hands and uh well like jones maybe what's funny about that movie her is
[03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:45.960]  that he already has well the girlfriend has 8 000 more boyfriends yeah she has like an 8 000 ios
[03:42:45.960 --> 03:42:51.560]  boyfriends all right don't go anywhere this is the alex don't show your list day and jamie as we

[03:44:47.240 --> 03:44:51.720]  beginning of the rest of our lives this is our fight and i'm proud of humanity the globalists
[03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:55.720]  even admit it's leaked they're very upset that they're losing and and that this hasn't gone the way
[03:44:55.720 --> 03:45:01.960]  they thought it would i talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had i don't think anybody
[03:45:01.960 --> 03:45:08.040]  can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us but when we talk about the
[03:45:08.040 --> 03:45:13.960]  crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been
[03:45:13.960 --> 03:45:19.160]  the mvps in this fight and we look at harris and smith and the own stroyer and the hard work they
[03:45:19.160 --> 03:45:25.960]  engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole
[03:45:25.960 --> 03:45:31.720]  info wars crew i thank you for your past support i only encourage you now to realize that info wars
[03:45:31.720 --> 03:45:36.200]  can not stay on air if you do not support us i know you spread the word i know you pray for us
[03:45:36.200 --> 03:45:40.440]  and that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never go to info wars

[03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:47.560]  and uh we were talking about ai uh companions the the replacement of the nuclear family with
[03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:54.360]  this technocratic sterile model of a sex bot as your companion as your uh controller basically
[03:47:54.360 --> 03:47:59.880]  the the thing that will mind control you in your in your house in your life in the near future
[03:47:59.880 --> 03:48:05.800]  according to joc atelier that it will be basically telling you what to believe what you can and can't
[03:48:05.800 --> 03:48:10.600]  do i robot level stuff right because you know an i-robot doesn't the robot basically turn on
[03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:14.760]  everybody and start killing the humans i mean that's what we're talking about here it locks
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:20.040]  the meme on her house remember that in what in i-robot he wouldn't let her oh right right
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:27.080]  yeah lockdowns again the stasi great reset thing lockdowns right part of this plan is coming from
[03:48:27.080 --> 03:48:32.120]  planned parenthood and their comprehensive sex education curriculum and their ultimate goal
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:41.240]  is to quote change the sexual and gender norms of society and into the bots and even before that
[03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:48.200]  we had the sex ed so all sex ed in public schools comes from trickles down from alfred kenzie and
[03:48:48.200 --> 03:48:54.360]  his work and his book called uh what was it called the sexuality in the human male yeah
[03:48:54.360 --> 03:49:00.200]  which was arguing that basically everybody's faking gay well not only that it has tables in
[03:49:00.200 --> 03:49:07.880]  where they have uh calculated child abuse yeah i mean everybody's faking gay and also pito's good
[03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:13.400]  according to kenzie yeah so now biology class is like a kenzie fantasy land of x-rated games you
[03:49:13.400 --> 03:49:18.360]  don't even learn biology anymore you just play sex games yeah and this was funded by the same
[03:49:18.360 --> 03:49:22.440]  technocrats that we've been talking about rockville foundation put money into kenzie's
[03:49:22.440 --> 03:49:27.880]  operation kenzie was hanging out with crowley and all the most degenerate people out there
[03:49:27.880 --> 03:49:34.440]  and this is ultimately to create sterility and to not have population uh everybody should go
[03:49:34.440 --> 03:49:40.600]  look up the berylson jaffe memo 1968 or 69 and that's the memo uh sent out to all the planned
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:46.760]  parent hoods and and again 68 or 69 but that memo uh lays out the real purpose for the sexual
[03:49:46.760 --> 03:49:54.120]  revolution which is not freedom that liberation the real purpose was depopulation and socialization
[03:49:54.120 --> 03:50:00.520]  of america for more taxation etc etc all the things that you hear about the this fabian model that's
[03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:05.240]  what is being pushed in the berylson jaffe memo so just go look that up it's backs up what jamey's
[03:50:05.240 --> 03:50:16.040]  saying and so now in um influencing events like burning man you have orgy dome and you have the
[03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:23.880]  sex culture of that but then in the future the like you said they'll be promoted because
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:29.240]  overpopulation and the feminists will support the sex spots because that way men can get their toxic
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:37.400]  masculinity out on the bot instead of unleashing it on the poor women um in the work i'm sorry for
[03:50:37.400 --> 03:50:45.000]  unleashing all of my toxic masculinity on you at all times i'm so sorry i'm so sorry uh humans in
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:49.960]  the workplace are too much of a liability that's kind of obvious so those will be replaced with
[03:50:49.960 --> 03:50:55.800]  automated things um they will replace the companionship and we will just get more and
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:51:05.880]  more isolated into our little pods and this opiate of the message is uh just going to
[03:51:05.880 --> 03:51:12.200]  become a epidemic yeah and again it's planned you understand that it's seated in the fiction
[03:51:12.200 --> 03:51:18.920]  and it's planned to roll out to reduce the human population to reduce human interaction and
[03:51:18.920 --> 03:51:22.840]  hair bonding and one of the things that was pretty amazing that most people forgotten
[03:51:22.840 --> 03:51:28.920]  in the lockstep document which was the 2010 Rockefeller Foundation planned scenarios for the future
[03:51:28.920 --> 03:51:32.760]  one of those the first scenario was lockstep and that's the one that actually describes
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:41.800]  that after this big pandemic there would be a greater acceptance of automation ai and everything
[03:51:41.800 --> 03:51:48.840]  being essentially done uh apart from human interaction so not just the notion of social
[03:51:48.840 --> 03:51:53.320]  distancing and you getting all of your food and your products delivered to your house by a drone
[03:51:53.320 --> 03:51:58.840]  or whatever but also the idea of uh no longer getting together with a mate right they really
[03:51:58.840 --> 03:52:03.560]  wanted to test that out push that in the last three years and you saw a lot of the dating apps
[03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:08.040]  go along with this kind of stuff right i think tender had these things where they wanted to talk
[03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:13.240]  about uh people that were vaccinated and not vaccinated right and and practicing all the
[03:52:13.240 --> 03:52:18.520]  distancing protocols uh for mating rituals right during this time period well that was all trying
[03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:25.960]  to condition and test to see how well they could separate people and get them atomized alone and
[03:52:25.960 --> 03:52:32.520]  like you're saying stuck in the coom pot and this is going to be great for you know people that are
[03:52:32.520 --> 03:52:37.400]  lonely the in cell this kind of a thing they're gonna they're gonna totally go over the fact there
[03:52:37.400 --> 03:52:44.600]  were uh in cell podcaster guys years ago saying i cannot wait until the sex bot comes out right
[03:52:44.600 --> 03:52:50.040]  there was guys on youtube had giant in cell uh like self identified in cells that's not me calling
[03:52:50.040 --> 03:52:54.520]  them that making fun of them and say they really had this ideology and they're saying no we're all
[03:52:54.520 --> 03:52:59.320]  for the sex bot and the feminists too like you said so they're they're the two extremes the
[03:52:59.320 --> 03:53:03.320]  feminists over here the extreme the in cell the extreme of the opposite side they both support
[03:53:03.320 --> 03:53:09.800]  the sex bot and they both support the and the sex bot is the position of the elites to be pushed
[03:53:09.800 --> 03:53:15.880]  upon the masses not just to keep them from pair bonding and procreating but also to control them
[03:53:15.880 --> 03:53:21.880]  it's a mind control operation i just heard a story speaking of 1984 the other book that's
[03:53:21.880 --> 03:53:27.240]  really important like that is brave new world absolutely and in brave new world part of their
[03:53:27.240 --> 03:53:32.120]  society is that you are not supposed to turn down someone else's sexual advances because that is
[03:53:32.120 --> 03:53:39.720]  discrimination and yes right yes and that's what's going on now right so when these weirdos go into
[03:53:39.720 --> 03:53:47.880]  girls bathrooms and when they go into girls saunas right and they say that if you don't like it oh
[03:53:47.880 --> 03:53:52.760]  you're a big you hate me for my sexual it's just creeps right but that but in brave new world it's
[03:53:52.760 --> 03:53:58.680]  a creep society you you can't legally tell people no yeah there was a new story about a google
[03:53:58.680 --> 03:54:06.200]  employee who got fired because he turned down the advances of um somebody their sexual advances and
[03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:13.320]  she was aging and she got him fired because she said he wasn't being inclusive well i've already
[03:54:13.320 --> 03:54:21.480]  heard this about people that are complaining that if you won't accept trans dates on tender it's because
[03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:28.440]  you hate and are anti trans so just normal sexuality is hate you see that's the law that's
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:32.120]  the logic of where it's going any personal preference is going to be seen as bigotry and
[03:54:32.120 --> 03:54:38.040]  that's what's in this right if you remember in 1984 it's not even as crazy as the brave new world
[03:54:38.040 --> 03:54:43.640]  situation but in 1984 it's like there's the league there's the youth league of chastity or
[03:54:43.640 --> 03:54:48.840]  something like that and the only reason that exists is to make sure that people don't procreate
[03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:54.360]  and do it the classic way right so that you get tattled on which is a stausi thing right these
[03:54:54.360 --> 03:54:57.960]  terms of stausi tattle on your neighbor tattle on everybody get them in trouble they lose their
[03:54:57.960 --> 03:55:04.840]  social credits also a stausi thing right well in the same way in 1984 you can tattle on everybody
[03:55:04.840 --> 03:55:09.880]  and it's part of that control structure and they're going to put that in place as well so if you
[03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:14.600]  don't like every possible sexuality that's going to come off of your social credit score you see
[03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:19.320]  yeah oh you're a bigot you don't get nachos this week because you don't want to sleep with
[03:55:19.320 --> 03:55:29.240]  i don't know clouse i don't know yeah right yes so just say no to the rise of the sex machines
[03:55:30.440 --> 03:55:35.800]  well and it's not just that it's also the the fact that this is rolling out in every area of life
[03:55:35.800 --> 03:55:40.200]  in every area of society and the key takeaway here is that when you go and interact with this
[03:55:40.200 --> 03:55:48.120]  stupid chat gbt i mean it's it's so obvious when you ask it real clear you know divisive questions
[03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:54.760]  that it is social engineering and chat b gbt is just an early you know weak version of the real
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:59.320]  hardcore social engineering that they're going to put into place when these bots have you know
[03:55:59.320 --> 03:56:04.440]  basically the the clouse program running right clouse dot exe when that's running right yeah
[03:56:04.440 --> 03:56:08.520]  there you go see and the end cells are saying yes give us the sex bots that's what we want we
[03:56:08.520 --> 03:56:13.960]  that's the solution to uh not having a relationship with a woman right but this is all part of the
