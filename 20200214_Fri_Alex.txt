[00:00.000 --> 00:16.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.720]  well it was just last week that president trump was completely exonerated and then there was
[00:24.720 --> 00:31.200]  almost no coverage of it and i kept saying what will the new scandal be what will the new scandal
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.040]  be what will the new scandal be and i predicted that one of the big scandals would be the president
[00:37.040 --> 00:43.280]  just being the president normal function of the president is criminal
[00:47.120 --> 00:53.760]  is illegal to these individuals and now the president talking about a kangaroo court talking
[00:53.760 --> 01:01.440]  about the jury four person being a big democrat operative that's supposedly obstruction of justice
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.280]  when it's the president's purview to completely pardon someone if he wants to
[01:08.960 --> 01:14.080]  so trump's not claiming illegal right to interfere it it's it's what the executive branch can do
[01:15.120 --> 01:19.440]  and then if we don't like what he does we don't vote for him again but that's a
[01:19.440 --> 01:23.520]  separate branch of government if you didn't have that power in the executive you would have the
[01:23.520 --> 01:28.000]  other branches always overthrowing it like a third world country and that's exactly what's
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.200]  starting to happen as america resembles in so many ways a third world nation in our behavior
[01:34.400 --> 01:40.480]  so ag bar came out and said that he won't be bullied and he basically said that trump was
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.520]  doing bad things when he's not and so that shows you the deep states really panic because
[01:45.520 --> 01:52.400]  trump's purging it and that bar is showing us true colors or is this to get heat off of bar from
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.800]  the democrats there shouldn't be any heat they should stop bowling to them and acting like the
[01:56.800 --> 02:03.600]  claims they make are legitimate here's what bar had to say i had made a decision that i thought was
[02:03.600 --> 02:10.880]  fair and reasonable in this particular case and uh once the tweet occurred the question is well
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.800]  now what do i do and uh do you go forward with what you think is the right decision or do you
[02:16.800 --> 02:22.000]  pull back because of the tweet and that just sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.200]  so you're saying you have a problem with the tweets yes well i have i have a problem uh
[02:28.160 --> 02:33.520]  with some of some of the the tweets i'm happy to say that in fact the president has never asked
[02:33.520 --> 02:42.240]  me to do anything in a criminal case uh however to have public statements and tweets made about
[02:42.240 --> 02:50.480]  the department about uh our people in the department our men and women here about cases pending in
[02:50.480 --> 02:59.280]  the department and about judges before whom we have cases make it impossible for me to do my job
[02:59.280 --> 03:06.080]  and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the in the department that we're doing our work
[03:06.080 --> 03:15.840]  with integrity this bar the president does not like to be told what to do he may not like what
[03:15.840 --> 03:22.720]  you're saying are you prepared for those ramifications of course as i you know said during
[03:22.720 --> 03:31.120]  my confirmation uh i came in to serve as attorney general uh i am responsible for everything that
[03:31.120 --> 03:35.520]  happens in the department but the thing i have most responsibility for are the issues that are
[03:35.520 --> 03:42.160]  brought to me for decision and i will make those decisions based on what i think is the right thing
[03:42.160 --> 03:47.440]  to do and i'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody and i said at the time whether it's
[03:47.440 --> 03:52.640]  congress newspaper editorial boards or the president i'm going to do what i think is right
[03:53.360 --> 04:01.920]  and uh you know uh the i think the the i cannot do my job here at the department
[04:02.800 --> 04:11.120]  with a constant background commentary that that undercuts me that's quite an attack on the president
[04:11.120 --> 04:17.120]  when the entire attack on stone is an attack on the president and the election and the judge and
[04:17.120 --> 04:22.000]  the prosecutors and the jurors have all been running their mouths everywhere while roger stone
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.320]  has a big gag ball shoved in his face and they've been in the washington post calling for my arrest
[04:28.800 --> 04:37.360]  because i pointed out that these juries look like the democratic national committees front line
[04:37.360 --> 04:44.240]  front line unbelievable and dr steve patinik is going to be joining us uh coming up the second
[04:44.240 --> 04:52.000]  hour he says bar's got to go also huge developments on the virus front the biggest yet on the other
[04:52.000 --> 05:01.360]  side back in t minus 60 seconds start your engines well it's finally happening the president is coming
[05:01.360 --> 05:06.400]  out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out of control criminals that need to be prosecuted
[05:06.400 --> 05:14.560]  and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state department and the justice department
[05:14.560 --> 05:20.720]  in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at
[05:20.720 --> 05:26.560]  treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination and now she's out on her
[05:26.560 --> 05:32.960]  globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see a lot more all the neocons need
[05:32.960 --> 05:39.120]  to be fired all the obama appointees fired all the deep state globalist who have resumes with
[05:39.120 --> 05:46.880]  george soros fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed trump is not the red wave
[05:46.880 --> 05:53.840]  he is the red storm and info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the people never backing
[05:53.840 --> 06:10.720]  down never giving in and delivering victory in our time as president trump continues to
[06:10.720 --> 06:17.840]  battle the globalist forces of the deep state the democrat party continues to take off its mask
[06:17.840 --> 06:25.680]  and reveal themselves as the true enemy of america and its people last week trump delivered a
[06:25.680 --> 06:32.240]  historic state of the union address which included an emotional tribute to honor one of the last
[06:32.240 --> 06:37.840]  remaining heroes of world war two but wait a minute who the hell is that sitting on their
[06:37.840 --> 06:45.120]  asses during the tribute you guessed it the enemy within that's radical leftist ill hand omar and
[06:45.120 --> 06:52.880]  rashita to leave caught on camera seeing here refusing to stand up and honor charles magie of
[06:52.880 --> 06:58.960]  the legendary tuskegee airman a unit of black fighter and bomber pilots who distinguished
[06:58.960 --> 07:07.440]  themselves during fierce aerial combat missions in world war two after more than 130 combat missions
[07:07.440 --> 07:14.080]  in world war two he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to
[07:14.080 --> 07:24.560]  serve america in korea and vietnam on december 7 charles celebrated his 100th birthday as republicans
[07:24.560 --> 07:31.600]  and democrats rose to applaud this all american hero omar and to leave just couldn't bring themselves
[07:31.600 --> 07:38.240]  to do so in fact they ended up walking out of the speech early in defiance of what rashita to leave
[07:38.240 --> 07:45.600]  said was trump's lies and bigotry but hey this shouldn't really surprise anyone after all these
[07:45.600 --> 07:52.080]  are among the same radical leftist who refused to condemn antifa after their terrorist attack on
[07:52.080 --> 07:56.960]  an ice facility in tokoma washington we are learning new details about the man who threw
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.600]  explosive devices at an immigration detention center in tokoma washington police are saying
[08:01.600 --> 08:06.960]  that a man was armed with a rifle and fire bombs and attacked the private facility operated on the
[08:06.960 --> 08:12.720]  behalf of immigration and customs enforcement or ice villan van sproensen he was linked with the
[08:12.720 --> 08:18.320]  antifa domestic terror movement attacked an ice facility in tokoma he was carrying an ar-15 and
[08:18.320 --> 08:23.200]  fire bombs and torched several cars that apparently hoped to burn the facility to the ground he was
[08:23.200 --> 08:27.360]  shot dead before he could kill anyone will you condemn the antifa attack in washington over the
[08:27.360 --> 08:34.960]  weekend it's easy to condemn terrorism will you condemn it antifa fire bombs a facility in tokoma
[08:34.960 --> 08:42.000]  over the weekend it's an ice facility will you condemn them for that are you pleased should
[08:42.000 --> 08:50.960]  more people do it it's easy to say no look we know who these people are and we know their agenda
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.600]  we're gonna go in there we're gonna teach the motherfucker but ilhan omar and rashita to leave
[08:55.600 --> 09:02.960]  are not really traders to america to me if you really think about it they're more like
[09:02.960 --> 09:06.640]  info traders
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.920]  shocking disrespect omar and to leave refuse to honor black world war two hero and that's just
[09:15.920 --> 09:22.080]  who these scumbags are they hate this country they brag about how they hate this country and
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.400]  that's what the democrats and the globalists would like to end up building is dividing and
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.760]  conquering this nation it's not going to happen as fast as they think it will in fact if we really
[09:33.760 --> 09:39.600]  work hard and expose them and get back in their faces and aren't intimidated we can completely
[09:39.600 --> 09:46.000]  turn the tide and we are that report is up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com it's in the
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.200]  darin mcgrain section on bandot video please get it out to everybody you know it's a powerful truth
[09:51.200 --> 09:56.480]  and needs to be seen the only way it gets out there is you as you see all the big jeffrey
[09:56.480 --> 10:03.200]  epstein information uh breaking as you see all the corruption coming out everything we told you
[10:03.200 --> 10:10.160]  about confirmed we're more banned than we were before and i've got all this incredible breaking
[10:10.160 --> 10:17.360]  news but i ended the show yesterday with something i want to get to later in the third hour and that's
[10:17.360 --> 10:23.120]  senator ram paul's speech on the senate floor is being taken off youtube facebook and twitter
[10:23.120 --> 10:30.480]  and they say it violates community standards so the senate's gonna put up with that now i guess
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.120]  this is total suppression of the american people it's organized crime and if
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.280]  Scientologists were doing this they'd all be arrested or if the italian mafia was doing it
[10:43.280 --> 10:47.520]  they'd all be arrested but when it's big tap doing it it's like oh well they're a private company
[10:47.520 --> 10:59.520]  they can spy on us illegally and sell our data and block what senator paul said about the witch hunt
[11:03.280 --> 11:11.440]  a gen teal doctor and he can't be heard and the senate just keeps taking it
[11:11.440 --> 11:17.760]  it trump keeps going along with it and you know i'm glad trump's in there but more and more i'm
[11:17.760 --> 11:24.160]  like mad rudge i mean i'm just pissed off that trump sits there and allows the democrats
[11:24.160 --> 11:30.480]  to engage in the persecution of trump supporters like this it's very unamerican it's very very
[11:30.480 --> 11:37.280]  dangerous but it's part of a unified global operation where governments are scared because
[11:37.280 --> 11:44.880]  they know their corruption's coming out and so bipartisanly they are
[11:47.280 --> 11:53.280]  going along with censorship big story up on info wars dot com uk approves large-scale
[11:53.280 --> 11:59.440]  internet censorship across the board with boris johnson who i support riggs it and i support
[11:59.440 --> 12:08.080]  nationalism but what he's doing is horrible it's authoritarianism and it's bipartisan and it's
[12:08.080 --> 12:15.680]  dangerous and so if we don't see action the next month or so by the president it's time to go to
[12:15.680 --> 12:23.840]  the trump rallies and peacefully take them over and we've got a plan to do that and i've been busy
[12:23.840 --> 12:29.840]  a lot of other things haven't quite launched it yet but i'm going to get it launched today so look
[12:29.840 --> 12:34.960]  for that because i'm not going to put up with the blue bloods and the snot knows republican
[12:34.960 --> 12:39.760]  establishment derailing our movement to save this republic i'm not going to trade out one group of
[12:39.760 --> 12:48.320]  tyrants for another i'm going to think about this carefully but as soon as trump survives
[12:48.320 --> 12:55.280]  their attempts to removing it's time for him to get down to business all right let me just stop
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.720]  right there and tell you what's coming up we know that attorney general bar has really come out
[13:00.720 --> 13:08.240]  against the president some people are saying that it's elaborate theater kabuki and that it's to get
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.200]  democrat heat off the attorney general for saying don't send its stone to an exorbitant amount of time
[13:13.200 --> 13:21.920]  well dr steve pacinic is a smart guy and he he does know a lot of people in the deep deep state
[13:23.280 --> 13:30.960]  not the lawyer bureaucracy but you know the folks in the military and those areas and he really
[13:30.960 --> 13:35.840]  has a big problem with bar and he particularly wanted to come on the show today so i'm told
[13:35.840 --> 13:39.920]  him he wants to come on there's an open door he thinks bar needs to resign and he thinks bar is
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.240]  going to make a move on the president and i tend to agree with him because of the pedigree of bar
[13:44.800 --> 13:52.640]  you know bar is up to his eyeballs in jeffrey ebbstein stuff and if i ever catch trump
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.600]  involved with any of the pedophile rings i'll drop him like an old shoe i've never found any
[13:57.600 --> 14:01.280]  evidence of that and instead you've seen massive arrest and we're moving against him and i think
[14:01.280 --> 14:06.080]  trump's great for that every time i get mad at trump i think about all the good stuff he's doing
[14:06.080 --> 14:13.920]  and balance it out but uh the bar thing is problematic and we're going to be chronicling bar
[14:13.920 --> 14:22.080]  and who he really is the next hour there's no doubt he's smart and there's no doubt that he's
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.480]  expanded investigations into human trafficking and done some good things but he's covering up the
[14:26.480 --> 14:34.880]  ebbstein death or event and there's been no prosecutions in all the blackmail situations
[14:34.880 --> 14:40.400]  that the clinton crime network has been using to control our government and academia why is
[14:40.400 --> 14:50.080]  everybody so scared of hillary clinton because they control giant blackmail rings and they've
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.640]  gotten the scientists and the academics and the intellectuals and they've all got them into this
[14:54.640 --> 15:01.280]  club and the people go have sex not just with 15 16 year old girls but even younger they want to
[15:01.280 --> 15:07.680]  be compromised you go to be videotaped having these orgies and i told you that 25 years ago
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.240]  and it was true then and it's true now i didn't just magically guess that it all came true just
[15:12.240 --> 15:19.440]  like i said it was true so that's coming up we have a fellow from the defense intelligence
[15:19.440 --> 15:24.080]  agency who's a really smart guy popping into the show to talk about a host of issues and also
[15:24.080 --> 15:30.240]  intend to open the phones up the virus is big the news is huge i haven't hit that yet we'll cover
[15:30.240 --> 15:36.080]  that next segment and then we're going to get into the latest in the campaign trails and so much
[15:36.080 --> 15:41.600]  more lawsuits getting filed everywhere because all the major female sports are being dominated from

[19:52.960 --> 19:57.600]  guys coming after us there's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals it's very exciting
[20:01.600 --> 20:04.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:04.240 --> 20:10.480]  you've got it
[20:17.040 --> 20:27.200]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[20:27.200 --> 20:39.120]  or well here we are on valentine's day 2020 i'm your host alex jones
[20:40.640 --> 20:43.280]  and if you're a tv viewer you can see the big map here from
[20:44.720 --> 20:48.640]  don hobkins that's integrated into the world health organization and the cdc
[20:48.640 --> 21:00.320]  redfield is the head of the cdc and here is a statement that he just made cdc director
[21:00.320 --> 21:06.560]  warns coronavirus soon widespread throughout united states it's coming and they go on to
[21:06.560 --> 21:12.000]  say that it's basically broken quarantine but they're in aggressive containment mode as it begins
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.520]  to spread here's what he had to say the worst-case scenario here in the united states so far we've
[21:17.520 --> 21:24.240]  been able to contain it but i think this virus is probably with us beyond this season or bond
[21:24.240 --> 21:28.480]  beyond this year and i think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get
[21:28.480 --> 21:35.200]  community-based transmission and uh you can start to think of it in a sense like uh seasonal
[21:35.200 --> 21:42.400]  flu and the only difference is we don't now going back a month ago we said is this just a giant
[21:42.400 --> 21:47.840]  world government police state drill was easy paying using it to crack down and to change the subject
[21:47.840 --> 21:54.000]  from losing the trade war with the us massive insurrection both on the mainland but also in
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.040]  hong kong and taiwan well definitely they've used it for that but now it's coming out that they've
[21:59.040 --> 22:04.000]  suppressed the numbers of infected and the numbers of dead massively and the reason you're seeing
[22:04.000 --> 22:12.640]  hysteria in china is because the virus is man-made we know that it's been engineered and there's a
[22:12.640 --> 22:19.360]  concerted effort to cover that up now we've had the head of the cdc and others come out and indeed
[22:19.360 --> 22:27.040]  say that we need to investigate whether this is man-made or not because the major universities
[22:27.040 --> 22:32.800]  have scanned it it is man-made so the united states is giving china a chance to go ahead and
[22:32.800 --> 22:38.000]  come out and admit what happened here and all the smart money was on this three weeks ago and now
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.520]  that's where all the red flags all the red arrows all of the fingers are pointing is it china working
[22:45.520 --> 22:51.120]  on a vaccine to a bio weapon that's a live virus and it getting out wouldn't be the first time
[22:51.120 --> 22:58.080]  that vaccine tests end up causing a pandemic or end up causing a major crisis but what we do know
[22:58.080 --> 23:05.680]  is this is very unusual and in full wars is going to be here on air cracking it all as it unfolds
[23:05.680 --> 23:10.080]  and the pentagon as we told you three weeks ago is shut up these emergency centers now that's all
[23:10.080 --> 23:16.400]  admitted they're expanding those and aggressive containment means if you have this virus they're
[23:16.400 --> 23:22.560]  going to lock you up now are they doing that to set the press to lock people up or is it because
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.520]  it's so deadly well a lot of people said well we'll end up finding out because there'll be a bunch
[23:27.520 --> 23:33.600]  of deaths no when there's a real crisis they tend to cover it up not just our government other
[23:33.600 --> 23:39.840]  governments you know it wasn't just the russians that covered up chernobyl 1950s a huge reactor
[23:39.840 --> 23:47.200]  blew up in california they didn't admit it till the 80s and most estimates were worse than chernobyl
[23:47.760 --> 23:54.000]  but do americans even know about that famous sodium reactor blowing up no you can look it up
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.720]  americas chernobyl just type that in california it wasn't three mile island and some leakage
[24:01.840 --> 24:05.040]  it was a reactor completely exploding like chernobyl
[24:08.080 --> 24:11.600]  so these governments and these corporations tend to cover things up and that's why
[24:12.480 --> 24:17.120]  i was once a supporter of nuclear power because if it's done right it's a great great thing
[24:17.120 --> 24:21.120]  these companies and these ceo's just don't care and they let everything fall apart and then melt down
[24:21.120 --> 24:29.760]  blow up and if you think that's bad the military runs a better ship with the nuclear submarines
[24:29.760 --> 24:33.200]  and the aircraft carriers but you know those have had disasters as well that have been swept
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.920]  through the rug i know some of the people involved some of the submarine captains that were involved
[24:37.920 --> 24:46.000]  in this when they were ordered to radiate their ships and test so clearly ggping i mean if you
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.440]  watch the people with what looked like glorified leaf blowers coming in and spraying antiviral chemicals
[24:51.440 --> 24:59.840]  on people this is what it's like to live in an authoritarian regime remember back in the 1950s
[24:59.840 --> 25:05.680]  they said duck and cover for atomic attack from the russians and of course getting under a desk
[25:05.680 --> 25:17.040]  isn't going to help you if the air raid sirens are going off in 15 minutes and icbms are coming in
[25:17.040 --> 25:25.120]  but it creates that fear and that's what it's really all about yeah they found it la's secret
[25:25.120 --> 25:33.840]  nuclear disaster in fact folks didn't even know there was a reactor there just like living here
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.920]  in austin there are two reactors one under ut and one up at the jj pickle research lab that's not
[25:39.920 --> 25:45.200]  even secret and i have austinites walk up to me and go i heard you say there's nuclear reactors
[25:45.200 --> 25:51.280]  in austin no they're not because people just can't deal with the truth anything that scares them they
[25:51.280 --> 25:58.560]  just say it's a conspiracy theory and they hope it all goes away well i'll tell you this one big
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.760]  bellweather is that we've had fema and different federal agencies try to buy up all the food from
[26:03.760 --> 26:12.400]  our sponsor my my patriot supply and the orders have intensified the last week over what they were
[26:12.400 --> 26:19.520]  even three weeks ago so they're still able to ship within 10 to 14 days they have the food they just
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.480]  have to package it and get it out it's extremely fresh they're working 24 hours a day but i did
[26:24.480 --> 26:30.160]  talk to them again last night and they said alich we can hold it 10 to 14 days another week maybe two
[26:30.880 --> 26:36.960]  we're gonna have to announce 14 to 21 days and at a certain point they're going to have to
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.920]  stop taking orders that that's there they're getting to a point where they can't even get the food now
[26:44.160 --> 26:49.760]  at an industrial scale to do this and the other companies sold out immediately to corporations
[26:49.760 --> 26:52.800]  and the government when they call because that's easier oh the government calls up boom you know
[26:52.800 --> 26:58.080]  you sell out but the government's hoarding food right now and sub agencies are ordering food on
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.880]  top of the food they have a lot of the government food is really old and crappy why are they doing
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.400]  that well because they think this could get really serious and get out of control because 2020 is so
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.640]  crazy with the economy and the wars and the attempts at race war and all things that are
[27:12.640 --> 27:17.440]  going on i think we're going to defeat the globalists at least in this round but i've got
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.880]  storeable food because it protects myself and my family and there's one more variable that i can
[27:22.880 --> 27:26.480]  take out of the equation so that i know i'm covered but i also need food to take care of my friends
[27:26.480 --> 27:30.880]  and my family we've got i don't know three four five six months of why i'm not sure it's big
[27:31.440 --> 27:36.400]  here at my offices where i have bought storeable food and water filtration and things like that for
[27:36.400 --> 27:43.440]  my crew so that we could operate for months here if we needed to and we have the firearms
[27:43.440 --> 27:48.560]  all locked up properly and folks that are trained to use them to protect ourselves because that's
[27:48.560 --> 27:54.160]  what an ant does not a grasshopper an ant is self-sufficient an ant can go out and forage an
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.800]  ant saves food for the winter a grasshopper doesn't it's like the locust all over average of it just
[27:58.800 --> 28:04.320]  fly in eat everything and then flop over and die in the winter the ants go on so i would take a
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.880]  cue from the ants and go to m4warstore.com where they have month supplies three month supplies
[28:08.880 --> 28:14.240]  six month supplies your supplies special diets and folks really have done taste tests even vice
[28:14.240 --> 28:17.920]  tried to attack us said let's let's test their food they're like that's really good macaroni
[28:17.920 --> 28:23.920]  that's really good stew what wait this coffee's excellent yeah i mean i'm not calling the food
[28:23.920 --> 28:27.840]  gourmet because you got to pay four or five times that to get that really good camping gourmet food
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.640]  there's stuff out there that's like you know but these are big bags of high quality no fillers

[33:48.480 --> 33:54.400]  indictments out there but the justice department can nix indictments were told the president
[33:54.400 --> 33:58.880]  shouldn't be able to nix indictments but the almighty number two of the justice department
[33:58.880 --> 34:05.680]  has that power because they're more important than president they're the permanent bureaucracy
[34:05.680 --> 34:13.360]  that's dug in and thinks they run this country and here's the letter we write to inform you that
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.480]  after careful consideration the government has decided not to pursue criminal charges against
[34:18.480 --> 34:25.920]  your client andrew g mccabe arising from the referral by the office of the inspector general
[34:25.920 --> 34:33.040]  to our office on conduct described in the report and what did he do all sorts of criminal activity
[34:33.040 --> 34:40.640]  lying to congress leaking information spying on the president lying to the president saying he wasn't
[34:40.640 --> 34:49.200]  i mean it's just ridiculous and so the swamp is flexing its tentacles it's a little alligator
[34:49.200 --> 34:54.480]  feat a report of investigation of certain allegations related to former fbi deputy
[34:54.480 --> 34:59.840]  director andrew mccabe based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known
[34:59.840 --> 35:04.720]  the government this time we consider the matter closed please do not hesitate to contact us if
[35:04.720 --> 35:10.800]  you have any questions these are nice letters to get i got one of these when they tried to plant
[35:10.800 --> 35:15.680]  child porn on us last year and the media was running around and go oh here's my letter that i'm the
[35:15.680 --> 35:24.960]  victim that the case is closed but that's not the case with this guy he got caught doing what he did
[35:24.960 --> 35:33.760]  absolutely directly but you see he did it under orders of barack who's saying obama
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.480]  who before he left said trump is it legitimate he's a russian agent we're gonna put stay behind
[35:38.480 --> 35:42.240]  money in place we're gonna block the delegates so that he doesn't get seated as the president
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.040]  is inauguration that failed and then they said oh the intelligence agencies have six ways from
[35:47.040 --> 35:55.040]  sunday to get you and we've just seen these rogue groups and if you want to know who these
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.680]  rogue groups are watch hollywood the message of hollywood is anti god anti family anti father
[36:01.680 --> 36:09.840]  anti mother anti unborn anti second amendment anti everything if they're just a bunch of scum
[36:10.800 --> 36:16.480]  who want a weakened demoralized america that can never come back from them selling us out
[36:16.480 --> 36:20.960]  it's disgusting so the rachel madhouse and the chunky schumars and the
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.240]  hillary clinton's can just have their way with this generation after generation passing the
[36:28.240 --> 36:35.280]  power on to each other as a plutocracy an oligarchy yeah in fact cue that up with audio
[36:35.280 --> 36:39.120]  remember just a few months ago brennan is up there with the former cia director
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.760]  mcgloughlin and they go thank god for the deep state we're gonna show this president whose boss
[36:45.760 --> 36:49.760]  we have the intelligence agencies and the intelligence committee and we're gonna remove him
[36:49.760 --> 36:54.320]  and brennan literally makes like a serial killer face that's one
[36:55.920 --> 37:01.520]  like a psycho gorilla they're like they're all bowing down to him
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.440]  you're watching baboons come to the head baboon and kiss its hand and our chimpanzees i mean
[37:07.440 --> 37:19.520]  amazing i mean that's who some old communists jerk off piece of crap gets up in front of congress
[37:20.480 --> 37:26.400]  with clapper and says we've never spied on anyone now us citizens has never been spied on not one
[37:26.400 --> 37:32.480]  time because they don't call it spying it's like trumps wrong we never wiretapped him
[37:32.480 --> 37:38.800]  they haven't called it that in 30 years it's electronic intercepts
[37:39.680 --> 37:41.760]  yeah so let's let's play the video of uh
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.240]  of them on c-span celebrating when when they were starting the impeachment
[37:48.240 --> 37:53.040]  and they're like we're gonna get it yeah and brennan literally goes
[37:55.680 --> 37:59.120]  everyone oh sir and he walks around congress and stuff when he's there
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.000]  just everyone's scared he walks around just imagine there's a full grown man walking around

[38:26.240 --> 38:30.400]  of there things won't be perfect but there'll be a hell of a lot better if you hate america and you
[38:30.400 --> 38:36.080]  were in the communist party you shouldn't be the cia director yeah no he voted communist twice
[38:36.080 --> 38:43.280]  because he's a sack of filth and everyone's so scared of him he better be scared of god almighty
[38:48.320 --> 38:51.840]  so let's let let's watch he another cia director
[38:51.840 --> 38:55.680]  to celebrate how they are god here it is
[38:56.240 --> 39:04.960]  presidents concern and often use term about a deep state being there to take you know thank god for the
[39:04.960 --> 39:14.640]  deep state i mean i think you know everyone here has seen this progression of diplomats and
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.600]  intelligence officers and white house people trooping up to capitol hill right now and saying
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.880]  these are people who are doing their duty who are responding to a higher call a higher call
[39:24.880 --> 39:29.920]  that you run the country so valentine's day at the doj even before drudge said that i saw the
[39:29.920 --> 39:35.200]  obviousness of it this is a little valentine gift could it get any more homoerotic
[39:37.120 --> 39:42.160]  from bill bar to his little cupcake he goes here you go sweetie it's not about sex gary now get on
[39:42.160 --> 39:55.360]  your knees you know that there's no way they're ever going to fix any of this though the bureaucracy
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.400]  can hang on like and like i said you actually have like an insect right before it dies before
[40:00.400 --> 40:06.560]  winter that big blue norther comes down and they're going to just be detached and sucked off of the
[40:06.560 --> 40:12.320]  vortex of history because that's the way it works for these bureaucracies in their ineptitude and
[40:12.320 --> 40:20.320]  their arrogance and just how soft and bug-eyed they are i mean struck and page those are chicken
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.360]  necks and they go and they get their degree and they become fbi agents and then they they're
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.000]  political frauds so they get promoted up the chain of command and everyone has to bow down to them
[40:30.000 --> 40:41.120]  it's disgusting but it's got to be dealt with and if you want to judge a tree by its fruits bill bar
[40:42.080 --> 40:48.240]  has presided over the cover-up of the jeffrey epstein saga
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.560]  now because trump is cracking down on the pedophile rings all over the world
[40:55.120 --> 40:57.920]  and because bar has been doing some of that as well i'll give them the benefit of the doubt for a
[40:57.920 --> 41:03.840]  little bit longer that they're just busy getting their ducks in a row but we need action
[41:07.040 --> 41:12.960]  we need action we know hillary has blackmail information we know she's threatening thousands
[41:12.960 --> 41:19.520]  of prominent people we need some of those prominent people to give a press conference and say look i
[41:19.520 --> 41:23.760]  didn't know what i was doing she looked like she was 20 she was 16 as soon as i did it they said
[41:23.760 --> 41:30.320]  they owned me and then the whole house of cards comes down i've never done anything like that
[41:30.320 --> 41:34.320]  but if somebody was trying to blackmail blackmail me with something like that i would do a press
[41:34.320 --> 41:41.600]  conference and that's what they did ladies and gentlemen and then it only began there and so
[41:44.000 --> 41:51.440]  this is how our country is held hostage by a pervert network and again people ask why would ms-13
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.920]  go kidnap a teenager and torture him to death for satan to become a member of ms-13 because the
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.000]  worst thing you can do is serve satan and to give you can get people to pledge themselves to satan
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.960]  they'll think there's no going back at that point so so many organized gangs have satanism involved
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.920]  and have killing of innocence involved well if you think ms-13 just invented that no with these
[42:09.920 --> 42:17.760]  globalist mafias it's devil worship it's underage sex then it's pedophilia then it's hey we got to
[42:17.760 --> 42:23.760]  get rid of these kids go down there and hack them up with a machete in the basement you're like but
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.200]  i'm a banking ceo hey listen you're going to go kill that five-year-old with this machete or you
[42:29.200 --> 42:39.280]  and your wife are dead you want it to be part of the club now you are see how it works keep the
[42:39.280 --> 42:48.880]  babies cool that's who these people are and it's time to call their bluff you see it's time for
[42:48.880 --> 42:58.320]  people to stop having fear realize the sort of truth is invincible when used well it's finally
[42:58.320 --> 43:03.680]  happening the president is coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out-of-control criminals
[43:03.680 --> 43:12.000]  that need to be prosecuted and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state department
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.240]  and the justice department in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over stone
[43:18.240 --> 43:24.400]  and offered her a job at treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination and
[43:24.400 --> 43:30.720]  now she's out on her globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see a lot more
[43:30.720 --> 43:37.040]  all the neocons need to be fired all the obama appointees fired all the deep state globalist
[43:37.040 --> 43:44.000]  who have resumes with george soros fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed trump
[43:44.000 --> 43:51.520]  is not the red wave he is the red storm and info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the
[43:51.520 --> 43:58.080]  people never backing down never giving in and delivering victory in our time there's roughly
[43:58.080 --> 44:03.840]  only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things

[44:07.520 --> 44:11.760]  trying to overthrow the president they're trying to silence free speech they're trying to trigger

[45:07.600 --> 45:13.200]  globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide
[45:13.200 --> 45:19.760]  and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[45:19.760 --> 45:25.840]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[45:25.840 --> 45:30.800]  but tried to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's
[45:30.800 --> 45:37.200]  been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[45:37.200 --> 45:43.680]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a
[45:43.680 --> 45:48.000]  big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.840]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize
[45:53.840 --> 46:02.000]  us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy three weeks ago we told you that the
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.480]  pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the coronavirus and that they believed it was
[46:06.480 --> 46:11.680]  much more serious than we were being told now we know that that is the case and we know the federal
[46:11.680 --> 46:16.480]  government and major corporations have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around
[46:16.480 --> 46:22.000]  the country almost everyone else is sold out but our supplier my patriot info wars store
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.160]  dot com still has their entire line of high quality fresh food and it's fresh that's why you have to
[46:28.160 --> 46:31.680]  wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered not because they don't have the food but because
[46:31.680 --> 46:37.360]  they've got to package it and their factories are going 24 hours a day high quality fresh food

[46:54.880 --> 47:04.240]  resistance you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:04.240 --> 47:25.680]  the answer to 1984 is the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:25.680 --> 47:35.520]  you know the fellow that told me that like 15 years ago i didn't know who he was at the time
[47:35.520 --> 47:42.480]  he died right after was like one of the most famous modern economists ever in the uk
[47:45.840 --> 47:54.320]  and he said the answer to 1984 is 1776 and then later i put a clip of him in one of my
[47:54.320 --> 47:58.640]  film people go you don't know who that is and i called to get him on as a guest he was dead by
[47:58.640 --> 48:04.080]  then but pretty powerful i did not coin that but i certainly popularized it
[48:07.600 --> 48:10.080]  okay here's what's gonna happen folks um
[48:13.200 --> 48:16.960]  i was pretty euphoric to see trump firing hundreds and hundreds of deep staters
[48:17.760 --> 48:23.280]  and they keep telling him don't do that will be nice but he's learned they only attack more so
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.880]  he's finally firing a whole bunch of them and now the just department's showing its true colors bar
[48:30.160 --> 48:35.280]  as a shot across the bow him out said you shouldn't tweet you should lay down and take it you
[48:35.280 --> 48:39.840]  shouldn't say something's a kangaroo court where it's a kangaroo impeachment you should take it
[48:39.840 --> 48:45.520]  presidents aren't allowed to talk the average citizen has that power but not a president
[48:46.800 --> 48:52.160]  and people like oh bar you know he's he's working with the president he knows he's under attack so
[48:52.160 --> 49:03.440]  it's a cover story you know q says so maybe but now andrew mccabe who leaked lied to congress
[49:03.440 --> 49:09.840]  spied on the president lied to the president did all this illegal crap he just got a valentine's day
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.200]  drugreport.com gets it right oh a justice department valentine's day how disgusting
[49:17.200 --> 49:24.160]  just like they started the impeachment on friday 13th against the president
[49:31.520 --> 49:35.920]  so that tells you everything you need to know and i'm gonna tell you something i'm not seeing any
[49:35.920 --> 49:49.680]  action none against the epstein clinton pedophile rings and you notice the deep state just keeps
[49:49.680 --> 49:56.400]  trying to remove trump trying to block him harasses supporters and then trump sits up
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.040]  during glad hands with bar who comes out and slides a knife right into his back
[50:01.040 --> 50:11.760]  hell not into his back bar walks right over and says you shouldn't be tweeting about what judges
[50:11.760 --> 50:15.840]  and courts are doing really the same judges that said he can't control the border and the supreme
[50:15.840 --> 50:21.360]  court ruled every time he was right bs man they're attacking the president in full time and they want
[50:21.360 --> 50:27.120]  him to shut up and let the bureaucracy come in and come together with a consensus every week
[50:27.120 --> 50:32.960]  of what he's supposed to do and be a kept president and until he does that like he's some
[50:32.960 --> 50:39.760]  Mandarin chinese emperor in the forbidden city until he binds his feet and grows four foot long
[50:39.760 --> 50:45.920]  fingernails and because you're so royal you came and your majesty you can't wipe your own arse
[50:45.920 --> 50:53.200]  or eat your own food you're so royal you don't walk and they have the priest go look how beautiful
[50:53.200 --> 51:00.400]  your bound feet are princes they'd be all deformed woman can't even walk but the the power behind
[51:00.400 --> 51:08.480]  the throne the legalist that the chai comms come out of for 3 000 years they had control of chinese
[51:08.480 --> 51:14.640]  dynasties telling them you are the elite and you aren't allowed to talk to the public you're not
[51:14.640 --> 51:19.840]  allowed to feed yourself you're not allowed to wipe your own ass they were really prisoners
[51:19.840 --> 51:26.240]  and other royal groups learned how to make royalty prisoners did you know the queen
[51:26.240 --> 51:31.440]  england doesn't wipe her own ass she has someone called the groom of the stool
[51:34.720 --> 51:41.040]  i'm not joking i'm not trying to be gross here you see the globalists are doing that to the
[51:41.040 --> 51:45.040]  public there's there are no men there are no women we don't want to be strong don't challenge people
[51:45.040 --> 51:51.360]  get rid of the f2a scoring system because f's will hurt someone's feelings and everybody gets a
[51:51.360 --> 51:56.960]  participation trophy but see then the trophies don't mean anything anymore do they because they're
[51:57.600 --> 52:02.640]  they're not real the best thing ever happened to me was adversity thank god
[52:05.840 --> 52:11.440]  that racist gangs brutalized me in dallas it was the best thing ever happened to me i love it
[52:11.440 --> 52:18.240]  because it activated my genes it activated who i was as a man made me strong made me learn to
[52:18.240 --> 52:23.040]  fight thank god i was on the tail end of back when people still fought and still went out and did
[52:23.040 --> 52:27.920]  stuff and you know it's sad sometimes you know your kid dies in a gang fight or whatever but
[52:27.920 --> 52:32.960]  it's better than living as a slave their whole life a little victim jellyfish that goes around
[52:32.960 --> 52:39.680]  going i'm a victim can you take care of me oh and they go oh you're part of this group now
[52:39.680 --> 52:44.400]  come be part of this group and as a collective we're going to take care of each other but that's
[52:44.400 --> 52:50.400]  never really how it works is it so this is all bigger than roger stone bigger than donald trump
[52:50.400 --> 52:55.360]  bigger than info wars if they can silence all of us if they can silence you if they can persecute
[52:55.360 --> 53:00.400]  people and scare everyone to submit they think they're gonna win that's why it's critical to not
[53:00.400 --> 53:06.560]  just act like you're not afraid but have the joy of battle and love this fight and love the honor
[53:06.560 --> 53:12.560]  of being able to engage these maggots reagan recently put out a very powerful report stacked jury
[53:12.560 --> 53:20.640]  of the kangaroo court against roger stone must end here is his report a kangaroo court is a court
[53:20.640 --> 53:28.480]  that ignores law and justice they are held to give the appearance of a fair trial while the verdict
[53:28.480 --> 53:39.920]  has been decided from the start on friday january 25th 2019 the fbi arrested roger stone in his home
[53:41.200 --> 53:46.080]  cnn showed up moments before to capture it all in its drama
[53:48.160 --> 53:55.120]  this was important because roger stone did nothing wrong the allegation was that he was
[53:55.120 --> 54:02.960]  seeking stolen emails from wiki leaks that could damage trump's opponents and even if this were
[54:02.960 --> 54:11.920]  true it is no crime so they make the arrest look like he was al capone because the lie
[54:11.920 --> 54:21.120]  is all they have left we know the judge assigned to the case has a political motivation to prosecute
[54:21.120 --> 54:29.280]  roger stone with all of the corporate mockingbird media against him judge amy berman jackson
[54:29.280 --> 54:36.880]  imposed a gag order on roger stone banning him from discussing his case in public including
[54:36.880 --> 54:44.640]  on social media and if that wasn't clear enough judge berman jackson made it absolutely clear
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.600]  during jury selection her judgments had been transparently political yesterday for example
[54:49.600 --> 54:54.560]  during jury selection one of the prospective jurors turned out to be a former press secretary in
[54:54.560 --> 54:59.920]  the obama administration who admitted that she despises donald trump and has friends in the
[54:59.920 --> 55:05.440]  federal prosecutor's office which is trying the case her husband meanwhile works at the justice
[55:05.440 --> 55:09.760]  department which is prosecuting roger stone the woman claimed she had followed the Mueller
[55:09.760 --> 55:17.040]  investigation closely but somehow had never quote read or heard anything about roger stone's case
[55:17.040 --> 55:23.200]  and didn't have a strong opinion about him uh-huh no sober person could take that claim seriously
[55:23.200 --> 55:27.840]  but amy berman jackson did she acted like it was all completely fine and on the level
[55:28.480 --> 55:33.840]  when roger stone's lawyers asked that that woman be removed from the jury pool jackson
[55:33.840 --> 55:41.200]  refused personal conflicts she said were quote not automatically disqualifying even the jury
[55:41.200 --> 55:49.440]  felt compelled to reveal itself as anti-trump activists juror seth cousins wrote an article
[55:49.440 --> 55:58.800]  for the washington post exposing himself as an anti-trump activist and now juror tamika hart
[55:58.800 --> 56:07.440]  has revealed herself as well after cnn exposed her identity journalist mike sernovich pointed out
[56:07.440 --> 56:17.280]  her clear political bias on social media before she could delete it kangaroo court the russian
[56:17.280 --> 56:24.160]  collusion fell apart months ago and somehow roger stone's made-up crimes still stand
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.760]  one would think that president trump would have already pardoned him by now never leave a man
[56:31.760 --> 56:40.480]  behind we cannot leave behind roger stone and we cannot leave behind general michael thomas flinn
[56:41.920 --> 56:50.560]  and we cannot leave behind julian assange these men did nothing wrong and their continued
[56:50.560 --> 57:01.600]  persecution is only proof of a corrupt system for info wars dot com this is greg reese all right
[57:01.600 --> 57:06.320]  that full report is it banned on video info wars dot com i want to just remind you of something
[57:06.320 --> 57:11.200]  everybody knew that that lady worked for obama and that her husband was on the muller probe
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.880]  and everyone was scared to say it we said it first we put it out tucker carlson picked it up
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.200]  to his credit i was pointing out while we're under attack here's the washington post from
[57:21.200 --> 57:26.720]  three months ago alex jones threatened to name a roger stone juror experts say he might be jury
[57:26.720 --> 57:34.000]  tampering well i didn't threaten to name him i named him piss up a rope you thugs go to hell
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.720]  alex jones threatened to out the juror you don't out jurors when they're democrat operatives
[57:38.720 --> 57:42.800]  they had to step down because of the conflict of interest and now we learn more of the jurors
[57:42.800 --> 57:50.960]  with the same piss up a rope scum almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold
[57:50.960 --> 57:55.840]  out of food but i know for a fact from sources to tell them people oh we've got it get your order in
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.640]  two weeks for delivery we follow this pattern over and over again i've been on ready for 25 years
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.880]  i've had storeable food for a long time and i learned very quickly a lot of these companies
[58:04.880 --> 58:09.520]  they're fine during normal times during a crisis they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because
[58:09.520 --> 58:14.400]  of inventory they'll still take your orders that's why about 11 years ago i found my patriot supply
[58:14.400 --> 58:19.040]  now the biggest most trusted company out there and i became a private labeler for them because they
[58:19.040 --> 58:22.240]  actually have it on hand they actually give it delivered to you on time they do what they're
[58:22.240 --> 58:26.080]  gonna say they're gonna do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good

[58:44.640 --> 58:52.000]  infowarstore.com with storeable foods i have confirmed with high level sources that president
[58:52.000 --> 58:58.080]  trump is intending to either pardon roger stone after his sentencing or give him clemency saying
[58:58.080 --> 59:04.880]  the conviction stands but you now basically don't go to jail either way this is incredibly good news
[59:04.880 --> 59:10.080]  but let's not forget julien assange that's one of the biggest black marks on trump is that he
[59:10.080 --> 59:15.040]  famously said i don't know who got the emails i don't know where they came from the russians
[59:15.040 --> 59:20.320]  a fat dude in his mom's basement whoever's got him release him it's about hillary committing a crime
[59:20.320 --> 59:25.200]  not who has the emails don't change the subject well julien assange undoubtedly took trump over
[59:25.200 --> 59:30.720]  the top the wiki leaks expose the deep state the man is a hero daniel elsberg was a hero well
[59:30.720 --> 59:35.280]  assange is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary confinement and the court hearings can
[59:35.280 --> 59:40.880]  barely talk president trump do the right thing and ask the british to release julien assange
[59:40.880 --> 59:48.560]  and give him a medal president trump you must release julien assange free julien assange free julien assange
[59:48.560 --> 1:00:04.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:14.480]  you
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:22.640]  welcome back alex jones here dr steve schenick is really worried he's got an emergency message
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:24.480]  the president coming up in about 15 minutes
[1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:35.520]  they're more afraid of trump being president than anything else because he is the president
[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:40.800]  and he's not doing what bureaucrats telling you can agree with what he says disagree it's a mix
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:47.600]  for me at least but the fact that he is trying to be the president and with every passing day
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:54.640]  every passing week and month and year he becomes the president more that's what scares them the most
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:58.800]  and so the fact that he's saying he's probably going to pardon stone the fact that he's saying
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:03.360]  the senate thing is outrageous they're like how dare you involve yourself in things anybody
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:09.760]  else can write a letter to the judge anybody else can say this is bs when the travis county
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:14.720]  indicted rick perry for nothing and i've got problems with rick perry but rick perry did not
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:21.520]  do anything when he vetoed a bill they called that corruption that's in the legislative power
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:27.760]  to veto a bill democrats wanted past money they wanted when the head of the agency got caught
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:32.320]  doing corrupt stuff he said fire the head of that agency i'm gonna veto that money they didn't do it
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:37.920]  they indicted took him two years and over two million dollars to beat that and and that's the
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:42.080]  tactic they don't want governors being governors they don't want presidents being presidents they
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:48.000]  don't want fathers being fathers mothers being mothers they're assaulting reality and i'll talk
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.440]  about that at the start of the next segment some other news i haven't gotten to that needs to be
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:59.040]  covered but you got nancy polosi and eric swallows well and others just out there again acting like
[1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:06.880]  the president tweeting is bad and now the attorney general is agreeing it's bad let's see
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:12.000]  the trump's not supposed to fire the deep state and now mccabe's been told he's not in trouble so
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:18.160]  this is a real justice department rebellion against the president right now and trump has all the
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:23.600]  cards bar has been involved covering up the epstein thing i've seen no evidence trumps involved in
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:28.720]  that but it's it's still very suspicious that nothing's being done on that front so here's
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:34.640]  what polosi had to say and then we'll play with swallows well said we also saw the president
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:41.200]  this week demonstrate once again uh that he does have he has no respect for the rule of law
[1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:45.600]  his assault on the rule of law by engaging in political interference in the sent
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:53.840]  sentencing of his associate roger stone indicated obstruction of investigation and you trump russia
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:03:01.040]  ties and witness tempering that's what trump that's what stone was indicted for this is an abuse
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:06.080]  of power that the president is again trying to manipulate federal law enforcement to serve his
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:14.000]  political interest and the president is what he is he thinks he's above the law he has no respect
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:21.120]  for the rule but where are the republicans to speak out on this blatant violation of the rule of
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:29.280]  law ag bar has deeply damaged the rule of law by withdrawing the doj sentencing recommendation
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:36.160]  the act of interference and trumps uh retribution against lead attorney in the stone case imagine
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:43.760]  that four of the prosecutors separated themselves from the case when the president of that just days
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:50.240]  after firing lieutenant kurtle vindman for speaking to his power this all must be investigated the
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:57.920]  american people must have confidence in our nation system of impartial justice and with the draw of
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:03.360]  the four career prosecutors the case but an act of courage on their part it must be commanded you
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:07.680]  know i'm going to everybody a favor i'm not going to make you listen to her anymore or swallow as
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:15.040]  well but maybe in post we'll put it out we post those 10 full words but truly disgusting and she's
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:20.240]  hard to listen to and hard to watch and and everything they say trumps doing they've done the
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:27.520]  truth is trumps gotten a lot done on policy that's direct where he can order a policy and see it
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:31.040]  happen but when it comes to bureaucracy he can't get anything done these people do whatever they
[1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:39.280]  want and they have paralyzed the president that's what this is oh you want to talk about a pardon
[1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:46.240]  that's illegal no it's not it's in the damn constitution you ugly demon witch and by ugly i

[1:06:51.600 --> 1:07:02.720]  well lots happened and we were all wondering only a week ago when the president was exonerated yet
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:10.320]  again what would the new canard be what would the new fiasco be what would the new hoax be
[1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:19.200]  what would the new fraud be and it's why he thinks that the judge is out of control
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:24.800]  but the presidents have always fought with the courts and judges and fought the con that's
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:28.640]  normals that's what the three different branches of government fight with each other so that you
[1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:33.280]  don't ever get one unified system but see oh the president's supposed to just do whatever the
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:40.000]  bureaucracy says and now the former acting fbi director who was involved in the leaking to congress
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:45.600]  and spying on the president lying about it and all of it he got a valentine's day card
[1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:49.600]  i mean these lawyers the justice department made me say
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:54.880]  you know they've been their candy asses have been planning that for a while
[1:07:54.880 --> 1:08:00.400]  and so trump wouldn't criticize bar came out and hit him right up front because now they've got
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:07.360]  trump where they want now they've gotten him to open up and trust bar and everybody and boy now
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:12.960]  they can carve him up real good at least they think they might be able to some will say oh bar
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:16.720]  did this you know he's under pressure from the democrats to make it look like you know he's
[1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:22.480]  not under trump's control whatever it's all the same thing a bunch of lawyers
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:34.400]  so dr steve pochettex joining us and the facts are in about bar and the cover up of epstein
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:39.520]  you can say what you want maybe he's gonna turn that around i hope he does i i want to fix things
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:45.040]  but you have a dug in bureaucracy that believes it has a right to rule over everyone and that
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:51.920]  it owns you and your family and so this is the new scandal tucky schumer all of them we want to
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:57.600]  remove the president he he he he he's obstructing justice in the roger stone case that has nothing
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:03.840]  to do with russia totally made up meanwhile vladimir putin has come out
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:12.400]  hard to believe you got to say this in 2020 but you have to defend it as long as i'm president
[1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:17.680]  we will have mother and father putin backs traditional family values once again
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:26.000]  well look at this female runners file suit to bar trans males from girl sports all over the

[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:04.320]  says he's a woman and breaks a woman's jaw why he's the bravest athlete in history is what they
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:14.800]  said now a man beating up a woman is the bravest thing in history that's the quote now everybody
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:21.840]  knows that's inversion of reality and it's ruining the sports but that's what it's all about men
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:29.280]  coming in and aggressively pitching all over female spaces and vice versa breaking down
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:38.480]  any privacy that's left that you're a woman i'm a man no you want to get some big dude
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:48.640]  who's got testosterone and everything and then he's going to be women at cycling and go up and
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:52.480]  get the gold medal and then the women are all supposed to sit there and play along with it
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:57.920]  and any woman that complains it's ostracized and loses her job and gets attacked by a bunch of bullies
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:09.040]  a cult biological male runner to compete in usa women's olympic trials what a joke if you catch a
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:15.840]  man taking more testosterone why they lose their gold medals like lance armstrong but if you're a
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:23.440]  man competing against women who's got 30 40 times the testosterone of a woman over he's make test

[1:11:54.880 --> 1:12:05.680]  soccer running over them in rugby it's just as insane as if i said i identify as a seven-year-old
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:12.160]  in pop Warner football and i go out there at 250 pounds and start running 70 80 pound little boys
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:20.960]  and girls over the fathers would get up and say call a patty wagon he's insane but it's all about
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:26.080]  making you accept something that is completely evil and completely out of control
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:31.680]  these guys are bullies

[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:12.640]  and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state department and the justice department
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:18.800]  in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at
[1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:24.640]  treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination and now she's out on her
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:31.040]  globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see a lot more all the neocons need
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:37.120]  to be fired all the obama appointees fired all the deep state globalists who have resumes
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:44.960]  with george soros fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed trump is not the red wave
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:51.920]  he is the red storm and info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the people never backing
[1:19:51.920 --> 1:20:02.800]  down never giving in and delivering victory in our time you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:25.440]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen and i'll exchange your host and this intro song by
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:36.400]  sting is perfect sending out an sos every time we have had dr. steve pacinic on in the last year
[1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:47.840]  or so he has warned that bar the attorney general has beyond deep state ties and is tied in with
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:52.640]  abstein and the ongoing cover-up and that he wouldn't end up biting the president in the ash
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:58.400]  ash now a lot of people are saying oh this is because there's heat in the media on bar so he
[1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:03.600]  came out and criticized trump and trump doesn't care because it's okay the president has the power
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:07.360]  to say these judges are out of control he's had all these other judges saying he can't control
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:11.280]  the border or can't block people from islamic countries that don't even have proper vetting
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:16.400]  so it's all about the deep state or the bureaucracy hamstringing the president
[1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:22.960]  and so that he's paralyzed in my view but you can say what you want about bill bar
[1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:27.920]  i want to believe the guy's a good guy i'm not involved in power struggles in the federal
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:35.760]  government my issue is is that he said abstein killed himself and clearly whatever you believe
[1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:40.960]  that's not true and there's been no more indictments and we know it's a huge clinton
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:48.160]  massad corrupt elements the cia blackmail ring that's all confirmed now and so why is nothing
[1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:52.160]  being done and so anytime dr patrick wants to come on we're usually trying to get him on he can't
[1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:56.320]  come on told him call me he called this morning he said listen we've got a warning to the president
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:02.240]  this is really serious and this isn't this isn't like bragging like we're deep state the real deep
[1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:07.520]  state is people that work all over this country whether in california or new york or florida or
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:13.120]  texas or ohio or indiana or nebraska or mississippi the deep state is people that put their boots
[1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:17.120]  on every day and take care of their kids and go to work and and the military and doctors and school
[1:22:17.120 --> 1:22:23.120]  teachers and the the auto mechanics and the truck drivers but it's true when he says the bureaucracy
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:28.640]  and the harvard elites and these lawyers aren't they think they're the deep state but it's we the
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:34.400]  people that are really the deep state and it's time for the tail to stop wagging the dog and when
[1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:38.640]  we say no they have no power and and they're running into that now but we were all asking
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.280]  just seven days ago when he was exonerated yet again what are they gonna do and it's just more
[1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:49.040]  of the same more oh if he says this conviction looks like bs that's meddling or obstruction or
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:54.160]  of oh if he talks to a world leader i mean you saw schumer and others last week said he can't talk
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:59.680]  to anybody it's all collusion it's all he has no power and it's time for trump to fire all these
[1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:05.440]  people what he was beginning to do and now we see bar raise his ugly head so the balance the hour
[1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:09.360]  dr steve pacinic joins us and i know you'll get into the whole history of it in the background but
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:13.760]  there's a good chance trump will end up seeing at least five minutes of this he calls it the clips
[1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:18.000]  and people bring it to them i'll just leave it at that what is your just quick synopsis in five
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.920]  minutes dr pacinic who i know the president knows who you are in your background the things you've
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:26.400]  done in different different agencies and things as a private citizen what is your five minute
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:31.920]  synopsis for the president five minutes synopsis of the president's very simple number one
[1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:40.320]  william bar has to go i've said it a year ago the reason for it not only has he really insulted
[1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:46.800]  the president and said an inappropriate thing that the president can't in fact tweet and
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:52.320]  interfere with the department of justice he can do whatever he wants that's the point what bar has
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:24:02.080]  not said is that he has not told anybody that from 71 to 77 he was a cia operative and analyst
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:09.280]  in 1989 it was bar who decided that we should invade a panama and gave the go ahead now the
[1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:16.080]  reason i was against that i went out to see noriega and i told him i will be here to represent you
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:21.760]  and personally take you out if you need to be but you're gonna have a war that you don't need
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:27.680]  and noriega pinpointed bar he pinpointed bush senior he said that these are all the people
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:33.520]  who are involved in corruption including the cia so what we have here is an individual
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:39.520]  who not only is deceptive but they call him a street fighter i'm a street fighter this guy's
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:44.960]  not a street fighter this guy comes from a very nice neighborhood from a father who converted
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:51.680]  from judyism to catholicism that's all fine he went to columbia or whatever but the truth of
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:58.160]  the matter is he's very close to muller he's he is a cia operative no matter what he says
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:04.240]  which means that his agenda is not in concert with the president trump's agenda and i said
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:11.120]  that a long time ago the flag for what i had to say and why i called you up was the fact
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:19.040]  that i thought it was beyond absurd to talk about roger stone serving any time let alone
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:27.520]  seven to nine years in a federal penitentiary and a judge was going to place that type of
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:34.240]  sentence on roger stone he didn't kill anybody he didn't intimidate anybody i mean basically
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:40.320]  roger stone is roger stone you know him i've known about him since the nixon administration
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:46.240]  he doesn't hurt people he doesn't kill them he doesn't touch him but you do not put a sentence
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:53.360]  like that even in theory and the reason why i called you up to say is that was again the
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:26:00.880]  manifestation of a corrupt justice department a corrupt fdi system which muller knew about
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:07.440]  combi knew about and bar knows about because bar is a close friend of muller he's been involved
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:15.600]  in all of these elements so nick uh trump once again he's isolated he has to begin to fire
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:21.520]  more and more people bar must go within the next few weeks there's no reason for him there
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:26.480]  he's not doing his full job and well let me ask you this why do you think he's making this move
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:31.520]  now because trump's finally firing hundreds of deep staters and and so they're hitting the panic
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:39.120]  button bar is a political animal contrary to what he says publicly he says oh i'm not intimidated
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:46.160]  by the press i'm not intimidated by a president i'm above intimidation wrong the minute you hear
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:52.720]  that kind of negativity and self-aggrandizement it's the reverse he's a total political animal
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:58.160]  he's nothing but a political animal and he likes to demonstrate that he's tough and independent
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:04.160]  he's neither tough nor independent he worked for verizon he worked for gt no i agree so why did he
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:10.480]  pop up and stab the president in the back at this point because he didn't want to be challenged
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:16.960]  and a man like trump is a true street fighter you don't mess with trump unless you come from
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:24.160]  new york you understand what he's about and a guy like bar who grew up in new york and actually his
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:30.640]  father was head of the dolphin school is highly compromised trump is not he made his own business
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:35.760]  you want to say trump lies that's fine you're right these people came up in their own in their
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:39.760]  little political lawyer system trump's his own animal and that's why they've got such a problem
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:45.760]  is he's not being ruled by their committees correct and what trump is now understanding he's brought
[1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:52.480]  back correctly hope hicks and some others his body defender and he now understands that he has to
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:58.320]  rely on a very close circle of advisors and he still has to clean out the way that's what he's
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:01.440]  saying he shouldn't have more than a hundred people the national security council not three
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:07.840]  thousand that's correct and and o'brien i give him credit he just fired 70 as we talked about on
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.600]  this show a months ago but i think it has to go down to 50 and even lower than that because
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:20.160]  trump cannot work with a critical mass of people who are deployed from other agencies by
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:24.560]  let's be clear a lot of our weak minded it's they're getting threatened behind the scenes anybody
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:28.960]  around trump is being is being basically having intelligence operations run against him let's
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:33.920]  talk about how the president could counter this now he could finally defeat this crop of
[1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:39.280]  lawyer deep staters once and for all and really get around to the business of relaunching america
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:43.280]  uh straight ahead of dr steve pacinic on the other side but but i agree with him and we're
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:48.160]  going to get into bar and and epstein because that's the big litmus test for me is where are the
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:56.320]  indictments what's happening with the blackmail rings i want to see that dealt with we can all
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:02.640]  agree these are troubled times right so do you know who's on your wireless network whether it's a big

[1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:10.560]  we follow this pattern over and over again i've been already for 25 years i've had storeable food
[1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:15.680]  for a long time and i learned very quickly a lot of these companies they're fine during normal times
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:19.840]  but during a crisis they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory they'll still take
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:24.960]  your orders that's why about 11 years ago i found my patriot supply now the biggest most trusted
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:28.960]  company out there and i became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand
[1:30:28.960 --> 1:30:32.320]  they actually give it delivered to you on time they do what they're gonna say they're gonna do
[1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:35.760]  because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people now they
[1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:39.360]  were saying seven to ten days before shipping because they've got the food but they got a package
[1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:45.760]  it record level orders now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the corona virus so get

[1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:02.560]  silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and
[1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:07.360]  i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like well what are you doing

[1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:27.600]  big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after i brushed my teeth
[1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:32.880]  with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:38.880]  i brushed my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like good things are happening
[1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:44.720]  in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just

[1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:01.680]  know i've got a quote here from carol rove on we're histories actors now and it's a very
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:06.720]  arrogant statement he made but actually if you have the right side of history and you have the
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:14.080]  historical position and the ability to take that that the flood that that that fortune you you can
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:18.880]  be histories actors i want to talk about that with dr steve pacinic because he this morning
[1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:22.800]  when i was talking to him he mentioned something along those lines and i want to explain the flip
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:27.600]  side of that statement by carol rove who was not one of history's actors and he knows that now
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:34.640]  but separately this is texas a nm 2007 and its homeland security into the department of the army
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:38.800]  headquarters united states special operations command and it's all the letters right here
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:46.080]  we show tv viewers and this is the nano silver that we have put out by one of the top companies in
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:52.000]  the world american biotech labs llc and this is the silver that the pentagon found with the wound
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:56.400]  gel and all of the private label was the best for taking out all sorts of bacteria and viruses
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:01.280]  including the sars family that is the corona virus and i'm not saying it's a panacea or a
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:06.080]  silver bullet though it is silver it's one of the best silver systems you'll find we sold out of
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:10.080]  the 16 ounce we have the one ounce and three ounce left that is selling out quickly it also
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:16.400]  funds the info war so get yours today it's for topical you can also ingest it infowarstore.com
[1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:20.720]  consult your physician obviously because even though it's it's approved for that you still
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:25.680]  need to find out what's happening personally in your own life but it's something that i use for
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:32.880]  my family it's something that has really made my life a lot better and 30 years ago they would
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:38.720]  attack different silver solutions now it's in the hospitals it's in the drug stores it's everywhere
[1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:42.960]  and this is the best one out there we have the super silver wound gel we also have the super
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:47.600]  silver whitening toothpaste that has the 15 parts per million nano silver but it's way stronger than
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:55.280]  regular coil silver so again that this is not to be swallowed um to use it wisely it's powerful but
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:36:00.800]  but it it is powerful for a reason it kills bacteria and viruses it means too much of it
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:05.200]  isn't good for you either so infowarstore.com that's how we fund this operation so going back to Dr.
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:13.200]  Steve Pachennick last friday i'm on air and i said what is the new hoax gonna be and i and i said
[1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:19.200]  it's clearly him just being the president uh doing anything they say is is corruption because
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:23.520]  they want the presidency paralyzed the answer is firing a bunch of people being the president
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:28.960]  and and not appeasing them anymore and i think the president knows that now i think that's why
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:33.920]  bar has come out from under his rock and is showing us who he really is you know we're hearing from
[1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:38.080]  the usual suspects queuing people that oh this is a masterful stroke with the president and this
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:45.280]  is to get folks off of bars back off his back this judge should be indicted uh the the the four the
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:49.840]  the jury foreman is a democratic operative they wanted me arrested here's the washington post
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:54.160]  alex jones threatened to name roger stone juror experts say you might be jury tampering they have
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.360]  former federal prosecutors under obama saying arrest me when i pointed out that this woman
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:05.760]  headed up a federal agency as a juror and that her husband was high-level lawyer number three on the
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:11.760]  muller probe so i didn't threaten to name them i did name them like eric sarah mowa and of course
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:16.560]  the lawyers all said and the constitution says i have a right to expose jurors if they have a
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:21.760]  conflict of interest that wasn't jury tampering it's doing my job so the intimidation of these
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:26.560]  people paralyzing everyone now you're a medical doctor yourself how do we get the president
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:30.960]  through this what would you advise him to do you know you're saying get rid of bar
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:35.680]  now then they'll spin that that oh c bar stood up to him he got rid of him all i know is he's surrounded
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:40.400]  by these lawyers that are always on tv i was just watching fox during the break and a cup of coffee
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:46.560]  they're like it was former bush you know it administrated people going the president needs
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:51.120]  to not be involved in things that's that he's not allowed to the president just needs to sit
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:56.640]  there and do whatever the bureaucracy says this is so obvious the problem is this bureaucracy
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:04.720]  am i wrong dr patrick no you i'm laughing because you hit it right on the head most of the people
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:13.040]  that trump unfortunately picked in the beginnings almeja was a john bolton a clear violation of
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:18.080]  what happened in the past there are many others and including myself and contetti the guy's totally
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:25.520]  incompetent he's self-aggrandizing they're manipulative now the reason i can understand what trump did
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:32.240]  is he has to rely on an instinct and a limited amount of information remember he comes from
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:38.720]  the business world when i talk to my people in the intelligence world i have to say just one word
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:46.640]  he's not a politician he's not an intel officer he is a businessman as a businessman the dynamics
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:52.400]  are very different so where normally he would come in and he would have let's say a foreman
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:57.520]  of the construction group and i've been in construction and reconstruction that foreman
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:02.800]  would have told trump no you need a better painter you need a better carpenter you need a better this
[1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:07.840]  no that guy didn't work well unfortunately because they're outcome based they're about a mission
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:15.040]  instead of bureaucracy and lawyers and kissing ass correct and jerry cushioner and evanka and
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:20.960]  all of those they're new no matter how well they serve the president they do not understand
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:28.720]  in how deep the intelligence community and the real deep state goes when you're talking about
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:37.120]  a guy like bar i don't think they understood that bar basically exonerated all of the iran contra
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:44.560]  people well who were they one was dewy claridge i knew dewy i mean he's a good ddo he was a good
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:52.400]  cia operative you had claire george i like claire george then you have mcfarland who was a disaster
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:58.960]  there's no one there who really understands how that type of history comes through again and again
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:02.880]  that's why trump doesn't know how to interface with the real government instead he's dealing with the
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:09.440]  lawyers correct that's a brilliant way to put it he needs someone in there not necessarily me you
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:14.720]  or someone else might flin for example you that's why they were so scared of flin because he knew
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:22.800]  how it worked well flin was the director of dia dia was an organization that always protected me
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:30.320]  even in panama where the cia dumped me and marked me for assassination the dia came in and protected
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:36.880]  me and took me out of panama and took me off the roster i go into the soviet union dia i've
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:42.800]  got to explain the defense intelligence agency there is an inherent conflict and i've said it
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:50.240]  for years on your show between the military intelligence and the cia the cia has had nothing
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:55.280]  but problems throughout the korea let's do the army nuisance 47 that the cia was kind of set up by
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:41:00.640]  globalist and british intel so i've never trusted it correct so when you say deep deep state you're
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:06.640]  talking about the military is the original deep state you have it exactly that if i was thrown
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:14.160]  off the base on fort amador by colin pal who was a pathological liar lied about vietnam
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:22.160]  lied about anthrax in 9 11 then you have guys like marxis narrows and defense intelligence
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:31.120]  agency boys who bring me back in and we break into the the uh military assets so that we can
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:37.440]  use them for propaganda i write that in my book but my point is trump doesn't know that he doesn't
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:42.160]  need to know that it's like saying to him look you remember the construction you did on 42nd
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:47.920]  street 25 years ago he may or may not have remembered but he certainly knew who to get what
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:53.840]  to get and what had to be done that he does not have in the white house so a brian is part of
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:42:00.800]  the bush administration is he good bad i really don't know but the the sifting mechanism the way
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:08.160]  they choose people is faulty and from that he has paid and so he keeps being goal oriented they lie
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:13.360]  to his face and then turn around and don't do it how does he get around that that's correct so you had
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:19.680]  combi you had uh muhler now you have bar and then you're gonna have another person who came in the
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:25.440]  four people who were the prosecutors were all obama people you have a judge who is an obama
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:34.800]  people in the washington dc if she convicts uh uh a stone that's going to be a problem because
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:39.920]  stone must be completely exonerated of any behavior because that destroys the whole
[1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:43.680]  russia gate it's bigger than stone i totally agree with you and took carlson let's come back then
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:47.600]  and and say what you would do right now if you were the president and and and what they're going to
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:51.760]  do if he doesn't take action against them because clearly they're pissed now they thought this impeachment
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.800]  will work and they thought other things were about to happen it didn't happen with the daily wear and

[1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:02.240]  i have confirmed with high-level sources that president trump is intending to either pardon
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:08.240]  roger stone after his sentencing or give him clemency saying the conviction stands but you
[1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:14.720]  now basically don't go to jail either way this is incredibly good news but let's not forget julien
[1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:19.840]  assange that's one of the biggest black marks on trump is that he famously said i don't know who
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:24.400]  got the emails i don't know where they came from the russians a fat dude in his mom's basement
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:29.760]  whoever's got him release him it's about hillary committing a crime not who has the emails don't
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:34.880]  change the subject well julien assange undoubtedly took trump over the top the wiki leaks exposed
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:40.240]  the deep state the man is a hero daniel elsberg was a hero well assange is even a bigger hero and
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:45.360]  he's rotting in solitary confinement and at court hearings can barely talk president trump do the
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:51.120]  right thing and ask the british to release julien assange and give him a medal president trump you
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:47:01.360]  must release julien assange free julien assange free julien assange you're listening to the alex
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:24.240]  jones show welcome back ladies and gentlemen you know there's 17 different u.s. intelligence
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:29.840]  agencies and dr patrick should probably speak to that briefly but he's talking about defense
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:34.400]  intelligence we have ivan rakeland green beret patriot smart guy i've met a few times he's
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:38.400]  coming on next hour the patrinic wants to stay one more segment they can overlap together
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:43.200]  to talk about the waterfront what's happening with the uh the military's view on all of this
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:48.800]  ish but to show you how even if you have the best of intentions you've got to have a life
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:57.120]  experience to understand things so i remember i was on air 26 years ago 1995 and bill clinton was
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:02.080]  had the the the military delta force training to take over cities to overthrow governors that
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:06.560]  opposed him clinton was delusional thought he could have a martial law takeover ahead of
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:12.080]  oklahoma city before he staged that uh and it all petered out but then i was getting intel and
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:17.200]  documents from people like like we'd be at a checkpoint on the side of the highway and fb
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:23.120]  agent would pull up and give us a document or then later we'd have people from the army give us info
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:27.600]  and then i'd go on air and talk about it all and go the delta force is attacking us and later
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:31.360]  they go no no we gave you the information we're not the ones doing it we're being ordered to do it
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:38.800]  show but i was like 26 years old then folks 25 years old then so uh i was just thinking you mean
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:42.240]  the police are coming to get us they're coming to take our guns no no the police don't want your
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:47.520]  guns they're being ordered to prepare it so is the military so it's a level of sophistication
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:51.840]  and i was smart at certain things back then but still didn't have experience i just had a popular
[1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:57.280]  talk show so people ask how'd you know all this stuff alex i didn't know a lot of it i had smart
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:02.880]  people giving me stuff and then and then i i couldn't read between the lines because i was so young
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:08.880]  and and so so ignorant that it was only later i was like ran into people they're like hey uh
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:13.840]  don't you understand we're the ones gave you that and and be a little more sophisticated we're not
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:18.640]  in with bill clinton try and take the gun that's why you got the information son but they understood
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:23.440]  they were smart they were older they they knew that at least i had a venue so people ask how i was
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:27.760]  ever so successful i knew some things growing up and say a lot of history and had family that were
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:32.480]  involved in stuff so they told me things but to to sit there and watch how as you said it's been
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:37.280]  good FBI agents and good people in defense intelligence and just good people across america
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:42.320]  and private life that are the real deep state that have been blocking this globalist takeover is
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:48.960]  that what you were getting at uh dr pacenic pretty much uh i mean there are names in generals but i
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:54.800]  will give you for example you mentioned a hero uh there's no reason why you should have known he
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:50:02.320]  was not a hero daniel elsberg you see that gentleman daniel elsberg came out with the pentagon papers
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:10.400]  what most people don't realize he was totally cia how do i know when i went to mit and darpan the cia
[1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:19.200]  trained me there he was so once again even the uh release of so-called secret information
[1:50:19.200 --> 1:50:26.400]  is created by the deep state and i don't expect you to know that i don't expect anyone else to
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:33.920]  know that that was happenstance and i understood very quickly what daniel elsberg was or is and
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:40.960]  i don't amon it i don't decry it it was just part of the game is he the same thing as like snowden
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:48.160]  correct so but that was another faction giving me information though right well but you have to
[1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:55.680]  understand the intelligence community never plays one side or the other it plays both sides it's
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:02.240]  truly of what we call hegelian dialectic i don't want to sound too esoteric but it plays the right
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:09.760]  the left the left the right always at the same time so somebody like you even alternative media
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:17.520]  has to cut in through the reality and this is what trump has to understand when he builds a building
[1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:24.320]  or when i build a company or create a company it's it's binary you either do it or you don't you fail
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:31.920]  in the world of manipulation which he understands very well it's never binary it's always well
[1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:38.960]  it's this and that at the same time what you need is some form of discipline and hierarchy
[1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:44.320]  where you can control that type of amorphous exactly by him letting them run wild it creates
[1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:51.360]  a vacuum that just begs them to keep trying coups correct and what he does and what he's really
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:58.880]  brilliant at and they finally figured it out is that he creates chaos but he lives in that chaos
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:07.440]  and he knows how to work it that's why Nancy Pelosi in two minutes of her 35 year life has
[1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:13.920]  destroyed an entire career by simply tearing up that piece of paper idiot that's all that's needed
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:20.160]  look at it again you'd never have to know anything more the same thing with all the democrats the
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:27.440]  party is dead but now you have a young man like peter buddachuk right what's the ostensible
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:34.240]  concept that he has you know given out what's the key element of peter buddachuk he's young
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:41.920]  but more importantly he said he's homosexual now why would he say that number one it may or
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:47.200]  may not be true i couldn't care less we've had other homosexual presidents like obama
[1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:53.040]  which he concealed it but the one thing that peter did not say and the one thing that's been
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:53:01.040]  hidden is oh my god guess what he belongs to the mackenzie consulting firm and you have to be
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:07.840]  pretty sophisticated to know this it's a secret consulting firm they usually recruit people who
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:13.920]  come out of harvard have a road scholar i was on that committee and usually those road scholars
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:21.440]  are co-opted by our intelligence community as clinton was bill clinton he worked for the cia he
[1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:29.360]  had a report to it as hillary was and guess who served with the cia in afghanistan peter buddachuk
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:35.520]  now how would you know that how would anybody in the audience know that because he purposely brings
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:43.440]  you distortion displacement and he gives you a false notion of what he's all about probably
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:48.880]  banging five chicks a day exactly whatever he's telling you is the opposite well it's not only
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:54.720]  the opposite you don't even know he's his loyalty has nothing to do the united states it has to do
[1:53:54.720 --> 1:54:00.560]  the covert operation exactly he's owned by some little private carved out group it's not only
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:07.360]  private particle it's also a political group the cia that uses another private group in order to
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:13.520]  protect or create this candidate so we have so but let's look at cia factions because it's the
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:18.720]  big intelligence agency and the one tied into globalism obviously there's different factions
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:25.520]  and things but clearly they don't like the way things are going but then most people i've ever
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:31.600]  interviewed from the cia don't even like what the cia is doing so who really runs it today there's
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:36.960]  16 different people the dni the director of national intelligence is a joke in other words bush
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:43.680]  created it as a way to cover over 16 different intelligence organizations do i need the nsa
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:49.680]  do i need the nga or national geostatial agency what i really need is a general like necna
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:56.800]  nakasoni in the white house who can control cyber command we have to start looking at the
[1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:02.480]  cyber is the interface to all of it it's what unifies it correct i have companies that i
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:08.240]  invested on a daily basis for example one company i want to identify gets a hundred million hits a
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:14.800]  day i don't need a tank i don't need a navy i don't need the nuclear subs anymore no you need
[1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:21.520]  information dominance correct and i need people like you to begin to explain to the public that
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:27.920]  we're getting a hundred million hits a day as you have i get hit you know google make sure that i
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:33.680]  don't get any remuneration or whatever that's fine that's a whole other subject now google's
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:41.680]  blocking rand paul's speeches this is how this has got to stop it's fascism what you have here
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:48.880]  is the creations of corporate fascism or what some people used to call socialist fascism but this
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:53.840]  is fascism yeah and why does trump put up with that why why is he like that this is out of control
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:56:00.640]  well it's not it's not an accident google was created by ron russian jew who i helped to get
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:06.640]  out of the soviet union and what did he create in google a reincarnation of the soviet union
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:12.800]  controlled denial and distortion that's exactly what he did but nobody monitored him i said it
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:18.800]  for 20 years google is nothing more than another fascist organization which you can take down
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:23.920]  if you know how to do it through the irs or through other means or if you have to do
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:27.920]  they're in bed with china they're so easy to stop why won't trump do it
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:35.360]  that i can't tell you my friend i wish he would understand what apple is about complete china
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:44.240]  who away is it is a disaster within the past 30 years i went from a rickshaw in china to a fast
[1:56:44.240 --> 1:56:51.360]  cars in modern cities in beijing and now they have the 5g and we don't and we don't have the
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:56.560]  cyber capacity that they do and we don't have the internet capacity because bureaucracy was set up
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:02.640]  to block our development and greenlit their development well you can say that our businesses
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:08.480]  like become so big the government is becoming irrelevant that's what nancy polosi and the
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:13.840]  democrats are beginning to understand yeah that's what you said because the nsa is google and is
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:17.760]  apple and his twitter and and and trump needs to get that too he's like oh they're private
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:21.760]  companies what the hell you the the freaking government built the damn things we'll be right
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:27.600]  back right do a few more minutes with dr steve machinic steve machinic dot com real stuff man
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:31.200]  we're talking about the real deal here and i and i love trump all day long but man i tell you
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:34.640]  he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over and everybody
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:39.760]  i mean i've got a problem and we'll just take the trump rallies over we've got a whole plan
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:43.040]  ready off the shelf we can launch it in three weeks i'm just telling the president
[1:57:45.440 --> 1:57:50.080]  don't be a victim if you're worried about the coronavirus exercise but not too hard

[1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:17.840]  my energy my focus i've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months it's incredible so do
[1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:23.440]  yourself a favor try out the products if you've been on the fence you can't lose except if you
[1:59:23.440 --> 1:59:28.400]  don't take action because when you buy the products you're funding the operation that is always

[1:59:37.760 --> 1:59:43.520]  please tell others about it word of mouth that's how we expand in the face of the nwo instead of
[1:59:43.520 --> 1:59:52.160]  imploding we're fighting to win and we are winning thanks to you you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:52.160 --> 2:00:04.080]  you founded the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show
[2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:12.720]  okay so most people that have political power try to leverage it right away and try to ask for money
[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:18.640]  or some political position i'm from texas i'm from the grassroots i want to create alternate systems
[2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:24.560]  for my progeny and for your progeny i don't want to control things i don't want to sit around
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:29.680]  with all those stuff suits and lawyers that said about two months ago i came with a plan
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:35.360]  that i haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:42.000]  20 different stickers impeach the democrats save the second amendment defend the first
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:49.040]  amendment info wars dot com and it looks like duct tape it's just a regular sticker you put it over
[2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:53.680]  your mouth you'd go to a trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:57.520]  things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you go well we're being censored
[2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:02.960]  and you know trump won't do anything about it and i can easily have people at every trump rally
[2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:10.480]  everybody loves us half as people are our folks are more and like like take c pack or something
[2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:15.040]  there are a bunch of blue blood kiss asses who aren't even conservative and everyone bows down
[2:01:15.040 --> 2:01:20.400]  to the bureaucracy and so i'm not threatening the president with something i'm simply saying
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:26.080]  we're not going to sit here and watch our grassroots movement that got you into office
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:30.640]  be overtaken by a bunch of special interests we're just not going to do it so we're loyal opposition
[2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:37.840]  here but we just want the president to know this plan will work i can take over the trump
[2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:42.160]  rallies right now something the democrats could never do because i have the people they know i'm
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:46.640]  real and and dr pacinic i'm let me just ask you what you think because i've not launched this yet
[2:01:46.640 --> 2:01:52.400]  because i just don't want a showboat like this but with the stuff i'm seeing and the
[2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:57.680]  justice department announcing they're not going to go after google for antitrust uh i just feel
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:02.080]  like it's my duty to go ahead and probably start pulling trigger on this what do you think i have
[2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:08.080]  no objections objection to it i think it's a brilliant maneuver because silence becomes your
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:14.480]  weapon and if they want to understand why you're silent you you read it right i think it's brilliant
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:20.320]  what you're doing you're not disrupting you're in no way offending anybody you're basically
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:25.520]  stating your view and you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most
[2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:33.280]  disturbing to people silence and that's a brilliant strategy you just encapsulated exactly what i mean
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:39.520]  by it so you get what what we're trying to do oh silence is the most lethal weapon that someone
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:46.000]  can have if i go to a meeting and i say nothing i remember in the state department people would
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:51.040]  always say well what do you think i said no i have nothing to say but the minute you look up
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:57.520]  or the minute you have a tag on your mouth and there's silence that's penetrating because
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:03.600]  there are two elements one you're silent and two you're intrusive with a strategy saying
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:09.600]  this is what i would like to have you don't say anything people can say oh that's absurd or look
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:16.720]  silly and the answer is you don't do anything and so in and no way can you be considered an
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:24.320]  agit prop agitation propaganda or anything offensive it's basically the most i think it's
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:30.320]  brilliant the way you thought about it number one you stand there you say nothing put it on your
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:36.320]  mouth and basically you're making a statement there's no way you can be offensive i don't see it
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:39.200]  well that's really well you know you're you're gonna get the heart of it i don't want to come in
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:42.400]  there like i want something like a pig at the trough i'm just saying hey we've already been
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:48.640]  silenced here we are we're represented by the fact we're silenced here we are that's true and silence
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:55.920]  what you've done alice and in a way it's brilliant you've taken the very element that they try to
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:01.840]  repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon think about it you should be head of
[2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:08.240]  intelligence units that's a brilliant way to look at it you take the very part of suppression
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:14.480]  silence and you make it into a weapon and then you put just the tag saying this is what i believe
[2:04:14.480 --> 2:04:19.280]  in but i won't state it but i'm not gonna you know what it is necessity is a mother of invention
[2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:23.440]  we're at the grassroots we have to like you we have to just like you do we have to innovate we
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:30.000]  don't live in the lawyer fantasy land ivory towers we have to be real or we fail well there's a simple
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:37.120]  reason do you have a pension that's guaranteed uh alex no neither do i that's why we we are what we
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:43.280]  are we're gonna go to 62nd break come back with closing comments for the president on what you
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:56.080]  think's happening we really appreciate you'll be right back stay with us well it's finally happening
[2:04:56.080 --> 2:05:00.720]  the president is coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out-of-control criminals
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:08.960]  that need to be prosecuted and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state department
[2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:15.280]  and the justice department in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor over stone
[2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:21.280]  and offered her a job at treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination
[2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:27.200]  and now she's out on her globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see a lot
[2:05:27.200 --> 2:05:34.080]  more all the neocons need to be fired all the obama appointees fired all the deep state globalist
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:41.040]  who have resumes with george soros fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed trump
[2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:48.560]  is not the red wave he is the red storm and info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the
[2:05:48.560 --> 2:06:04.480]  people never backing down never giving in and delivering victory in our time

[2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:59.200]  coming out today say there'll be no criminal prosecution of andrew g mccabe that that's a
[2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:06.640]  valentine's gift to the to the deep state in my view dot opportunity what do you see in this
[2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:16.560]  symbolism of that my attitude is pretty much uh this i i am not a fan nor have i ever been a
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:23.280]  fan of the department of justice for well over 30 40 years i don't find them to be impartial
[2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:29.600]  i find that most of the lawyers or prosecutors who come in at any given time are really political
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:36.640]  entities who have served one way or another and this is the key in a washington firm in other
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:42.560]  words most of them will look at uh you look at their abrasive man you will see they've worked in a
[2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:49.200]  washington firm they come out of harvard they come out of yale and for me i'm not i'm not impressed
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:56.320]  with lawyers i've never really used lawyers for litigation i've used them as financial instruments
[2:07:56.320 --> 2:08:02.400]  in other words in a system that i was working in either in the law or in publishing their job
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:07.520]  was very simple i don't want to know what's right or wrong from them i just wanted them to make more
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:15.040]  money so basically a lawyer to me is kind of a second hand element i don't really need lawyers
[2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:20.640]  in the world of cyber command and cyber communications they're totally unnecessary
[2:08:20.640 --> 2:08:28.240]  they think they're necessary and they become a key element of our system but remember we're
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:36.000]  260 years old and we're moving at a very fast exponential rate i don't see a need for judges
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:41.840]  who are basically ex lawyers who are politically active let me ask you this in closing
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:49.280]  obviously there was a big organic populist deep state i've been a mom taking care of her
[2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:54.240]  children in the morning making them biscuits and gravy is the real deep state or a cop got doing his
[2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:58.320]  job changing the whole lady's tire or a doctor doing their job that's the real deep state it's
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:03.920]  just rubber meets the road but obviously if the if the corrupt elements of the deep state keep
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:08.880]  trying to start a fight and get the fight they want they should pray for donald trump success
[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:13.280]  america's so awake now the military so awake everybody i know so awake and they don't want
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:17.840]  to go out and start having a civil war but if the communists and the democrats and the bernie
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:22.480]  sanders the world think they're gonna have this big happy hunting ground in america it's not going
[2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:26.480]  to go the way i did in russia or other places i don't think they realize how much danger they're
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:31.360]  in can you speak to that if things were to go into a civil war i don't see it going well for the
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:37.440]  other side there won't be a civil war number one there aren't enough people on the democratic of
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:43.040]  the socialist side bernie sanders will probably win but as i've said a long time ago and i've
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:49.680]  heard bernie uh you have to be a multimillionaire to be able to say you're a socialist or a communist
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:55.440]  i've never met any communist or socialist who was not a multimillionaire so the inherent
[2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:02.400]  contradiction of bernie sanders and what he stands for is nice in terms of the fluff and
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:10.720]  the need to motivate teenagers but it's fantasy land he knows it uh michael bloomberg knows that
[2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:17.440]  the democratic party knows it but basically it's the end of a democratic party that's really what
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:22.480]  it really is so how do you see them ending because you're right i mean it's coming to an end i said
[2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:29.840]  a year ago when nancy polosi was out of control when john i said on your show when i said biden
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:34.640]  was demented and and everybody thought i was you know you're right and we got censored on facebook
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:39.120]  is that interview your interview with me got us banned again but now it's all prima facia it's all
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:46.160]  admitted but he is demented look at he came in last he didn't know where he was he didn't know what
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:50.320]  he was saying he just keep yelling at people and the fact that they would keep him in the field
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:56.320]  when he's acting like that shows the lights are on but nobody's home well but that's the point and
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:01.760]  and you want them to you want the democratic party to spend millions to do his square and a whole
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:09.520]  bunch of consultants who are totally useless what's happening is you and i are becoming the alternative
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:16.640]  world to what's in the media what's the fake news the cnn's all of them they're gone hollywood
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:23.520]  is gone when you're paying 180 million dollars for a junk film like the irishman you're finished
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:29.360]  well that's my last question for you obviously a delusional like carl rove saying we're histories
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:33.360]  actors now we control reality and we'll give you a new reality tomorrow but if you've got history
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:38.000]  on your side and you're telling the truth and you're in the path of history like julia cesar
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.480]  shakespeare there's a tide and the fairs of men will take it the flood leads on to fortune
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:47.600]  if we go with the tide of what's right and true we are histories actors here's carl rove statement to
[2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:53.600]  the new york times bragging we're an empire now when we act we create our own reality and when
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:59.280]  you're studying that reality judiciously as you will we will act again creating other new realities
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:05.680]  which you can study too and that how things will sort out we're histories actors now all of you
[2:12:05.680 --> 2:12:11.120]  all of you will be left to just study what we do but now it's the bureaucracy and the lawyers
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:16.720]  and the democrats and the blue bloods that are literally having to watch what we do just because
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:22.480]  we're doing what's normal and and and so his own prophecy about them has now been turned against
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:29.120]  them gotta have final statements on who histories real actors are the real actors of histories of
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:35.200]  the insignificant ones the alternative ones like you me call rove will be in history all right for
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:42.960]  the most incompetent stupid self-aggrandizing individual who brought us the worst president
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:48.960]  of the united states in the past 40 years george bush jr and cheney and the wars in
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:54.720]  our hebrac in afghanistan what we haven't done so far and this is why i plead on your show we
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:13:02.000]  have to hold people accountable people have to go to prison and have to have a day in the sun
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.520]  where there's accountability for killing other people the might flins of the world didn't kill
[2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:15.120]  anybody they had some intelligence roger stone never killed anybody but bush jr did cheney did
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:22.000]  carl rove did the obamas did so there's a whole political system that we have to hold accountable
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:28.160]  but we're moving too fast and where we're heading into now is no longer into kinetic energy what's
[2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:34.480]  called wars or conflicts we're heading into a world where we have to be the dominant actor
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:40.480]  and unfortunately china and russia will be far more successful than we are because our students
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:46.400]  are better trained there our students don't speak the languages when i went to the left sabotage
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:52.960]  america to rule it and then they sabotage their main power base correct and what they did was to
[2:13:52.960 --> 2:14:00.640]  really cripple our country by saying diversity supersedes competency and in china the most powerful
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:07.440]  weapon i had ever seen was a 10 story bookstore filled with only english and american books with
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:14.400]  all chinese young people reading it i don't know one store here that has no right they're devouring
[2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:21.040]  the classics and then we've we've just abandoned them correct and we need a strong education system
[2:14:21.040 --> 2:14:27.760]  if i would trump i would fire the entire department of education start over again and mandate that
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:34.560]  every state has to work on intelligence and competency not diversity i'm not interested in
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:40.800]  whether you're black white yellow green i'm hispanic i came out of cuba no i don't think marlos
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:46.960]  or king jr said it's about what you can produce correct and what you can give to our country
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:52.720]  and i will mandate that every young person has to serve our country not necessarily in war
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:58.960]  but i don't care where their services but like israel you will serve us for two years i would
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:04.960]  reinstitute a service to this country and thank you all right dr pacenic steve pacenic dot com
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:08.960]  powerful interview i hope the president listens to you because we didn't even get into this you

[2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:25.760]  you
[2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:33.120]  i've been rakeland is a former green beret and formerly worked with the defense intelligence
[2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:41.920]  agency he's also recovering lawyer as he calls it and he joins us to talk about a whole host of
[2:20:41.920 --> 2:20:49.280]  subjects he's at rakeland on twitter r-a-i-k-l-i-m so i wanted him to send me a list of things to get
[2:20:49.280 --> 2:20:53.360]  into because i met this guy a couple years ago at a press conference in dc really liked the
[2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:58.320]  speech he gave and being to get him on he's finally here uh and he wants to get into roger stone
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:04.400]  general flin loony left corrupt fbi deep state election fraud which i would put up front thanks
[2:21:04.400 --> 2:21:09.520]  for joining us i see you're there in your car probably somewhere in virginia or something
[2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:15.120]  but i've been what would you call this period in american history we are in right now because it's
[2:21:15.120 --> 2:21:22.000]  just crazy uh as far as one word i think it's completely ridiculous just a little bit about
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:27.200]  myself and why i wanted to kind of jump on and join in the conversation is that my parents
[2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:32.640]  fled the soviet union back in the 70s to to run away from communism and socialism i would never
[2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:38.320]  have thought 40 years later that i would be helping fight communism and socialism that is coming from
[2:21:38.320 --> 2:21:43.920]  the left with all the squad and all the bernie sanders activity going on in this presidential
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:48.960]  cycle it is completely ridiculous well that that's why no exactly so your ethos is your family tried
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:54.160]  to escape tyranny and now you're you're you're like literally you've seen it before and here it is in
[2:21:54.160 --> 2:22:01.440]  your face right i hate to say it this way but as a green beret the motto is free the oppressed and
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:06.320]  now being a resident of virginia they have the motto of six semper tyrannous which is down with
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:11.360]  tyrants and not only northern we can we can talk about so a litany of issues i don't know how much
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:17.760]  time you have we have all the time in the world you let me roll with your smart guy i mean people
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:22.720]  need to understand who haven't bernie sanders says we need food lines we don't need choice he says
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:27.120]  that's poverty really why is everybody going to explain what we're facing you've seen it your
[2:22:27.120 --> 2:22:34.320]  family's seen it and now here it is yet again right absolutely i mean i was born here in the state
[2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:40.240]  so i didn't see it personally but my family like you said saw it and it comes down to capitalism
[2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:44.880]  always works the market will always work itself out in order to be able to provide the most value
[2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:50.560]  and most benefit and good to society i mean it's got problems produced a hundred times more than
[2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:57.680]  communism was that alex it's got problems but it'll produce a hundred times more than communism
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:05.280]  hundred times easily so yeah i just wanted to come on if you wanted to talk about uh no
[2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:09.520]  i mean get into your parents let's see the rest of segment on your parents play in the soviet union talk
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:18.000]  about that oh sure so in the 1970s and 74 uh my parents fled the soviet union my father from
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:25.040]  lennon grad which is obviously changed names later on to st petersburg and then my mother
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:33.200]  from the far east they fled in the 74 went through a system where there was the lobby in the united
[2:23:33.200 --> 2:23:38.240]  states that was facilitating the movement under jackson bank i'm not sure if you're old enough
[2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:44.880]  to remember but the jackson vatic amendment allowed for soviet jews to depart the soviet union in
[2:23:44.880 --> 2:23:50.960]  return for the uh the assistance with brain distribution throughout russia and then the
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:57.520]  different republics so under that strategic system my parents were able to come into the united states
[2:23:57.520 --> 2:24:03.200]  legally mind you unlike a lot of these folks uh and come into the united states and seek the american
[2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:10.000]  dream there you go jackson vatic amendment what is your what is your dad what does your mom describe
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:17.360]  in the soviet union why they didn't like it well both of them have passed in the last couple years
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:23.680]  but uh when throwing up a lot of the things that they discussed with me was uh you know everybody
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:28.960]  there essentially had one one channel that they received all their information from
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:33.840]  they were essentially lemmings to the state and then the only way to really get away from that
[2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:40.480]  lemming mindset was to turn off the tv and drink your yourself to death so vodka alcohol this was
[2:24:40.480 --> 2:24:47.600]  back in the set right 60s and 70s what do you think of putin today i mean i think he's a nationalist
[2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:53.760]  i think he's helping russia right i mean you have to look at it in context so a lot of people say
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:25:00.160]  content is king but i think context is ace in the context of russia uh in the in the yeltsin
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:07.040]  years in the 1990s you had a president uh yeltsin at the time who's a you know bumbling drunk and
[2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:12.960]  essentially that's what the country looked like complete chaos and that's not i mean in the
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:19.520]  interest of us national security you don't want to have a strong powerful nuclear capable country
[2:25:19.520 --> 2:25:24.720]  that is in complete chaos you want to have an ability to somehow negotiate with a stable partner
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:31.040]  and i think you know in some aspects obviously russia and putin is a uh strategic competitor
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:36.160]  in many regards but on some fronts they are strategic uh partner especially when it comes
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:40.320]  down to let's just get the exactly hollywood hollywood's trying to grab our children hollywood's
[2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:46.240]  trying to grab our children putin is against that so i i i believe moral issues and ideology
[2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:53.920]  trumps geography and trumps uh everything else and i don't see leaders that are opposing things
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:58.640]  like putin is so i'm not i'm not scared to say that i agree with what putin's doing defending the
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:03.680]  russian families rebuilding their population that's what we need here i i like that i like that
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:10.480]  and because and i see him as a competitor i i want to adopt the things that putin's done right
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:15.280]  in the grand scheme of things i would say as a shorthand russia has known for several things
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:22.080]  over the last few hundred years literature culture and their intelligence services right
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:27.040]  so the first two are positive in in the sense of contributing to humanity and the last one
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:32.480]  depending on where you are if you're an american and that's an adversarial role so you kind of
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:38.800]  have to interact with russia understanding those three dynamics i agree with you but i just don't
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:44.080]  see i'm not a russophile either i don't see russia as the issue i see hollywood in the left as the
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:49.360]  cancer if russia was messing with us i say go to war with russia but i don't see russia encroaching
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:58.320]  on my daily life i see the left doing it the left is doing it every day they started off by
[2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:03.840]  banning you from the digital sphere they're banning a lot of other people i mean laura lumar we all
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:12.720]  know who she is uh it's it's nazi sort of communist mentality of muting people that have a different
[2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:19.680]  division or a thought process and they try to contribute to the conversation well that's it
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:24.800]  and then once they mute you they then every day with the mainstream media well that's my frustration
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:31.120]  i mean is that once they mute you they then talk in your voice the work people think oh i've just
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:38.640]  been muted no you've not been muted so i want to say a couple things so i didn't really know
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:43.840]  because i i served in the military for 20 plus years and while you're in the military you're
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:47.440]  focused on your job you know 18 hours a day essentially seven days a week especially as a
[2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:51.760]  green beret deployed to different places so you don't really focus on the political conversation
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:57.200]  as much as maybe i should have but as i started to get away from my military you know profession
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:02.720]  and into the political sphere and i started to see who the main influencers and contributors were
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:07.360]  in the political sphere i stumbled across your name and i didn't really know who you were really
[2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:12.160]  until you you know we met a couple years ago but then when you got banned i really looked at your
[2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:17.120]  background i didn't realize you had been doing this for 20 years and all of a sudden the day
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:23.760]  literally and i you know this the day you trended number one in downloads in the app store on apple
[2:28:24.320 --> 2:28:30.960]  above cnn is when they muted you because at that point you became effective i want one of the
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:37.680]  quotes that roger stone meant uses in the his movie uh get me roger stone he says something to the
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:45.120]  effective uh you hate me or if i'm i relish that you hate me because if you didn't hate me i would
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:50.480]  not be effective exactly right let's stay there we'll be right back we'll be right back on the

[2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:26.800]  okay so ivan rakeland is a really interesting guy from a green beret defense intelligence agency
[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:33.200]  formerly lawyer whole nine yards and i've been asking a lot of questions of him here
[2:33:33.200 --> 2:33:36.560]  familiar with his work for like four or five years ran to him about three years ago
[2:33:36.560 --> 2:33:40.640]  then went to get him on the show we've got him here with us coming up next hour tyler nixon
[2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:46.240]  roger stone's lawyer is going to exclusively join us on air despite threats i mean i've got
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:51.360]  articles right here arrest alex jones washington post for talking about the roger stone trial
[2:33:51.360 --> 2:33:57.040]  it's not like i'm acting tough here if i bow down to this i'm done it's not like i'm like
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:04.480]  going ask for you judge i'm man you got a lot of courage a lot of courage this is unconstitutional
[2:34:05.600 --> 2:34:10.800]  the minute i start bowing down to that which is the day i start dying so i always tell listeners
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:16.000]  it's not a heroic position to stand up for what's right it's the default you've got to do it and
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:22.240]  it's just crazy you talk about the special forces in the army uh you know free the innocent stand
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:26.800]  up for the oppressed that's what it's really all about and i've always been impressed by military
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:31.280]  people i know especially uh the green berets the army a lot of family that was involved in that
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:34.640]  they were just the best people you never imagined and they just wanted to free the oppressed but
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:40.720]  they were always mad at the leadership they had i think with trump we finally got real leadership
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:44.800]  i don't think trumps perfect but before we get to all these topics you've got roger stone general
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:49.760]  flan looney laugh corrupt fbi deep state election fraud well what is your gut level approximation
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:54.800]  not as an army officer but just as an american citizen of president trump your real gut view of
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:35:03.040]  him because i respect that view my gut feeling is when he america first really is what resonates
[2:35:03.040 --> 2:35:07.600]  the most i think within the military community so when you say i'm going to promote america and
[2:35:07.600 --> 2:35:12.880]  i want to make sure that i fund the entire military so that it is second to none globally
[2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:20.160]  that's what resonates the most that tells you yes absolutely that means the core ethos
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:26.720]  so going back to what you're talking about with the roger stone trial i don't when you
[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:34.080]  if you may alex when you talk to his attorney why don't you ask how is it possible that the judge
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:40.640]  puts roger stone under a gag order and how is that cool and how does that conflict and follow with
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:45.760]  the first amendment well you're a lawyer but i've talked to a bunch of lawyers it's never been done
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:52.800]  this judge jackson is doing stuff that you're the lawyer tell us it's never been i know i get it
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:56.480]  it's a rhetorical question no i know it's rhetorical you're the lawyer tell us what that means
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:02.080]  right so the first amendment free speech in this instance you have a judge that puts a
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:09.040]  gag order on why on all social media posts that he does every single thing so now he's not able
[2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:13.680]  to defend himself personally thank you for putting the picture up absolutely literally
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:19.120]  you're silencing his ability to defend himself from any smears that are coming from the entire
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:27.680]  mainstream media and and big tech industrial complex and then literally he's done i mean
[2:36:27.680 --> 2:36:34.240]  essentially assassinated by humans not as americans but as humans watching somebody tied up
[2:36:34.240 --> 2:36:39.360]  being stabbed in the gut while they're tied up it's abhorrent
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:48.480]  right this is ridiculous i um i i hope and i uh i would hope that the president
[2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:57.120]  ideally on february 20th the minute before the sentencing comes down he pardons roger stone
[2:36:57.840 --> 2:37:01.920]  that would be beautiful that's perfect don't do it after like a judge is powerful
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:05.600]  do it right before right and do it via tweet
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:12.000]  and that would be the first instance i think in the history of our country where
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:16.160]  part of it would be a twig now granted the paperwork had to follow up through the white
[2:37:16.160 --> 2:37:22.400]  white house council etc no officially it'll be yeah no you're right because the president needs to
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:27.440]  stop all of us need to stop giving authority to the left like like they're the authority and
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:31.920]  over worry what they say because i've already discovered people love it when i'm attacked by
[2:37:31.920 --> 2:37:38.000]  the left it's like currency instead of how do we stop the cowling to them the what do you call
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:44.480]  that spirit of bowing to somebody right everybody wants to i mean there's there's actually valid
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:50.240]  compromise when both sides are uh have the intention of reaching some sort of conclusion
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:55.920]  we're both benefit in this political discourse that we're in right now but one side does they
[2:37:55.920 --> 2:38:00.800]  don't want to compromise so then there's the only way to make it a level playing field
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:08.800]  is to use the same tactics unfortunately what is the psychology of like crazy people that they
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:13.680]  think they're invincible because i mean i've got a lot of influence and i'm strong but i'm not
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:19.840]  overconfident what is it about these these these weirdos that they think they're invincible and no
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:24.720]  matter how many times they lose they keep attacking attacking attacking what is this what is the
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:32.560]  psychology of that well i'm not a psychologist alex but i mean i would say that the fundamental
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:36.400]  issue there is the reason why they they continue to do it is because there are no repercussions
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:42.080]  for the bad behavior exactly they've never been punished the bad behavior is never just exposed
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:50.240]  it's never uncovered you know by your by your uh what is it the uh the amazon post for the dnc new
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:57.200]  york times they're not going to expose it so they believe because mainstream media gives
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:02.080]  them cover to do that no you just said it they believe because mainstream media gives them cover
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:07.680]  that they're but in the court of public opinion they're losing but because they look at the news
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:12.880]  and see cnn say they're good they think they've got to get out of jail free card they don't
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:19.280]  right and on the other side when you scratch your head it's going to be turned into oh my gosh
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:24.400]  look at him scratching his head it's self-mutilation the worst human on the planet ridiculous and
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:30.400]  that's going to be the headline right it's ridiculous so anyway going back to roger stone
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:36.960]  i just hope that uh next week so next week as far as i was tracking on thursday is the sentencing
[2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:43.120]  hearing and hopefully i think it's 10 or 11 in the morning in dc here i'm not too far away myself
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:49.840]  and i'm just hoping that the president that morning uh sends out his pardon via tweet and then clears
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:54.960]  things and then did you see what happened earlier today with andrew mccabe yeah they just said
[2:39:54.960 --> 2:40:02.720]  oh your justice system yeah roger stone goes they're trying to get him into jail for seven
[2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:10.000]  and nine years for what he didn't recall the exact answer for several of the 500 plus questions that
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:14.880]  was asked of him there is testimony before the house permanent select committee on intelligence
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:20.320]  and then you know if i know somebody for 20 years and i'm just kind of being jocular you know shooting
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:27.040]  the you know what i mean shooting the crap with them and say hey buddy uh why do you have to talk
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:32.800]  bad about me and using expletives in it there's no way that the person he's talking to is going to
[2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:37.760]  feel threatened that roger's going to do something to him and then you have one of the jurors i don't
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:42.880]  know you probably already talked about it today on the show one of the jurors is a lackey of donna
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:47.440]  brazil and i believe was a politician that ran oh yeah no she ran for congress and failed yeah
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:52.080]  ridiculous going back to the first thing you asked me what are we it's worse she told him
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:57.840]  in jury selection we have the transcript i paid three thousand dollars for it she said i'm not
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:08.960]  political in the vordir jury selection right yeah yeah for those that don't know jury selection is
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:14.560]  called a vordir but that's what i mean the democrats thought they could suspend all logic and just do
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:20.000]  whatever they wanted to defeat trump and instead they've just blown themselves up so but listen i'm
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:24.960]  never overconfident gut level going to break here minute and a half you're a smart guy i haven't
[2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:29.520]  how do they strike back let's not be overconfident they never give up how do they strike back
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:35.840]  how are they gonna strike back once a pardon occurs or whatever how are they gonna try to
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:43.280]  take trump out now well they're gonna do it through the media it's the constant influx
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:49.120]  whether it's google whether it's you know any big tech twitter they're gonna control it so that
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:54.880]  the information about this lady that is a dnc operative that came out with this post against
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:59.360]  roger stone it's going to be muted so the left is not even going to know it exists we're talking
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:04.000]  about it in a vacuum here because we have the freedom of speech to do so but they're not going
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:09.360]  to see this and so it's not right we're in our own little free world here and they're not ever
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:16.000]  going to see it right so the only way to fight back on it is is to create these different platforms
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:22.400]  that are able to penetrate and create free free speech well that's it you just said it's about
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:28.560]  human action against the censorship okay when we come back loony left corrupt fbid state election
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:37.360]  fraud that's the big one trump could literally have 2020 in 260 days stolen from him if he's not
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:42.800]  aware of it and then what does he do once he's aware of it because soros owns a bunch of machines
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:47.200]  the democrats are registering legal aliens everywhere to vote how do we counter that we come back
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:55.120]  on the other side because that's it election fraud is is key bono don't be a victim if you're worried

[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:45.520]  the republic is strong the republic has been asleep Ivan Raiklin is our guest former green
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:52.160]  beret defense intelligence agency formerly a lawyer a smart guy we can get anything you want
[2:47:52.160 --> 2:47:58.400]  in these closing times before roger stone's lawyer joining us but election fraud that that that's
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:03.680]  really the big Achilles heel of trump and everything else and what's happening in the
[2:48:03.680 --> 2:48:08.960]  election we've seen Iowa we've seen that the democrats stealing stuff I hate bernie sanders
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:13.200]  but he's the guy the democrats want they're stealing it from him again so looking at that
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:17.680]  is that not front and center that really is the ace of spades that's a wild card didn't Ivan
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:23.680]  I wouldn't say it's it's front and center I don't know about the wild card the wild card that
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:28.320]  formerly was the wild card was michael bloomberg but now he's just going to drop several billion
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:34.480]  dollars and purchase the uh purchase the election so I think previously the big discussion was big
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:38.400]  tech now I think he's just going to purchase the election uh one component that we can do I think
[2:48:38.400 --> 2:48:46.240]  and let's back up you think bloomer could actually do it to win the election is going to be a long
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:51.760]  shot to win I don't think he has the will to definitely absolutely so we're going to see
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:55.840]  I mean we're we're going to see whether or not the hypothesis of him pulling it off
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:00.640]  is going to come to fruition on Tuesday or for super Tuesday but I mean the amount of ads
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:05.120]  that he's been purchasing I use this analogy so if you're worth a hundred thousand dollars and you
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:09.600]  drop the fifty six hundred dollar maximum contribution to your preferred candidate
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:15.520]  that would be the equivalent of bloomberg according to you know relating it to his net worth
[2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:21.520]  it would be the equivalent of him dropping three point five billion dollars into his own campaign
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:27.360]  that's more than I believe I I could probably say that's more than all presidential campaigns
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:32.560]  in the collective I think so so here's this republican oligarch coming to the rescue of the
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:40.640]  democrats but so look at the political constellation what is the real reason he's doing it the real
[2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:46.480]  reason is then back in november before he announced uh it was evident that the democrats were going
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:50.560]  to impeach and then biden was was going to his name was going to be brought through the mud with
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:57.360]  his son hunter taking that board seat with berger exactly what they say that they want to remove
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:05.920]  biden and put bloomberg in the poll position absolutely I agree with that assessment absolutely
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:10.800]  uh he you know he's on his way down obviously we saw that with his so we were wondering who
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:16.160]  the big mystery can't it won't be hillary won't it's going to be bloomberg so here's the mystery
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:21.200]  candidate that a lot of people are maybe talking about so if it's bernie if bernie sanders wins
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:28.240]  the nomination I would say that talsy gabbert is probably in on the shortlist for bp for for uh
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:35.040]  bernie and again if we're going back to 2016 with with the her endorsing him back in 2016 so I think
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:39.840]  that still carries some cache even though I think she made some missteps over the last you know a
[2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:47.520]  few months if it's bloomberg uh we have to take a look and see the biggest indicator of my hypothesis
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:54.400]  being true uh accurate is that if hillary clinton takes her residency and moves it from new york to
[2:50:54.400 --> 2:50:58.240]  arkansas or elsewhere that's going to be the biggest indicator that she's going to be the
[2:50:58.240 --> 2:51:03.120]  running mate with bloomberg because if you look at bloomberg you can't have two people from the same
[2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:10.000]  correct you can't come from the same district right according to the constitution I can't
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:15.200]  I can't cite the exact same you can't have two people from the same state same state you cannot
[2:51:15.200 --> 2:51:20.240]  have that so the president and the vice president have to be representatives from a residence of
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:26.080]  two different states so she says illinois or arkansas you know it's done deal it's a done deal
[2:51:26.080 --> 2:51:30.560]  she's going to jump in the race immediately after the convent well we've known all along she plans to
[2:51:30.560 --> 2:51:36.320]  do that whether she was going to do it or not she keeps control the party saying that but it might
[2:51:36.320 --> 2:51:45.600]  actually happen right and I think if that happens uh that's that's a guarantee for for trump's victory
[2:51:45.600 --> 2:51:51.840]  for reelection now bloomberg by himself maybe a stronger person then it'd be a I think it'd be a
[2:51:51.840 --> 2:51:57.760]  challenging race for for trump 2020 but I mean I think they still pull it off with a victory just
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:03.520]  because the money can't buy everything and people don't like bloomberg I mean I don't care if he's
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:08.160]  got ten billion dollars to spend I just don't see people buying and notice he can have all the
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:14.320]  mirrors he want nobody's censoring him but the average mom tries to put a meme out she's censored
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:20.400]  right so hey he's a great capitalist I don't take that away from him at all
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:26.880]  but he has zero charisma I just don't see him motivating people to come out I mean I guess
[2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:31.920]  you can motivate people so much with with money and if that's the only indicator then he has a
[2:52:31.920 --> 2:52:36.880]  chance but outside of that he has he has no ability I think to motivate folks outside of his uh deep
[2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:44.560]  pockets let me ask you this as a citizen gut level I really wanted to get into uh kind of general
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:54.880]  flin's case yeah that ties into significantly 2020 campaign because when you take a 33 year
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:53:01.360]  veteran that's deployed for five years in his career you know very highly decorated general
[2:53:01.360 --> 2:53:07.760]  that took massive amount of risk to help and support our current president in his in his election
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:13.760]  in 2016 and then the entire cabal I mean I'm not going to rehash all these different names goes after
[2:53:13.760 --> 2:53:20.560]  him to essentially remove his ability to clean house and not continue to prosecute him and that's
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:27.920]  a travesty so I'm hoping that his case here shortly the judge in his case allows him to withdraw
[2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:32.480]  as guilty plea because by doing that they're going to be out with Sidney Powell an amazing
[2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:38.560]  attorney is going to be able to call witnesses and do discovery to literally uncover the entire
[2:53:38.560 --> 2:53:43.280]  you know what everybody's been calling the the conspiracy theories well they're no longer going
[2:53:43.280 --> 2:53:50.880]  to be conspiracy theories they're going to be actual conspiracies that are uncovered to undermine
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:55.920]  and dethrone a duly elected president that you know we've been talking about it for three years
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:54:01.200]  but the the mainstream media and the American public has not really seen that and I think
[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:08.160]  the biggest violation of our of our rights occurred and it was uncovered I think it was
[2:54:08.160 --> 2:54:14.400]  about two weeks ago when the foreign intelligence surveillance port put out there publicly that
[2:54:14.400 --> 2:54:20.320]  two of the four FISA warrants that were issued by the court to the FBI to surveil the Trump campaign
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:24.560]  were done illegitimately illegally so that's going to start that's going to continue to open
[2:54:24.560 --> 2:54:30.640]  things up and I think general Flynn's case is instrumental on the outside of uncovering all
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:36.800]  this and then John Durham is going to be uncovering it all of these nefarious activities internally
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:41.280]  in his investigation we're going to start seeing I think Brennan we're going to start seeing all
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:47.360]  these names come out as the initial actors in the entire crossfire hurricane no I agree
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:53.920]  I totally agree with you Ivan but my problem is what is the attorney general going to do
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:58.320]  because right at this critical point of victory he's signaling an attack on Trump
[2:54:59.040 --> 2:55:01.200]  so that's where I'm really worried is that that's happening
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:05.200]  out today you may have missed it because it just came out in that last hour or two
[2:55:05.200 --> 2:55:11.200]  I saw an indication that he just just came out in the public that he appointed somebody internally
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:16.640]  to investigate those prosecutors that are prosecuting general Flynn to determine
[2:55:16.640 --> 2:55:20.880]  whether or not there's any no I saw that he created a new special official office to do that
[2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:28.000]  yes I just picked on maybe it was I just heard his bar installs outside prosecutor
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:36.640]  for a view case against Flynn ex-Trump advisor absolutely I'm not just I'm not an enemy with
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:41.280]  bar I'm not just trying to sit here and like attacking all I know is
[2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:48.320]  is I hand them try to set me up with the Russians I had to go meet with the FBI I'm not going to
[2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:53.600]  talk about on air they asked me not to but they literally had an FBI task force saying that my
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:59.600]  dad and I were Russian agents okay so when you've been through that when you have no connection
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:03.200]  I mean you're about as Russian as I get a rainbow right on the US Army page where everybody you
[2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:07.680]  know it's about as Russian as I get like when you're being accused being a Russian agent you've
[2:56:07.680 --> 2:56:11.920]  done nothing with Russia you start getting a little bit pissed off does that make sense
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:17.520]  not as well you should be absolutely so I mean this this whole process is brings discredited upon
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:23.120]  the entire organization unfortunately I know folks in the FBI and the line line agents doing their
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:29.760]  job doing their job well great risk to themselves to promote the security of our you know the public
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:34.960]  they go home to their families no I get it you understand at the end of the day they literally
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:42.000]  were told I'm a Russian agent with no proof I'm pissed man I want retribution I didn't sell out to
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:47.680]  the the Spanish or the Russians or the Germans or the Japanese that's what pisses me off I'm called a
[2:56:47.680 --> 2:56:53.200]  traitor they never get in trouble they need to get in trouble for this absolutely and I think
[2:56:53.920 --> 2:56:58.720]  I think Barr is on our side 100% even though what he said on that interview I think it's
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:04.640]  essentially signaling to the president that hey I've got this just let me do it it's not maybe
[2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:10.560]  going as quickly as you want it to go but I've got this and it's moving forward nicely because
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:15.840]  there's a lot of you know they're the bureaucracy moves slowly so I think to my assessment was his
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:21.520]  indicate Barr indicated that we've got a handle on this just let me do my job all right well I
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:27.440]  hope you're right you probably are Ivan Raiklin thank you so much Raiklin at Twitter come back

[3:00:55.520 --> 3:01:02.880]  lawyer ivan rakeland i've been enclosing here ahead of roger stone's lawyer joining us
[3:01:02.880 --> 3:01:08.560]  who's always late with the sky playing with it which is okay what would you call i asked
[3:01:08.560 --> 3:01:12.240]  us when you first came on over an hour ago what is this period in history we're in right now
[3:01:14.800 --> 3:01:19.120]  it's a period in history i mean i use the term ridiculous for a whole slew of reasons we talked
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:25.440]  about this you know big tech going after the election fraud we talked about all these cases mccabe
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:30.880]  having one standard of when he lies to the fbi himself he doesn't get prosecuted when somebody
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:35.520]  doesn't lie to the fbi they have a political vendetta with you prosecute him for seven and nine
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:43.040]  years uh there's a whole laundry list oh even in closing yesterday i was at the pro life rally
[3:01:43.040 --> 3:01:47.120]  in richmond virginia you were there a few weeks ago for the gun rally same location
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:53.120]  and guess uh i mean we had several thousand people there and guess who wasn't there
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:59.360]  the governor he's not my governor but he's the governor of the commonwealth of virginia but he's
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:05.440]  keeping babies comfortable oh yeah he's making the babies comfortable you know what i call for
[3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:10.960]  his mother i'm not sure if she's alive but she should consider post birth abortion on her son
[3:02:11.680 --> 3:02:16.640]  exactly legally you're a lawyer if you're gonna kill somebody a month after they're born i'm not
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:20.480]  saying kill the governor but his mother could walk right up just i expect him in the net because
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:25.200]  it's a post birth abortion consult with the physician and if she wants she can consult with
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:30.000]  two positions and then make a decision make sure that governor northerms is comfortable
[3:02:30.560 --> 3:02:36.080]  and then go ahead and abort him because he's acting like an infant i guess i'm not using for
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:41.280]  abortion that may be one of the cases where it's actually you know the women's right is
[3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:48.480]  is supersedes governor northerms rights that's a good point they want to get the babies organs
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:53.120]  they want to say we keep my life after but exactly if it's a week after a month after
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:02:57.280]  55 years after that that's a good point i mean what is north they're going to do god forbid
[3:02:57.280 --> 3:03:02.080]  somebody walks right up to him and says post birth abortion and just stabs him in the neck i mean
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:05.920]  what is what is he going to do like somebody just walks him says you know governor northerm you're
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:12.080]  right i'm decided it's more limited than that alex i argue it's more limited where the mother is the
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:18.400]  only one that can give that authorization right using his logic it would be his mother that would
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:27.600]  be the only one that has the rights to post birth abort him i mean that's that i'm using his argument
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:32.960]  what do you think no i mean i think you're right i just he wants to kill babies all day and i don't
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:39.440]  wish any harm upon him i just wonder what is interesting isn't it interesting that interview
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:43.760]  comes out and i believe the following day it's just almost as though that black parenthood
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:50.800]  put out a hit squad for opera research on governor northerm to find blackface so that the entire you
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:57.280]  know media industrial complex diverted their attention from him making the statements of
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:02.320]  making the babies feel comfortable so that they could be executed after birth and then it transitions
[3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:08.400]  into exactly they pivoted to the racism thing he was the guy with the k k out outfit because you're
[3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:13.760]  right they pivoted they pivoted to the racism i've been rakeland thank you so much rakeland

[3:04:27.840 --> 3:04:35.040]  tyler nexon to talk about what in hell is going on here i mean i can tell you that obviously he's
[3:04:35.040 --> 3:04:39.040]  being threatened not to come on the show and there's this is the big story the next big move
[3:04:39.040 --> 3:04:44.240]  against the president is why are you partying people you don't have that power it's only in the
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:56.720]  constitution well it's finally happening the president is coming out and saying the deep state
[3:04:56.720 --> 3:05:03.440]  are a bunch of out of control criminals that need to be prosecuted and he has fired over 200
[3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:10.320]  senior bureaucrats in the state department and the justice department in just the last few days
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:15.920]  and he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at treasury as soon as she
[3:05:15.920 --> 3:05:23.120]  quit that job he then withdrew the nomination and now she's out on her globalist ass this is beautiful
[3:05:23.120 --> 3:05:28.720]  it's happening but we need to see a lot more all the neocons need to be fired all the obama
[3:05:28.720 --> 3:05:35.760]  appointees fired all the deep state globalists who have resumes with george soros fired fired fired
[3:05:35.760 --> 3:05:43.920]  fired trump is finally unleashed trump is not the red wave he is the red storm and info wars is the
[3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:50.480]  tip of the spear powered by we the people never backing down never giving in and delivering
[3:05:50.480 --> 3:06:01.920]  victory in our time
[3:06:06.320 --> 3:06:09.600]  you've got to admire people that are true to their cause
[3:06:09.600 --> 3:06:23.680]  ilan omar to leave and others i mean they really came to america from their squalid third world
[3:06:23.680 --> 3:06:31.440]  hellholes or women had no power as assassins of stockholm syndrome to conquer us because there
[3:06:31.440 --> 3:06:39.600]  were open hearts and when you saw them at the state of the union last week stand down during a
[3:06:39.600 --> 3:06:44.640]  celebration of the life of a hundred year old world war two heroes it illustrated who they were
[3:06:45.280 --> 3:06:53.520]  horrible pigs who could never be redeemed because they have chips on their dirty shoulders
[3:06:53.520 --> 3:07:01.520]  here's the report that they hope you don't spread as president trump continues to battle the
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:08.640]  globalist forces of the deep state the democrat party continues to take off its mask and reveal
[3:07:08.640 --> 3:07:16.720]  themselves as the true enemy of america and its people last week trump delivered a historic
[3:07:16.720 --> 3:07:22.400]  state of the union address which included an emotional tribute to honor one of the last
[3:07:22.400 --> 3:07:28.640]  remaining heroes of world war two but wait a minute who the hell is that sitting on their asses
[3:07:28.640 --> 3:07:35.360]  during the tribute you guessed it the enemy within that's radical leftist ilhan omar and
[3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:43.120]  reshita to leave caught on camera seeing here refusing to stand up and honor charles magie of
[3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:49.200]  the legendary tuskegee airman a unit of black fighter and bomber pilots who distinguished
[3:07:49.200 --> 3:07:57.120]  themselves during fierce aerial combat missions in world war two after more than 130 combat
[3:07:57.120 --> 3:08:03.680]  missions in world war two he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:12.240]  went on to serve america in korea and vietnam on december 7th charles celebrated his 100th birthday
[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:20.240]  as republicans and democrats rose to a quad this all american hero omar and to leave
[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:26.080]  just couldn't bring themselves to do so in fact they ended up walking out of the speech early
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:33.120]  in defiance of what reshita to leave said was trump's lies and bigotry but hey this shouldn't
[3:08:33.120 --> 3:08:39.680]  really surprise anyone after all these are among the same radical leftist who refused to condemn
[3:08:39.680 --> 3:08:45.520]  antifa after their terrorist attack on an ice facility in takoma washington we are learning
[3:08:45.520 --> 3:08:49.920]  new details about the man who threw explosive devices at an immigration detention center

[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:25.520]  familiar with after the former empire actor came out in january of 2019 and announced to the world
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:30.240]  that trump supporters were responsible for this egregious crime but as investigators look deeper
[3:11:30.240 --> 3:11:34.480]  into his story many things didn't seem to line up and small it was charged with 16 counts of
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:39.280]  disorderly conduct then his charges were magically dropped by an obama link prosecutor working on
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:44.640]  the case and the story all but disappeared by the end of 2019 however small it is now back in the
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:49.600]  headlines after being indicted again by a grand jury on six counts of disorderly conduct for
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:54.640]  allegedly lying to police about the attack and filing a false police reports but let's backtrack
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:11:58.880]  a little i mean it's been over a year since small that came forward with this story and many may
[3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:04.000]  forgotten all of the little details tied to the case such as how he was attacked in a snowy chicago
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:09.360]  night at 2 a.m. after leaving subway when two white males and make america great again hats jumped
[3:12:09.360 --> 3:12:14.000]  out of the shadows and beat him senseless pouring bleach on him while yelling racist and homophobic
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:19.360]  slurs wrapping a noose around his neck and taking off but not before yelling this is maga country

[3:12:52.880 --> 3:12:58.000]  all jokes aside these long-awaited indictments come after a year-long investigation which exposed
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:03.040]  small it's various lies such as who was behind the racial and homophobic attack of small let
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:07.600]  it was discovered that the two masked men who small let described as white males
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:11.840]  were found out to be two nigerian brothers who trained with small let and worked with him on
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:17.680]  empire surveillance footage was also released in which the brothers were caught buying ski masks
[3:13:17.680 --> 3:13:22.080]  red hats and similar rope to the one that was later seen dangling around small that's neck
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:26.960]  they later admitted that small let had not only paid them but it also directed the staged attack
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:32.080]  of course celebrities and politicians didn't waste a second before coming out and support a
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:37.840]  small let and rebuking racism trump supporters and trumps america for not only enabling but
[3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:43.200]  encouraging this type of behavior but small let's case isn't unique after president trump took
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:48.720]  office there has been a rise in fake hate crimes targeted at pushing the idea that white supremacy
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:54.800]  racism and homophobic attacks are commonplace to trump supporters for example back in november of
[3:13:54.800 --> 3:14:02.720]  2016 a church organist spray painted a swastika an anti-gay slur and the words hail trump on an lgbtq
[3:14:02.720 --> 3:14:07.600]  church he attended and when the story first broke several mainstream media outlets tied the hate
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:12.480]  hoax to trump's election he was later arrested after it was found out that he was the very one
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:18.640]  behind the crime he had reported also during that month an 18 year old muslim woman in louisiana
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:24.080]  claimed that two white men one of whom was wearing a maga hat attacked and robbed her taking her
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:28.880]  wallet and his job while yelling racial slurs she later admitted to the police that she made the
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:35.120]  whole thing up in 2018 a 19 year old african-american woman in long island said that a group of four
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:41.120]  teenagers approached her yelling trump 2016 they then told her she didn't belong in the country
[3:14:41.120 --> 3:14:46.880]  slashed her tires and placed a note on her car that said go home however after an investigation
[3:14:46.880 --> 3:14:52.480]  done by police it was learned that none of this ever actually took place these were a few of a
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:57.520]  long list of fake hate crimes with small let's being one of the most prominent he's due in court
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:02.560]  on february 24th where many are waiting to see if justice will finally be served and if trump
[3:15:02.560 --> 3:15:08.240]  supporters will finally be vindicated for the blame of yet another staged hate crime to fight

[3:20:23.760 --> 3:20:31.440]  criminal case and he joins us despite a lot of roadblocks right now live on this friday
[3:20:31.440 --> 3:20:37.360]  valentine's day transmission so tyler we appreciate you coming on we appreciate your
[3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:43.040]  courage as a patriot and army veteran for telling the truth and all you've gone through to defend
[3:20:43.040 --> 3:20:49.040]  roger so much is happening i could ask a lot of questions i think the best thing to do is just
[3:20:49.040 --> 3:20:54.160]  give you the floor about the big national controversy we kept asking what will the
[3:20:54.160 --> 3:20:59.120]  next attack on the president be well it's the pardon of roger stone he's not supposed to
[3:20:59.120 --> 3:21:07.120]  have that power even though it's at the constitution plain as day uh so it is the fiascos uh just
[3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:11.120]  continue so tyler without getting yourself in too much trouble or getting into what's
[3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:16.640]  happening with roger uh just as a citizen as a veteran as a patriot what is happening right now
[3:21:17.600 --> 3:21:20.800]  well i mean you just look at the look at the two-tier justice system we have
[3:21:21.360 --> 3:21:28.800]  with andrew mccabe this lying criminal who was entrusted with such vast power deputy director
[3:21:28.800 --> 3:21:35.200]  of the fbi just totally let off he openly admitted that he lied to his fellow fbi agents to cover up
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:41.280]  the leaking that was going on the seditious activities within the fbi he's let go roger stone
[3:21:41.280 --> 3:21:47.600]  is treated like some sort of uh you know kingpin drug criminal or whatever we have you um this is
[3:21:47.600 --> 3:21:55.120]  they just the left the screeching squealing rapacious left just can never stop short of
[3:21:55.120 --> 3:21:59.920]  going too far in any instance they just don't know when to quit they don't know when to pull back
[3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:05.440]  and they don't know when they've gone too far because they're just greedy manic out of control uh
[3:22:05.440 --> 3:22:10.960]  their thirst their greed their lust for power is is endless i totally agree for new listeners of
[3:22:10.960 --> 3:22:17.440]  viewers tuning in every second tell them mccabe a letter came out today a valentine's president
[3:22:17.440 --> 3:22:22.080]  saying you're not in trouble for all the things you did so talk about that well sure i mean you
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:26.000]  had the federal prosecutors after sitting on it for something like i don't know it's been at least
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:32.800]  a year that since you know mccabe was was fired and basically i think probably more than that
[3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:37.520]  and they were taking all this time to go over i don't know what there was to go over but they
[3:22:37.520 --> 3:22:42.880]  were because he admitted it he admitted that he lied um and you know they finally he lied to
[3:22:42.880 --> 3:22:49.520]  congress he lied to the president he he leaked i mean this guy is incredible yeah well what basically
[3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:54.320]  it came out of a wall street journal story that they talked about like it was basically he leaked
[3:22:54.320 --> 3:22:59.600]  to the media and they inspect inspector general and others you know wanted to find out what is
[3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:03.360]  the source of these leaks because you know they had combi the leaker i mean you know these guys
[3:23:03.360 --> 3:23:07.600]  they're they're great they're great at playing this game i mean shiff being the ringmaster of all
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:13.520]  in washington on that front um but you know basically they were they were uh looking into uh
[3:23:13.520 --> 3:23:19.200]  these stories that had gotten out and and you know we're basically uh favorable to i guess the clintons
[3:23:19.200 --> 3:23:25.200]  in the clinton foundation and and uh during the election human trafficking blackmail ring
[3:23:25.200 --> 3:23:31.360]  which which the justice department just prostates themselves to yeah and and so basically mccabe
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:37.280]  had told his own fbi agents his own fellow agents uh under him that he had not like a lot he did not
[3:23:37.280 --> 3:23:43.200]  allow the fbi to speak to anyone um about you know about the uh conduct of the uh investigation of
[3:23:43.200 --> 3:23:48.800]  the clinton foundation and so forth and so he lied he was lying he had he'd basically been
[3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:53.520]  doing the leaking he had been uh you know he had known about what was going on i think combi had
[3:23:53.520 --> 3:23:58.000]  briefed him and just put this way i mean it just comes down to their little power cabal at the top
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:01.600]  thought they could get away with this stuff and guess what they have now they have gotten away
[3:24:01.600 --> 3:24:06.400]  with it because he has let off scott free i mean the most disgusting thing i've seen i think in
[3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:12.800]  recent memory was andrew mccabe denouncing uh the possibility of roger stone receiving any
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:18.880]  clemency and lasting president coming out i mean it's like exactly so no it's like some kind of uh
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:24.320]  some kind of cult in which they have to be brazen about their crimes and dirty deeds just because
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:29.280]  i had a guest on earlier saying bars sold out but then i want to be fair i don't know the truth
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:33.840]  i'm not god you're you're saying no this is a little bit more sophisticated what do you think
[3:24:33.840 --> 3:24:38.800]  about bill bar i you know i'm so i'm on the fence with that roger it's it's tough because i think he's
[3:24:38.800 --> 3:24:43.920]  well it comes down to i guess i i should believe my lying eyes um he says the right things he gave
[3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:49.600]  a speech at the federalist society annual lawyers convention which was which was outstanding he
[3:24:49.600 --> 3:24:53.600]  talked about he put his finger on exactly what they're doing which is this this resistance campaign
[3:24:53.600 --> 3:24:58.720]  trying to thwart the proper operations of the united states government and the presidency
[3:24:58.720 --> 3:25:04.640]  and yet nothing happens i mean these guys i hate to say it's like the as an attorney i'm not i'm not
[3:25:04.640 --> 3:25:08.880]  i'll consider myself part of it but you get into the legal realm of things you get into like
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:13.120]  investigators fbi agents and attorneys and the justice department and the larger bar
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:17.120]  yeah it well it becomes not it becomes gray it becomes like a cabal or most of
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:21.920]  well we don't go after our own kind of thing you know it's like this self protective thing i mean
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:26.720]  one of the things that the disciplinary system and this is probably little known to most people
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:31.520]  the disciplinary system throughout the country uh it's state and there's no real federal level
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:36.720]  but it's not designed in any way to punish it says straight up we don't take action against
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:40.800]  attorneys who've committed crimes or done anything to punish them in any way whatsoever
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:46.560]  it's to protect the sanctity of the uh you know the legal profession and to lesser extent the
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:52.880]  justice system itself and so they're really better get protecting a coup is going to destroy
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:57.760]  lawyers forever so yeah that's what they don't over confidence so long right they are like
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:02.720]  literally reaping the whirlwind right now yeah the lids blown off everything they it's a joke to
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:08.880]  think that they can uh let let someone like an andrew mccabe go who everybody knows it and he
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:14.560]  admitted it that he had misled and lied to his fellow fbi agents which is a federal felony i mean
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:19.760]  so let's go back to this let's go back to this tell our next lawyer roger's lawyer what does it mean
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:25.200]  right now that bar came out and made these statements because clearly i'm no lawyer but
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:29.280]  the president can bat mouth courts the presidents always have done that there's always a battle
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:34.880]  between executive and judicial and legislative as well so that statement what was that meant to do
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:40.960]  well you know i i i tend to think the fact that trump didn't blast back at him tells me
[3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:45.280]  that there might have been a little bit of a kabuki dance going on there uh that it might
[3:26:45.280 --> 3:26:49.920]  have been a setup in a sense and they sort of rope-adoped uh the people who would were talking
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:54.800]  about impeaching bar and then you know trump goes into uh you know who's already been impeached and
[3:26:54.800 --> 3:27:01.440]  exonerated goes into sort of his uh his you know twitter uh rant mode and draws attention away from
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:06.960]  bar who then looks like why is bar covering up epstein you know that's a good question i mean i
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:11.680]  think that the problem is you're dealing with messes that go deeper than even bars no i mean i
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:16.480]  believe me i get it it's like it's a huge black mill ring how do you how do you unwind something
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:22.240]  like that i mean it again it runs so deep it's a good good good question and the problem is you
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:26.480]  know bill bar sits at the top he's responsible for every prosecution in the country and and so
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:31.680]  does any attorney general and you know i i suppose if you really wanted to bore into it he could
[3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:35.840]  but you know some attorneys generals to say look you know i'm not going to get involved in the
[3:27:35.840 --> 3:27:40.720]  weeds and into the lower level stuff i mean yeah he was i can tell you the pentagon's piston bar
[3:27:40.720 --> 3:27:46.240]  and and these lawyers think all day like they're the only ones that exist i don't i don't work
[3:27:46.240 --> 3:27:51.120]  with the pentagon but i mean they're the ones that actually do the do the do the deeds the pentagon
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:56.320]  is like almost done right now because they've they've seen this and if trump's week that's fine
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:28:00.320]  they're good they're they're gonna fill in for the president so i just hope all these lawyers
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:04.720]  realize that they're really they're at the end of their rubs right now they're just like right at
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:08.720]  the end of their rubs yeah i'll tell you what you know it's unfortunate because you're not
[3:28:08.720 --> 3:28:13.040]  gonna be honest to yourself i mean you know the pentagon's pissed yeah absolutely and here's the
[3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:20.320]  things you you know i thought of roger stone with him as it says sort of informal counselor in the
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:25.360]  white house to give him guidance on who to choose who to select who to surround himself with you
[3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:31.440]  think about all the times that he appeared roger did on uh info wars and said this guy is no this

[3:30:55.040 --> 3:31:02.000]  from info wars your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the globalist
[3:31:02.000 --> 3:31:07.440]  system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s but worldwide and
[3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:13.440]  president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[3:31:13.440 --> 3:31:18.960]  as well you're still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some
[3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:23.600]  other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china
[3:31:23.600 --> 3:31:30.000]  trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:35.520]  being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[3:31:36.320 --> 3:31:40.240]  against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[3:31:40.240 --> 3:31:46.080]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[3:31:46.080 --> 3:31:51.280]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:31:51.280 --> 3:31:58.000]  i have confirmed with high-level sources that president trump is intending to either pardon
[3:31:58.000 --> 3:32:04.000]  roger stone after his sentencing or give him clemency saying the conviction stands but you
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:10.560]  now basically don't go to jail either way this is incredibly good news but let's not forget julian
[3:32:10.560 --> 3:32:15.600]  assange that's one of the biggest black marks on trump is that he famously said i don't know who
[3:32:15.600 --> 3:32:20.160]  got the emails i don't know where they came from the russians a fat dude in his mom's basement
[3:32:20.160 --> 3:32:25.520]  whoever's got him release him it's about hillary committing a crime not who has the emails don't
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:30.720]  change the subject well julian assange undoubtedly took trump over the top the wiki leaks expose the
[3:32:30.720 --> 3:32:36.240]  deep state the man is a hero daniel ellsberg was a hero well assange is even a bigger hero and he's
[3:32:36.240 --> 3:32:41.040]  rotting in solitary confinement and the court hearings can barely talk president trump do the
[3:32:41.040 --> 3:32:46.800]  right thing and ask the british to release julian assange and give him a medal president trump you
[3:32:46.800 --> 3:32:52.240]  must release julian assange free julian assange free julian assange
[3:32:54.800 --> 3:33:02.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:02.720 --> 3:33:26.480]  okay well toller nixon last minute decided to disconnect and try to get a video feed to us
[3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:31.120]  we have his audio that's all that matters but whatever we didn't cut him off while he's doing
[3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:36.480]  whatever he's doing it may take two days three weeks hundred years who knows it's like karmically
[3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:43.200]  this is just what happens but hey it's high technology you know skypin video up on satellites
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:50.160]  on tv stations all of the country it's amazing all i know is is the attack on president trump and
[3:33:50.160 --> 3:33:57.280]  the attack on roger stone is an attack on us all and that we need a repudiation of what has happened
[3:33:57.280 --> 3:34:02.480]  to roger stone not for roger stone even though i'm friends of roger and he's an innocent man
[3:34:03.600 --> 3:34:09.520]  the president needs to say forget all this russia crap you people didn't deliver any evidence
[3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:17.680]  and we're gonna pardon everybody because let me tell you i i'm not a wimp and i'm not a grand
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:22.720]  standard but man when you're watching senate intelligence committees and house armed services
[3:34:22.720 --> 3:34:28.400]  committees and there's generals up there and senators they're calling you a russian agent
[3:34:29.120 --> 3:34:30.000]  i mean you're like
[3:34:34.320 --> 3:34:42.000]  i mean you get pissed i mean it's i mean we had a russian on that's a green beret us
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:46.880]  patriot born in the us earlier that's as close to russians nothing against russians but it's like
[3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:53.840]  like when you're accused of things that are a hundred percent not true it doesn't make you
[3:34:53.840 --> 3:35:01.600]  tower in fear it pisses you off especially when the people doing it are globalist
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:08.400]  that say no borders don't wall no usa at all america sucks they're creating racism they're
[3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:14.960]  creating division they walk out when this tuskegee airman a hero of world war two a hundred-year-old
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:21.040]  black man those guys kicked ass world war two they walk out there in the ski airman and then you've
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:28.640]  got to let them be the moral authority to tell you how you're a piece of crap you get pissed so
[3:35:28.640 --> 3:35:34.480]  so we do have him now and i appreciate roger stone's lawyer joining us how is roger doing in spirits
[3:35:35.280 --> 3:35:40.640]  because just 24 hours ago i'm like oh great trump's standing up this is so wonderful and
[3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:46.400]  he's going to pardon roger and then the whole new scandal is the president can't pardon somebody
[3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:52.880]  you're a lawyer you're a smart guy tyler but anybody can go look at the constitution the
[3:35:52.880 --> 3:35:58.480]  president can pardon whoever he wants so the idea that the new scandal is that the president was
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:06.000]  going to pardon somebody it's it's just they're trying to sabotage any regular presidential
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:12.320]  activity is that accurate yeah i mean if this the democrats scum and the left had their way
[3:36:12.320 --> 3:36:16.000]  at least during the trump presidency they would abolish article two of the constitution
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:20.480]  i mean the president's pardon power is absolute and it's un there's no appeal from it there's
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:25.200]  no ability to countermand it there's no review of it it's it's absolute it's final you could pull
[3:36:25.200 --> 3:36:30.400]  out a you could pull out a cocktail napkin right now and end the madness with roger uh you know and
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:35.200]  i think i think trump wants to my hope is and if let me tell you something if he does not pardon
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:40.480]  roger or commute his sentence or whatever it be and there isn't executive clemency and roger has
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:45.920]  to face any even a minute behind bars trump will have lost me and a lot of other americans too no i
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:52.640]  agree because forget roger roger's great it's prima facia power the presidency if they can
[3:36:52.640 --> 3:36:58.480]  call him not to use this basic power it's ridiculous yeah and then this is what they try this is
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:05.280]  their this has been their modus operandi for the last 40 odd years is to attempt to
[3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:13.760]  drum up a bunch of hypocritical hyper uh you know hair splitting kind of uh what's the word i guess
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:19.520]  sort of um tricks and and uh traps in order to make it look as though a normal exercise of power
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:24.960]  by any republican as some sort of abuse in order to cow and to intimidate republicans
[3:37:24.960 --> 3:37:30.960]  of which we had plenty of squishy exactly every one just stop bowing down to it it's like that's
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:35.280]  right i know i agree and trump's the first one i think who was really just said you know in their
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:41.040]  faces f you for that lack of a you know in so many not those words but you don't have saying
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:44.640]  he stuck it right back to them and said i don't care what you think i don't care what you say
[3:37:44.640 --> 3:37:50.160]  you people are never going to be pleased you're never going to be uh uh dissuaded from your your
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:55.360]  maniacal path of destroying anybody who's in your way and stands in the way of your power
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:37:59.200]  so let's just not kid ourselves let's drop the pretense that we've operated on for the
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:04.240]  last 30 years where people like george hw bush they called him will wimp i mean the guy bent
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:10.160]  over backwards to accommodate the the democrat junta raising taxes and you know everything
[3:38:10.160 --> 3:38:14.640]  anything they wanted as long as nothing appeases them nothing nothing yeah and the thing is
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:19.920]  that what that what the what they held over what they were able to i think leverage against the to the
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:25.200]  typical republican uh sort of establishment as we've known and it has been their militarist overseas
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:30.240]  designs they've been able to sort of say you know what you guys can run amok and and domestically
[3:38:30.240 --> 3:38:35.760]  with all this uh quasi socialism on the path to socialism and let's just let us have our overseas
[3:38:35.760 --> 3:38:40.160]  wars and our interventions and our and our uh you know military industrial police exactly
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:45.440]  let's just do what they want here while they get imperial power that's right and and trump's the
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:49.440]  first one to come in and say what are we doing in the middle east and and be serious about it
[3:38:49.440 --> 3:38:54.240]  and to say what what is going on with uh you know all this corruption that goes on on uh uh
[3:38:54.240 --> 3:38:59.120]  unaddressed in the in the government and you know look i like i said saying earlier if roger stone
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:04.320]  had been if trump had been smart enough to to not listen to the palace guard who've done him no
[3:39:04.320 --> 3:39:09.360]  favors frankly who brought in and allowed to fester right underneath his nose to i mean ben
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:13.200]  roads packed the national security council they raised the number of people in there from 100 to
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:18.880]  250 i mean literally up until just recently you had obama ben roads and beds in the national
[3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:24.240]  security council undermining the president which made them totally disrespect the president so
[3:39:24.240 --> 3:39:30.800]  now that he's awake and moving to fire him that's when bar activates and comes out and attacks him
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:36.400]  yeah well you know i hate to say it i mean this bar door um all this stuff i keep i've heard this
[3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:40.080]  so many times we've all heard it so many times oh there's right on the eve of the inspector
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:44.640]  general reports coming out that's going to be these people are ultimately uh you know bars
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:49.840]  an establishment creature and a bushy they're all covering their ass yeah exactly and they and the
[3:39:49.840 --> 3:39:56.880]  problem is they view the the the larger institution of their dc centric you know beltway globalist
[3:39:56.880 --> 3:40:03.120]  power as more important than any one outrage or investigation as powerful as they think they are
[3:40:03.120 --> 3:40:08.080]  none of it's working for them now they're all in defense they're they're falling what are they
[3:40:08.080 --> 3:40:12.800]  thinking right now because like the best they can do is just try to stymie us for a while they're
[3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:18.960]  losing right now they absolutely are we have never before in history and i mean i've been 36 years
[3:40:18.960 --> 3:40:24.560]  in american politics uh since i was a little kid uh volunteering on the reagan campaign i've never
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:31.360]  seen it uh this expose and this out in the open and them and the other side the the uh uh you know
[3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:37.200]  the dc so-and-so is the elites i've never seen them so scurrying around uh acting like crazy uh
[3:40:37.840 --> 3:40:42.320]  out of control sort of uh just gone berserk really i mean they're there i mean you see the the
[3:40:42.320 --> 3:40:47.600]  rhetoric has reached such extremes chuck schumer i mean this guy this this clown stands up in the
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:53.200]  end the Pelosi of them and you know the thing is you hear it and it's extreme and i think it's
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:57.680]  attempting to demoralize us and to make us feel like oh my god they're really on the march and
[3:40:57.680 --> 3:41:03.280]  this has always been the way the left operates is sound and fury for a tiny percentage of
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:10.080]  screechers who uh to to basically intimidate us what is the way out for trump when we come back
[3:41:10.080 --> 3:41:14.960]  from right but but like what about roger i mean how is he doing under all of this
[3:41:15.920 --> 3:41:21.440]  roger is he who would not be buoyed by the last two days regardless of where it goes because he
[3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:26.400]  has solid grounds frankly for appeal and for overturning this he has solid grounds for a mist
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:32.480]  trial now because of these uh these uh despicable leftist jurors who lied their way onto the jury
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:37.600]  as we expected to happen i mean we all knew was going to happen this judge allowed it to happen
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:41.440]  uh you know in fact facilitated it in my opinion sitting there listening to her
[3:41:41.440 --> 3:41:46.400]  laughable attempts to give the veneer of questioning these people and certainly not in
[3:41:46.400 --> 3:41:52.320]  the meanwhile michael abinani has now been convicted of trying to extort nikey today
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:57.680]  that's right yeah they're yeah the guy they had on is their savior their future presidential
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:02.800]  candidate i mean remember now like he was invincible he was his god oh yeah yeah he was gonna he was
[3:42:02.800 --> 3:42:08.160]  gonna debate trump personally i mean these people's judgment is so piss poor on its face
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:12.800]  and yet you know no matter how many times they're discredited and embarrassed and exposed and prove
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:18.400]  wrong they still persist and so you know that's where we need to basically just realize stop
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:22.960]  trying to appease these people f them you know what i'm saying let's go no exactly we're gonna do
[3:42:22.960 --> 3:42:29.600]  we're gonna do and use the power stop use the power you have yeah exactly absolutely so stop laying
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:34.480]  down stop letting them run us over stop trying to you know for years and it's to an extent it's
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:39.280]  sharpened our game the fact that they would throw lies at us they would exaggerate and and and uh
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:44.720]  caricaturize us made us have to like sharpen our game always be righteous kill us only makes it
[3:42:44.720 --> 3:42:51.600]  stronger so i want to talk about the different scenarios with roger you come back well it's
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:56.480]  finally happening the president is coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out of
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:05.040]  control criminals that need to be prosecuted and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state
[3:43:05.040 --> 3:43:11.200]  department and the justice department in just the last few days and he took the head prosecutor
[3:43:11.200 --> 3:43:17.280]  over stone and offered her a job at treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the
[3:43:17.280 --> 3:43:23.120]  nomination and now she's out on her globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to
[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:30.080]  see a lot more all the neocons need to be fired all the obama appointees fired all the deep state
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:37.120]  globalists who have resumes with george soros fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:44.800]  trump is not the red wave he is the red storm and info wars is the tip of the spear powered by
[3:43:44.800 --> 3:43:51.360]  we the people never backing down never giving in and delivering victory in our time there's
[3:43:51.360 --> 3:43:57.520]  roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things

[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:05.520]  trying to overthrow the president they're trying to silence free speech they're trying to trigger
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:09.760]  riots in the streets but everything they do is blowing up in their face we the people have

[3:44:53.280 --> 3:44:58.080]  super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:02.560]  and i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like well
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:06.400]  what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell me and oh so
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:12.320]  here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste i've
[3:45:12.320 --> 3:45:17.680]  ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free
[3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:23.120]  i think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after i brush my
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:28.720]  teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i
[3:45:28.720 --> 3:45:34.720]  brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in
[3:45:34.720 --> 3:45:40.720]  my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[3:45:40.720 --> 3:45:56.720]  a day now because i like the way it feels three weeks ago we told you that the pentagon had set up
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:46:01.200]  secret quarantine centers for the coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:05.920]  than we were being told now we know that that is the case and we know the federal government
[3:46:05.920 --> 3:46:10.560]  and major corporations have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country

[3:46:58.400 --> 3:47:10.880]  there's no way to describe how real it is on this planet
[3:47:11.680 --> 3:47:20.480]  space the gas giants the sun the moon all of its real our parents our children who we are
[3:47:20.480 --> 3:47:28.000]  are we're all humans this is so real right now and you can feel the very destiny of humanity
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:36.160]  being decided right now i'm so blessed to be here i bet on humanity a long time ago i'm
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:44.560]  believed in humanity and i knew that if we simply promoted a pro-human future that people would buy
[3:47:44.560 --> 3:47:52.480]  into that so we'd have a future and now we're here the battle is joined we're talking to
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:59.120]  taller next to roger stone's private lawyer not his lawyer in these cases and you know i've been
[3:47:59.120 --> 3:48:05.040]  honest with people i've told roger hey come on the air and talk about politics and you're a smart
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:09.200]  guy we don't want to hear about russia and how you're innocent we know you're innocent dude we
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:14.640]  know you're not a russian agent give me a break it's like telling a pterodactyl it's santa claus like
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:20.640]  we know that's not what this but now roger's the big issue because now it's the new political
[3:48:20.640 --> 3:48:25.600]  football to get rid of trump and then he can't pardon somebody because they think the average
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:31.440]  americans dumb like you can't have a president let somebody go i mean that's crazy we never heard
[3:48:31.440 --> 3:48:38.560]  of that before and if you see that political ignorance they're counting on but it's not working
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:46.560]  so tyler and closing what are you predicting next week on the 20th that what what day is
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:54.560]  the 20th is that thursday friday what day is the 20th do you predict that the judge punts
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:49:03.920]  and like kicks it out or do they say that again guys man if i can you hear me yeah they're like
[3:49:03.920 --> 3:49:09.200]  popping in on me talking to me i don't know they're like give me on sure well first let's hold on
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:14.080]  toller let me hear what they have to say just it's it's next thursday okay thank you it's next
[3:49:14.080 --> 3:49:18.880]  thursday please continue toller well i just want to first affirm what you said at the beginning
[3:49:18.880 --> 3:49:24.640]  and uh and thank you and tell you how much uh so many of us appreciate your approach to things
[3:49:24.640 --> 3:49:29.440]  which is a human approach you know that humanity is where it's at and and the the the hopes for
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:36.560]  humanity the the prospect that we will overcome these evil elements these demonic in many cases
[3:49:36.560 --> 3:49:42.320]  elements that that run amongst us and have uh deceived mankind for so long and i think so
[3:49:42.320 --> 3:49:46.640]  many people's eyes are open now and i think you've been a leader in that and and bringing
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:51.600]  attention to that on that level of you know this is this is a planetary thing and this is a this is
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:57.120]  the future of our our species basically is so important because it puts things in perspective
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:50:02.240]  i think when we get involved in the weeds of these uh these political trash who are always
[3:50:02.240 --> 3:50:07.280]  trying to tie everybody up they're right it's just good versus evil and snare yeah and snare us
[3:50:07.280 --> 3:50:12.160]  and their intrigues and all their their uh sophistry uh you know if i could predict what
[3:50:12.160 --> 3:50:16.800]  this judge is gonna do uh you know i think i'd be i'd probably be a lot more wealthy than i am
[3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:21.520]  which is not much but that being said look she's gonna throw the devil that's what she's gonna do
[3:50:21.520 --> 3:50:26.160]  yeah she's gonna do she's gonna try she's gonna try to i think to some extent justify herself
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:31.440]  uh with some sort of i mean first of all the whole thing with the roger stone violated
[3:50:31.440 --> 3:50:35.120]  the gag order and this that the other i mean that that that's a bunch of bunco that they've
[3:50:35.120 --> 3:50:38.960]  been pushing and then mainly mainly here's the thing here no one's ever heard of a gag order
[3:50:38.960 --> 3:50:43.760]  that goes past the trial oh my god almighty i've never heard of it you know or much less
[3:50:43.760 --> 3:50:48.000]  one that extends beyond the contours of the case to where he can't post anything he can't
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:53.120]  wish his wife a happy birthday on facebook you know but you know that being said look the four
[3:50:53.120 --> 3:50:59.600]  stuges are gone these elinsky cravis jed whatever morando scum yeah the left the left thought they
[3:50:59.600 --> 3:51:04.160]  were invincible they thought that they were going to have victory in all this criminality
[3:51:04.160 --> 3:51:10.000]  but now that it's not turning up what do they do next well you know that they the judge i think is
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:16.320]  gonna uh i think she's gonna try to give him enough to make it hurt but not so much that it prompts
[3:51:16.320 --> 3:51:21.840]  an outcry i don't think she realizes though that at this point with the revelations concerning
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:26.720]  this prosecutorial corruption which of all of us in the team have known about well you know
[3:51:26.720 --> 3:51:30.640]  those of us close to roger have known about all along from get go what i would have put up
[3:51:31.360 --> 3:51:37.520]  which which hunt show trial this has been but with all that and now these revelations of tainted
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:43.360]  jurors and this to meek a heart who was you know a congressional i mean that it it's just insane
[3:51:43.360 --> 3:51:48.800]  i don't think she's gonna have uh listen remember when i said arrest me because we pointed out
[3:51:48.800 --> 3:51:54.160]  that the woman headed up a federal agency and that her husband was on the miller report
[3:51:54.720 --> 3:51:58.720]  i mean yeah the problem our problem is you can't distinguish the media matters propaganda from
[3:51:58.720 --> 3:52:04.000]  the what the court or anybody else legit was so formerly so-called legitimate outlets say
[3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:10.000]  i mean they get their talking points from the uh the most trashy uh maniacal maniacal matters
[3:52:10.000 --> 3:52:15.760]  gives the orders out everyone follows it like it would came out of jesus christ mount it's so true
[3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:19.920]  and you know you think it's it's it sounds like at first like oh come on that's just that's just a
[3:52:19.920 --> 3:52:26.560]  propaganda talking point it's it's absolutely true i mean literally in the filing uh concerning uh
[3:52:26.560 --> 3:52:32.000]  that that called you out for mentioning roger uh and just passing along that he you know his
[3:52:32.000 --> 3:52:36.480]  sentiment was he hoped for a pardon uh and they distorted that into somehow you know of
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:41.600]  attributing it to roger well he was in the news media matters media matters he said i trusted
[3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:48.000]  god in the pardon i quoted that i said roger trusting god in the pardon he gave why can't he
[3:52:48.000 --> 3:52:52.080]  say that yeah yeah i'm sorry but we need to push back this and this is another thing that
[3:52:52.080 --> 3:52:57.920]  irks me about his uh his legal to his defense team is for well in addition to having thrown
[3:52:57.920 --> 3:53:05.840]  him under the bus when that first ridiculous uh gag order uh was uh the well a violation uh
[3:53:05.840 --> 3:53:12.240]  motion was put in place but that's the so-called crosshairs which by the way in the uh in the
[3:53:12.240 --> 3:53:16.880]  memorandum of sentencing from the four stooges they called firearm crosshairs like give me a
[3:53:16.880 --> 3:53:23.760]  break this is at any rate um his lawyer threw him under the bus and basically set him up to be to
[3:53:23.760 --> 3:53:28.640]  let this judge shove his own lawyers uh words in his face at every subsequent tightening of the gag
[3:53:28.640 --> 3:53:33.440]  order but you know i i mean my personal counsel and this is you know this is just as a friend to
[3:53:33.440 --> 3:53:38.320]  roger and by the way i don't speak for roger in any way i just you know want to get that clear
[3:53:38.320 --> 3:53:41.920]  and i know you've said it as well i do not speak for roger he doesn't prompt me doesn't tell me
[3:53:41.920 --> 3:53:46.480]  what to say i don't tell him what to say but i if i were him i at this point i would i would come out
[3:53:46.480 --> 3:53:51.520]  and say i'm done being gagged i live in a in a free country and we're going to keep it this way
[3:53:51.520 --> 3:53:57.440]  the first amendment gives me this right no judge totally fear his speech during this whole fiasco
[3:53:57.440 --> 3:54:02.320]  yeah yeah no no they'd better they'd rather have him silence unable to defend himself
[3:54:02.320 --> 3:54:07.040]  and i think it's in order somewhat to his benefit in the sense that well it's also in order to our
[3:54:07.040 --> 3:54:13.120]  relief because when you can't speak and you can't get uh you know he can't stand up for himself
[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:16.640]  you start to worry that people have forgotten and have forgotten the the plate that you're
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:21.920]  still they're certainly not forgotten now they're totally pissed and no it's coming before and stone
[3:54:21.920 --> 3:54:26.720]  right now all right he does he does paler nixon thank you so much how do folks follow you on twitter

[3:54:43.600 --> 3:54:48.000]  and thank you so much i appreciate you god bless you all right all right the war room's about to
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:56.880]  start with on shroyer and savannah hernandez and others um this is all a ridiculous fiasco they're
[3:54:56.880 --> 3:55:00.800]  all a bunch of cowards all a bunch of lawyers that sit around all day kissing each other's
[3:55:00.800 --> 3:55:06.480]  asses and trying to figure out what side to be on they're not leaders they don't say this is the
[3:55:06.480 --> 3:55:14.000]  right thing to do we're gonna do this but i am because that's all i've got i will never have a
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:18.720]  committee meeting about the right thing to do i will never sit down with a bunch of people and
[3:55:18.720 --> 3:55:24.320]  decide how do i make a better position for myself man back when they offered me ten million dollars
[3:55:24.320 --> 3:55:32.000]  in a book deal like 15 16 years ago i've since weighed more weight way more than ten million
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:38.800]  dollars but it was ten million dollars to fund an operation and do what i want that was real money
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:47.600]  that was value the average person thinks success is finally getting there where the establishment
[3:55:47.600 --> 3:55:57.120]  goes here's the money you're with us now but i already had the kiss at your group and others
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:56:04.960]  offer me all the money and all the power i don't want to be with them in fact i want to pour gas
[3:56:04.960 --> 3:56:13.280]  leave on i mean i'm not a violent person except i really am and i'm not going to do this myself
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:20.640]  i'm going to do this through all of us and i just really want human success and i don't
[3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:26.480]  like a bunch of chicken shits working against humanity and i want them to know there's people
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:31.520]  that aren't for sale and there are people that will get their hands around your neck until your
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:38.000]  eyeballs pop out of your head and so that's really what this broadcast is all about is a big fu
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:44.640]  to the satan worshippers and the pedophiles and the control freaks and everybody that wants to
[3:56:44.640 --> 3:56:50.400]  get little clubs and decide that you've really made it because you're part of the system i'm here
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:57.680]  to blow your system up and i'm here to run ice picks through your ice and if i die in the process
[3:56:57.680 --> 3:57:04.080]  well that's even better isn't it because you people are cowards and i don't mean our audience our
[3:57:04.080 --> 3:57:07.600]  audience is the best people on earth but the people that serve satan
[3:57:10.560 --> 3:57:18.240]  you're gonna burn in hell and i'm gonna make sure that happens so uh the war rooms coming up
[3:57:18.240 --> 3:57:23.520]  we had a really good four hour show today and i really appreciate the crew doing an amazing job
[3:57:23.520 --> 3:57:30.240]  so the war rooms coming up don't spread the links don't tell people about the show
[3:57:30.240 --> 3:57:53.760]  so just bow down to the world government okay just give up give up give up give up actually don't do that
