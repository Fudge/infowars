[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Here we are, Friday, January 28th, 22nd, the Battle to Retake Canada is peacefully happening right now.
[00:12.000 --> 00:30.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:42.000 --> 01:10.000]  The longest convoy ever recorded in Canadian history, 50-something miles long, some estimates from over a million truckers, and more people are joining a peaceful civil disobedience fight. This is how you do it.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  Yeah, we're not gonna take it.
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  It's for those literally announced he's gonna hide in his house claiming he has COVID. Unbelievable.
[01:23.000 --> 01:47.000]  That's Klaus Schwab's man that he says he owns.
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.000]  We'll fight, you'll see.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  Oh, we're in a Saturday.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  We're not gonna take it.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  Oh, rocking this song when I was 10 years old, folks.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  38 years ago.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  Canada is under globalist attack. Canada is now waking up. This is literally a UN great reset post industrial assault.
[02:39.000 --> 02:59.000]  And as good as that news is, we're gonna be tracking it as it unfolds the first of close to a million trucks now arriving in the capital of Canada as the people seek to peacefully recapture their land from the clutches of the Bilderberg group.
[02:59.000 --> 03:10.000]  Wow.
[03:10.000 --> 03:25.000]  Yeah.
[03:25.000 --> 03:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the fight to save our republic and to save all of our nations is now the front lines of that fight are Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  The globalists have seized almost every major blue city and still have them under their martial law system.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  We must retake the hearts and minds of the people. We must let them know about the great reset, the new world order.
[03:49.000 --> 04:04.000]  We must galvanize the resolve against it and call not just to cut the heads off politically of this system, but to actually stab the giant evil hydra in the heart by politically non violently digging them out of their holes
[04:04.000 --> 04:14.000]  and then prosecuting them for crimes against humanity. And that's now being called for in parliaments and governments around the world by more and more prominent people.
[04:14.000 --> 04:26.000]  And the new world order has fear in its eyes. The head of Pfizer, Fauci, Gates, all of them aren't laughing anymore because it's blown up in their face.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  They knew there'd be opposition, but not at the level they thought.
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  Now listen, I just did a 40 minute interview commercial free with General Flynn. It'll be posted in the next few hours at band.video.
[04:37.000 --> 04:46.000]  We got excerpts coming up though this hour where he warns of imminent false flag in America to bring in martial law against the American people and a civil emergency.
[04:46.000 --> 05:01.000]  This is serious business. Tomorrow's news today, my Paul Revere's. So here's your mission. If you choose to accept it, take the live feeds at band.video and infowars.com and share them now.
[05:01.000 --> 05:17.000]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill and it is the fastest growing market and supplements in the world for good reason. There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some nine that do incredible things in our brains.
[05:17.000 --> 05:27.000]  And we've tried them all. We've researched them all and we will not sell you anything that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity or any type of extreme hangovers.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  I mean, because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit of a let down once you take them, but that would just be a lie.
[05:33.000 --> 05:44.000]  But these are very, very clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you. And one of our best sellers is back in stock, Brain Force Plus, a good clean, Neutropic, a good clean brain pill.
[05:44.000 --> 05:53.000]  You can find stuff that's stronger, but it's not good for you. This is a high quality system. It's available at infowars.com and sold out for a long time at 40% off.
[05:53.000 --> 06:00.000]  So get your Brain Force Plus today at infowars.com and help keep us on air. Thank you so much and I'll see you out there.
[06:24.000 --> 06:33.000]  The epicenter of human awakening and human resistance as millions of people take to the streets to cheer on a convoy.
[06:33.000 --> 06:42.000]  Estimated between 700,000 and a million truckers now beginning to enter the capital of the once great nation of Canada.
[06:42.000 --> 06:55.000]  Now under Davos Group Command, now under Bilderberg Group Command, Klaus Schwab brags on TV that he has penetrated Canada and now has the cabinet under his control.
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  These aren't James Bond villains in a movie. These are James Bond villains for real.
[07:02.000 --> 07:12.000]  And they're normalizing their corporate world government dictatorship, but China's turning against the New World Order. Doesn't mean China's good.
[07:12.000 --> 07:21.000]  Russia's turning against the New World Order. The American people have turned against it. We don't want the corporate world government. We say no.
[07:21.000 --> 07:34.000]  Now I'm going to come in here tomorrow and I'm going to do a live show. We usually do tape to air on Saturday where I'll tape an hour, two, three, four hours in the early morning or afternoon and then we'll air it in the afternoon or evening.
[07:34.000 --> 07:58.000]  I'm going to come in tomorrow and we're going to live at 2pm central, 2pm central for at least two hours commercial free to take calls and to play clips of people in Ottawa and in this historic event and also chronicle all the other resistance movements that are peacefully standing up and taking action across the world.
[07:58.000 --> 08:14.000]  So 2pm central, 3pm eastern, 1pm mountain, noon Pacific and I want everybody to know that link will be at the front page of infowars.com and this is not a spectator sport.
[08:14.000 --> 08:25.000]  This is a full contact sport in the info war to get off the bench and to share that link and cause a chain reaction tomorrow and tell those that you share it to for them to share it and tell them to share it and them to share it.
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  And will we save the world tomorrow? No, but together every little bit we do will and we're so close.
[08:32.000 --> 08:52.000]  It is a bizarre, very surreal thing to now see the true talking points against the globalist and the great reset coming out of senators and congressmen and governor's mouths and all the big top podcast hosts and the top fox hosts everywhere.
[08:52.000 --> 09:13.000]  We have done it ladies and gentlemen, info wars, that is you the audience of activists and our guest and this whole family have successfully launched a worldwide resistance to the globalist by being aware of them and understanding that submission to their program is death, resistance to their program is life.
[09:13.000 --> 09:38.000]  We still have important work to do into the future, but I must tell you that we should as a minimum see this as a milestone of how far we have come together and that things will be much, much worse if you hadn't been there doggedly over the years praying for this broadcast and spreading the articles and videos and praying for us.
[09:38.000 --> 09:53.000]  So I want to sink in and I want you to get chills. You are the tip of the spirit. You are the sword of truth. You are the resistance to this evil and God loves you and sees you and appreciates you.
[09:53.000 --> 10:19.000]  So as we feel the enemies will thrown against us and as we experience all the spiritual death and pain they're creating, that's their weapon, because we care, we have souls, we feel it. And as they throw all this at us, know that God will take that evil energy and will translate it and will transform it and will use it for good and that that is God's great mysteries.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  And that is how the Lord works mysterious ways. So you're not going to defeat the new world order by yourself. You're going to do it through God in you.
[10:27.000 --> 10:46.000]  And when I say that to you, I say that to myself because knowing all this is extremely painful and I know why a lot of people just go into denial and just go into distractions and diversions because it is very hard to really face up to the fact that there's this much evil on the planet.
[10:46.000 --> 10:58.000]  Now, let me issue an emergency warning right now. Obviously, we walked into a trap on January 6. We had been to so many big Trump rallies around the country with almost no violence.
[10:58.000 --> 11:09.000]  Always, if there was violence, it was the other side. Literally, you could count on one hand the times Trump supporters did something wrong or were the people starting a fight.
[11:09.000 --> 11:18.000]  We had rallies with hundreds of thousands, half a million people weeks before January 6. And I just figured, well, the police won't stand down. The Secret Service won't stand down.
[11:18.000 --> 11:25.000]  Surely they've refused Trump winning National Guard. He should have overridden that. But I was like, this is going to be OK.
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  But I had such a bad feeling that morning while I was sitting there listening to all these boring Republican speeches and then Trump got up there and it was an OK speech.
[11:33.000 --> 11:42.000]  That I had a horrible foreboding feeling and I thought, quit being paranoid. Maybe you're just coming down with something. Because I felt sick.
[11:42.000 --> 12:00.000]  And, of course, I was picking up what was about to happen that we were being led into a trap and that this was extremely dangerous and that it could have triggered a bigger, true riot, true violent confrontation that could have actually triggered a civil war and potentially millions of dead out of that.
[12:00.000 --> 12:14.000]  But thank God that the globalist provocateur operatives were not able to really get the riot going the way they wanted and that their minions and useful idiots were unable to actually capture any of the members of Congress.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  Because if that would have happened, they would have brought in a civil emergency and martial law in the back of it and that was the deep state's plan.
[12:21.000 --> 12:37.000]  They're planning that again and I interviewed right before we went live for 40 minutes, commercial free, General Flynn. Extremely powerful interview on Russia and Ukraine and Hunter Biden and Marisma and China and nuclear war.
[12:37.000 --> 12:51.000]  And then he got into false flags and said that he is extremely concerned that the deep state is preparing with all their preparation and rain washing a major false flag to declare a civil emergency and martial law.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  Because that's the end game of this takeover. And they've been telegraphing that and they've been saying that.
[12:57.000 --> 13:14.000]  So that interview is going to air in full today. It'll fit in the fourth hour. And right around that same time, we will post the full interview to band.video so that you can share it.
[13:14.000 --> 13:31.000]  But General Flynn issues an emergency false flag warning of a new January 6. And obviously that now leads us to the beautiful capital of Canada, Ottawa, where I went and covered the Bilderberg group in 2006.
[13:31.000 --> 13:40.000]  And I got detained there and arrested for a day and then they had to release me. This is a big protest because back then even mainstream media said you shouldn't arrest a journalist coming to cover something.
[13:40.000 --> 13:57.000]  And the first trucks of upwards of a million with aftereaux on the side are arriving at the beautiful neo-gothic parliament building that is an extremely beautiful building, by the way, one of the most beautiful I've seen.
[13:57.000 --> 14:07.000]  But it's something that ran out of Harry Potter. It's got gargoyles and daemons all over it. But it's still beautiful stonework. It's got unicorns carved in it, lions, rampant and everything.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  And I've been inside the building. It's amazing.
[14:11.000 --> 14:20.000]  My point is, is that the globalists are going to try to provocateur to try to make Trudeau look good. They're going to try to make this look violent.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  And you know they're going to try to provocateur a group to actually try to go in and occupy the parliament.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  Now the left does that all the time and burns down cities and the media says it's a good thing.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  They've even just dropped charges against somebody that, you know, Firebomb the Portland building.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  They just said, well, he's an activist, so he's allowed to do that.
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  The last thing we want is anybody to be violent.
[14:46.000 --> 15:00.000]  And learning from January 6, the Canadians that I've heard call in to the other shows, that's why we're going to do a special show tomorrow from at least two to four p.m. commercial free taking your calls from Canada,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  from the event, from the trucks arriving, from the citizens arriving.
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.000]  And everybody that lives in Canada, you need to go there and peacefully document and take photos and shoot videos and do interviews and put it all out on every platform you can
[15:15.000 --> 15:24.000]  and explain that Trudeau is a globalist, that Trudeau admits he wants a dictatorship, that Trudeau admits he works for Klaus Schwab and Klaus Schwab brags about it
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  and that they want to lock our societies down. We're going to bring their system to gridlock.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  Now they intend to just wait everybody out and in a way they actually want the collapse of society.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  So they're probably arguing to themselves, well, this is good, this will just further shut things down.
[15:39.000 --> 15:47.000]  But if it's a learning experience and people talk about the Great Reset and the globalists and how their countries occupied by a foreign multinational corporate takeover,
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  this event will be nothing but a pure victory.
[15:50.000 --> 16:00.000]  So we've got to keep it peaceful and we've got to stop any provocateurs because you know the Ottawa police are going to stand down and let the provocateurs attack.
[16:20.000 --> 16:27.000]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes. They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[16:27.000 --> 16:35.000]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traders know they can shut us down by force.
[16:35.000 --> 16:42.000]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially. So be it. Make them silence us by force.
[16:42.000 --> 16:51.000]  This is the final battle of the Information War. Give now. Buy products. Donate. Before everything changes.
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  We need you to carry us through to the end. Victory or death. Go now to infowarstore.com.
[16:59.000 --> 17:05.000]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are back in stock.
[17:05.000 --> 17:14.000]  Whole food multivitamin, a central nutrient multivitamin from natural healthy sources, not synthetic, and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips.
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  The classic Linus Pauling Nobel Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system in every cell in your body.
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.000]  They're both back in stock sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[17:26.000 --> 17:32.000]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep us on air.
[17:32.000 --> 17:42.000]  So again, it's a 360 win. But whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin and take vitamin C and take zinc.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  We also have some great vitamin D products in infowarstore.com as well.
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  But whatever you do, defend your body's immune system. We want to keep patriots in the game against the new world order.
[17:51.000 --> 17:59.000]  So it's a 360 win. It's something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and your immune system while funding the info war at infowarstore.com.
[17:59.000 --> 18:06.000]  I want to tell you about sale that we've just launched, especially if you have not properly prepped for a disaster.
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.000]  10% off all storeable foods at infowarstore.com is insurance you can eat.
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.000]  The globalists have crept out of the shadows and are now openly trying to destabilize the entire planet.
[18:18.000 --> 18:28.000]  And in my opinion, now is the most crucial time to stock up on storeable food and get ready for the next big crisis because these Democrats have already shown they're not holding anything back.
[18:28.000 --> 18:39.000]  In response to this communist sabotage of humanity, the team over at MyPatriot supply has agreed to allow us to offer our customers 10% off all storeable foods.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  But this deal can't last long. This is only available for a limited time.
[18:43.000 --> 18:51.000]  Your decision now can mean saved time and money later, not to mention insurance you can eat in a crisis.
[18:51.000 --> 18:59.000]  10% off all storeable food right now at infowarstore.com.
[19:22.000 --> 19:28.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[19:28.000 --> 19:37.000]  And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled, tranty.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[19:41.000 --> 19:52.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[19:52.000 --> 20:11.000]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[20:22.000 --> 20:31.000]  How do you train the population? They're all suspects. They're all criminals. They're all bad.
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  They all should be locked up and tracked and traced and controlled.
[20:35.000 --> 20:44.000]  Well, cook up a virus and release it and then set the testing system where people that don't even have it are marked as guilty.
[20:44.000 --> 20:52.000]  And create an enemy that can never be defeated to common cold and roll out your depopulation weapon through a so-called vaccine.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  And now you've got your world ID. Now you've got your pretext to put things in people's bodies.
[20:56.000 --> 21:05.000]  Now you've got another way to divide humanity against each other while the corrupt globalists consolidate all the power and the control.
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  And if you want to illustrate how serious this is, there's a very important article on infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[21:12.000 --> 21:19.000]  Everybody should go look at. This is so Orwellian that when you see the video of it, it just stuns you.
[21:19.000 --> 21:26.000]  Canadian Walmarts install vaccine passport scanner booths to screen customers.
[21:26.000 --> 21:36.000]  So the same thing is happening in Australia, New Zealand at their big stores, their grocery stores, and Canada all a beta test to go everywhere else.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  Now Germany is installing scanners. Oh, no humans needed. You step into a box. It scans you. You're a good little slave.
[21:45.000 --> 21:54.000]  And then it lets you in. And of course, what do the unvaccinated and the triple jab or the quadruple jab all have in common?
[21:54.000 --> 22:00.000]  You're never fully vaccinated. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
[22:00.000 --> 22:09.000]  And then they say it's the American thing to do to censor people and not let medical doctors speak out and warn of all the heart attacks and cancer.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  Oh, and then Pfizer goes with the FDA and says, don't release the documents for 75 years.
[22:14.000 --> 22:23.000]  And the first documents the judge orders released three months ago say thousands killed by the shot and thousands of miscarriages in the first few weeks.
[22:23.000 --> 22:33.000]  And now the judge orders 50,000 pages released. That was just 300. And they say we're not doing it. We can't.
[22:33.000 --> 22:44.000]  We have a secret agreement that President Trump signed and that other governments signed where we don't have to under national security for liability reasons because they did it, folks.
[22:44.000 --> 22:56.000]  They launched a bio synthetic Kim attack. It's really not biological. It's synthetic biology. It's nano tech. So it's bio Kim nano attack.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  And let that sink in, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:00.000 --> 23:12.000]  So humanity needs to not just galvanize against the lockdowns and the mask and being told they're not essential and forcing us into debt for the great reset for the world social credit score and universal basic income to control every aspect of our lives.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  It's about killing us.
[23:15.000 --> 23:23.000]  And so here are the images. Canadian Walmarts install vaccine passport scanner booths to screen customers.
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  Did you ever want to know what the antichrist system would look like?
[23:29.000 --> 23:37.000]  Did you ever want to know what it would be like when the Walmarts become the FEMA camps?
[23:37.000 --> 23:44.000]  And there you go. Amazon Wal-Mart target.
[23:44.000 --> 23:55.000]  They'll be staffed by onsite nurses. And if you're not allowed in, they'll just usher you over it says and inject you free of charge because they care so much about you.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  That's why they created it at Wuhan. And that's why they suppressed all the scientists that pointed out it was manmade.
[24:01.000 --> 24:08.000]  And that's why I told you Peter Dasek was CIA and now that's been declassified. Obama developed the weapon.
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  Scientists protested in 2015. They moved it to Wuhan.
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.000]  And it is the deep state globalist that hate our country that control Obama that launched the attack.
[24:18.000 --> 24:30.000]  And we're looking at the third administration of Obama where he has his puppet in there who will take all the blame while the globalists carry out the total destruction and bankruptcy
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  and bio attack, chem attack on the people.
[24:35.000 --> 24:44.000]  This is a very standard operation throughout history to have globalist carry out operations like this.
[24:44.000 --> 24:51.000]  And they've now done it yet again in a high tech way.
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  They are the most selfish people you could ever imagine in your life.
[24:57.000 --> 25:12.000]  And they believe that they get to have their great lifestyles of huge palatial farms and ranches and seaside resorts and private aircraft and all of it as long as they kill a bunch of us.
[25:12.000 --> 25:23.000]  And we sit here and we take it and we sit here, those of you that work for the system and pretend you're getting ahead by playing along with it.
[25:23.000 --> 25:29.000]  Just to be clear, Biden announced that 1.2 million unvaxxed illegal aliens crossed the border.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  He legalized them outside of law.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  The numbers eight times that accord the border patrol because they turn back.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  They say turnbacks are 80% when they're not even 5%.
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.000]  That number is much higher, but won't allow unvaxxed truckers to cross the border.
[25:45.000 --> 25:55.000]  That's because you're a productive good little slave that does what you're told and you've got to be tracked and traced, you've got to get used to them putting in your body what they want, when they want.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  And Trudeau is hiding under the table.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  Mr. I want to be a dictator.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  Mr. I've been trained by Klaus Schwab to bring in the great reset and collapse Canada.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  Trudeau isolating at home in bid to dodge massive Canadian trucker caravan.
[26:08.000 --> 26:19.000]  He smeared his fringe minority, who he said have unacceptable views that will quote, not be tolerated.
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  I will not tolerate your views of me and what I'm doing to you.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  And Klaus Schwab goes on.
[26:27.000 --> 26:39.000]  He says the greatest example of our control is Trudeau. We've penetrated and control his cabinet. We control the other cabinets.
[26:39.000 --> 26:45.000]  They are believers in what we are doing.
[26:45.000 --> 26:52.000]  Absolutely creepy evil cult.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  What did General Flynn say? We've got a short clip of it coming up next segment and the full interview will air in the fourth hour.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  What did General Flynn warn of?
[27:00.000 --> 27:08.000]  The next stage is false flags, not just here but around the world to blame the anti-lockdown, to blame the anti-vaxxers.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  That's the next move.
[27:10.000 --> 27:20.000]  And they're telling you the anti-vaxxers who are just anti-Nuremberg violation, anti-GMO forced injection are going to stage terror attacks.
[27:20.000 --> 27:27.000]  They're claiming we are going to stage terror attacks against them when obviously they're going to do it to themselves.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  So they can be the victims. That's the only card they've got left other than war and cyber attack.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  And they're telling you, oh, the Russians are getting ready to take the U.S. power grid down.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  Sure. Did the Russians turn off the Keystone pipeline? No.
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.000]  Did the Russians implode the U.S. border? No.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  Did the Russians have drag queen pedophile story time? No. Did the Russians devalue the dollar? No.
[27:50.000 --> 27:58.000]  Did the Russians invent fentanyl at MIT? Give it to China and allow it to be shipped in? No.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  Did the Russians do any of that? No. I mean, I wish it was the Russians because then we could do something about them.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  That's a clear and outside group.
[28:07.000 --> 28:15.000]  But no, it's people posing as if they're Americans and as if they're our leaders. But they've all gone to the alumni of Klaus Schwab.
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.000]  They went to the Bilderberg Group's Young Leaders Seminar and they got vetted.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  And they got prepared and they got put in it now all over the news.
[28:26.000 --> 28:34.000]  Oh, the power grid. It's imminent. American right-wingers are preparing with Putin to turn the power off.
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  And while Schwab's like, soon the power will be turned off and you will die, it will be so good for Earth.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  We also need climate lockdowns and rolling blackouts.
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.000]  But the Putin will turn your power off. It is Putin. He will do it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  Unbelievable times to be alive, folks. Have you shared the live link at infowars.com for our show?
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  Have you shared the link from Bandai Video? Because if you haven't...
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  Reset Wars is a great tool.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  Amazing and eye-opening.
[29:07.000 --> 29:15.000]  It really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily go across political lines or religious lines,
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  but about all of us as a human species coming together.
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  I'm a combat veteran and, I mean, that brought me close to God.
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  But what Alex goes through brought me even closer.
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  I can feel God in my life now. The viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously programmed into your brain
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  and how to erase those programs and install new...
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  Reset Wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular info wars broadcasts.
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious and self-determined life.
[29:47.000 --> 29:57.000]  If you're on the fence about Reset Wars, it's time to get off the fence. Join Reset Wars today.
[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  And all the other garbage that's taking place, like supply chain right now,
[30:22.000 --> 30:28.000]  you need to get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[30:28.000 --> 30:37.000]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their storable food at 25% off.
[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  Four years. But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[30:43.000 --> 30:48.000]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off

[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  It's hard to believe January 2022 is almost over.
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.000]  And that means our big New Year's special is about to end.
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.000]  The highest quality, whole food-based multivitamin.
[31:13.000 --> 31:18.000]  And our best-selling vitamin C with zinc and rose hips formula
[31:18.000 --> 31:27.000]  that absolutely turbocharges your immune system are both on sale for just a few more days for 40% off at infowarstore.com.

[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  It's all available at infowarstore.com right now.
[32:00.000 --> 32:03.000]  Human-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[32:03.000 --> 32:08.000]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.000]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house
[32:12.000 --> 32:18.000]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process
[32:22.000 --> 32:27.000]  where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[32:27.000 --> 32:32.000]  Nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[32:32.000 --> 32:39.000]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[33:00.000 --> 33:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:15.000 --> 33:20.000]  When I grow up, I want to be around you guys.
[33:20.000 --> 33:27.000]  When I grow up, I want to take you mad at the next level. I want our children to grow up in freedom together.
[33:27.000 --> 33:33.000]  The love of God and the love of discovery and creation. We will have our victory.
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  My job is to become obsolete where everybody knows about the New World Order and the Bilderberg Group
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  and the Great Reset and the Transhumanist Cult.
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.000]  And we've gone from maybe one half of 1% knowing who they were 28 years ago when I first got on air
[34:05.000 --> 34:12.000]  to now about 20% of the public knows and a large portion of government knows.
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.000]  Not just the side of government and corporate governance that's working with the globalist,
[34:18.000 --> 34:25.000]  but now the other side waking up to what's going on and knowing how to strike at the root and how to resist it.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  By showing it's illegitimate, it acts as a private corporate intelligence agency.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  It uses blackmail and control. Once you know its tools and once you know its goal as a collapse of civilization,
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  you understand that you can't work with it. You can't make deals with it.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  You can't sell out for a while and get rich with it because your children will be destroyed.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  And you're not going to have to wait long now because it's here.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  A lot of folks will still sell out and say, well, we'll just double cross them later.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  Now you know that's not the case.
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.000]  All right, here is a little excerpt of some of what General Flynn talked about this morning
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  when I taped an interview with him right before we went live at 11 a.m. Central.
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  And we are going to, again, have this interview posted to BandodVideo and MFullWars.com
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  in full by the fourth hour and we will premiere it here in the fourth hour as well today.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  But it's absolutely the most important interview yet with General Flynn,
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  the former head of defense intelligence, former national security advisor to President Trump,
[35:33.000 --> 35:38.000]  and a former would-be political president if they had their way.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  They are so scared of Flynn because he understands where the bodies are buried.
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  Here is a little bit of a prelude of what's coming up.
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  The worst-case scenario in this case, as I started to look at this buildup
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.000]  and this what I call road to war, is this movement where you start to talk about nuclear weapons
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  and people that are talking about World War III.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  I mean, this is not going to be some, you know, movie, right?
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  This is real.
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  And in a World War III scenario, which people in Washington, D.C.,
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  people in the legislative branch, some of these senators, some of these members of Congress,
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  some of these people in the National Security Council, some of these think tankers,
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  they are all, like, beating the drums, like, we should be ready to go, we should go.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  No, no, take a deep breath, everybody.
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  I think that we are going to see, and I expect something, again, another distraction.
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.000]  You know, some, I really do, I expect, because of what was staged on January 6th
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  and what was staged up in Michigan to kidnap, you know, the fake kidnapping of the governor,
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  up in Michigan, Whitmer, I think we're going to see staged events.
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.000]  I really do, I mean, I really do think that do not put past this administration
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.000]  but their, you know, their dugs, in some cases, that they have access to,
[37:08.000 --> 37:15.000]  do not put it past them to stage something and then declare some type of national emergency
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  in order to further shut down aspects of our freedoms.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  I mean, I believe that.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  So, you know, and I tell that to people and I'm telling it to you and I'm telling it to your audience.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  You know, in 30 seconds, it has to do with this beautiful country
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  that my father, who was a World War II and Korea War veteran
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  and my mother, who decided to have nine children, thank God,
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.000]  they handed my family, my generation, our generation, Alex, a beautiful country
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  on a silver platter and said, you know, go forth and do good, be good to others
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  and work hard and you'll have a good life.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  And we, our generation has screwed this up.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  And so when I look at my children and my grandchildren, especially, that's my long game.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  So pay attention, people.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  Discover, learn, read, do whatever you got to do and, you know, and follow this great show
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  because Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  Very powerful interview.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  And when an information war, you want to win it, you share it.
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  You don't want to win it.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  Then roll over and die, folks, because they're coming for everybody.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  They're coming for everybody.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  I got a USA Today article here that I'll get too late when Roger Stone joins us,
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  but just, just wait till you see that.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  Roger Stone, bottom of the next hour.
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  Then a big prominent lawyer who's winning a lot of lawsuits against these workplace vaccines
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  is going to be popping in in the third hour and a lot of other news.
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  And then, of course, we are going to have the big Flynn interview in full.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  It'll just perfectly fit in that one hour, so that's coming up.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  Okay.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  Something I need to announce to the listeners that's extremely serious,
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.000]  not just for me, but for all of you, needs to get said here, okay?
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  Nietzsche said, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  And it's true.
[39:07.000 --> 39:13.000]  We've been boycotted and censored and attacked and lied about for 20 years of my 28 years on air.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  And so it forced us to get our own warehouse and our own shipping department and our own products
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  and our own everything because our sponsors would get great responses,
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  but then they would call up and threaten to kill their families.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  And they'd say, sorry, people just threatened to kill our family.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  They came to our house.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  We can't be a sponsor.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  And that was happening 10 years ago.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  So we had to go out, start our own things, sell our own stuff.
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.000]  And I was in a hole, I don't know, two, three years ago of three plus million dollars.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  And we got a lot of products in the listeners bottom.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  We got out of the hole.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  And then starting about a year and a half ago, the supply chain broke down.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  We're used to, you can get t-shirts in two, three weeks.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  Now it takes five, six weeks.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  We can get supplements in six weeks, high quality.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  Now that it's 10, 12, 14, 20, now it's 25 weeks.
[39:59.000 --> 40:07.000]  And so we can't spend money out 25 weeks and then have an order coming in at 10 that we put in 20 weeks ago
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  and then have to put in the next order and pay for half of it.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  We don't have the money for that.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  That's the shortfall of the supply chain 25 weeks out.
[40:15.000 --> 40:22.000]  And I talked to people in business and energy and oil fields and gas and power plants.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  The copper wire isn't coming in.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  The repair systems aren't coming in.
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  They're going into cannibalizing all the old wells around the country to go fix the ones that are still operating.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  They can barely get enough power out of the ground right now to supply the U.S.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  This has all been done by design.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  So I get chills when I tell you this is a father and is an American.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  We are screwed.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  Now the big globalist corporations, they've got their Chinese supply chain and others with all their chain of garbage.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  I can get tainted stuff from China in 10 weeks.
[40:52.000 --> 40:59.000]  You can't get clean, badass stuff from other parts of the world like South America and Canada and the U.S. and things
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  that are all triple certified in 25 weeks.
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.000]  A lot of these companies are just closing their doors or they're getting bought up and just shut down by the globalists who have unlimited money.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  It's like Neil Young's catalog got bought by the Blackstone Group.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  They're buying everything.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  A lot of it just to shut stuff down and exercise control.
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  And so whatever quality products we can get, we're going to have what we can't get, we're not going to have.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  So a lot of best sellers have been discontinued.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  A lot of other stuff has been sold out for 6, 8, 10 weeks.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  If we had the product, you love it, you buy it, we'd have money.
[41:32.000 --> 41:41.000]  Right now we have a multi-million dollar deficit because again we have to sell $30 million worth of food to make $5 million or whatever.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  To fund the operation.
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  It's the same thing.
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  It's not like all money we keep.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  We keep a tiny part of it to fund the operation.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  And hey, Band-Aught Video is incredibly successful.
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  Millions and millions and millions of views a day, but that's everybody else's videos.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  We're hosting them.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  That's a huge burden, millions of dollars a year to pay for the bandwidth on that.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  So we need your financial support plus we've got products you need.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  I would go to infowarstore.com.
[42:04.000 --> 42:17.000]  Whatever we've got in stock, like the fluoride free whitening toothpaste that's so great or the activated charcoal toothpaste or the multi-vitamin minerals we've got, they're all top of the line high quality.
[42:17.000 --> 42:25.000]  So much of the stuff is sold out and we're talking 25 weeks till some of this stuff comes in and I'm looking at the money and not even having the money out that far to do it.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  I don't know what I'm going to do, but anything we're selling we've got in stock.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  Now there's a silver lining.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  My Patriot Supply saw this and their literal Christian mission is to feed people.
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  So they went crazy the last year and bought up every bit of food they could.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  So everybody else that sells horrible food is either sold out or overpriced.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  They actually have extra food right now and they're Christians.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  So instead of 10% off, no, no, no, no, no, no, not 10% off.
[42:49.000 --> 42:55.000]  Instead of 10% off, ladies and gentlemen, it's 25% off.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  25% off.
[42:57.000 --> 43:20.000]  It was 10% off.
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  Basically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  The traders know they can shut us down by force.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  So be it.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  Make them silence us by force.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.000]  Give now.
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  Buy products.
[43:48.000 --> 43:49.000]  Donate.
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  Before everything changes.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  Go now to infowarstore.com.
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  Keep us on air.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  We'll continue to bring you the band guests.
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.000]  Keep us on air.
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  The new supplements that we have, the latest in the Info Wars live supplement line.
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  The vitamin D3 with calcium gummies.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  The vitamin C with zinc and the whole food multivitamins.
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  Or if you buy the combo pack with all three at infowarstore.com.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  And you know, I'm telling you, the vitamin D gummies, this is a great thing for your kids.
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.000]  They're going to love it.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  It's healthy.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  The calcium good for them, the vitamin D.
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  So that's at infowarstore.com.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  Supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies,
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  the emergency supplies at infowarstore.com.
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  We cannot thank you enough.
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  I was overweight.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  I was barely holding onto a job.
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[45:15.000 --> 45:16.000]  And it worked pretty good.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  And shortly thereafter, you came out with that shield.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know,
[45:20.000 --> 45:21.000]  and I got really excited about that.
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.000]  So I took it.
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.000]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  You know, I could think again.
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  I could connect with people again.
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  It's amazing.
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.000]  It works.
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.000]  Beautifully said, brother.
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world,
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.000]  with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage cyber attack,
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  with the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here,
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  but in Europe and war with Russia, with the massive inflation
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  You need to get prepared now with high quality,
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  storable food that is ready to ship.
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalix.com
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  has offered their storeable food at 25% off for years.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  But right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this
[46:45.000 --> 46:52.000]  to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  Act now, get prepared now.
[46:54.000 --> 47:16.000]  This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[47:24.000 --> 47:53.000]  This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  The RPAC Live broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  I want to salute all of the amazing truckers
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  and the millions of people descending on the capital of Canada.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  The globalists want you bankrupt, they want you totally under their control
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  so they can put a biomedical tyranny over you
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  like your children wear carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide creating face diapers.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  And we will say no to the cult, we will resist it, we will say no.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  You know, why do they put biological males in women's sports
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  and now let them dominate every level of it?
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  Because if you'll accept something that ass backwards
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  and that is that big a fraud, you'll accept anything.
[48:46.000 --> 48:55.000]  Now Disney announced that Snow White and other female characters will not wear dresses.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  They want to take the power of women and their culture
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  and what they like and what they gravitate to
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  and what they enjoy and celebrating their beauty.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Like a woman is a flower.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  Why is a flower beautiful?
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  To attract bees for procreation.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  It's the same thing.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  Every species of bird, colorful and other species, not.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  This is who we are.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  This is what we do organically.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  And they are saying no, you can't do that
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  because we're hitting you with so many chemicals and so much garbage
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  that women will be like men and men will be like women.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  And that's what they've done because it's an enemy of the people.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's social engineering, it's depopulation, it's sick.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  And everything they push is pure death.
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.000]  Trans child molester, 26 who sexually assaulted a girl,
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  10 is sentenced to just two years in juvenile facility.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  Now this has never been done before,
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  but it's just like men with penises are put in California jails
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  in prisons to rape women and then they'll have in the headlines.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  Two women have had a baby.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  Again, assaulting your mind with fraud.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  And in this case, they said, well, no one's ever convicted an adult
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  and put him in a juvenile.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  But you see, if you identify as a child,
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  that's how they want to get pedophilia legalized.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  Oh, you identify as a cat.
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  You identify as a dog. You identify as a child.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  But they're blurring the lines here saying,
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  well, he did this when he was 17.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.000]  So now he'll pay in a juvenile facility.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  They're just getting you used to all sorts of...
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  Oh, yeah, let's put a child molester in with adolescents.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  Let's put a child molester in with 12-year-olds.
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  That's as young as will be in the facility this man is in.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  A transgender woman, you mean a man,
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  now 26 has been ordered to serve just two years
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  in juvenile detention center for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl
[51:01.000 --> 51:08.000]  after L.A., D.A., George Gaskin refused to prosecute her as an adult.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  Hannah Tubbs, formerly known as James, now 26,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  pled guilty in 2020 to sexually assaulting the young girl
[51:15.000 --> 51:21.000]  in a Denny's bathroom in 2014 when he was 17.
[51:21.000 --> 51:26.000]  Prosecutors had pushed for it to stay in the Los Angeles jail
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  and be tried as an adult,
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  but the D.A. declined to file a motion to move the case
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  out of juvenile court where it was filed.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  And so now he'll put the creature in the child rapist with children.
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  They're predators, folks.
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  The whole thing is about training you,
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  and now they've got all this anti-white garbage going on,
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  so it's not 10 to 1 black-on-white crime.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  In many areas of Blue City, it's 20 to 1.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  20 to 1 black-on-white crime.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  Look at this lovely lady here,
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  the now convicted rapist of a 10-year-old girl in Denny's.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  Imagine that dude rapes your 10-year-old daughter,
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  sticks his filthy proboscis center,
[52:08.000 --> 52:14.000]  and instead of being given the death penalty,
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  he gets to spend two years with a bunch of children locked up.
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.000]  This is a pervert pedophile revolution.
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  It's the transhumanist revolution.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  And it continues on.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  Federal judge cites climate crisis
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  in decision to cancel oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  Oh, China's drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  Mexico's drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  Brazil and Chile and the Russians and everybody else.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  But we can't.
[52:44.000 --> 52:49.000]  We can't drill in our own Gulf of Mexico because of climate change.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  That's right.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  Total made-up garbage.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  It's the siege against America.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  A federal judge yesterday
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.000]  invalidated a massive oil and gas lease sale for 80 miles,
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  for 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  after a coalition of environmental groups,
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  you mean Saudi-funded, BP-funded,
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  sued the Biden administration to stop it.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  The ruling cancels 1.7 million acres of oil and gas leases
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  from the sale according to data
[53:15.000 --> 53:21.000]  from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  And what was Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates obsessed with?
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  Using the UN to get control of the ocean
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  to then transfer it to multinational corporations.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  Oh, this is all going to get drilled.
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  Just not by us.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  Oh, oh, all that shale oil is going to come out of Canada.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  It's going to get loaded on trains
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  and shipped to the Pacific coast and shipped to China.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  We're just not going to get it in that big pipeline
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  we built over 10 years that came down to Houston.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  It's just a three-point. Economic total warfare.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  But, oh, there's this article
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  out of local TV in District of Columbia.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  Take only what you need.
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  DC asked people to limit supermarket purchases
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  as empty shelves persist.
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  As empty shelves persist.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  And they say, oh, it's hoarding that's causing the problem.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  No, it's supply, chain, breakdowns, and inflation.
[54:25.000 --> 54:30.000]  It's economic, globalist warfare against us.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  The power to tax is the power to destroy,
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  as the famous Supreme Court Justice said.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  And here it is,
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  San Jose to disproportionately punish low-income gun owners
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  with liability insurance requirement.
[54:43.000 --> 54:50.000]  Roger Stone joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  He's really upset with Trump.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  He's going to be as diplomatic as he can,
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  but it really is scary.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  Roger privately started telling me six months ago
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  he was very concerned.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  He went public two weeks ago on air.
[55:01.000 --> 55:07.000]  And Trump is now disproportionately endorsing rhinos,
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  neocons, and people that hate his guts,
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.000]  over-bonified patriots and populist and nationalist
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  and good people, and people that got Trump elected
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  and people that Trump claims he supports.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  So that's coming up bottom of the hour.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  I've got a bunch of economic news and a bunch of world news
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  and military news and Biden news.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  That's coming up, ladies and gentlemen, next hour.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  Also, ex-Clinton advisor, Biden should pardon
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  nonviolent January 6th defendants
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  fulfill unity promise. Absolutely.
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  I mean, if they wanted unity, they would do that,
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  because they released people that burned down courthouses
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  and said they did nothing wrong,
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  but people that peacefully walked in
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  have already spent a year in jail
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  and are being given six-month sentences.
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  So that's all coming up.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, two quick announcements.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  DVDs are more important than ever
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  because it allows you to have a digital hard copy
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  that you can make digital copies of and underground share.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  I am so excited that we produced
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  Cobra Land Part 1 and Part 2.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  And Part 2 is even more powerful than Part 1.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  It deals with the mask and how it's a fraud
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  and how it's a scam with all the scientific evidence,
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  and it's so well done.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  It is 1995 at infowarstore.com.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  That way you support the filmmakers
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  and info wars when you get it, and then you get absolutely free.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  Two other films on one DVD that are historic.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death.
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  So three films for the price of one at infowarstore.com.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  And again, the 13th is the same date like the storeable foods.
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  25% off until the 13th of February.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  That's when we got it in that deal.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  That's when we happened to be ending this
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  because we estimate we'll be sold out
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  of this second run of printing this DVD.
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  We also have Part 1 of Cobra Land.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  If you haven't gotten it as well,
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  you get a free copy of In Game with that.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  But we're running low on Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Order of Death.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  And so either until the 13th or while supplies last,
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  you get that film, Cobra Land, The Mask Part 2,
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  at infowarstore.com, and you will get the two films free.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  And then you can have it in your library
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  and make copies of it and burn other copies.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  And DVD sales are exploding again
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  because people are sick of having it on the cloud
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  or it digitally disappearing.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  You want to have this in your hands
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  as a key piece of information warfare
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  and the truth going into this horrible future we're facing.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  We hope to back it off now, but if we don't
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  in the future, this will be underground material
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  punishable by FEMA camp and probably death.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  I'm not joking.
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  The left says they're going to kill
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  50 million Americans in death camps officially.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  with our number two, infowarstore.com.
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  Need your support.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  Reset Wars is the game.
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  Reset Wars is a great tool.
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  Amazing and eye-opening.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  It really dives deeper into yourself
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  and into the bigger picture
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  that doesn't necessarily go across political lines
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  or religious lines, but about all of us
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  as a human species coming together.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  I'm a combat veteran, and I mean,
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  that brought me close to God,
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.000]  but what Alex goes through brought me even closer.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  I can feel God in my life now.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  The viruses that Alex talks to you about
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  that are subconsciously programmed into your brain
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  and how to erase those programs and install new...
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  Reset Wars is a step beyond
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  what you already get in regular info wars broadcasts.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  and help you live a more conscious and self-determined life.
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  If you're on the fence about Reset Wars,
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  it's time to get off the fence.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  Join Reset Wars today.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  Welcome.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  Hello, Alex.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  Welcome.
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[59:04.000 --> 59:07.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  that have never been heated up,
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  It's a very fine wine.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  People are like, why are you selling something
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  That's just how it is.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  It's how it works.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  So it's always good.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[59:43.000 --> 59:55.000]  you should get it.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  All right, we've got several powerful reports
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  that have been filed by John Bowne,
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  one of them's title,
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Cancel Silicon Valley Before It Cancels Us.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  You want to fight the global?
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Let's get that link and share it.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Another one that we're going to play later in the broadcast,
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Biden administration launches proxy war in Ukraine,
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  and that's what I'm going to be covering next segment.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  It's the best of times, it's the worst of times,
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  like they say in a tale of two cities.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  There's a huge awakening happening, huge resistance.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  It's beautiful, it's wonderful,
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  but we've got to be honest with ourselves.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  The globalists have a bunch of tricks up their sleeves.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Cyber attacks, wars, collapse, they swore false flags.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  We'll be covering that all coming up next segment.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Here is the latest report.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  This, believe it or not, is the face of a tyrannical psychopath,
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  stalking First Amendment protected Americans
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  on the social media platform Twitter,
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  a platform that is way overdue
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  from having its section 230 protection stripped.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  Protections that have been blurred
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  as new Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  acts as a dictatorial publisher
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  editing the content of free speech
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  to strengthen the left's demonic globalist narrative
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  with the blatant outcome
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  of rendering the U.S. Constitution meaningless
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  while vaccination deaths and injuries
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  continue to pile up outside of the view of the general public.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment,
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  where our role is particularly emphasized
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  as who can be heard.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  The scarce commodity today is attention.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  There's a lot of content out there, a lot of tweets out there.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Not all of it gets attention.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Some subset of it gets attention.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  And so increasingly, our role is moving towards
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  how we recommend content.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  After taking brains from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey...
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  People need to have their battle rifles and everything ready.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  They're bed sides.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  And you got to be ready.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Send a chill up my spine. How about yours?
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  It did. I mean, there's a number of actions
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  that we believe help a call to incitement of violence.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  And those are the things that we need to make sure
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  that we are taking action on.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  Agrawal has been shutting down accounts
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  at a rate that would make the Communist Chinese jealous,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  targeting politicians, journalists and virologists
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  to keep the anti-American propaganda sputtering along.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Beverly, there's more.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Parig Agrawal on this tweet comparing all white people to racist quote
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  if they are not going to make a distinction
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  between Muslims and extremists,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  then why should I distinguish between white people
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  and racist allegedly from a joke that he was parroting.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  But regardless, was it that tough for Twitter to find somebody
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  who didn't make comments like this to be its next CEO?
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  The hatchet recently swung down on representative Marjorie Taylor Greene
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  for allegedly violating its COVID-19 misinformation policy
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  after posting information directly from the CDC's website,
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  permanently banning Dr. Robert Malone,
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  the inventor of mRNA technology.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  What the heck happened in Germany in the 20s and 30s?
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Very intelligent, highly educated population,
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  and they went barking mad.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  And how did that happen?
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  The answer is mass formation psychosis.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  and has free-floating anxiety,
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  and then their attention gets focused by a leader
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  or a series of events on one small point, just like hypnosis,
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  they literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Dr. Malone, there are members of Congress
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  who believe that what the social media companies
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  are doing to censor people like you,
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  it's good, but it's not enough. Watch.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  It's no secret that our social media companies
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  have been part of their algorithms promoting disinformation.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And I think that these steps are important,
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  but frankly, a little too little and a little too late.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Suspending just the news founder John Solomon
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  for tweeting an article on the FDA's statement
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  that the fully approved commodity vaccine is legally distinct
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  from the emergency approved Pfizer product,
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  which is more widely available in the United States.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Congress has allowed this cancer to metastasize
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  as politicians nationwide gorge on COVID relief money.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Compliant doctors and nurses bathe in vaccine incentives
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  and insurance money, and the Senate and House
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  continue to be the kept minions of Silicon Valley donations.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Nothing will change unless we the people
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  cancel Silicon Valley before it cancels us.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill,
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  and it is the fastest growing market
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  in supplements in the world for good reason.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there,
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  some healthy, some not, that do incredible things in our brains.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  And we've tried them all, we've researched them all,
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  and we will not sell you anything that is linked
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  to any problems or any type of toxicity
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  or any type of extreme hangovers.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  Because I'm not saying some of our brain products,
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  you won't have a little bit of a let down once you take them,
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  but that would just be a lie.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  But these are very, very clean with compounds
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  that God gave us that are good for you.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  And one of our best sellers is Back in Stock Brain Force Plus,

[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  but it's not good for you.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  This is a high quality system.

[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  now into hour number two on this live,
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  verboten, forbidden edition of the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Friday, January 28, 2022, we are in the thick
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  of what the globalists call World War IV,
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  the economic, corporate, spiritual, biological attack
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  on humanity of depopulation by the forces
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  of the transhumanist criminal combine,
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  the global directive.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  You know, it's incredible.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  You know, I meant to play this last week,
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  and I didn't do it.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Well, you guys queue up the new trailer for THX1138
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  that came out in 1971.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  George Lucas' masterpiece with Robert DeVall,
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  because I'd forgotten that it was in that movie,
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  and then I rewatched clips of it online
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  to show how dialed in George Lucas was
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  where they're describing this as the global government
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  of the bio-collective directive.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  We have decided, and it's all a technocracy,
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  because that's what they were actually planning back then.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  So when you see Dr. Strangelove in 1964
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  where they've got plans for underground bases
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  and turning us into basically suboid slaves,
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  this was being proposed by the Rand Corporation.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  And in the movie, Dr. Strangelove's like,
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  I happen to have a development plan right here
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  for just such a scenario.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  By the Bland Corporation, yes.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  Not Rand, Bland.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  So when you see THX1138 and you see Dr. Strangelove,
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  they're making jokes about fluoride in the water,
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  this ain't a frickin' joke.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  It's an underground global government,
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  literally and figuratively,
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  that is a breakaway civilization.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  We'll play the trailer next segment.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And then Rob Dew was pointing out during the break,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  and I said, wow, that's pretty amazing.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Let's get those clips together,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  how they're showing a camera shot
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  in Ottawa of the Capitol building,
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  because on the backside it's like a giant park,
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  an area where cars can't park.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  So he was showing me that they're showing a camera shot
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  from the parliament, no cars, no trucks,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  saying, look, no one's here,
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  because they're all in the city on the other side,
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  and upwards of a million are now arriving.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  So again, just, I mean, they had over 2 million people
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  for the March for Life, no coverage.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  They had at least 300,000 for the anti-vax
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  tyranny operation.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  All of that.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  So they're saying, here's a live cam shot,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  here's what's going on at the parliament,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  and then they show you the back of it
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  so you can't see what's going on.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  That's how the deception operates.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Oh look, no one's there, ha ha,
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Trudeau's staying in his house,
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  coming out for five days, he has COVID.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  That's coming up next segment as well,
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  but let's get to the really big news,
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  and then I did a very important interview with General Flynn
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  on the danger of nuclear war,
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  and how serious this is,
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  and how he believes they're getting ready to stage a false flag
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  as a crackdown on the American people
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  and basically declare a civil emergency,
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  which is admitted.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  So that's all coming up in the fourth hour today.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  But let's just look at some of these headlines.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  There's an NPR, this just came out a few minutes ago,
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  and I don't just believe NPR, we went and checked this, it's true.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  China's ambassador to the US warns of military conflict over Taiwan.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  The globalists have put Biden in to be weak,
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  they put Biden in to be compromised by the Chinese and the Russians
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  so that it encourages them to start a war
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  because Biden didn't really run on the show.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  The globalists won a war with Russia and China,
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  they're luring them in just as Joe Scowles predicted 15 years ago,
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  that by the year 2022, 2023, 2024, they would lure us into this war.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  China's ambassador to the US warns of military conflict.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  Veteran Chinese diplomat, Quinn Gang, China's ambassador to the US
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  speaks with NPR Steve Inske at Quinn's official residence in Washington, D.C.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  They interviewed him yesterday, they aired the interview today.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  And in this one-on-one interview, since assuming his post in Washington,
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  last July, Quinn Gang accused Taiwan of walking down the road towards independence
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  and added, if the Taiwan authorities in both the United States keep going down the road for independence,
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  it will most likely involve China, United States in two big countries in a military conflict.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  You can hear the whole interview.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Let's grab that and hear that later next hour, that's pretty big.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  Then you've got this, Biden warns Ukraine President Zelensky,
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  prepare for impact Russian invasion virtually certain.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Fueling tensions, CNN claims Biden told Zelensky Russian invasion imminent,
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  White House denies it.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  I mean, this is just a leaking disinformation operation,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  and basically Biden is just a lever of power that all these different globalist groups
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  are battling over.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  So one day it's the Soros arm driving it,
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  another day it's the Justice Department arm driving it,
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  another day it's the Atlantic monthly crew,
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  and then it's the New York Times crew,
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  and then it's the Jeff Bezos operation getting what they want.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Reminds me of the hags in Greek mythology that don't have an eye,
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  they pass the one eye around and fight over it,
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  and then literally, I mean, I want to explain something to the D.C. crowd.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  I don't want political power, I don't want Hollywood power,
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I want away from you, I want you to leave us alone.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And that's all the Midwest and Texas and rural areas across this country want
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  is to be left alone by you.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  But you see, they're not going to leave us alone.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  They're coming for our children, they've already come for our children,
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  they're coming for our very lives, they're coming for our jobs,
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  they're telling us that we are non-essential, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  So we just showed you the dot cams that they're showing on TV,
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  because they have a fence up, they've put up about 150 yards in front of the
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  parliament in Ottawa, Canada, their capital,
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  and then they're just showing it and saying,
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  look, no one's there, that's on the news, they're like,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  no one is here, no one showed up, despite what they claimed,
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  and then actually the whole city is just full of trucks and people everywhere.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  And they're saying they're going to occupy there until the lockdowns and all the tyranny end,
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  and beat the drum over and over and over again,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  that it's tyranny, that it's illegitimate, that it's a great reset takeover.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  In fact, I don't mean to give you guys a heart attack here as a crew,
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  that's such a great job.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Will you guys pull up what we aired yesterday, please,
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  of Klaus Schwab, or maybe it was two days ago,
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  bragging on C-Span that he controls Trudeau, that he controls Canada,
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  that he controls half the cabinets, that they've penetrated the cabinets,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and that they are following the belief of the great reset?
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Because that's what this is about, is Trudeau's control by a multinational criminal conglomerate,
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  that has sold us out to China and others, and is now trying to start a war with Russia.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  Here is the clip, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  When I mentioned our names, like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on,
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  they all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  But what we are very proud of now is the young generation,
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  like Prime Minister Trudeau, President of Argentina and so on,
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  that we penetrate the cabinets.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau,
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and I would know that half of this cabinet, or even more half of this cabinet,
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  are for our, actually, young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  And that's true in Argentina, too?
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  Wow.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  Sorry.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  That's true in Argentina as well.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  It's true in Argentina, and it's true in France now.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Maybe it's the president who is a young global leader, but what is important?
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to break and come back,
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  and there's been some big developments with Russia and China that are just now breaking.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  We'll get that information for you on the other side,
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  and we'll get more into how the media manages perceptions
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  and won't show all the big crowds out there.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  But corporate media has almost no viewers now, and independent has massive views.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And no matter who they take off, Alex Jones, Dan Bongino, or Joe Rogan,
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  just more people than fill the shoes and become massive overnight,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  because folks are simply looking for populist information,
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  and that's why the tyrants will fail.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  But instead of just cutting the heads off of the Hydra politically,
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  we've got to go in and wipe out the globalist politically
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  at the heart of the Bilderberg Group and their public arm, the Davos Group, enemies of humanity.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out,
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flower,
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  because you will be down and out.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  Selling out now at infoorstore.com.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  It's hard to believe January 2022 is almost over,
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  and that means our big New Year's special is about to end.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  The highest quality, whole-food-based multivitamin

[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  So that means as of the time I cut this on Thursday evening,
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  you've just got three days to save 40% off on high-quality products
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  at infoorstore.com, like our vitamin C, zinc, rose hips formula

[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  and of course our whole-food multivitamin,
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  meaning it comes from organic sources
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  and is again the highest quality for your body.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  It's all available at infoorstore.com right now.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  should be your next purchase from the infoorstore.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  for a variety of health conditions,
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  including those with osteoarthritis
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  in nutrition, immune defense,
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infoorstore.com
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  It's time to come to grips with the fact
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  are stealing all of your data
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  and creating a map and a database of where you go
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  and what you do.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover,
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  they can shut you down.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards,
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  That's why everybody should visit infoorstore.com.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant,
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  made in America products that have 100% reviews

[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  to support the overall InfoWars against the globalists.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  A true 360 win.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Get your Faraday cages at infoorstore.com.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Check out the new line. It's amazing.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  Alright, Roger Stone just sent me a message.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  I can't tell if this is on his getter or his telegram
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  or what it is because those sites pretty much look the same.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  They're all great sites.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  But Roger Stone sent me this message right here.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  We can do an overhead shot.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  And it says, I joined Alex Jones today at 1.30pm Eastern time.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  That's the next segment to talk about the Trump endorsements
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  and what is really happening in the Republican Party.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  And then he sent me this message.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  He says, this will be the most significant broadcast I've done
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  on InfoWars since 2016.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  So get ready for this information next segment.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  I want to make a quick announcement here to the listeners
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  and to the viewers.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  We are in such dangerous, perilous times in this world right now
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  that it is so important for you to behave and act like, in my view,
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  this could be the last show we ever do every day.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  And it could be the last time you're able to talk to your family
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  across the country for a long period of time.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  It could be the last time you have electricity for a long time.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  It could be the last time you have food in your pantry.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  The last time you can go to the store.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  If you think the deadly vaccine is bad,
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  if you think what you've seen so far is terrible,
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  if you think the supply chain breakdowns and the open borders
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  and the devalued currency and the inflation is bad
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  and all the wars and rumors are wars,
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  let me give you the bad news.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  And if we don't realize how much trouble we're in
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  and if we don't get on our knees and pray to God and repent
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  and ask for a reprieve, we're going to look back at 2021-2022
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  as the good old days.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  I'm a person that's been ready for this for a long time.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  I'm a person that doesn't scare easily.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  And I can tell you, I'm shook up all the time right now
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  because this is it.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  This is the fabled New World Order World Government
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Antichrist takeover.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  I'm not saying it's about to happen next week,
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  but all the pieces are being put in place
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  and the training wheels for it are being engaged in right now
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  and you go to these big churches, you hear nothing about this.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  Instead, they ask you to check your QR code
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  and make sure you got your vaccine passport to be there.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  They are nothing but induction systems or feeders, funnels
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  in to the belly of the beast.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  And I'm not judging these groups.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  I'm just telling you, folks, it's time to get right with God right now.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  Big time.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  And it's also time for us to fight the hardest we ever had
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  to spread the word and to get the word out and to warn people
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  so they know what is going on.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  So we need to build up our war chest.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  We don't need to be running on empty here in M4 Wars.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  We need to go strong into the future
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  as much capital as we have to operate as best we can.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And I've got to tell you, this is going to be the last chance
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  you ever get to get these supplements
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  or to get this great fluoride-free toothpaste
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  or to get a book or a film or a t-shirt or storeable food
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  because the world is so dangerous,
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  you can wake up just like that in the powers out
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  and we're at war with Russia.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Because the globalists are going to cut our power off
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  and say the Russians did it.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  They're all over the news.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  I told you years ago they do it,
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  saying the Russians are going to cut the U.S. power.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  They're going to wipe it in.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Pentagon warns Russia planning cyberattack.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Pentagon warns Russia turned off the colonial pipeline.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  No, they didn't. The globalists did.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  The globalists turned off the Keystone, too.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  The globalists just said we can't have any oil drilling in the Gulf.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  That's the Democratic Party.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  That's the New World Order.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  That's the Eugenicists. They did it.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  And I'm not here defending Russia.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  If it was Russia doing all this, we could stop it easily,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  but we can't because we have an enemy within the gates
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  that runs our system.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  And everybody that works for the system
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  that pretends like you're on the winning team, you're fools.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  You have thrown your birthright out the window.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  You've destroyed yourself.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  And there's still time for you to turn back.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  But I'm not going to talk to people that serve evil.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  Most of them are a lost cause.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  I'm talking to those of you that know what's going on
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  and know how serious things are.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  You need to get your head straight.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  You need to get focused and get out of that fog
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  and decide what you're going to do politically, spiritually,
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  economically, culturally to not go along with this
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  and not comply like the million people
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  descending on Ottawa, Canada right now
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  with caravans 50, 60, 70 miles long
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  coming in from every major direction
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  exposing the Great Reset, exposing the New World Order,
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  exposing what's happening.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  So I would go to infowarstore.com
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  and I would get these products
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  and I would buy extra to have a backup.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  We're going to end the sale by Monday.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Vitamin C, zinc with rose hips.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  1100% of your vitamin C.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  Very strong, very organic, very high quality.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  This is something everybody should be taking daily.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  It is 40% off infowarstore.com.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Our whole food, not from whole foods.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  It means whole food.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  From food, concentrated, real organic vitamins,
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  our multivitamin, top of the line,
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  great price regularly, 40% off infowarstore.com.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Brainforce plus 40% off.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  That sale is going to end Monday as well.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  We're already sold out.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  The majority of these products,
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  since they came back in,
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  But now is the time to boost your immune system,
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  to boost your body's natural defenses
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  and to fund the infowar.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  We have other great products
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  like our new, updated, improved,
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  even higher quality concentrated bone broth
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  with chaga mushroom and bee pollen
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  and really strong, great turmeric.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Can't do better for your whole body,
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  your joints, your stamina, your libido,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  your immune system.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  It simply is amazing.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  I mix them with protein powder
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  and take it as a meal replacement.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  It feels so good.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  It makes my joints that hurt feel so much better.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  I ask myself, why do you forget
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  and not take this every day?

[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  My Patriots, the biggest food supplier
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  of storeable food in the country

[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  So unlike others that are running out of food,
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  they bought a massive amount

[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  like five years ago.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  We should change the name.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  It diffuses people.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  It's their entire line of food.

[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  and then they ship it to you
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  because the whole factory line,
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  I've been there when they've done it in Utah,
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  then they run the whole line right there fresh right to you.

[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  All right, Roger Stone
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  says he's breaking the biggest news
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  since he's done in 2016
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  on the broadcast straight ahead
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  that General Flynn coming up
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  warns of imminent globalist false flags
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  and declare martial law.
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  with everything that's going on
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  both at home and the world at large.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  we could all use more of,
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  our new sleep support formula down and out
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  is just the thing.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  that is specifically designed

[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  are extracted directly into the glycerin solution
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  so the ingredients are already dissolved
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  into the formula before you even take it.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  is the passion flower
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  like the Cherokees
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.

[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  once you take them but that would just be a lie.

[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  it can be very stressful dealing
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  with facts you refuse to accept
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  if you have a family member suffering
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  from this degenerative mental condition
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  from www.infowarstore.com
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  Studies have suggested that
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  can slightly lower blood pressure
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  decrease triglyceride levels
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  decrease the growth rate of plaque
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  and provide a soothing reduction
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  in inflammatory responses
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  in joints and the digestive system
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  recent studies have suggested
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  can stimulate immune function
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  by increasing the concentration
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  and activity of immune cells
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  it worked for my family
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  and now I can have a logical
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  and calm discussion about actual facts
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  that pertain to reality
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  just like I said
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  that pertain to reality
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  get your ultimate fish oil
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  for a friend, family member or yourself
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  www.infowarstore.com
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  well fresh off trying to put
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  transgenders in front line combat
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  and trying to purge the military of anybody
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  that's pro-america and trying to make
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  the troops take experimental deadly shots
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  in violation of the Nuremberg code
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  the odd couple of evil
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  Austin and Millie
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  have had a press conference
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  where they urge Russia not to invade
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  and to stand down and where they say
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  the Russian attack is imminent
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  and Russia says you're massing
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  troops on our border
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  we've only put some troops on our border
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  in case you do, we're not going in
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  stop it
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  but there's just a hysteria here
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  with CNN
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Biden told the Ukrainian president last night
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  to brace for impact
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  and then the White House says that's not true
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  so
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  the Pentagon is busy trying to start a civil war
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  with the American people
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  they're busy trying to put everybody in jail
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  apparently evil and the Capitol was about
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  white rage when it wasn't
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  what a time to be alive
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Roger Stone joins us with exclusive
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  huge news and Roger doesn't hype stuff
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  that isn't
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  hype for a reason
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  he sent me a message just 10 minutes ago saying
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  this is the biggest news
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  biggest show I've done
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  since 2016 election
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  this is going to be absolutely
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  massive
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  and what is he about to talk about
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  well he's about to tell you
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Trump faces a mega revolt
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  a MAGA revolt
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  over his endorsements
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  so it started out in the last year as a problem
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  endorsing some really bad neocons
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  and others that hate President Trump and hate his supporters
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  now has become an avalanche
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  where he's not even basically endorsing
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  anybody good so
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  Trump is destroying himself ladies and gentlemen
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  by pushing the poison vaccine everything
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  it's very very sad
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  I've been persecuted for supporting Trump
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  I hope we can salvage this
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  but joining us
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  is
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Roger Stone former top advisor to
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  President Trump long time confidant
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  40 plus years Roger thank you so much
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  for joining us today
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Alex it's great to be back with you
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  and the whole crew at Info Wars
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  look there's no one alive
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  who loves Donald Trump more than I do
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  I started trying to get him to run
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  for president in 1988
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  I was willing to go to jail for
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  seven to nine years rather than
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  bear false witness against him
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  under extraordinary pressure
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  from Robert Mueller and his thugs
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  I think he could be the greatest president
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  in my lifetime
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  and can you imagine what he could have accomplished
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  had he not been surrounded by
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  quizlings and traitors
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  and he gave us the most vibrant robust economy
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  in our history he rebuilt
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  our national defense and in fact
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  our offensive capability
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  he instilled fear in our enemies
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  around the world
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  he told the red Chinese that we would not be
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  patsies anymore
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  so there's much great to be talked about
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  here but it's important
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  to understand the backdrop of what's going on
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  here Alex
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Donald Trump's nomination was in essence
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  the hostile takeover
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  of the Republican Party
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  and what's going on right now
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  is a systematic effort
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  by Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  to retake control
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  of the Republican Party
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  and take it back to the country club
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  now there are times
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  when the president seems to understand
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  this for example only weeks ago
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  was Donald Trump himself
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  who was aghast at the vote
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  by Congressman Christopher Smith
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  of New Jersey for Joe
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  Biden's build back better
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  trillion bonanza
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  and Trump himself went on social media
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  to call for a primary
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  challenge to this rhino
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  fortunately Mike Krispy
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  who was a broadcaster with right side
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  broadcasting lives in the district
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  step forward and said me I'll take him on
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  and now this rhino is in deep trouble
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  by the way Kris Smith
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  has been in Congress for 40 years
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  who called him out? Donald Trump
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  and he's going to get beat so there are
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  times when the president appears
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  to understand exactly what's going on here
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  and the president has certainly
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  called out Mitch McConnell
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  and Mitch McConnell's ties
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  to the Chinese and his desires
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  to compromise
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  with the deep state
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  what we saw here in Tennessee 5
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  which has got everybody in an uproar
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  is where the president endorsed
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  a bushy, a rhino
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  a woman named Ortegas
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  who certainly looks like a bad actor
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  considering her connections to Jeb Bush
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  and Mike Pompeo
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  and other deep staters
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  and hopefully this is an early warning
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  I'm not all that impressed
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  with the MAGA candidate Robby
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  Starbucks seems like a nice enough fellow
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  but it's a multi candidate race
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  the races to watch here
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  Alex to determine whether the president
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  really understands what's going on
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  are several
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  first and foremost the most important
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  one in the nation the number
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  one rhino in the country
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  the guy who is Mitch McConnell's
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  right hand man
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  is Senator James Lankford
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  of Oklahoma
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  it was James Lankford
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  who sat on the Senate Intelligence Committee
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  for four years and never once
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  criticized the Russian collusion
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  hoax
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  it was James Lankford
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  who made the motion on January 6
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  to certify the election of Joe Biden
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  and then
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  apologized to Black Lives Matter in Tulsa
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  because he had briefly
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  questioned the results of the election
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  saying it was racist
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  in fact it was James Lankford
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  who was open to a third impeachment
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  over Donald Trump regarding
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  January 6
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  this guy is the number one rhino
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  in the country he is a certain vote
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  for Mitch McConnell to return to the leadership
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  now he's being challenged
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  by Jackson Lawmire
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  a hard charging
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  pastor and businessman
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  who has built an extraordinary
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  grassroots campaign
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  is beginning to press
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  the senator
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  Jackson Lawmire is one of the most exceptional
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  first time candidates I've ever seen
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  so what will the president do
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  will he throw a lifeline
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  to this enemy
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  or will he support a legitimate
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  MAGA challenger
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  by the way you can go to jacklaw.com
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  or Jackson Lawmire to read more about this guy
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  he's incredible
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  there are other examples
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  what about Laura Loomer
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  she's running an incredibly hard charging race
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  against Dan Webster in Florida
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  he didn't even bother to show up
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  to vote against the second impeachment attempt
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  and he didn't even bother to send
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  a proxy which is allowed under house rules
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  that's how much he cares about the president
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  recently
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  in a public forum
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  when a show of hands was asked for
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  in terms of who thought the election was stolen
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  Dan Webster didn't raise his hand
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  the dichotomy
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  Alex between the grassroots
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  and the leadership of the party
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  is like day and night
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  and it's pure
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  about the last election is still
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  red hot
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  it is the number one issue
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  among Republican primary voters
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  I don't care whether you're in Nevada
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Tennessee
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  or New Jersey
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  I'm not going on the basis of my gut
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  or my instincts or what I think
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  I'm looking at sophisticated polling
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  and
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  while we look at these key races
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  we're going to determine
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  who understands that he is being undermined
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  by those who seek his endorsement
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  let's talk about why they do so
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  despite his positions
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  on vaccinations
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  which I also disagree with as you do
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  do not underestimate the strength
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  or potency of Donald Trump
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  at the grassroots level of the Republican Party
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  even today
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  87% of Republican primary voters
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  in Oklahoma are more likely to vote
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  for the candidate endorsed by President Donald Trump
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  in New Jersey
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  I can tell you right now
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  and that's a blue state
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  it's only 69%
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  and that's why we can criticize
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Trump and put pressure on him to do the right thing on issues
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  which he tends to do
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  but we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  that's why the Democrats fear him so much
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  is because if he gets behind people
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  they win that's why this battle to get him to endorse good people
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  is key
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  we're going to break in a moment but real fast Roger
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  let's just name names
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  and endorse his enemies
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  that's an extraordinarily difficult question
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  because Donald Trump is a guy
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  who likes to pick up the phone and consult
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  with many many people
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  he also hates it when people go out and say
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  oh I just talked to the president and here's what I told him
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  and I think in some cases
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  he has been sold a bill of goods
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  but the most important
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  contests are yet to come
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  we've already had some disappointments
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  so for example
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  he's endorsed Vern Buchanan
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  a Wheeler dealer
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  often called the most corrupt member
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  of Congress being challenged by Martin Hyde
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  in Sarasota
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  Martin Hyde's a real patriot
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  I mean he is a mega Republican
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  a huge disappointment
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  and you turn around and the president has endorsed
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Mario Diaz-Ballart in Miami
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  the president doesn't know
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  we've got to come back and talk about this Roger
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  you've got a lot of sites
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  you've grown back to your alternative social media
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  how do people find all things Roger Stone as we go to break
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  go to stonecoldtruth.com
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  stonecoldtruth.com
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  that's the best place to go
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  I'm big on gab
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  I like gab because they're really committed
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  to free speech and no censorship
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  you won't find me on getter
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  they won't verify me
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life. Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system of a supplement that contains both. This Infowars Life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the Infowars store. The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellts.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  Until 10 years ago the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't exist. Well now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, show on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  And if as a Liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot. We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  When we look at the world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast, everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  They want control of procreation, they want control of the relationships between men and women. They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image and given free will.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision free will and stand against evil.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  And then for eternity win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  These folks, they supply the border control everybody with their systems as well. They're amazing folks and you get a free phone of $600 to $50 value absolutely free at m4warsphone.com.
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do. These aren't. And the calls are free when folks call you. You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  The calls you were free or take a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced. And I keep one in my car, I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  You can go to m4warsphone.com or 941-955-1029-41955 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central it's the Alex Jones show still on air.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  He's got all the attacks and all the lies and in many ways more authoritative, more influential than ever.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  But that just enrages the globalists and makes them more than ever want to throw our ass in prison.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  Big ol' article in USA Today talking about Roger Stone under investigation for supposedly maybe being behind the insurrection at the Capitol.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  Unbelievable. We'll talk about that some at the start of the next hour before he leaves us because General Flynn did an interview with me this morning.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  He's going to air in the fourth hour. And he said imminent false flags. He sees Biden preparing the public for that to try to outlaw the Republican party in his opposition.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  Even Mitch McConnell two weeks ago said, what is this that Republicans are domestic enemies, including Republicans in Congress?
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  What are you trying to cause a civil war? And Democrats are everywhere, Roger, saying we're in a civil war.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  They've got to arrest us, not just censor us. You've already experienced them try to set you up and try to put you in prison.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  You had to be pardoned. This is serious business. Explain to people from your deep political understanding where we're at and how much danger you think we're in.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  And then again, you're called to Trump while you're saying this is the most important broadcast you've done here in five years and why it is the most important.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  Here's why it's the most important, Alex. What I'm calling for is to let Trump be Trump. Let him return to his roots.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  This was a historic takeover of the party. What you're seeing right now is nothing less than an epic struggle by Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy to take the party back to the country club.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  Nobody has exposed this as effectively as Laura Loomer, who crashed a National Republican Congressional Committee event in Miami,
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  and basically exposed the fact that Kevin McCarthy and the House Republicans don't want to talk about honest, clean, fair elections,
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  don't want to talk about the internet censorship and deplatforming of conservatives and Trump supporters and libertarians and independent thinkers.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  They don't want to talk about any of these things. They want to bury them. But I can just tell you the people at the grassroots,
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  the people who love Donald Trump and the job he did for this country are not over it and they're not going to be over it.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Big news, by the way, today, the breaking just a little while ago out of Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania Commonwealth courts have ruled the mail-in ballots used in the last election to be unconstitutional.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  It was pretty clear to most of us, but again, the rhinos in the Republican state legislature, House and Senate, threw Donald Trump over the side and legalized mail-in ballots.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  Now it will go to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which leans left. If the next election is held in Pennsylvania under the old rules,
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  you're not going to elect a Republican governor and you're not going to carry that state, which I'm convinced Donald Trump did in the last election.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Epic news, not only that, but the governor has appointed a woman by the name of Lee Chapman as the Secretary of State.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Where was Lee Chapman previously? Why was she working for George Soros while living in Washington, D.C.?
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  So they want to make their theft of Pennsylvania permanent. This is the kind of battle you would expect the Republican National Committee to be fighting,
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  but they are MIA. Donald Trump has raised and continues to raise record sums for the Republican National Committee.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Where were they in the fight over election integrity? Why did General Michael Flynn and his allies have to go raise the money,
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  and great patriots like Wendy Rogers have to go out and raise the money for audits in Arizona, for audits in Wisconsin to fight the fight in Pennsylvania?
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  Where is the Republican National Committee? The chairwoman of the committee, Rana Romney McDaniel, did that give you a hint?
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  She is so busy counting the money that Donald Trump is bringing in, she's not spending any on it to make sure that we have honest, fair elections,
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  or doing anything about the fact that our candidates across the board are being knee-capped with internet censorship.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  Meanwhile, all of us, whether it's OAN or Newsmax or you or I that tell the truth, we're all being targeted for destruction.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  That's what listeners have to understand. Praying for us, financially supporting us, spreading our articles and videos is beyond key
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  because they wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't effective with the truth.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  And as you said, all over the country, the election fraud is coming out in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  It's being certified, it's being proven, and the legislators are saying we're not going to have consent decrees with Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama's lawyers
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  just to say we're going to accept fake ballots mailed in by the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. This is going to stop them dead in their tracks.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  That's why they're in total panic mode. Do you agree with General Flynn that they're trying to frame us for a new January 6 false flag?
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  I believe they're cooking up.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  Well, we both know that there is no evidence, as Reuters reported a month ago, longer than that.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  The FBI investigated extensively. They found no connection between Roger Stone or Alex Jones regarding any conspiracy or any illegal activity on January 6.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  And even today's USA Today said that their star witness had no contact with me or no information.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  That's because any claim or assertion or even implication that I was involved in any illegal activity on January 6 is categorically false.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  It's BS, but that doesn't stop them from recycling it.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  And then beyond that, Alex, the business insider writes a piece yesterday saying that my wife and I are under criminal indictment for a failure to pay our taxes.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  This is a vile lie. The Biden Justice Department has filed a civil complaint against us regarding our 2007 taxes.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  It is highly sensationalized and it reads it implies that we have either hidden assets or failed to report income, categorically false, and I won't fight it because it's not true.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Only because my lawyers contacted the business insider and demanded a retraction and a correction does it now correctly point out that it is a civil complaint.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  Let me put it another way. I made payments to the IRS for three years running without missing a single payment until the Mueller investigation bankrupted me.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  And now they charge me with not being able to pay their payments.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  Had they continued to work with me, they'd continue to be being paid.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  It's a perfect example of the kind of harassment you have to put up with.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  Yeah, I need lawyers to defend myself.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  So go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  StoneDefenseFund.com. Put it up there, Daria. I need help.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Absolutely. So let's talk about this.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  We are champions in this fight. We're seen as symbols of American liberty and populism.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  That's why the globalists want us destroyed and taken off air so incredibly badly.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  And you do have the President's here. We're not going to make a big deal about it.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  But everybody knows that that's why they hate you so much.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  And I know that you and others are working on him to get him to endorse better candidates.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  Not just for his future, but America's future.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  I mean, is there any way to get him a good advisor that he can run these things by?
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  Because this is really bad, Roger.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Well, we're going to see here again. Let's look at those bellwether races.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  Oklahoma is absolutely crucial.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  The President has totally figured out Mitch McConnell and what a con man he is.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  And the President has made it clear that he intends to challenge him.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Why then would the President turn around and endorse James Langford?
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Will Rogers never met James Langford.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  This guy is an obnoxious rhino snot who's not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  He never once in four years on the Senate Intelligence Committee did he defend President Trump.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  And now he says he's open to a third impeachment regarding January 6th.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  Well, the President didn't do anything wrong on January 6th,
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  other than exercise his constitutional rights to question the outcome of the election.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Challenging him is Jackson Lawmire, a hard charging pastor and businessman
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  who I've gone down there to endorse because I'm so impressed with his candidacy.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Now the President can either give Mitch McConnell what he wants and cut his own throat
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  or he can stand with those who stand with him.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  Jackson Lawmire, by the way, has been endorsed by the Oklahoma State Republican Party Chairman, John Bennett.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Former Marine, the first state legislator in Oklahoma to endorse Donald Trump for President.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  So you know where we stand.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Look, I love Donald Trump and I think he can be the 45th and the 47th President.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  And I disagree with him on some things but look at the great things he did
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  and don't underestimate his strength.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  A Reuters poll last week, Republican primary voters nationally,
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Trump, 54, Ron DeSantis, 11, Mike Pence, 7, Chris Christie, 2, 2.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  So for those who want to believe that the President has lost his mojo,
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  you're dreaming folks, it's not true.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  He is stronger than he's ever been.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  The question is, will he continue to lead a revolution
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  or is he going to let the party be hijacked by the rhinos and taken back to the country club?
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  So what headline do I give this interview?
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Something like exclusive.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  Roger Stone says Trump is stronger than he's ever been but must endorse patriots.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  I mean, what's the headline here? What's the takeaway?
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  The headline is, Roger Stone breaks down the internal struggle for the Republican Party and control of the future.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  The Republican Party is the last, best hope for this country.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  They're trying to outlaw us, they're trying to frame us for crimes we have nothing to do with.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  Why are they so afraid of Donald Trump?
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  Why are they petrified that he's going to run again?
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  Could it be because he beat them twice and they fear that he's going to beat them again?
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  He has to watch out for the Trojan horses.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell are running their candidates in on him,
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  like Corey Mills in Florida.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  Roger, you're on fire. Stay there.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  I want to play that clip of him on the golf course a few days ago saying I'll be the 45th and 47th.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  Get your take on that and more straight ahead and we have another special guest joining us.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  Reset Wars has been a great tool. Amazing and eye-opening.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  It really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily go across political lines or religious lines,
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  but about all of us as a human species coming together.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  I'm a combat veteran and, I mean, that brought me close to God, but what Alex does brought me even closer.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  I can feel God in my life now.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  The viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously programmed into your brain
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  and how to erase those programs and install new.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  Reset Wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular Info Wars broadcasts.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  It's an academic level course that will raise your awareness and help you live a more conscious and self-determined life.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  If you're on the fence about Reset Wars, it's time to get off the fence.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  Join Reset Wars today.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  It's hard to believe January 2022 is almost over and that means our big New Year's special is about to end.

[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  It's beautiful, how the state, the melody settles down over me.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  Robert Stone's our guest and he is over COVID and I've never seen him so fired up.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  And he's got something to say about January 6 next segment.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  But right now I wanted to play this clip of Trump a few days ago saying I'm going to be the 45th and 47th member.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  Six months ago the media didn't pick it up.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  Roger met with Trump, he didn't want to get specific, but Trump had gone from wasn't going to run to them messing with him, going to run.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  And the Afghanistan thing was the final deal and here was Trump confirming it that he will be the 47th president.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  That has got to scare the hell out of the left here it is.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  You're so lucky to be one up.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  First on T, 45th president of the United States.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  45th and 47th.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Yes, I love that.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Beautiful.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  What an easy game.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  I think it's pretty boring to be middle all the time.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  So, Roger, looks like he's running for sure.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  That's got to scare the hell out of him.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  This is why I love Donald Trump, I mean, that is just so cool.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  Not only the perfect quip, but also the perfect shot.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  Straight down the fairway.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  Because Trump is a winner.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  That's why they are scared to death of.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Meanwhile, let's be very clear.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  In Michigan, the Republican leaders are urging him to endorse the chief of police of Detroit for governor.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  The same guy who provided a police escort of the Detroit police department when they dropped off the 300,000 phony ballots at 3am at the voting counting center in Detroit.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  Why would he endorse a current Democrat who switched to suddenly say, oh, I'm a Republican for governor.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  Or let's look at Nevada where party leaders are urging him to support the sheriff of Clark County, Joe Lombardo.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  This is the same guy who not only covered up the Las Vegas shooting crimes, but who says even today he's seen no evidence whatsoever of voter fraud in Nevada.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  Well, it's because he must be wearing a blindfold.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  It is outrageous to see these rhinos in every state trying to take back the country.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  Pardon me, trying to take back the party.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  Meanwhile, anyone watching this broadcast who gives a penny to the Republican National Committee or to the National Republican Congressional Committee or the National Republican Senate Committee needs their head examined.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  This money is not going to go to save America.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  This party is not going to go towards winning elections against socialist Democrats.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  This money is going to go towards kicking the Trump people out of control of this party.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  This is Donald Trump's party at the grassroots.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  And they are so petrified of the Trump movement that they've tried to frame you and I.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Look at those blaring headlines.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  Roger Stone and Alex Jones now under investigation.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  This is an absurdity.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  Yes, I went and I answered their subpoena because by law, if you don't, they can charge you with all kinds of things because you refuse.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  But I also invoked my Fifth Amendment right many, many, many times.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  Why?
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  Not because I've done anything wrong.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Not because I know something that I want to hide.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  But I have firsthand experience with the Democrats ability to take things you say that are innocuous, immaterial or irrelevant and twist them into a crime.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  And boy, they'd like to lock me up because they don't want me helping Donald Trump in the next election.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  They don't want me helping to get Jackson Lawmire in Oklahoma elected to the U.S. Senate.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  They don't want me helping Mike Crispy in New Jersey.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  I have selected a very handful of people who I believe to be true patriots, Martin Hyde and Sarah Soda.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  I mean, these guys are warriors.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  They're prepared to take the Democrats and the socialists on.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  And they don't want me out there on the battlefield.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  Had I been on the battlefield in 2020 instead of sweating out going to prison, the results might have been different.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  That's right.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  Roger Stone said, let's talk some about January 6. The General Flynn interview I did this morning is going to premiere in the fourth hour coming up in 55 minutes.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  And he's really worried about a false flag built around January 6.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  We'll come back and talk about that straight ahead with Roger Stone.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  Let's interrupt us and make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  The traders know they can shut us down by force.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  So be it.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  Make them silence us by force.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  Give now.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  Buy products.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  Donate.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  Before everything changes.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  Victory or death.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  Go now to infowarstore.com.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  Well, if you ever wanted to live to see the multinational corporations try to take over America and the rest of the western world, you live to see it.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  The biomedical training, the open borders, the evaluation of the currency, the Bilderberg Groups, the Davos Group, getting hundreds of presidents and prime ministers elected that they brag on TV that they control.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  Unbelievable.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  We got big Russian news coming up.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  China news.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  There is so much.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  But Roger Stone and I are here.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  Talking about January 6th.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  He just spent, he just joined us the last 40 minutes or so drilling into Trump and some of the bad endorsements he's making and how dangerous that is.
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  And how we can hopefully get Trump back on the straight and narrow just because it's the right thing to do and it's common sense.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  But if we look at January 6th, big U.S. say today article out today that's not as bad as the other ones, you know, saying that we're guilty criminals and need to go to jail and, you know, with no evidence.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  Admitting that what the FBI said in August of last year, they investigated us all, that there was no plan from Trump, through Roger Stone and Alex Jones to attack the Capitol.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  And they go on to say that they have now interrogated all the Oathkeepers and that the Oathkeepers told them no, no one told us to do that.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  Well, of course, I didn't tell them to go in there and blow our feet off.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  I don't shoot myself in the foot with a fricking shotgun.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  I mean, we were trying to get a 10 day investigation by the Senate.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  We had the damn votes probably.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  And the few morons that went in with some of the provocateurs that helped break through and the police stood down and a thousand FBI and plain clothes we now know stood and watched.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  That's confirmed.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  That's the story here.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  And we've got Trump trying to get National Guard out there and being overridden.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  He could have then overridden that.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  He didn't.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  But Millie got on his ass and said, don't do it.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  So the truth is they stood down a million people came to DC, a few hundred broke through the police, a few thousand then walked in peacefully.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  And I agree with what some of these Democrats have been saying.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  Former Clinton advisor Biden should pardon nonviolent January 6 defendants fulfill unity promise.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  If somebody, you know, beat a cop over the head of the riot shield, give him five years in jail.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  OK, but you can't have Democrats burning down cities, firebombing buildings, burning down court houses, shooting people and then having the vice presidential candidate bail them out.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  And then try to say it's all a big conspiracy.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  There is no connection between Trump and any of us and what happened.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  It was a disaster.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  It hurt us.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  It didn't help us.
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  We did not have the motive to try to get a few hundred people to beat up cops under the Capitol.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  It is fraud, but the media keeps hammering at Roger and saying that they want us arrested.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  This shows what authoritarians these criminals are.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  Give us your take on it.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  Yeah, if they were to investigate, then they should be investigating the death of Roseanne Boyland.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  This is one of the most horrific things that I've ever seen.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  I've watched the video being bludgeoned with nightsticks being sprayed in the face with Mace.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  This is an unarmed woman who's peacefully protesting.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  She's not inside the Capitol.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  She literally was literally trampled to death after being savagely beaten by Capitol Hill police officers.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  And then there's Ashley Babbitt, unarmed, killed in cold blood.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  Who was she menacing?
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  And then make a hero out of the cop that shot her.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  And we now know from the full footage that hadn't been released till now, it came out in court,
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  that she was freaking out.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  She'd been a police officer in the military telling everybody to stop and demanding the police stop the crowd.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Now we know it was the opposite.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  She wasn't even trying to jump through the window.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  Not only that, but I guess that you just put your finger on it, which is we've been accused of a lot of things,
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  but stupidity is not one of them.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  What happened January 6 was counterproductive to our legitimate political goals.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  The real problem here is they want to criminalize constitutionally protected political activities such as free speech,
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  such as the right to peacefully assemble, such as the right to petition your government to redress your grievances.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  They want to make these things crimes.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  Oh, you're guilty of speaking your mind.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Yeah, I gave a speech on the 5th of January and I put it up on YouTube and guess what?
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  It's gone.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  They've taken it down.
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  Why?
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  Because it was, as Donald Trump would say, a perfect speech.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  That's why.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  I didn't advocate lawlessness.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  I didn't advocate anarchy.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  I didn't advocate that anyone hurt anyone at the Capitol or anyone else.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  I did talk about my apocalyptic view of the struggle this country faces and I did say it is a struggle between good and evil,
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  between dark and light, between those, the godly and the godless.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  By the way, it is anti-Christian bigotry to say, oh, well, that means you're for violence.
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  No, that means I believe in Jesus Christ.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  That's what it means.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  And I have a right to say that, but they want to snuff out your right to say that.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  That's why I'm spending all my money, all my time raising money to pay lawyers.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  I'm so sick of paying lawyers.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  I like to go back having a normal life, but that's not going to happen.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  So folks, go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  And after you do that, go to the Infowars Store and buy a product.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  People don't understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of freedom and truth over the last five years.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  They don't understand it.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  The truth is, and you can read this in my book, The Making of the President 2016,
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  If it were not for Infowars and us getting the Trump message out,
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  Donald Trump wouldn't have been nominated.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  There was no stronger advocate for Donald Trump's America First agenda than Alex Jones.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  And he has suffered for it.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  He has been punished for it.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  He has been vilified for it.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  He has been sued relentlessly, as have I.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  Why do they want to lock us up?
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  Why do they want to lock Stone and Jones up?
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  Because we are threats to them.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  Because the truth is always threatening to them.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  No one is as hated as the truth teller.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  I believe that's what Plato said.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  And it is absolutely right.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  So go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  Make a contribution.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  Go to the Infowars Store right now and buy one of the great products.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  And if you're not in the mood for a product, you can make a donation.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  There's a donation button.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  I'm sick of being called a grifter.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  I lost my home, my insurance, my car, my ability to make a living because I was gagged for 18 months.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  I put it all on the line, just like the founding fathers.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  I was subjected to the most relentless pressure you can imagine to turn my back on Donald Trump.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  Get yourself off the hook, kid.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  Turn on the president.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  Lie. Betray him.
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  And maybe we'll go easy on you.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  And I said no.
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  And I put my fate in the hands of Jesus Christ.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  And I fell on my knees and I prayed.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  And that's why I'm here today.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  And no, for those who say, Stone, you should retire.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  You should withdraw from the battlefield.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  You should give up.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  That's not happening.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  I love America and I'm in the fight.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  It doesn't mean I'm going to go out and break the law.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  I'm not an idiot.
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  But that's why they fear us.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  I'm not going to give up, Alex.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  No.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  Wow, Roger.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  I have never seen you this fired up.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  What's going on?
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  Well, I mean, I had a little bout of the Chinese bio virus that they put on me.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  And thanks to Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, I'm 100% back to full health.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  Now we'll probably get banned just because I said that.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Those drugs work, folks.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  By the way, another big peer review study confirmed that these murderers blocked it.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Again, this is just a criminal establishment completely out of its mind.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  In closing, Roger, it's beyond a political realignment worldwide against globalism,
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  Hollywood, the New World Order.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  Everybody hates it.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  Statistics show it.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  70 plus percent of Americans, including black Americans at the highest level,
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  see the media as the enemy of the mainstream media.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  They love independent media.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  The system's been defeated.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  It just wants to start a civil war to smoke screen that we've got to not be violent
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  and not let them do that.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  And I'm really worried in Ottawa with all those truckers that they're going to try to provocateur
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  something there.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  So peace is so incredibly key.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  But Roger, just in a one minute closing comment, how would you describe the political class
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  right now?
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  I mean, they're on the ropes.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  They're like zombies.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  I mean, don't they get how hated they are and no amount of martial law, no amount of
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  censorship, no amount of bullying will ever put their New World Order back together again?
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  That's why they have put so much stock in deplatforming and censoring us.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  They are petrified of Donald Trump.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  They really are afraid that he's going to come back.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  That's why they want to disqualify him now by falsely claiming that he's responsible for
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  the actions of January 6th.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  They're still bruised from the beating he gave them in two prior elections.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  And he lives in their head rent free.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  I'm not giving up on Donald Trump, and I'm not turning my back on him just because I
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  disagree with him on vaccinations.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  He's still the greatest president in my lifetime, and I'm still ready to fight for America.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  The fight now is for the soul of the Republican Party.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  Are you with the Stones and the Loomers and the Lawmires and the Patriots like General
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  Flynn, or are you with the Rhinos?
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  Do you want to go back to the way it was before?
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  Wow, Roger.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  Amazing.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  Woo!
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  Powerful.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  Roger, got to come back again sooner.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  down, with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack, with the deep
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:14.320]  state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia, with the
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:20.120]  massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place by supply chain breakdowns,
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:26.400]  you need to get prepared now with high-quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:31.360]  And it's been four years since my Patriots supply at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:36.400]  their storable food at 25% off, four years.
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:42.760]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13, 2022, a little over two weeks from the
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:50.120]  time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog of my Patriots
[2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:51.120]  supply.
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:53.080]  Act now, get prepared now.
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:57.400]  This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:02.280]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first-ever Kava Kava Roots supplement
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:06.080]  that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:10.320]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:15.480]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for relaxation and euphoric
[2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:16.480]  effects.
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:22.080]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:26.400]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:31.120]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:32.320]  loosen up a little.
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:36.800]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:43.200]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:49.360]  herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balerian
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:50.360]  Root.
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:55.640]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWars
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:17:56.640] Store.com.

[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:25.960]  from the Mexican rebels, and I've been buying it
[2:18:25.960 --> 2:18:28.080]  for what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:30.140]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[2:18:30.140 --> 2:18:32.240]  for about 50% more, per pound,
[2:18:32.240 --> 2:18:33.800]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:34.880]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[2:18:34.880 --> 2:18:36.760]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[2:18:36.760 --> 2:18:39.280]  from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:41.480]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[2:18:43.960 --> 2:18:46.400]  We had one, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:49.240]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com,
[2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:50.960]  and that's how we find this operation,
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:52.440]  and if you don't find us and don't want to see it,
[2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:53.280]  that's fine.

[2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:06.760]  After years of being off the shelves,

[2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:09.880]  favorite formulas ever,
[2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:12.400]  and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:14.920]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:18.480]  It's got concentrated, high quality chicken broth protein,
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:20.040]  turmeric root that's so amazing,
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:24.160]  shagamush or bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:26.720]  then it's got added magnesium and potassium
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:27.560]  for electrolytes.
[2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:30.720]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder
[2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:34.120]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:36.040]  It even tastes better than last formula,
[2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:38.760]  and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:42.640]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein,
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:45.960]  isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:19:45.960 --> 2:19:46.960]  You're gonna love this,
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:48.120]  and what it does for your joints,
[2:19:48.120 --> 2:19:49.320]  what it does for your body,

[2:19:51.360 --> 2:19:52.920]  and it helps find the info war.
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:55.080]  This is really the best bone broth out there,
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:19:57.320]  so get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:19:59.200 --> 2:20:02.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:20:02.040 --> 2:20:05.640]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:14.440]  There are a lot of different ways to fight back peacefully,
[2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:18.440]  and with civil disobedience against this biomedical
[2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:22.440]  tyrannical takeover that's taking place
[2:20:22.440 --> 2:20:25.440]  across the world, not just here in the US.
[2:20:25.440 --> 2:20:29.000]  They're peaceful fighting against this takeover in Canada,
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:32.440]  places like Australia, places like Germany and Austria,
[2:20:32.440 --> 2:20:35.440]  and the UK is our fight as well.
[2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:39.440]  It is Klaus Schwab, it is the corporations
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:41.440]  taking over our bodies.
[2:20:41.440 --> 2:20:45.440]  And now from multiple highways, upwards of a million truckers
[2:20:45.440 --> 2:20:47.440]  are beginning to descend on Ottawa,
[2:20:47.440 --> 2:20:50.440]  and the corporate press is completely silent
[2:20:50.440 --> 2:20:52.440]  and giving an almost no coverage.
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:55.440]  And Trudeau, the Bilderberg group,
[2:20:55.440 --> 2:20:58.440]  Davos Group alumni of Klaus Schwab
[2:20:58.440 --> 2:21:00.440]  is hiding in his house, literally.
[2:21:00.440 --> 2:21:02.440]  Well, there's other ways to fight,
[2:21:02.440 --> 2:21:05.440]  and Brian Festa has been recommended to me
[2:21:05.440 --> 2:21:06.440]  by a lot of people,
[2:21:06.440 --> 2:21:08.440]  and I've seen him on national television,
[2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:11.440]  but a lot of people I know in the legal department say
[2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:13.440]  he's one of the most effective
[2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:16.440]  at fighting these illegal mandates,
[2:21:16.440 --> 2:21:18.440]  and we've seen some Supreme Court rulings,
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:20.440]  we've seen OSHA pull back,
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:22.440]  but you know they're going to try to bring it back,
[2:21:22.440 --> 2:21:24.440]  and so he's involved in a lot of the lawsuits
[2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:26.440]  against big companies that are trying to still,
[2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:28.440]  despite the government mandate being pulled back,
[2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:30.440]  trying to force these experimental
[2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:32.440]  Nuremberg violating systems on us.
[2:21:32.440 --> 2:21:35.440]  So we, the patriots, USA.org,
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:38.440]  we, the patriots, USA.org,
[2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:40.440]  he's a civil rights attorney,
[2:21:40.440 --> 2:21:43.440]  along with business partner Dale Don Joy,
[2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:45.440]  founded We the Patriots,
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:47.440]  and I'm going to go over his whole background,
[2:21:47.440 --> 2:21:49.440]  but they're great folks,
[2:21:49.440 --> 2:21:51.440]  and they are exposing what's happening.
[2:21:51.440 --> 2:21:54.440]  Brian is the father of a vaccine-injured child
[2:21:54.440 --> 2:21:56.440]  who became involved in medical freedom activism
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:21:58.440]  in legal work several years ago after his son
[2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:00.440]  was seriously injured by the flu shot.
[2:22:00.440 --> 2:22:03.440]  Yeah, half my family's been almost killed by these things.
[2:22:03.440 --> 2:22:05.440]  Don is a Navy veteran,
[2:22:05.440 --> 2:22:08.440]  former Pfizer executive-level employee
[2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:11.440]  with a personal vaccine injury story of her own.
[2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:13.440]  Don was almost two decades of experience
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:15.440]  of the fight for medical freedom,
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:17.440]  and I'm not going to go over all the rest of what they're doing,
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:19.440]  but they're very, very active,
[2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:21.440]  and he comes highly recommended.
[2:22:21.440 --> 2:22:23.440]  So Brian, thank you so much for coming on,
[2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:25.440]  whether you should probably need to give people
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:27.440]  the 35,000-foot view,
[2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:29.440]  because you really have got a bird's-eye view
[2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:30.440]  of what's going on.
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:32.440]  Yeah, thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:34.440]  It's absolutely insane what's going on.
[2:22:34.440 --> 2:22:36.440]  You know what's going on. I know what's going on.
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:38.440]  The rest of the world,
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:41.440]  much of the world has woken up to what's going on,
[2:22:41.440 --> 2:22:44.440]  and that's what we do at We The Patriots USA.
[2:22:44.440 --> 2:22:46.440]  We fight, and we also educate,
[2:22:46.440 --> 2:22:49.440]  because, as you know, spreading truth
[2:22:49.440 --> 2:22:52.440]  is the most important weapon that we have.
[2:22:52.440 --> 2:22:54.440]  We're at a start. I could ask you a million questions.
[2:22:54.440 --> 2:22:56.440]  You're suing a bunch of big companies.
[2:22:56.440 --> 2:22:58.440]  You've already had some big successes.
[2:22:58.440 --> 2:23:00.440]  How about giving us the overview of where the U.S. is right now
[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:03.440]  with this biomedical takeover?
[2:23:03.440 --> 2:23:06.440]  Well, the United States, obviously, in the world
[2:23:06.440 --> 2:23:08.440]  is in a very, very dangerous place.
[2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:12.440]  We are on the precipice of a turning point
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:14.440]  in human civilization.
[2:23:14.440 --> 2:23:17.440]  This isn't just about the United States.
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:19.440]  This isn't just about a handful of people
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:21.440]  in the Biden administration.
[2:23:21.440 --> 2:23:23.440]  I mean, he's nothing more than a puppet.
[2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:25.440]  As you know, a shadow puppet, I like to call him,
[2:23:25.440 --> 2:23:28.440]  for what's really going on at the globalist elite level.
[2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:31.440]  And this was all part of a plan.
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:34.440]  I mean, they instituted this very purposefully,
[2:23:34.440 --> 2:23:37.440]  starting with fear to break everybody down,
[2:23:37.440 --> 2:23:40.440]  get most people to comply and take these shots,
[2:23:40.440 --> 2:23:43.440]  and then the remaining that wouldn't put them out of work,
[2:23:43.440 --> 2:23:45.440]  destroy their livelihoods,
[2:23:45.440 --> 2:23:48.440]  so that we couldn't pull together and fight back.
[2:23:48.440 --> 2:23:53.440]  But we're saying we're going to prove them wrong about that,
[2:23:53.440 --> 2:23:55.440]  because we do still have good people.
[2:23:55.440 --> 2:23:59.440]  I have people contacting me who have lost their jobs recently,
[2:23:59.440 --> 2:24:02.440]  completely out of work, don't know where to turn,
[2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:04.440]  but they say, I'm still going to throw you $10,
[2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:07.440]  because we're not going to let these SOBs take us down.
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:09.440]  We're going to fight back.
[2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:11.440]  And so we are creating at We The Patriots USA
[2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:14.440]  a litigation machine to take down this tyranny,
[2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:16.440]  because that is our strategy.
[2:24:16.440 --> 2:24:19.440]  You asked what is sort of the 35,000-foot view.
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:23.440]  Our strategy is to file as many of these lawsuits
[2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:25.440]  in as many places in this country,
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:27.440]  as many circuit courts of this country,
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:29.440]  dozens and dozens of lawsuits.
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:31.440]  Because otherwise, all you're doing, Alex,
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:32.440]  is you're playing whack-a-mole.
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:34.440]  You got one here, you got one there.
[2:24:34.440 --> 2:24:38.440]  Meanwhile, they're coming at you with untold trillions of dollars.
[2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:41.440]  We're talking about the gates of the world,
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:44.440]  the sources of the world, the federal government,
[2:24:44.440 --> 2:24:47.440]  the state governments, the pharmaceutical industry, big tech.
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:49.440]  They're all in on this together, as you know,
[2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:51.440]  and they've got untold trillions of dollars.
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:55.440]  But we can pull together patriots, brave men and women
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:57.440]  listening to this.
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:24:59.440]  And yes, I did say men and women,
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:02.440]  because that's all we have, right?
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:05.440]  And we're not PC at Here at We The Patriots,
[2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:10.440]  but we are fighting back everywhere across the United States,
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:12.440]  coast to coast and beyond.
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:14.440]  I have people calling me from Alaska to Hawaii.
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:16.440]  Well, that's what I'm told by a bunch of lawyers.
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:19.440]  I know, and other people, they just say you guys are on fire.
[2:25:19.440 --> 2:25:22.440]  Yeah, I mean, we've been already one of our cases,
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:24.440]  the New York health care workers case,
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:26.440]  because the state of New York, Kathy Huckle,
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:29.440]  decided that health care workers don't have the right
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:31.440]  to request a religious exemption.
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:33.440]  We've already been to the Supreme Court on that case.
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:35.440]  We didn't get the emergency injunction in place,
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:38.440]  but we do have that case ongoing through the system,
[2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:42.440]  and we do believe that we back at the Supreme Court very quickly.
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:44.440]  Well, but I just heard this week,
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:46.440]  I'm wrong that right now it is being blocked, though,
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:48.440]  by another suit, right?
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:50.440]  Yeah, well, there's several suits.
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:52.440]  This is what happens when they push this tyranny
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:54.440]  and they throw us all together.
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:56.440]  There's several going on at once,
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:26:00.440]  but yes, temporarily, there has been a block,
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:02.440]  but we are going to keep fighting
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:04.440]  so that we get this before the United States Supreme Court,
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:06.440]  and there's a precedent on the books that says
[2:26:06.440 --> 2:26:08.440]  this can never happen again in any state
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:10.440]  that a state government in violation
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:12.440]  of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:16.440]  can say you are not allowed to have a religious exemption.
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:19.440]  We also have a couple of huge lawsuits,
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:22.440]  one against the largest brick-and-mortar retailer
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:24.440]  in the United States and the world,
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:28.440]  Walmart, Bill Salyer, denied Iver Mectin,
[2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:31.440]  okay, went to his pharmacy after he had a prescription
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:33.440]  from his doctor, Dr. Molly James,
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:36.440]  you may know her, fantastic doctor,
[2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:38.440]  gave him a prescription for Iver Mectin,
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:40.440]  he was critically ill, he and his wife,
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:42.440]  the pharmacist hung up on his doctor,
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:44.440]  said I'm not filling that prescription.
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:46.440]  We have a federal lawsuit against Walmart in Minnesota
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:48.440]  about two weeks ago.
[2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:50.440]  We have another one pending against CVS,
[2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:52.440]  the largest pharmacy chain in the United States,
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:54.440]  so this is what we do.
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:56.440]  We strategically file these lawsuits
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:26:58.440]  against the biggest fish out there
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:00.440]  because if we can take them down,
[2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:02.440]  if we can win those lawsuits,
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:04.440]  that will trickle down to everyone else.
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:06.440]  That's our strategy.
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:08.440]  We, the Patriots, USA.org, the biggest need,
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:10.440]  like I said, is donations,
[2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:12.440]  and we just need people to pull together.
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:14.440]  But, you know, check us out, check out our website.
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:16.440]  We have a lot of great resources there, too,
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:18.440]  for people that want to fight back.
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:20.440]  Absolutely, it takes money to fight a war,
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:22.440]  and that's why I have so many of the real activist groups
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:24.440]  that the enemy is attacking,
[2:27:24.440 --> 2:27:26.440]  that are having victories on the show
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:28.440]  because you have little people in the middle class
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:30.440]  and even wealthy folks who love to hold on to their money.
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:32.440]  They don't start spending,
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:34.440]  and it's going to be worthless anyways
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:36.440]  with all this inflation.
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:38.440]  Our bodies are our most important asset,
[2:27:38.440 --> 2:27:40.440]  they are our castle,
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:42.440]  our national law, common law, international law,
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:44.440]  US law, federal, state.
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:46.440]  It's just outrageous.
[2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:48.440]  It really is medical rape.
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:50.440]  Absolutely.
[2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:52.440]  There's no better term for it.
[2:27:52.440 --> 2:27:54.440]  That's not hyperbole.
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:56.440]  People accuse you of hyperbole, but guess what?
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:27:58.440]  What's going on in this country right now
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:00.440]  is not hyperbole.
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:02.440]  It is the destruction of the human race.
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:04.440]  They are trying to take us down.
[2:28:04.440 --> 2:28:06.440]  It's a depopulation agenda.
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:08.440]  We know that, as well as you know that, Alex,
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:10.440]  and we intend to stop it,
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:12.440]  do everything that we can with God
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:14.440]  at our backs.
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:16.440]  We want to tell you, too, if you want more education
[2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:18.440]  about this, because that is another part of our mission,
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:20.440]  it's education, check out our podcast,
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:22.440]  Faithful Freedom with Teran Gregson.
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:24.440]  She's a PGA tour reporter that we are defending.
[2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:26.440]  She was fired for defying the mandate.
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:28.440]  She's awesome.
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:30.440]  And also check out our Telegram channel,
[2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:32.440]  We the Patriots USA as well,
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:34.440]  because we have a ton of great information.
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:36.440]  We the Patriots USA.org.
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:38.440]  I love you, Brian, and I love what you're doing.
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:40.440]  Let's come back and talk about
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:42.440]  what the Supreme Court already said,
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:44.440]  what you expect the dark side to pull now,
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:46.440]  and so much more,
[2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:48.440]  as our brothers and sisters are up there
[2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:50.440]  peacefully occupying Ottawa right now,
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:52.440]  the capital of Canada.
[2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:54.440]  We salute them and tomorrow are doing a special
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:56.440]  live broadcast, 2 p.m. Central.
[2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:00.440]  Reset Wars is legit.
[2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:02.440]  Reset Wars is a great tool.
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:04.440]  Amazing and eye-opening.
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:06.440]  It really dives deeper
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:08.440]  into yourself and into the
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:10.440]  bigger picture that doesn't
[2:29:10.440 --> 2:29:12.440]  necessarily go across political lines
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:14.440]  or religious lines, but about all of us
[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:16.440]  as a human species coming together.
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:18.440]  I'm a combat veteran and
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:20.440]  I mean, that brought me close to God,
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:22.440]  but what Alex goes through
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:24.440]  brought me even closer.
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:26.440]  I can feel God in my life now.
[2:29:26.440 --> 2:29:28.440]  The viruses that Alex talks to you about
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:30.440]  that are subconsciously programmed into your brain
[2:29:30.440 --> 2:29:32.440]  and how to erase those programs
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:34.440]  and install new.
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:36.440]  Reset Wars is a step beyond
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:38.440]  what you already get in regular info wars broadcasts.
[2:29:38.440 --> 2:29:40.440]  It's an academic level course
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:42.440]  that will raise your awareness
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:44.440]  and help you live a more conscious
[2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:46.440]  and self-determined life.
[2:29:46.440 --> 2:29:48.440]  If you're on the fence about Reset Wars,
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:50.440]  it's time to get off the fence.
[2:29:50.440 --> 2:30:02.440]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:04.440]  It's time to come to grips with the fact
[2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:06.440]  that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:30:06.440 --> 2:30:08.440]  criminals, hackers, corporations,
[2:30:08.440 --> 2:30:10.440]  big tech government are stealing
[2:30:10.440 --> 2:30:12.440]  all of your data and creating a map
[2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:14.440]  and a database of where you go
[2:30:14.440 --> 2:30:16.440]  and what you do so in the future
[2:30:16.440 --> 2:30:18.440]  under their globalist takeover
[2:30:18.440 --> 2:30:20.440]  that will bring you down.
[2:30:20.440 --> 2:30:22.440]  Protecting your privacy,
[2:30:22.440 --> 2:30:24.440]  protecting your credit cards,
[2:30:24.440 --> 2:30:26.440]  protecting your bank accounts,
[2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:28.440]  protecting your photos,
[2:30:28.440 --> 2:30:30.440]  protecting everything that's on your phone
[2:30:30.440 --> 2:30:32.440]  is paramount.
[2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:34.440]  That's why everybody should visit

[2:30:52.440 --> 2:31:18.440]  It's amazing.
[2:31:22.440 --> 2:31:24.440]  It contains the rose plant seeds.
[2:31:24.440 --> 2:31:26.440]  Natural chemicals found
[2:31:26.440 --> 2:31:28.440]  in the hips may even be helpful
[2:31:28.440 --> 2:31:30.440]  for a variety of health conditions
[2:31:30.440 --> 2:31:32.440]  including those with osteoarthritis
[2:31:32.440 --> 2:31:34.440]  and for those with pain after surgery
[2:31:34.440 --> 2:31:36.440]  studies have shown.
[2:31:36.440 --> 2:31:38.440]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[2:31:38.440 --> 2:31:40.440]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[2:31:40.440 --> 2:31:42.440]  in nutrition, immune defense
[2:31:42.440 --> 2:31:44.440]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:31:44.440 --> 2:31:46.440]  It has been reported that
[2:31:46.440 --> 2:31:48.440]  intake of both is often inadequate,
[2:31:48.440 --> 2:31:50.440]  even in affluent populations
[2:31:50.440 --> 2:31:52.440]  in America.
[2:31:52.440 --> 2:31:54.440]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out
[2:31:54.440 --> 2:31:56.440]  at infowarstore.com
[2:31:56.440 --> 2:31:58.440]  where we promise our rose hips
[2:31:58.440 --> 2:32:00.440]  don't lie.
[2:32:00.440 --> 2:32:02.440]  It's only been in the last 60 years
[2:32:02.440 --> 2:32:04.440]  that we've had satellites that can
[2:32:04.440 --> 2:32:06.440]  decently measure
[2:32:06.440 --> 2:32:08.440]  what's happening in the atmosphere.
[2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:10.440]  But if you look at all the different studies
[2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:12.440]  and reports about NASA and other governments
[2:32:12.440 --> 2:32:14.440]  and other agencies,
[2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:16.440]  they all disagree on what's really happening
[2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:18.440]  with the climate.
[2:32:18.440 --> 2:32:20.440]  So yes, climate change
[2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:22.440]  is totally real.
[2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:24.440]  But notice first they called it global freezing
[2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:26.440]  back in the 70s and 80s and then
[2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:28.440]  global warming and when that didn't really happen
[2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:30.440]  the way they wanted it to. Okay, now it's just climate change.
[2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:32.440]  But did you know that man-made
[2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:34.440]  climate change is a real thing
[2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:36.440]  when it comes to the United Nations
[2:32:36.440 --> 2:32:38.440]  and the Department of Energy
[2:32:38.440 --> 2:32:40.440]  and Bill Gates and the UN?
[2:32:40.440 --> 2:32:42.440]  They have. Weather control treaties from 1979
[2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:44.440]  and Bill Gates has been manipulating the
[2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:46.440]  weather for a very long time.
[2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:48.440]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists
[2:32:48.440 --> 2:32:50.440]  won a Nobel Prize for
[2:32:50.440 --> 2:32:52.440]  an idea of spraying different particles
[2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:54.440]  out of jet engines to control the weather.
[2:32:54.440 --> 2:33:20.440]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[2:33:20.440 --> 2:33:24.440]  Bad news travels like wildfire.
[2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:26.440]  Good news travels slow.
[2:33:26.440 --> 2:33:28.440]  They all call me wildfire.
[2:33:28.440 --> 2:33:30.440]  Everybody knows
[2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:32.440]  hell, I'm bad news.
[2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:34.440]  Everywhere I go
[2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:36.440]  always getting in trouble
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:38.440]  leaving them girls
[2:33:38.440 --> 2:33:40.440]  that hate to see me go.
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:42.440]  You know, I tell you, I'm sitting here
[2:33:42.440 --> 2:33:44.440]  trying to write a headline
[2:33:44.440 --> 2:33:46.440]  during the break for this General Flynn review
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:48.440]  that we're going to premiere next hour.
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:50.440]  And I just can't even come up with something
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:52.440]  hardcore enough.
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:54.440]  General Flynn issues emergency
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:56.440]  warning of nuclear war imminent
[2:33:56.440 --> 2:33:58.440]  deep state false flags
[2:33:58.440 --> 2:34:00.440]  breaking
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:02.440]  General Flynn
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:04.440]  warns of nuclear war
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:06.440]  deep state staging
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:08.440]  false flag
[2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:10.440]  to implement Marshall law.
[2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:12.440]  General Flynn warns deep state
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:14.440]  false flag
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:16.440]  to implement Marshall law.
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:18.440]  General Flynn warns deep state
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:20.440]  planning false flag
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:22.440]  to institute Marshall law.
[2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:24.440]  Nuclear war with Russia.
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:26.440]  I mean, and the former head
[2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:28.440]  of the defense intelligence agency
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:30.440]  former chief advisor to Trump, this is real.
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:32.440]  This is the guy that convinced Obama
[2:34:32.440 --> 2:34:34.440]  to have the pivot to deal with China.
[2:34:34.440 --> 2:34:36.440]  It's not like he just fell off a turnip truck
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:38.440]  yesterday.
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:40.440]  And
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:42.440]  that's what's going on.
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:44.440]  They're betting their whole thing on
[2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:46.440]  this. We'll take a world ID.
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:48.440]  We'll let them put things in our body.
[2:34:48.440 --> 2:34:50.440]  They'll be able to cover up if we get sick.
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:52.440]  They'll wait 75 years
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:54.440]  until
[2:34:54.440 --> 2:34:56.440]  they tell us what's in the damn shots
[2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:58.440]  or what happened when they gave them to people.
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:00.440]  You can't make this up.
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:02.440]  That's not a Monty Python episode.
[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:04.440]  Brian Fiesta is a very well known lawyer
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:06.440]  that heads up WeThePatriotsUSA.org
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:08.440]  that's fighting hard to follow lawsuits
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:10.440]  against Walmart and all the rest of these people
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:12.440]  trying to enforce inoculations.
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:14.440]  What do you make of how guilty it is
[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:16.440]  at first they asked the federal court for 55 years
[2:35:16.440 --> 2:35:18.440]  now the court says no, start releasing it
[2:35:18.440 --> 2:35:20.440]  so Pfizer joins the suit and says
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:22.440]  75 years.
[2:35:22.440 --> 2:35:24.440]  What does that tell the public?
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:26.440]  We don't want you to know what we did to you for 75 years.
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:28.440]  This is incredible.
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:30.440]  Exactly.
[2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:32.440]  And if people can't see it by now, Alex,
[2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:34.440]  I don't know what to tell them.
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:36.440]  Because it is crystal clear.
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:38.440]  There's a phrase there hiding
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:40.440]  in plain sight.
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:42.440]  It's all out there.
[2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:44.440]  Obviously, they are trying
[2:35:44.440 --> 2:35:46.440]  to stop the public
[2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:48.440]  from knowing the truth.
[2:35:48.440 --> 2:35:50.440]  They don't want the people knowing what they're doing.
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:52.440]  That fact alone should be
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:54.440]  enough automatically
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:56.440]  for them to plaintiffs to win the case.
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:35:58.440]  Unbelievable. Please continue.
[2:35:58.440 --> 2:36:00.440]  So, what we're doing
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:02.440]  and just to sort of expand,
[2:36:02.440 --> 2:36:04.440]  you mentioned the Supreme Court case,
[2:36:04.440 --> 2:36:06.440]  the OSHA mandate.
[2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:08.440]  That was a great victory, but it was not
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:10.440]  a perfect day, right?
[2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:12.440]  We had a great decision
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:14.440]  for the OSHA mandate.
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:16.440]  We had a bad decision the same day from the same court
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:18.440]  for the CMS mandate for health care workers.
[2:36:18.440 --> 2:36:20.440]  People are scratching their head
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:22.440]  and say, how can they rule with us
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:24.440]  on one way and rule against us the other way?
[2:36:24.440 --> 2:36:26.440]  Well, because they're still buying the lie
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:28.440]  that this is such
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:30.440]  a deadly virus,
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:32.440]  okay?
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:34.440]  It wasn't such a great window in how ignorant
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:36.440]  she says there's a million people in the hospital,
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:38.440]  4,000 kids dying every day or whatever.
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:40.440]  None of it was even true, just totally
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:42.440]  made up.
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:44.440]  100,000 kids, she said,
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:46.440]  are on ventilators from the
[2:36:46.440 --> 2:36:48.440]  Omicron Fair.
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:50.440]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:52.440]  And this is what's scary, folks.
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:54.440]  When we have a Supreme Court justice,
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:56.440]  now, luckily, she wasn't in the majority.
[2:36:56.440 --> 2:36:58.440]  But still, when we have a Supreme Court justice
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:00.440]  that states that as fact,
[2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:02.440]  these are really, really scary times.
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:04.440]  So, what we need to do
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:06.440]  absolutely
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:08.440]  is pull together files.
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:10.440]  Many of these lawsuits are possible because, listen,
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:12.440]  I know people have lost faith in the justice system.
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:14.440]  I haven't. If I had,
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:16.440]  I'd leave the profession, okay?
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:18.440]  There are still good constitutionalists,
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:20.440]  liberty-minded judges
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:22.440]  and justices that will uphold
[2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:24.440]  the rule of law. I still believe that.
[2:37:24.440 --> 2:37:26.440]  If at any day I come to a contrary conclusion,
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:28.440]  I'll turn in my law license.
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:30.440]  Well, we saw an example of that with the Carl Rittenhouse case.
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:32.440]  That judge was very fair.
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:34.440]  Yeah. Well,
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:36.440]  I mean, this is what we need.
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:38.440]  We need to have more judges like him
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:40.440]  who actually look
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:42.440]  at the evidence, okay?
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:44.440]  Who aren't swayed by public opinion and by the media
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:46.440]  because they're not even supposed to be watching that stuff.
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:48.440]  Well, that's what's going to happen to me and Sandy Hook.
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:50.440]  The judges go, give us your marketing on Sandy Hook
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:52.440]  and we go, it doesn't exist. Boom!
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:54.440]  Defaulted, we know you have it.
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:56.440]  I don't have marketing about what I
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:58.440]  say on air.
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:00.440]  But again, they just,
[2:38:00.440 --> 2:38:02.440]  they reject on to you what they want.
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:04.440]  But I've also seen courts
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:06.440]  do great jobs in cases I've had.
[2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:08.440]  So you're right, it's a mix.
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:10.440]  But more and more, it does seem like
[2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:12.440]  Democrat judges are just doing whatever they want.
[2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:14.440]  Well, I mean, this is why
[2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:16.440]  it's a numbers game, Alex. This is why I'm saying
[2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:18.440]  we need as many of these lawsuits as possible.
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:20.440]  Each one of these lawsuits, by the way, folks
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:22.440]  can be $50,000 to $100,000,
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:24.440]  sometimes more, as you well know.
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:26.440]  And that's a
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:28.440]  pretty good discount.
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:30.440]  One of the great lawyers we work with,
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:32.440]  one of them, the interest of full transparency
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:34.440]  is your counsel, Norm Pattis.
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:36.440]  Pattis and Smith Law Firm in New Haven, Connecticut.
[2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:38.440]  Absolutely phenomenal. They do a lot of work
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:40.440]  for us. But these lawsuits add up
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:42.440]  very, very quickly. And this is why,
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:44.440]  because we have, unfortunately,
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:46.440]  some very bad decisions also coming out
[2:38:46.440 --> 2:38:48.440]  from the federal judiciary,
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:50.440]  we need as many of these suits filed
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:52.440]  as possible.
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:54.440]  Bottom line, there's a total war going on to usurp
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:38:56.440]  a thousand years of common law
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:38:58.440]  to Magna Carta. A thousand years of people
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:00.440]  fighting and dying and bleeding for the freedoms
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:02.440]  that we have that have been enshrined.
[2:39:02.440 --> 2:39:04.440]  They weren't given to us by those people,
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:06.440]  but they fought and died to point them out to us.
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:08.440]  And now we're just giving them up.
[2:39:08.440 --> 2:39:10.440]  We're just crapping down the toilet
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:12.440]  all of this hard-fought freedom.
[2:39:12.440 --> 2:39:14.440]  Exactly. And this is why
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:16.440]  we need to respect
[2:39:16.440 --> 2:39:18.440]  and honor our veterans as well.
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:20.440]  And that's why we're standing up for Bill
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:22.440]  Salyer, the U.S. Marine who has denied Iver Mectin.
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:24.440]  My business partner, Don Jolly,
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:26.440]  an amazing woman
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:28.440]  who is a Navy veteran,
[2:39:28.440 --> 2:39:30.440]  so we are a veteran-owned business
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:32.440]  and who put
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:34.440]  herself on the line for her country as well.
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:36.440]  We need to stand up
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:38.440]  for all of our ancestors
[2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:40.440]  who fought so valiantly
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:42.440]  to preserve our constitutional rights,
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:44.440]  our God-given inalienable rights
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:46.440]  that are preserved for us in the Constitution.
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:48.440]  We need to
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:50.440]  honor their names,
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:52.440]  honor their legacies,
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:54.440]  because right now,
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:56.440]  if we give in to this,
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:39:58.440]  this is it. I mean, you thought
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:00.440]  Nazi Germany was bad.
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:02.440]  This is going to make that look like a child's play.
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:04.440]  And I know I'm going to take heat for that,
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:06.440]  but I don't really care,
[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  because it's the truth.
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:10.440]  This is basically Nazi ideology
[2:40:10.440 --> 2:40:12.440]  through the medical system worldwide
[2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:14.440]  run by behavioral psychologists.
[2:40:14.440 --> 2:40:16.440]  Look at these convoys that have taken over.
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:18.440]  That's last night. Reportedly, it's even more insane today.
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:20.440]  Beautiful.
[2:40:20.440 --> 2:40:22.440]  These are brave patriots that we connect with.
[2:40:22.440 --> 2:40:24.440]  These are the type of people we connect with.
[2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:26.440]  We have actually heard from some people in Canada,
[2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:28.440]  although we only operate in the United States,
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:30.440]  but this is Ottawa.
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:32.440]  This is awesome.
[2:40:32.440 --> 2:40:34.440]  Beautiful. This is what we need to happen
[2:40:34.440 --> 2:40:36.440]  in the United States as well.
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:38.440]  You know, Joe Biden doesn't want
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:40.440]  them coming down through the border,
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:42.440]  but he's fine.
[2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:44.440]  Well, if we tried to do this in D.C.,
[2:40:44.440 --> 2:40:46.440]  they would just hire 50 thugs at the front
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:48.440]  to throw them all off cocktails at the police.
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:50.440]  That's what we got to do.
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:52.440]  We got to keep exercising our free speech,
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:54.440]  even if they try to set us up.
[2:40:54.440 --> 2:40:56.440]  We got to be peaceful, though.
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:40:58.440]  Absolutely.
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:00.440]  We do not advocate for violence.
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:02.440]  A convoy of truckers is not violent.
[2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:04.440]  Standing out, like you see those brave men
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:06.440]  and women right there, those patriots with their flags,
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:08.440]  that's not violent.
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:10.440]  Violent lawsuits is not violent.
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:12.440]  There's a lot of ways we can fight back
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:14.440]  without resorting to violence,
[2:41:14.440 --> 2:41:16.440]  and that's what we advocate for
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:18.440]  in the United States.
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:20.440]  I'm not going to file a lawsuit, Alex,
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:22.440]  just to get a flashy headline.
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:24.440]  I could do that, and I'd probably get a lot of donors,
[2:41:24.440 --> 2:41:26.440]  but I only file lawsuits if I think I have
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:28.440]  a real chance of winning them,
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:30.440]  because that's the name of the game.
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:32.440]  And we know this.
[2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:34.440]  It is the legal victories we've had so far
[2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:36.440]  that have been holding back,
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:38.440]  because the Democrats, as you know,
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:40.440]  and a bunch of states have introduced legislation
[2:41:40.440 --> 2:41:42.440]  to come to your house and take you away
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:44.440]  if you're uninoculated and haven't taken the shot
[2:41:44.440 --> 2:41:46.440]  yet, that's where this is headed.
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:48.440]  And obviously, we're trying to prevent that,
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:50.440]  because we know in America,
[2:41:50.440 --> 2:41:52.440]  where we do have something called the Second Amendment,
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:54.440]  if they start banging down doors
[2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:56.440]  and forcing shots into people's arms,
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:41:58.440]  it's not going to be pretty.
[2:41:58.440 --> 2:42:00.440]  This isn't Australia, this isn't New Zealand.
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:02.440]  If they start doing that here,
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:04.440]  it's going to be really, really ugly.
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:06.440]  I think they're smarter to get this.
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:08.440]  The globalists want to start a civil war here
[2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:10.440]  to destroy the country and devalue it,
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:12.440]  then they're going to come in with the IMF
[2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:14.440]  to stop this. That means the feds
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:16.440]  and the bureaucracy have to back off
[2:42:16.440 --> 2:42:18.440]  and stop doing illegal stuff.
[2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:20.440]  And as citizens, we've got to have a cool hand as well
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:22.440]  and realize, Klaus swabs the enemy.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:24.440]  Bill Gates is the enemy. We're not each other's enemies.
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:26.440]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:28.440]  And we're all children of God.
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:30.440]  We're all Americans.
[2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:32.440]  We all need to stand together
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:34.440]  and fight back peacefully,
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:36.440]  as you said. And I believe that we're going to win.
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:38.440]  I still believe that because we have God on our side.
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:40.440]  And when God is for you, who can be against?
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:42.440]  That's right. Stay there, Brian. Folks,
[2:42:42.440 --> 2:42:44.440]  it's now time for everybody that's a new listener.
[2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:46.440]  Whether you work in private government
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:48.440]  or private systems or you're retired
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:50.440]  or whatever, you've got to choose a side.

[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:54.440]  open global government, world cashless society,
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:43:10.440]  vaccine passports.
[2:43:24.440 --> 2:43:26.440]  With practically half the population
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:28.440]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:30.440]  up in camps, the traders
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:32.440]  know they can shut us down by force.
[2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:34.440]  But that would accelerate the awakening
[2:43:34.440 --> 2:43:36.440]  exponentially.
[2:43:36.440 --> 2:43:38.440]  So be it.
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:40.440]  Make them silence us by force.
[2:43:40.440 --> 2:43:42.440]  This is the final battle of the information war.

[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:30.440]  okay we're gonna play the 40 minute interview with General Flynn next hour and halfway through that hour
[2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:37.440]  we will post the full unedited again interview on band.video and it's just really important
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:42.440]  to stop this war with Russia it's really important for a lot of reasons everybody share it
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:46.440]  especially where he gets into clearly the globalists are laying the ground for false flags
[2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:51.440]  a new January 6th to try to go after American people it's all over the news
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:57.440]  but he talks about that and so much more and then he talks about what his long game is
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:02.440]  just a media says he's a terrorist planning all these over throws in the government and all this totally made up
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:05.440]  and he says oh his long game is his grandchildren
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:11.440]  powerful interview coming up next hour in the war room Owen Shroyer 3 p.m. central today and then tomorrow
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:16.440]  I'm getting my hair cut I've been so busy I'm almost a hippie over here almost got like a
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:20.440]  almost got a mullet going here I haven't had hair this long in 30 years
[2:48:20.440 --> 2:48:26.440]  I'm getting a haircut tomorrow at noon but I'll be up here by one and then at 2 o'clock
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:32.440]  central we'll do it 2 o'clock central we're gonna go live for two hours commercial free
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:39.440]  and take calls from Canadians at the giant demonstration in Canada and really focus on that
[2:48:39.440 --> 2:48:44.440]  because the corporate media they put a fence up around the parliament they're showing a shot of it
[2:48:44.440 --> 2:48:48.440]  and saying look no one's there on the news look no one's there
[2:48:48.440 --> 2:48:53.440]  that's their deception that's all they've got is their lies and their fraud but they forget
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:57.440]  the million people are so they're now starting to show up should be over a million total
[2:48:57.440 --> 2:49:02.440]  well the globalists can't stop them from videoing and getting it out and even if every person puts it on
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:07.440]  Twitter or Instagram or wherever and only gets 100 views apiece that's tens of millions of people that will see the truth
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:16.440]  but a lot of folks are putting it on getter and on all the other platforms like the great folks over at GAB
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:22.440]  and the people over at Rumble amazing site and that's exploding and that's so exciting and people like
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:27.440]  Senator Paul are moving away from YouTube with their sensor for telling the truth
[2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:32.440]  and they're going to places like Rumble and promoting it and more and more going to places like
[2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:37.440]  Band-Aid video which we didn't have a business model for Band-Aid video we put it up the average video
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:42.440]  gets tens of thousands of views we don't even run ads on other people's videos we're probably going to have to
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:46.440]  change the contract and actually run one up front to pay for the bandwidth because now it's getting so popular
[2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:51.440]  the bandwidth bills are just insane and that's great we want people that have been banned and knocked off to have a channel
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:56.440]  it's just that we're victims of our own success we want to thank folks for that support and that's why
[2:49:56.440 --> 2:50:03.440]  Ryan Festa is here on the air saying hey you want to sue you want to stop these employers you want to fight back
[2:50:03.440 --> 2:50:08.440]  you don't want to lay down go donate with their organization that I know for a fact is taking action with real lawyers
[2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:17.440]  with real lawsuits with real results with the Patriots USA.org now Ryan other points about where this is going
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:22.440]  it's run by the UN it's run by the Davos group it's run by big corporate systems to take over
[2:50:22.440 --> 2:50:27.440]  I know you're targeting things over individual rights and things what about the data sharing
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:32.440]  what about the surveillance what about big tech being involved in all this what about the racketeering
[2:50:32.440 --> 2:50:39.440]  what about the monopoly capitalistic vulture capital combines I mean that's probably above your pay grade
[2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:45.440]  my pay grade but we really need some anti-trust lawyers to get involved we really need Congress to take action
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:53.440]  look what Congress has put up with the censorship the surveillance the lies of Fauci I mean this has just been insane
[2:50:53.440 --> 2:50:59.440]  absolutely you're a hundred percent correct and I'm glad you mentioned we need anti-trust lawyers
[2:50:59.440 --> 2:51:06.440]  we need more civil rights lawyers more constitutional lawyers we absolutely need to get them involved
[2:51:06.440 --> 2:51:12.440]  so please if you if you are an attorney and if you or you are a doctor we need more of them in our network
[2:51:12.440 --> 2:51:19.440]  as well please reach out to us because we're building our network every day of more and more attorneys across the United States
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:26.440]  yeah I mean big tech is a huge part of this I've always said because as you mentioned in the open of this segment
[2:51:26.440 --> 2:51:35.440]  my son was very seriously a vaccine injured by a flu shot years ago and he's 10 years old now but still has lifelong disabilities
[2:51:35.440 --> 2:51:43.440]  and I blame big tech almost more than I blame the pharmaceutical industry and the reason I say that is because they've prevented
[2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:49.440]  the truth about vaccines from getting out there they owned them they own the media the smartest thing that big tech ever did
[2:51:49.440 --> 2:51:58.440]  that actually the smartest thing that the pharmaceutical industry ever did was buy up advertising the media they own 70%
[2:51:58.440 --> 2:52:06.440]  of the advertising on network news and cable news okay and big tech same thing that by censoring all of us and kicking us
[2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:13.440]  off all of the platforms because social media is where information is shared now by kicking all of the big names off there
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:20.440]  you've been booted we've been booted my business partner she's off she's not on any platform anymore except telegram
[2:52:20.440 --> 2:52:28.440]  you know it's it's just insane and they've stopped the truth from getting out because think about it if if most of the country
[2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:37.440]  knew what you and I know if we could just freely go on NBC Nightly News or if we could go to any mainstream media outlet
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:46.440]  or if we could go on to Facebook and Twitter and nothing was censored and instantly we got millions of likes and millions of shares
[2:52:46.440 --> 2:52:53.440]  how quickly would this end and organizations like mine would be funded overnight and they know that so big tech is the biggest culprit
[2:52:53.440 --> 2:53:01.440]  in my opinion totally true and beautifully said and that's why they're now moving to debanking they're now moving to denying people
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:09.440]  through databases Uber or hotels or any of this that they literally want to unperson us with the global social credit score
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:17.440]  and this is a very vicious big global corporate move to take over our body surveillance and get away with it so all the tech surveillance
[2:53:17.440 --> 2:53:24.440]  and all the home assistants that watch you and spy on you that's just the tip of the iceberg that's just the opening salvo of this very
[2:53:24.440 --> 2:53:31.440]  cold-blooded takeover and I remember all those hearings 10 years ago 5 years ago I was there 3 years ago when Sundar Pachai
[2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:37.440]  the head of Google was in the committee hearing while they were attacking me by name and I didn't get to speak
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:44.440]  I'm at the back of the room with Roger Stone and they were asking so is it true you track people's location in live time
[2:53:44.440 --> 2:53:50.440]  I mean that's a question a 10 year old should know and Sundar goes no we don't do that and lies to Congress
[2:53:50.440 --> 2:53:57.440]  okay so they have no respect for Congress and I'm not trying to be mean to judges but I've been in these courtrooms
[2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:03.440]  these judges a lot of them probably can't even use a calculator or don't know how to balance their checkbook
[2:54:03.440 --> 2:54:09.440]  and I'm not even a techie guy but I know about the systems and what things do not the code but how they work
[2:54:09.440 --> 2:54:17.440]  and it's just frightening that some of these 60, 70, 80 year old judges literally are like Rip Van Winkle that woke up
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:22.440]  under a tree 100 years later and they are just being bamboozled by big tech and have no idea what's going on
[2:54:22.440 --> 2:54:27.440]  but you're right the wedding of big tech with big pharma is the only reason they've gotten away with these incredible
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:35.440]  horrors and the ability to gaslight everybody yeah yeah and you know truth has a way of bubbling to the surface
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:42.440]  that's a line from an amazing book by a friend of mine JB Hanley how to end the autism epidemic if you haven't read it check it out
[2:54:42.440 --> 2:54:49.440]  but he said that it always stuck with me because it's it's true sooner or later the truth is going to come out
[2:54:49.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  okay we are absolutely going to win this it's it's a matter of how soon and unfortunately that does come down to money
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:06.440]  because they have unlimited resources this is a David and Goliath battle we've got in our hands but guess what Alex we know who won that battle
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:12.440]  that's right well I'm impressed Brian give us updates his lawsuits unfold things go forward the last few minutes we have left
[2:55:12.440 --> 2:55:17.440]  of the shower before the general Flynn interview other key points you'd like to impart to folks
[2:55:17.440 --> 2:55:26.440]  well again I just want to stress that this is a collective effort okay we are networking where we've partnered with amazing
[2:55:26.440 --> 2:55:33.440]  organizations throughout the United States such as stand for health freedom my friend Leah Wilson runs that we've got my friend
[2:55:33.440 --> 2:55:40.440]  Simone Gold who runs America's frontline doctors who's also a partner of ours just some amazing organizations we need to come together
[2:55:40.440 --> 2:55:47.440]  because no one person no one organization is going to do it I am incredibly grateful that you've given me some airtime here
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:56.440]  and a platform to share my message and let people know about our organization we are going to win this like I said as long as we trust
[2:55:56.440 --> 2:56:05.440]  in God first and foremost everything will go according to his plan and you know I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing by the courts
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:12.440]  yes we get a lot of setbacks and the media likes to play that up right they hype that up every time there's a defeat on our side
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:18.440]  it seems like that's all that's happened because it's all over the news but these are mectin cases in particular I'm really excited about
[2:56:18.440 --> 2:56:26.440]  we also have it's totally unrelated to medical freedom but critical race theory in schools we're taking that on as well
[2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:35.440]  Guilford public school district parents were they they are alleging in the complaint that we're about to file seriously harassed to the point where
[2:56:35.440 --> 2:56:47.440]  the lead plaintiff Danielle her her seventh grade son was sexually assaulted in school as part of this harassment campaign
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:56.440]  by by other students because they spoke out of out of a critical race there I mean this is really really bad oh yeah it's really causing racial attacks on white people
[2:56:56.440 --> 2:57:03.440]  and and it's totally evil the opposite of what Martin Luther King jr. taught and the opposite of what Christ taught and the opposite of and a lot of the
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:11.440]  left tries to deny critical race theory but then all the manuals and the videos come out it is the most vile racist divide and conquer crap ever
[2:57:11.440 --> 2:57:18.440]  and the people that brought this into the schools and devised this I think should face criminal charges because this is organized racketeering
[2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:26.440]  criminal race-based conspiracy absolutely it is you we talk about crimes against humanity well that's one of them too
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:33.440]  I got the Michael Flynn interview coming up but that's at six after do five more minutes Brian fast I want to hear about your work on the critical race
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:41.440]  there is also you're doing a great job there we're gonna come back our number four straight ahead general Flynn interviews only six minutes away tell everybody you know
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:58:07.440]  this is gonna be history-making stuff we'll be back sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large if you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of our new sleep support formula down and out it's just the thing it's our new faster absorbing liquid formula

[2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:37.440]  so the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it one of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:47.440]  be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out selling out now at infowarstore.com
[2:58:47.440 --> 2:59:03.440]  with all the craziness going on in the world with the globalist plotting their next big lockdown with the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack with the deep state pushing a civil war not just here but in Europe and war with Russia
[2:59:03.440 --> 2:59:24.440]  with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now you need to get prepared now with high quality storeable food that is ready to ship and it's been four years since my patriot supply at preparewithalex.com has offered their storeable food at 25% off
[2:59:24.440 --> 2:59:46.440]  four years but right now it's 25% off until February 13 2022 a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalex.com on the entire catalog of my patriot supply act now get prepared now this is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self sufficient
[2:59:46.440 --> 2:59:57.440]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[2:59:57.440 --> 3:00:19.440]  well when that bio weapons producer mad scientist Fauci got caught creating the Wuhan virus
[3:00:19.440 --> 3:00:27.440]  again a function they just changed the definition again a function well the ADL
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:35.440]  our masters they literally control reality they say they have now changed the definition of racism
[3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:54.440]  and it's possible for anyone who is brown to be racist you understand that's right ladies only white people are racist so really this is tribalism you can have blacks that are tribal and hate the other black tribe you can have you know a tribe that's Muslim that hates a Christian
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:01:12.440]  you can have you know the Jews and the Muslims that are always fighting with each other that's tribal division sectarianism but now none of that exists it's all just white people this is so evil folks this is so bad and it's meant to make white people racist
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:29.440]  you can put people in groups such as destroy the real liberal you know egalitarian Christian system racism the marginalization and or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people
[3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:41.440]  and that's the definition they're giving America to then dismantle America and the capitalist system for the middle class telling brown people you can't be the middle class which is the ultimate form of actual racism
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  seriously evil this just got changed yesterday and there you go ladies and gentlemen so they're getting rid of tribalism and real terms like that sectarianism
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:02:05.440]  because racism is really just a term for that based on skin color tribalism based on skin color and now they're moving towards just saying being white is inherently bad as they now teach everywhere
[3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:16.440]  so you are getting Brian Festa who's fighting this with we the Patriots USA.org got a few minutes left here tell folks what you're discovering in your lawsuits about critical race theory
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:35.440]  well this one that I just told you about in Connecticut was the most shocking one I've seen it's Loudoun County all over again but almost to another level there's elements in here not only like I said the sexual assault there's also sex education curriculum really disgusting stuff
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:47.440]  that was being given and shown to kids in the school that's going to be an element as well of this lawsuit but the critical race theory this superintendent this is what Danielle told me okay
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:03:01.440]  she went into a private meeting with him and said what's going on I got this email that you're going to be changing the curriculum you're going to be promoting this new kind of perspective on race this sounds a lot like critical race theory
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:19.440]  in the 1619 project and he said well yeah you know it is it is I'm trying my goal my mission in Guilford is to elevate the whiteness of Guilford that's what he said now I don't know what that means but he said he purchased $6,000 worth of Abraham X.
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:36.440]  Kennedy's book how to become an or how to be an anti-racist you're probably familiar with it he purchased that book this is America's evil white people are inherently bad America must be gotten rid of so this is America killing poison being injected by the establishment right into our children's minds
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:51.440]  absolutely and he purchased that for every staff member in the district including kindergarten teachers K through 12 okay so he wants them to be reading this so they can implement this in their curriculum and the Pentagon is force feeding this to the troops
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:54.440]  I mean this is just so criminal
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:04:07.440]  it is we have to put a stop to this listen this is what I'm always telling people we have to race to the courts to create good precedent before they create bad precedent because once they create bad precedent we're done for decades folks look what happened in Roe v. Wade all right
[3:04:07.440 --> 3:04:22.440]  that was 1973 and look at we're still dealing with now and it turns out that baby never even died that was a false flag unbelievable the new definition of racism being white ADL declaration of war against America
[3:04:22.440 --> 3:04:34.440]  the closest thing the Nazis in America folks is the ADL very shameful do not represent wonderful Jewish Americans and others they are just a leftist Marxist Leninist globalist organization to destroy this country absolutely unbelievable
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:37.440]  all right Brian Festa thank you so much sir
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:43.440]  thank you Alex and I hope to talk to you again we'll have some great updates coming back soon we the Patriots USA.org

[3:06:11.440 --> 3:06:27.440]  worst case scenario in this case as I started to look at this build up in this what I call wrote to war is this movement where you start to talk about nuclear weapons and people that are talking about World War 3
[3:06:27.440 --> 3:06:43.440]  I mean this is not going to be some you know movie right this is real and in a World War 3 scenario World War 3 scenario which people in Washington D.C.
[3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:58.440]  make people in in in the legislative branch some of these senators some of these members of Congress and these people in the National Security Council some of these think tankers they are all like beating the drums like we should we should be ready to go we should go no no take a deep breath everybody
[3:06:58.440 --> 3:07:16.440]  I think that we are going to see I expect something again another distraction you know some some I really do expect because of what was staged on January 6 and what was staged up in Michigan to kidnap you know the fake kidnapping of the governor up in Michigan
[3:07:16.440 --> 3:07:32.440]  Whitmer I think we're going to see staged events I really do I mean I really do think that do not put past this administration but their you know their dogs in some cases that they have access to do not put it past them to stage something
[3:07:32.440 --> 3:07:47.440]  and then declare some type of national emergency in order to further shut down aspects of our freedoms I mean I believe that so you know and I tell that to people and I'm telling it to you and I'm telling it to your audience
[3:07:47.440 --> 3:08:04.440]  you know in 30 seconds it has to do with this beautiful country that my father who's a World War two and Korea War veteran and my mother who decided to have nine children thank God they handed my family my generation our generation Alex a beautiful country

[3:08:34.440 --> 3:08:50.440]  it for wars tomorrow's news today
[3:08:50.440 --> 3:09:06.440]  well he doesn't need any introduction on this Friday January 28th broadcast he's general Flynn former head of the defense intelligence agency former top advisor national security advisor to president Trump and of course a
[3:09:06.440 --> 3:09:21.440]  battled individual in the fight for this republic he wrote a very important article that I saw widely syndicated exclusive of general Flynn Biden might get hundreds of millions killed over Ukraine and then Biden was in the news last night with statements
[3:09:21.440 --> 3:09:38.440]  and braced for impact to the capital and to the president of Ukraine trying to really escalate things so we couldn't have a better expert he is a China and Russia expert on then general Flynn general thank you I know that you're on the road on your way to
[3:09:38.440 --> 3:09:53.440]  McAllen Texas you're in Houston right now to survey the collapse border so thank you for stopping on the road to do this quick interview absolutely Alex and thanks so much for having me and and you have a great audience and I want to just thank
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:10:08.440]  at your terrific audience for supporting me so thank you well absolutely sir we love the great work you're doing for this republic so so please get into the editorial that came out a few days ago and then since then a lot has developed what you really think is happening because I'm not a military
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:17.440]  master mind like you but it looks to me like Biden is trying to distract from all of his problems here at home by trying to start some type of proxy war with Russia.
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:28.440]  I mean this is you know these are these are people that are masters of distraction in the White House today and then and then running our government running our intelligence agencies running our Department of Defense.
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:39.440]  So what I wrote the reason why I wrote that article is because when I look at Russia, you know Russia has really three big problems they have a historic problem they have a geographic problem, and they have a cultural problem.
[3:10:39.440 --> 3:10:59.440]  And when when you have this historic problem which is really Europe and NATO, and this continued encroachment, and I really think that we have to take, you know, a sort of a step back and look at the historical perspectives that we are all facing and particularly in the decision making when it comes to the potential for going to war when you
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:16.440]  have nuclear powers you know these of a Russia and the United States of America at a at a potential you know stance against each other with with some of the incredibly stupid forum policies that we have coming out of our White House which are just showing
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:25.440]  enormous weakness and all the other adversaries that we have like China like Iran like North Korea they're all watching what it is that that is going on.
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:37.440]  And I think that a couple of weeks ago I probably I'd say a month ago Putin probably wasn't where he's at but he has seen such weakness and in Biden and and you know I think there's so many things that we have to take into perspective here.
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:58.440]  So, you know, the the the recent phone call by by the White House to by Biden to Ukraine President Lenko. I think that, you know, we have to understand what kinds of things they discuss and they'll be bits and pieces that will come out of that.
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:14.440]  And strategically this is really a European problem right now. I'm not, you know, we, that's why I'm that's why I'm getting ready to go to down on our on our Texas Mexican border here to rally for our own border because, you know, we're getting so worried about the Ukrainian
[3:12:14.440 --> 3:12:24.440]  border all of a sudden. This is a European problem and I think, I think, and we know we can talk about Germany we can talk about some of the issues with what where the Germans stand.
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:37.440]  It's really very, very serious time. I wrote that article because I wanted people to understand who read it, that we are talking about the potential for nuclear powers, and this this increasing rhetoric about going to war.
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:51.440]  I've seen people that serve or served in that White House, the current White House talking about World War three the foreign policy think tanks the defense think tanks out of Washington DC, want to continue to drive us to a war with Russia
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:13:04.440]  and we just we cannot afford it right now. Number one, but number two, this is not really our problem. This is a European problem. I think that Europe needs to resolve this as much as as much as Russia needs to resolve this.
[3:13:04.440 --> 3:13:15.440]  Well, since you raised that very respected head of the German Navy resigned last week, I think you were looting to that and said some really important things about China as the enemy.
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:23.440]  It seems to work with us. They're becoming more Western than even us. Putin talks about how we need to become Christian in America. Russian needs to become Christian.
[3:13:23.440 --> 3:13:31.440]  Putin says we need to have children. We need family values and is not trying to expand its borders while China, it seems, has taken over the world.
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:39.440]  You are one of the main architects that convinced I think one of the few good things Obama did, but you're credited with convincing Obama and others to pivot towards China.
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:50.440]  Now it's clear that China is expansionist. Why do we see this move away from confronting China and confronting Russia?
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:14:04.440]  Well, I think that there's a lot of reckoning that has to take place and I think the world of journalism could do some more investigations when it comes to because we're not, you know, maybe we want to talk a little bit about, you know, Hunter Biden and
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:12.440]  the CCP and the intelligence community of the Chinese. Yes, sir. Take us wherever you want. You've got the floor. Tell us.
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:26.440]  Big, big deals. So, you know, there is this focus, this over focus on Russia and always has been particularly from those left-leaning institutions in this country and basically away from China.
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:34.440]  You know, the sharks in the water right now smell blood when it comes to the stupidity of the foreign policy of this administration.
[3:14:34.440 --> 3:14:42.440]  So, again, I'm going to go back to Russia. Russia has three principal problems, historic. I just mentioned Europe and the historic problems with Europe.
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:52.440]  They have a geographic problem with China and they know it and they have to deal with it. And we're talking eight time zones in Russia and a lot of it touches on their border with China.
[3:14:52.440 --> 3:14:58.440]  And that geographic border has a lot of challenges for them and they have to deal with it. That's just, that's the neighborhood that they're in.
[3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:07.440]  And then the third problem is cultural. And this gets to the heart of what you just asked me and what this German chief of naval operations actually I think he was alluding to.
[3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:15.440]  I mean, the cultural problem is the rise of Islam and radical Islam and Islamists inside of the Russian Federation.
[3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:23.440]  When you look at the Southern tier of nations all the way over to places like, you know, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, into the Central Asia.
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:25.440]  Who can seize all of these things?
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:29.440]  On the interview, we're going to be right back on the other side with the rest of the interview.
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:35.440]  Be sure and visit General Flynn's new site that's excellent, been revamped. That's generalflin.com.
[3:15:35.440 --> 3:15:42.440]  Generalflin.com and it's new book, A Letter to America. I'm Alex Jones. This is the Info War.
[3:15:42.440 --> 3:15:47.440]  And in the next 30 minutes we'll post the full interview to Band-Aught Video so you can share it.
[3:15:47.440 --> 3:16:15.440]  This is important. This could stop World War III and this could stop the big false flag. It's up to you, America.
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:27.440]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists. They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[3:16:27.440 --> 3:16:37.440]  And in a way they're right. If we let them lie to us and dump us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[3:16:37.440 --> 3:16:47.440]  They really deserve what's happened to us. So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[3:16:47.440 --> 3:17:09.440]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts. The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:23.440]  You need to get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[3:17:23.440 --> 3:17:33.440]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their storable food at 25% off for years.
[3:17:33.440 --> 3:17:38.440]  But right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[3:17:38.440 --> 3:17:48.440]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:18:12.440]  At now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[3:18:12.440 --> 3:18:21.440]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:27.440]  This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[3:18:27.440 --> 3:18:34.440]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarsstore.com.
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:40.440]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarsstore.com.
[3:18:40.440 --> 3:18:47.440]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.

[3:18:55.440 --> 3:19:10.440]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[3:19:10.440 --> 3:19:16.440]  better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:21.440]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:19:21.440 --> 3:19:26.440]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[3:19:26.440 --> 3:19:30.440]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[3:19:30.440 --> 3:19:36.440]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[3:19:36.440 --> 3:19:39.440]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:51.440]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we find this operation and if you don't find us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[3:20:09.440 --> 3:20:19.440]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones show. The full Michael Flynn Issues Emergency Warning interview has now been posted.
[3:20:19.440 --> 3:20:25.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:25.440 --> 3:20:43.440]  General Flynn Issues Emergency Warning of Nuclear War and Coming Domestic False Flag. The full interview just went live about 10 minutes ago at band.video. It's also going live on the front page of infowars.com.
[3:20:43.440 --> 3:20:49.440]  We're going to make it the featured video. You can see right there that little promo video we put out earlier is the top video.
[3:20:49.440 --> 3:20:58.440]  We're going to make the full interview, the featured video at band.video. Very easy to find. Right there at the top. Back to the interview.
[3:20:58.440 --> 3:21:03.440]  Putin sees all of these things and he's got to deal with every single bit of it.
[3:21:03.440 --> 3:21:12.440]  I think that if you can put that German naval officer's link on your site today, people can understand.
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:21.440]  This is a very serious guy. I know who this guy is and I think that he was right in what he said because China is the principal adversary that we face.
[3:21:21.440 --> 3:21:28.440]  I'm looking at this from a military perspective. People in the State Department, they can look at them as colleagues if they want.
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:37.440]  I don't look at them as colleagues. I'm talking about China. I look at China as a nation state that is in the pockets or they have us.
[3:21:37.440 --> 3:21:43.440]  We have the US administration in their pockets and we really are having a difficult time.
[3:21:43.440 --> 3:21:50.440]  I'm going to tell you, while Russia is considering whatever they're going to do, while Europe is considering whatever they're going to do,
[3:21:50.440 --> 3:22:01.440]  and you can see the political leaders of Germany, they don't want anything to do with war with Russia because if they do, their Nord Stream oil pipeline gets cut off, their access to energy.
[3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:11.440]  One of the things that Trump did during the Trump administration was he took this issue on and he made the United States of America energy independent.
[3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:14.440]  Well, now all of a sudden, we're not energy independent.
[3:22:14.440 --> 3:22:23.440]  So whenever a guy like Putin can raise the barrel of a price of oil, which he does and he takes advantage of Europe, which he can,
[3:22:23.440 --> 3:22:27.440]  it's because the United States of America is showing incredible weakness.
[3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:34.440]  And we are energy independent, meaning we're taking care of ourselves from an energy perspective, but we also can take care of the rest of the world, Alex.
[3:22:34.440 --> 3:22:39.440]  I mean, then there's a lot more leverages, a lot more strength, and we don't have that right now.
[3:22:39.440 --> 3:22:48.440]  And that was one of the first actually things that Biden, the Biden administration did was they started to shut down our energy independence, our pipelines.
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:53.440]  And it's just incredible. So there's a series of issues that are in play right now.
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:58.440]  And when we talk about war in Europe, this is not a small thing.
[3:22:58.440 --> 3:23:08.440]  And I think that in Putin's case, I think that he has the upper hand when it comes to Biden and he knows it because he knows all of the crookedness,
[3:23:08.440 --> 3:23:14.440]  particularly when it comes to the kinds of things that the Biden family got involved in in Ukraine with charisma, right?
[3:23:14.440 --> 3:23:21.440]  I mean, with Hunter, I don't know what he was getting paid at, you know, $60,000 a month or something for his energy expertise.
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:27.440]  Give me a break. And so these kinds of leverages are held over this administration.
[3:23:27.440 --> 3:23:36.440]  So regardless of whatever the conversation was that Biden had with the president of Ukraine, I think all of it amounts to nothing more than another demonstration of weakness.
[3:23:36.440 --> 3:23:47.440]  And particularly in terms of the foreign policy of this administration, this current administration that's in there and all the other adversaries that we have like China, like Iran, like North Korea.
[3:23:47.440 --> 3:23:54.440]  Let's just see what these other countries start to do. Let's see what kind of pressures the Chinese start putting on Taiwan.
[3:23:54.440 --> 3:24:02.440]  I can tell you, I watch the Japanese media. I watch the Japanese media on a routine basis, probably every day, if not every couple of days,
[3:24:02.440 --> 3:24:09.440]  to see what their sense is in their country about the Chinese incursions over the Taiwan Straits.
[3:24:09.440 --> 3:24:19.440]  And I'm going to tell you, there's a lot of concern. And I don't feel right now that the Japanese feel like they can count on this administration to stand strong with them.
[3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:31.440]  I know that we have a great military-to-military relationship, but when it comes to the foreign policy, this administration is showing extraordinary weakness.
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:36.440]  And I mean, I just think it's just stupid. I mean, I think it's the foreign policy right now is just stupid.
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:48.440]  When you start to listen to these defense and foreign policy think tanks that in Washington, DC, that want nothing more than the United States to get back into another war or continuing to participate,
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:53.440]  you know, instead of getting in there and fighting and winning and getting out and with clear objectives.
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:58.440]  I mean, I just, I'm very concerned right now. And that's why I felt compelled to write that article.
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:02.440]  Well, it's very important. And I'd like to walk through a few of the points that you mentioned here.
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:12.440]  What do you make of even Republican senators saying things a few months ago like we might have to nuke Russia first, first strikes and other statements like that.
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:18.440]  And then Biden saying a week and a half ago, okay, we don't care if there's a small incursion by Russia.
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:22.440]  The next day saying no, you know, any incursion we may take military action.
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:25.440]  Then the next day saying no, no, we'll never have military action.
[3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:28.440]  NATO threatening to attack them saying no, we'll never do that.
[3:25:28.440 --> 3:25:33.440]  I mean, this seems like the worst policy is to go hot and cold off and on.
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:40.440]  That sounds like how you'd try to start a war to me being an expert on this at the Pentagon level and White House level.
[3:25:40.440 --> 3:25:43.440]  When you look at this, what is this signal to the world?
[3:25:43.440 --> 3:25:45.440]  I mean, is there even any strategy here?
[3:25:45.440 --> 3:25:51.440]  Or is it just a bunch of crazy leftists that have hijacked the country in a stolen election and don't know what they're doing?
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:53.440]  Well, a couple of things.
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:26:05.440]  So first of all, there was some type of leaked communication recently by one of the media outlets and it had to do with Victoria Nuland.
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:10.440]  Victoria Nuland, who's one of our senior State Department directors.
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:19.440]  And it's interesting, we're so much more deeply involved in this Ukrainian issue than most Americans would want.
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:20.440]  That's number one.
[3:26:20.440 --> 3:26:23.440]  I think that people need to know that American people need to know that.
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:30.440]  I would tell you, for all these people that get up and tout all these things that we should do, what I would ask people to do.
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:37.440]  And that's what I really has said or stated was we need to take a deep breath and we need to step back.
[3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:40.440]  And this is where relationships do matter.
[3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:42.440]  It doesn't mean that you have to like somebody.
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:49.440]  It just means that you have to have a relationship with somebody so you can pick up a phone, call them up and you're talking to them on an equal or even a stronger.
[3:26:49.440 --> 3:26:51.440]  Foundation or basis.
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:27:05.440]  And this is why I think where in the case for Donald Trump and I'll go back to his administration because I think he had actually a very sort of man on man or president on president strong relationship with Putin.
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:07.440]  They didn't always agree on everything.
[3:27:07.440 --> 3:27:17.440]  And I can tell you, Trump never gave into him if you just followed along with what kinds of things that the Trump administration did over the time that he was the president when it came to Russian relations.
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:23.440]  But we have to have these types of strong relationships with the leaders of these countries.
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:26.440]  And is it that what the head of the German Navy said when he resigned?
[3:27:26.440 --> 3:27:28.440]  He said, we got to get eye to eye with these people.
[3:27:28.440 --> 3:27:30.440]  That's how we're going to stop wars.
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:31.440]  We got to get real.
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:32.440]  Exactly.
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:35.440]  I mean, it's not just a call to the Ukraine president.
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:36.440]  I mean, they're in the middle.
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:39.440]  This is what why is the president of the United States dealing?
[3:27:39.440 --> 3:27:47.440]  And again, this gets back to having zero relationship or having a relationship where it's one of weakness and you're afraid.
[3:27:47.440 --> 3:27:50.440]  He's afraid to make this call and afraid to see what's going to be said.
[3:27:50.440 --> 3:27:56.440]  And I think that all that we really need to do here is we need to talk.
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:27:57.440]  We need to take a step back.
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:05.440]  We need to see who has the strongest relationship and we need to get involved at that level, not the president of the United States talking to the president of Ukraine.
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:08.440]  Why isn't the president of the United States calling up Putin and saying, hey, look.
[3:28:08.440 --> 3:28:10.440]  You know, we don't want to go here.
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:13.440]  And this is let's figure out how we can move around this.
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:15.440]  But the reason why exactly.
[3:28:15.440 --> 3:28:22.440]  So why would why would Western establishment that's always been engaged with foreign countries, especially superpowers be paralyzed?
[3:28:22.440 --> 3:28:26.440]  Because what you're describing sounds like people that are asleep at the switch.
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:27.440]  Yeah.
[3:28:27.440 --> 3:28:30.440]  Well, the big message to our adversaries is one of weeks.
[3:28:30.440 --> 3:28:32.440]  And it's not just people that are asleep at the switch.
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:43.440]  These are people who who look at foreign policy as a way to enhance their own equities and particularly in this particular administration to distract.
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:47.440]  Because I really do believe the really important parts are coming up.
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:48.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:28:48.440 --> 3:28:49.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:50.440]  This is the M4 war.
[3:28:50.440 --> 3:28:55.440]  The General Flynn interview is now at Band-Aid video.
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:29:00.440]  It's hard to believe January 2022 is all most over.

[3:29:55.440 --> 3:30:00.440]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[3:30:00.440 --> 3:30:02.440]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:07.440]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[3:30:07.440 --> 3:30:08.440]  But we failed.
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:10.440]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:30:10.440 --> 3:30:18.440]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[3:30:18.440 --> 3:30:27.440]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:30:27.440 --> 3:30:30.440]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[3:30:30.440 --> 3:30:32.440]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:30:32.440 --> 3:30:35.440]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[3:30:35.440 --> 3:30:40.440]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[3:31:22.440 --> 3:31:29.440]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[3:31:29.440 --> 3:31:33.440]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different.
[3:31:33.440 --> 3:31:35.440]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:38.440]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:31:38.440 --> 3:31:40.440]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[3:31:40.440 --> 3:31:55.440]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:31:55.440 --> 3:32:04.440]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill and it is the fastest growing market and supplements in the world for good reason.

[3:32:56.440 --> 3:33:06.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:06.440 --> 3:33:18.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:18.440 --> 3:33:22.440]  What you're describing sounds like people that are asleep at the switch.
[3:33:22.440 --> 3:33:28.440]  Yeah. Well, the big message to our adversaries is one of weakness. And it's not just people that are asleep at the switch.
[3:33:28.440 --> 3:33:39.440]  These are people who look at foreign policy as a way to enhance their own equities and particularly in this particular administration to distract.
[3:33:39.440 --> 3:33:46.440]  Because I really do believe that, and I say this, I think maybe I said this at the very beginning, these are people who are masters of distraction.
[3:33:46.440 --> 3:33:52.440]  I mean, the fact that we're up now talking about Ukraine, you know, we're not talking about the lockdowns and the mandates.
[3:33:52.440 --> 3:33:59.440]  We're not talking about that. This is why I'm going to the border today, the Mexican-Texas border, the Mexico-Texas border.
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:03.440]  This is why I'm going down there today to visit it and then have a big rally down there.
[3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:10.440]  And it's because we need to start to look at what's happening domestically and we need to say, really pay attention to it.
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:17.440]  This administration is causing us to look in places where we really don't have huge national security interests.
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:26.440]  And the reason why we are where we are in the Ukraine is because of just incredible weakness and frankly, stupid foreign policy.
[3:34:26.440 --> 3:34:29.440]  And I use that word, you know, just what it means, stupid.
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:35.440]  I mean, these are people who have gotten us into this mess because of all of the things that we have allowed to happen.
[3:34:35.440 --> 3:34:39.440]  And I go back to this business about energy.
[3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:41.440]  Energy is a big deal globally.
[3:34:41.440 --> 3:34:49.440]  And when Russia is providing Germany, I think they're providing like 70% and then the Germans then export that around Europe.
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:53.440]  So they're providing them like 70% of their energy needs right now into Germany.
[3:34:53.440 --> 3:34:57.440]  So, you know, what does Germany have to say about all this stuff in the Ukraine?
[3:34:57.440 --> 3:35:01.440]  I'd be interested and I think we're going to see very little coming out of there.
[3:35:01.440 --> 3:35:06.440]  I think from a military perspective, I think they talked about sending some helmets or something like that.
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:16.440]  I mean, you know, I do not want to get involved in a conflict in the Ukraine because I just don't see the objectives.
[3:35:16.440 --> 3:35:20.440]  I don't see what it is in terms of our national security interests.
[3:35:20.440 --> 3:35:22.440]  I don't think Putin does either, be honest with you.
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:29.440]  I really don't think Putin does, but I think that what we have to do is we have to develop and get better at these relationships.
[3:35:29.440 --> 3:35:30.440]  But we're not going to get it.
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:33.440]  Sadly, we're not going to have an Alex under this administration.
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:35.440]  This administration has blown it.
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:39.440]  Our foreign policy is in a state of shambles right now.
[3:35:39.440 --> 3:35:51.440]  And when we start to, I don't use in my article, the article that was written there, I don't use, I don't talk about nuclear weapons in a very, in a light way.
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:58.440]  I mean, when we talk about the use of nuclear weapons or the capabilities of nuclear weapons, let me tell you something about Russia.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:00.440]  Russia is no lightweight.
[3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:03.440]  Russia and Putin, particularly in the time that he's been in charge.
[3:36:03.440 --> 3:36:09.440]  I mean, he's developed some very sophisticated technology, some sophisticated weaponry.
[3:36:09.440 --> 3:36:12.440]  They have increased their level of readiness and training.
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:16.440]  I mean, they do a lot of annual exercises and we paid very close attention to them.
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:17.440]  And I still do.
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:26.440]  I watch who they're trading with and their relationships with and what kind of technologies they have in their military and their, in their ability to communicate and their cyber capabilities.
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:30.440]  I mean, this is a very, very sophisticated enemy and we cannot take them lightly.
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:40.440]  And frankly, in terms of our military, I pray that our military and our leadership is more focused on fighting and winning our nation's wars, which is what it's designed to do.
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:50.440]  Instead of worrying about what critical race theory is going to be or continuing to shove these, these jabs into the arms of our troops who, who frankly are fighting, are trying to fight that back.
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:53.440]  So I mean, we, we have our priorities, Alex.
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:56.440]  We have our priorities right now, so upside down.
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:08.440]  And we are in a very, very dangerous position here for the United States of America going forward, not only with the Ukraine, but in the Indo-Pacific basin, particularly when it relates to Taiwan.
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:13.440]  And I, and I really, and I know you got listeners in Japan that pay attention to this.
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:14.440]  And I know they'll listen to this.
[3:37:14.440 --> 3:37:16.440]  You know, we stand with Japan.
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:17.440]  We always have stood with Japan.
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:22.440]  And I know the Japanese are very, very concerned about the foreign policy decisions.
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:35.440]  And I, I will go back again to the relationships because I think that the, the compromised people in the White House and the compromised people around this particular president.
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:40.440]  And I mean, you know, within his own family, everybody knows it, Alex.
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:41.440]  Everybody knows it.
[3:37:41.440 --> 3:37:47.440]  You know, if this were Donald Trump Jr. or Eric Trump, oh my God, but since it's Hunter Biden, nobody does anything.
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:48.440]  Nobody says anything.
[3:37:48.440 --> 3:37:52.440]  I mean, I, you know, I listened to Peter Schweitzer the other day talking about some of this stuff.
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:54.440]  It's just more and more things keep coming out.
[3:37:54.440 --> 3:37:56.440]  And so these people are compromised.
[3:37:56.440 --> 3:38:03.440]  They know exactly what's happening because they've been able to infiltrate right inside of our, our decision-making system.
[3:38:03.440 --> 3:38:06.440]  And, and they, they, they're just waiting.
[3:38:06.440 --> 3:38:11.440]  They're just, you know, the, the bait is there and they're about to, you know, they're about to jump all over it.
[3:38:11.440 --> 3:38:16.440]  So absolutely in general, aren't, aren't the big corporations a kind of globalist consortiums.
[3:38:16.440 --> 3:38:22.440]  They're trying to play cutries off against each other to consolidate power and control and, and divert from their biomedical
[3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:25.440]  COVID-19 power grab.
[3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:32.440]  Aren't they playing a dangerous game here because they're just acting like superpowers and weapons and all this is a chessboard or something.
[3:38:32.440 --> 3:38:34.440]  This isn't a chessboard, is it?
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:40.440]  I mean, you described at the end of your article that, hey, folks, all that money, all that money you big hedge fund people have,
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:42.440]  you're not going to be able to even have a bank to keep it in.
[3:38:42.440 --> 3:38:45.440]  You're not going to have electricity if we have a nuclear war.
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:54.440]  Can you spend a few minutes describing how this could kick off because it just seems so historically insane to be on Russia's doorstep,
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:39:01.440]  moving troops in to Russia's theater and then threatening Russia when they mass troops in response to that.
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:03.440]  It just seems like folly to me.
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:05.440]  Here's, here's where I'm at with war.
[3:39:05.440 --> 3:39:06.440]  Okay.
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:07.440]  And this is for everybody.
[3:39:07.440 --> 3:39:10.440]  War is never clean.
[3:39:10.440 --> 3:39:13.440]  When you start talking about going to war,
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:16.440]  it never ends up the way you want it to.
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:18.440]  It's unfair.
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:19.440]  It's very unfair.
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:22.440]  Warfare is not meant to be fair.
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:28.440]  The escalation of activities once you end fighting each other, once you begin the war,
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:32.440]  starts to go into a direction that you never planned for.
[3:39:32.440 --> 3:39:34.440]  I don't care how many options you put on the table.
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:38.440]  I don't care how many options your military has presented.
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:40.440]  It will never go the way you want it to go.
[3:39:40.440 --> 3:39:44.440]  And so you have to be prepared for a range of things.
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:53.440]  And one of these things that you have to be prepared for is this, what a lot of us in my whole world was planning for the worst-case scenario.
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:40:00.440]  And the worst-case scenario in this case, as I started to look at this buildup and this what I call road to war,
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:09.440]  is this movement where you start to talk about nuclear weapons and people that are talking about World War III.
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:14.440]  I mean, this is not going to be some movie, right?
[3:40:14.440 --> 3:40:15.440]  This is real.
[3:40:15.440 --> 3:40:26.440]  And once we start, once we get into something like this, and we begin to impose horrific foreign policy decisions,
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:32.440]  particularly over a military that is not our military, that is not ready in a place like Europe.
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:37.440]  And I think that NATO is not in a place today where they're trained and ready to...
[3:40:37.440 --> 3:40:42.440]  I mean, NATO, we just look at the debacle coming out of Afghanistan with NATO, right?
[3:40:42.440 --> 3:40:45.440]  And not only the United States of America, but also NATO.
[3:40:45.440 --> 3:40:47.440]  So we're in a different place today.
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:50.440]  This is not World War II.
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:52.440]  People always go back and say, well, World War II.
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:58.440]  No, this is a new Russia that they are well trained.
[3:40:58.440 --> 3:40:59.440]  They're ready.
[3:40:59.440 --> 3:41:02.440]  They have a leader who appears to be in charge.
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:05.440]  We are in a different place militarily.
[3:41:05.440 --> 3:41:08.440]  We're in a different place from a foreign policy strategically.
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:10.440]  Europe is in a different place.
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:13.440]  I mean, I think this is a European problem right now.
[3:41:13.440 --> 3:41:15.440]  And I think that Europe needs to step up.
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:18.440]  And they need to start calling to action what they are going to do.
[3:41:18.440 --> 3:41:23.440]  And they may have to get in there with their own people, their own leaders,
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:29.440]  dealing with Putin and starting to have a conversation with what it is that he wants and what he needs.
[3:41:29.440 --> 3:41:31.440]  I mean, Putin doesn't want to go to war.
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:34.440]  Believe me, Putin has enough problems internally to Russia.
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:36.440]  He's got plenty of problems internally to Russia.
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:40.440]  He doesn't need another external war to distract anything.
[3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:44.440]  Maybe the people in the White House need that external distraction.
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:46.440]  And maybe they're trying to lead us toward that.
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:51.440]  And God help us if they are, because the escalation of war can take us to a nuclear exchange.
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:58.440]  And like I said, to all these tech titans and all these corporate leaders out there across our country
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:00.440]  who are dealing with China right now.
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:02.440]  I mean, you better start paying attention.
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:05.440]  Otherwise, we're not going to have a country here in the United States of America
[3:42:05.440 --> 3:42:10.440]  to be able to do the kinds of things that we've always cherished our ability to do.
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:14.440]  Which is to live in a democracy with a capitalistic type system.
[3:42:14.440 --> 3:42:15.440]  That's fine.
[3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:18.440]  A constitutional republic where we have all of our freedoms.
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:24.440]  We're going to lose these things if we end up escalating to a point that is now no longer in our control.
[3:42:24.440 --> 3:42:27.440]  And that's what happens in these large-scale wars.
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:34.440]  Alex and in a World War III scenario, which people in Washington, D.C.,
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:39.440]  people in the legislative branch, some of these senators, some of these members of Congress,
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:43.440]  some of these people in the National Security Council, some of these think tankers,
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:46.440]  they are all like beating the drums like we should be ready to go.
[3:42:46.440 --> 3:42:47.440]  We should go.
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:48.440]  No.
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:49.440]  No.
[3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:50.440]  Take a deep breath, everybody.
[3:42:50.440 --> 3:42:51.440]  Washington, D.C.
[3:42:51.440 --> 3:42:53.440]  How about shutting down for a week?
[3:42:53.440 --> 3:42:56.440]  Arrive as moms.
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:43:02.440]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:06.440]  we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:08.440]  Domestic terrorists.
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:12.440]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:15.440]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:18.440]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:21.440]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[3:43:21.440 --> 3:43:27.440]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps,
[3:43:27.440 --> 3:43:30.440]  the traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:33.440]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:35.440]  So be it.
[3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:37.440]  Make them silence us by force.
[3:43:37.440 --> 3:43:40.440]  This is the final battle of the Information War.
[3:43:40.440 --> 3:43:41.440]  Give now.
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:43.440]  Buy products.
[3:43:43.440 --> 3:43:44.440]  Donate.
[3:43:44.440 --> 3:43:46.440]  Before everything changes.
[3:43:46.440 --> 3:43:49.440]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[3:43:49.440 --> 3:43:50.440]  Victory or death.
[3:43:50.440 --> 3:43:54.440]  Go now to infowarstore.com.
[3:43:54.440 --> 3:44:00.440]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience.
[3:44:00.440 --> 3:44:02.440]  A symbol of slavery.
[3:44:02.440 --> 3:44:10.440]  A symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:16.440]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:24.440]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[3:44:24.440 --> 3:44:32.440]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[3:44:32.440 --> 3:44:36.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[3:44:36.440 --> 3:44:40.440]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:46.440]  Cloud Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:49.440]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[3:44:49.440 --> 3:44:52.440]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[3:44:52.440 --> 3:44:55.440]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[3:44:55.440 --> 3:45:03.440]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:11.440]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:19.440]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[3:45:19.440 --> 3:45:29.440]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[3:45:29.440 --> 3:45:34.440]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[3:45:34.440 --> 3:45:45.440]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:51.440]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[3:45:51.440 --> 3:45:55.440]  Selling out now at infowarstore.com.

[3:46:55.440 --> 3:47:07.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:07.440 --> 3:47:21.440]  In a World War III scenario, which people in Washington, D.C., people in the legislative branch, some of these senators, some of these members of Congress,
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:27.440]  some of these people in the National Security Council, some of these think tankers, they are all beating the drums like,
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:29.440]  we should be ready to go, we should go.
[3:47:29.440 --> 3:47:32.440]  No, no, take a deep breath, everybody.
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:35.440]  Washington, D.C., how about shutting down for a week?
[3:47:35.440 --> 3:47:39.440]  How about shutting down for a month, and let's let cool heads prevail.
[3:47:39.440 --> 3:47:44.440]  I think if you shut down for a week or two, maybe you would come back and go, OK, yeah, things are OK.
[3:47:44.440 --> 3:47:47.440]  And guess what, the rest of this country will be just fine.
[3:47:47.440 --> 3:47:48.440]  Beautifully said.
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:53.440]  General Flynn, I know you in about six, seven minutes have to get on the road to get to McCallum for this big event.
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:55.440]  You've got down there, we're going to have reporters down there as well.
[3:47:55.440 --> 3:48:00.440]  Hell, I may even come down there, but the point is, you talked about what Ukraine is distracting from.
[3:48:00.440 --> 3:48:05.440]  Let's spend a few minutes on that, the central issue of COVID-19.
[3:48:05.440 --> 3:48:13.440]  You're one of the only leaders out there that gets that it's a political weapon of control and fear and economic shutdowns to consolidate power.
[3:48:13.440 --> 3:48:17.440]  Finally, a lot of leaders like Paul and others are talking about the Great Reset.
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:19.440]  They're talking about Klaus Schwab, that other power group.
[3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:22.440]  We talk about China, we talk about Russia, we talk about the U.S.,
[3:48:22.440 --> 3:48:26.440]  but then there's that globalist arm that manipulates all the different groups.
[3:48:26.440 --> 3:48:30.440]  You're an expert on that, you observe that when you are the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:34.440]  without getting into classified aspects of the different power blocks.
[3:48:34.440 --> 3:48:40.440]  Can you explain to us in a nutshell what the globalists are up to and how you think we counter them?
[3:48:40.440 --> 3:48:45.440]  I think just identifying them and exposing the U.N. conglomerate is the way to go.
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:46.440]  What do you think?
[3:48:46.440 --> 3:48:47.440]  Absolutely.
[3:48:47.440 --> 3:48:51.440]  This idea of the Great Reset is not a conspiracy theory.
[3:48:51.440 --> 3:49:00.440]  Klaus Schwab wrote a book about it, so let's not kid ourselves anymore, let's not let the mainstream media box us into a bunch of conspiracy theorists.
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:01.440]  This is very real.
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:11.440]  This whole issue with COVID, so COVID is a real type of disease or whatever you want to call it, but it's treatable.
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:17.440]  I don't want to get into the medical or the science part of it, which has really come out in droves.
[3:49:17.440 --> 3:49:23.440]  This is all about control, and it's controlled by a group of elitists around the world,
[3:49:23.440 --> 3:49:32.440]  and that includes some of these tech titans, some of these corporate titans of the, not only in the United States, but around the world,
[3:49:32.440 --> 3:49:34.440]  and certainly some of these other organizations.
[3:49:34.440 --> 3:49:42.440]  So a couple of organizations, and everybody can go look these up, World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the European Union,
[3:49:42.440 --> 3:49:49.440]  the World Health Organization, which has come into the news quite a bit because of all this COVID stuff and the responses,
[3:49:49.440 --> 3:49:57.440]  but all of these global organizations, the United Nations is another one, all these global organizations, they see themselves,
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:05.440]  and those that are sort of even above them, they see themselves as this is how we can rule the world.
[3:50:05.440 --> 3:50:07.440]  This is how we can control societies.
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:09.440]  This is how we can control humanity.
[3:50:09.440 --> 3:50:15.440]  So let's introduce something called COVID, and they did it, and they did it for a couple of reasons.
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:17.440]  One of the big reasons was to steal an election.
[3:50:17.440 --> 3:50:25.440]  I mean, if the Democrats worked as hard on foreign policy as they worked on stealing the elections, maybe we would be better off.
[3:50:25.440 --> 3:50:35.440]  So there's a lot of things here going on, but yes, these are globalist organizations, these are world organizations,
[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:43.440]  and when you start to look at who is directing them and who is leading them, there are real people behind that.
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:49.440]  I mean, Shraab is one, you've got George Soros, you have the Arabella group.
[3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:57.440]  I mean, these are real things, these are real, led by real people who have placed themselves, Gates is another one,
[3:50:57.440 --> 3:51:03.440]  who have placed themselves above some of these world institutions, and they drive them.
[3:51:03.440 --> 3:51:05.440]  They really do drive them.
[3:51:05.440 --> 3:51:11.440]  So, hey, I'm just a guy out here in the United States of America.
[3:51:11.440 --> 3:51:16.440]  I've been given a great platform just by the people of this country, and I appreciate it very much so.
[3:51:16.440 --> 3:51:18.440]  I get attacked all the day.
[3:51:18.440 --> 3:51:23.440]  I get attacked constantly, Alex, as you know, and that's okay.
[3:51:23.440 --> 3:51:25.440]  I'm going to continue to fight.
[3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:28.440]  I'm going to continue to fight for what I believe are the right things.
[3:51:28.440 --> 3:51:35.440]  And, you know, I mean, we're dealing with an administration that has an open border policy for this country.
[3:51:35.440 --> 3:51:37.440]  An open border policy for this country.
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:45.440]  And we're talking, I mean, so what's been reported by our own government institutions is two and a half million people
[3:51:45.440 --> 3:51:50.440]  illegals have crossed into the country since this administration took over, two and a half million.
[3:51:50.440 --> 3:51:53.440]  That's what's been reported, because that's how many they have tracked.
[3:51:53.440 --> 3:51:57.440]  But there's some that are watching this very closely that I'm in touch with.
[3:51:57.440 --> 3:51:59.440]  And we think it could be double that.
[3:51:59.440 --> 3:52:01.440]  We think it could be double that.
[3:52:01.440 --> 3:52:06.440]  And now they're, you know, now they're sneaking them in like we've seen recently in the last 48, 96 hours.
[3:52:06.440 --> 3:52:10.440]  We've seen recently where they're flying some of these military-age males.
[3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:17.440]  They're flying them below the level, below the screen, into some of these smaller airport hubs around some of these, you know,
[3:52:17.440 --> 3:52:19.440]  out in some of these states and some of these cities.
[3:52:19.440 --> 3:52:21.440]  And this is all known.
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:25.440]  All of these Republican senators, all of these Republican members of the House,
[3:52:25.440 --> 3:52:30.440]  they should be jumping up and down on the Capitol steps and the White House steps and saying,
[3:52:30.440 --> 3:52:31.440]  enough is enough.
[3:52:31.440 --> 3:52:32.440]  We cannot handle this.
[3:52:32.440 --> 3:52:34.440]  This is going to destroy our country.
[3:52:34.440 --> 3:52:38.440]  And that's why we're going down to the border here today and tomorrow to have this rally.
[3:52:38.440 --> 3:52:41.440]  So if you get a chance to come down, Alex, I'd love to see it.
[3:52:41.440 --> 3:52:42.440]  I'd love to have you.
[3:52:42.440 --> 3:52:45.440]  I'd love to get you up there and speak to this crowd of people that we're going to have.
[3:52:45.440 --> 3:52:51.440]  And we need to keep fighting for this and other things in our country, because domestically, we've got massive problems.
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:58.440]  And we don't need to, we don't need all these distractions that I think that this administration is actually attempting to use
[3:52:58.440 --> 3:53:01.440]  to distract from the real problems we're having right here at home.
[3:53:01.440 --> 3:53:02.440]  Well, that's right.
[3:53:02.440 --> 3:53:06.440]  General Flynn.com is the place to find all the great articles and videos and work you're doing.
[3:53:06.440 --> 3:53:07.440]  General Flynn.com.
[3:53:07.440 --> 3:53:16.440]  Looking at Biden, looking at the election coming up in 284 days, I see the new national terrorism directed with the president,
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:21.440]  the open announcement that Trump supporters are terrorists, that people that question lockdowns are terrorists,
[3:53:21.440 --> 3:53:26.440]  that they believe that patriots are about to stage false, or about to stage terror attacks,
[3:53:26.440 --> 3:53:28.440]  which I believe will be false flags.
[3:53:28.440 --> 3:53:33.440]  Looking at the climate and closing general, what do you make of the attempt to take January 6,
[3:53:33.440 --> 3:53:37.440]  which we know is a federally provocative event at many levels.
[3:53:37.440 --> 3:53:41.440]  There were also some useful idiots that got sucked into it, in my view, to now project on that,
[3:53:41.440 --> 3:53:46.440]  no, it's not radical Islam that's the big threat. It's not communist China that's the threat.
[3:53:46.440 --> 3:53:49.440]  It's the American people and patriots that are the threat.
[3:53:49.440 --> 3:53:55.440]  And with straight faces, the CIA has come out and said, oh, we believe a civil war has already begun.
[3:53:55.440 --> 3:53:58.440]  We're going to have to arrest all the leadership.
[3:53:58.440 --> 3:54:02.440]  I mean, this is what a real authoritarian takeover looks like historically.
[3:54:02.440 --> 3:54:06.440]  Can you speak to that with your historic understanding?
[3:54:06.440 --> 3:54:15.440]  Yeah, so in this country, I will tell you that Hezbollah, Hamas, Al Qaeda are all real threats inside of this country
[3:54:15.440 --> 3:54:23.440]  and they're real. And what we just saw in this hostage situation in Texas within the last couple of weeks,
[3:54:23.440 --> 3:54:27.440]  it was very, very real. It wasn't fake. It wasn't a conspiracy theory.
[3:54:27.440 --> 3:54:33.440]  I think that we are going to see, I expect something, again, another distraction.
[3:54:33.440 --> 3:54:42.440]  I really do, I expect, because of what was staged on January 6th and what was staged up in Michigan to kidnap,
[3:54:42.440 --> 3:54:48.440]  the fake kidnapping of the governor up in Michigan, Whitmer, I think we're going to see staged events.
[3:54:48.440 --> 3:54:53.440]  I really do. I mean, I really do think that do not put past this administration,
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:55:05.440]  but they're, you know, they're dogs in some cases that they have access to, do not put it past them to stage something and then declare some type of national emergency
[3:55:05.440 --> 3:55:10.440]  in order to further shut down aspects of our freedoms.
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:16.440]  I mean, I believe that. And I tell that to people and I'm telling it to you and I'm telling it to your audience.
[3:55:16.440 --> 3:55:20.440]  So as we move forward, what we have to be is we have to be above all this.
[3:55:20.440 --> 3:55:26.440]  We have to maintain, like I used to say, you know, to the troops, we have to maintain the moral high ground.
[3:55:26.440 --> 3:55:30.440]  We have to be stronger morally. We have to be stronger ethically.
[3:55:30.440 --> 3:55:35.440]  We have to be, you know, we have to stand ready on our principles and our values and we have to promote those people,
[3:55:35.440 --> 3:55:43.440]  particularly those people that are now getting involved in primaries and in our election systems and in our,
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:51.440]  in stepping up, we have a lot of veterans now, a lot of police. I'm endorsing a lot of police, a lot of veterans now who have never been in politics
[3:55:51.440 --> 3:55:58.440]  for political office, whether it's a state senator, whether it's a county commissioner, whether it's a U.S. senator or a governor.
[3:55:58.440 --> 3:56:04.440]  I mean, a lot of people that are now stepping into the political fray because they're sick and tired of what's happening in the country.
[3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:08.440]  And that's what we need more of. We need more of, you know, sort of, I call it local action.
[3:56:08.440 --> 3:56:13.440]  We'll have a national impact. And I believe that truly. So pay attention, people.
[3:56:13.440 --> 3:56:22.440]  Discover, learn, read, do whatever you got to do and, you know, and follow this great show because Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[3:56:22.440 --> 3:56:28.440]  And I keep saying that to you, Alex, you know, because, I mean, you know it, but God, the beating that you've taken,
[3:56:28.440 --> 3:56:32.440]  and I know the beating that I've taken for the last five years and still do.
[3:56:32.440 --> 3:56:45.440]  I mean, I have been subpoenaed by the, by the, by the, you know, the insurrection commission led by the new punches pilot of this era, you know, Pelosi.
[3:56:45.440 --> 3:56:55.440]  And so, I mean, this is insane. And it's just, it's horrific. And it's costing tens of thousands of dollars for all of us who get subpoenaed because you got to, you know, you got to respond.
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:57:04.440]  Right. So anyway, I just, I really want people to pay attention, maintain the moral high ground, America, and get involved in your communities like you've never been involved before.
[3:57:04.440 --> 3:57:09.440]  So God bless you, Alex, for having me. Thank you for the time. And I hope to see you down on the border in the county.
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:17.440]  Absolutely, General. Since you mentioned this one other point, I'm sure you saw the New Republic, the New York Times, all of them are branding you as somebody that wants violence when you've never done that.
[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:23.440]  They're branding you as the new rebel leader with rebel flags and all this other crap saying, what is your long game?
[3:57:23.440 --> 3:57:29.440]  Please spend a minute or so telling us who you really are, because I know they're attacking you from the low level, the high level.
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:40.440]  They're attacking you from fake rest roots groups. I mean, I've seen the similar attacks on myself, but it's more intense with you because they know you're a very viable leader to really, you know, galvanize Americans to fix this peacefully.
[3:57:40.440 --> 3:57:45.440]  How do you want to respond to the deep state trying to cast you?
[3:57:45.440 --> 3:57:58.440]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[3:57:58.440 --> 3:58:05.440]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[3:58:05.440 --> 3:58:12.440]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[3:58:12.440 --> 3:58:23.440]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:32.440]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[3:58:32.440 --> 3:58:45.440]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[3:59:02.440 --> 3:59:10.440]  Get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[3:59:10.440 --> 3:59:17.440]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[3:59:17.440 --> 3:59:24.440]  That's the survival instinct, but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[3:59:24.440 --> 3:59:29.440]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[3:59:29.440 --> 3:59:36.440]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[3:59:36.440 --> 4:00:03.440]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at InfoWarsStore.com.
