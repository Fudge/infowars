[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[00:25.000 --> 00:41.000]  Well, if you're a long-time listener or viewer, just came across the live feed because you heard it's the verboten transmission,
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  what you're not supposed to look at or what you're not supposed to read or listen to, welcome to the live Sunday Global Broadcast Teleprompter Free.
[00:49.000 --> 00:59.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones from the ATX. It is January 20th, 2019, four o'clock Central Standard Time Blasting out across the MNFM dial television,
[00:59.000 --> 01:07.000]  of course, at infowars.com and newswars.com. There's always themes that come up without even trying to make it the theme.
[01:07.000 --> 01:15.000]  Corporate media puts out their themes, puts out their talking points that they want us to follow, but we tend to go with the themes that just organically show themselves.
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  The themes are today, America, the new socialist frontier, the new place the disease is spreading.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  Once you experience it, you want to get away from it, but you have to experience it first.
[01:26.000 --> 01:38.000]  And hoaxes, corporate mainstream media hoaxes. We had three reporters at the Women's March in D.C. yesterday,
[01:38.000 --> 01:51.000]  and I've just been enthralled by their live footage and by other people's footage. It was like crazed demonic piranhas attacking men, women sexually assaulting men,
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  just flipping out, screaming, yelling. This is divide and conquer tactics.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  And we're going to have Owen Shroyer who just got back today in studio to go over all of that.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  But then you've got the older, quote, Native American man with a whole group of people saying, let's go get them.
[02:10.000 --> 02:21.000]  And then a whole group of Women's March leftist men march over to a group of Catholic school, high schoolers, wearing Make America Great Again hats,
[02:21.000 --> 02:35.000]  get in their face while they taunt and scream at them. And then National News puts it out that a bunch of white racist Catholics got in the way of precious Native Americans just trying to go up the steps.
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  And just like blacks in the 50s being denied access to lunch kitchens and to bathrooms, there were the modern white supremacists.
[02:43.000 --> 02:58.000]  I mean, I've got CBS, all of them, CNN. Only ABC ran a fake headline, but then later admitted, well, actually, you've got the group of Democrats coming across with a couple of guys with drums.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.000]  And at first the students are jumping up and down with it. Like it's a football game having fun. Then they push their way in getting their face.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  And the news goes, look at the smiling face of the white man taunting him, blocking the Native Americans access up the steps.
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  The true sign of white supremacism. And then Twitter and all these other leftist groups came out.
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  Kathy Griffin and said, I want those kids doxxed. I want where they live. I want their heads.
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  Total complete harassment. And it turns out they're all, oh, hi, how are you totally loving like Trump supporters?
[03:31.000 --> 03:42.000]  And here are the leftist going over the raw footage is on info wars.com. It's on news wars.com. We're going to play some of it that would take hours to play all of it.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  But we've got where they say, let's get them. All right. Oh, they're in trouble now. Boom, boom, boom. You march over there are the steps.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  Nobody's blocking the steps. You've got students. They're taking a student photo. You crash into them.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  And then don't worry, the corporate media is there every channel.
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.000]  Did you see that dirty white kid smiling while he was, oh, by the way, they never play audio while he's being called names and being sped at and everything else.
[04:06.000 --> 04:16.000]  He just sits there and takes it and smiles and he's the bad man. If you are standing on a street corner and you're white, you're wearing a red hat.
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  And then here come people over to get in your face. Don't worry, the media is going to edit that to say that you did something bad.
[04:23.000 --> 04:32.000]  This is like saying that England attacked Germany to start World War II. It's just not true.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  But it's the same media groups that put this out when I was in D.C. a few months ago to confront the head of Twitter.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  These women run up and go, your mother's married, your brother, your monkey, your subhuman, white, your piece of filth.
[04:43.000 --> 04:50.000]  And I went, well, you're KKK, Brown KKK. You're racist, Brown KKK. The media edited it from that point on, but we have the raw footage.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  That's the deception of corporate media. They're conscious criminal deceivers.
[04:55.000 --> 05:21.000]  The proof's all on Infowars.com. Get it and spread it.
[05:21.000 --> 05:32.000]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.000]  Infowars Life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[05:39.000 --> 05:54.000]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.

[06:11.000 --> 06:28.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.000 --> 06:41.000]  Sunday, January 20th, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday. And I'm back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, David Knight.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  And of course, it's along with the David Knight Show at 8 a.m. every day at the Infowars Network. Infowars.com for us to our show.
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  We'll be in studio with us in about 30 minutes. I also host the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m. Central.
[06:53.000 --> 07:02.000]  Obviously, there's the big news that Trump has angered his base. Trump has absolutely enraged the Tea Party, enraged nationalists.
[07:02.000 --> 07:13.000]  He said, I'll give you DACA. I'll legalize all these other groups. I'll give pathway to citizenship. People just can't come in, smuggle them with little kids and drugs and weapons.
[07:13.000 --> 07:24.000]  You've got to passport. And the Democrats said, not just no, they said, hell no, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[07:24.000 --> 07:34.000]  That was the main chant that the Soros funded, Islamic run, women's march in D.C. We've got all that footage, a lot of exclusive footage.
[07:34.000 --> 07:43.000]  It took hours and hours to bleep all the cussing from the piranha-like people that had been whipped into a frenzy by the establishment.
[07:43.000 --> 07:53.000]  But Trump did this before.
[07:53.000 --> 08:10.000]  We have a system that is absolutely hell-bent on total and complete divide and conquer. And this is all they ever do.
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.000]  Trump has always, even during the campaign, said, all I want is for people to be vetted and to not have a criminal record.
[08:16.000 --> 08:23.000]  And sure, if you've been there since you were a kid, your parents brought you illegally, we'll legalize you. But we're not going to then let you say you just got here last month,
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  and you've been deported five times, and you're 30 years old, you've got a criminal record, and now you bring your whole family here with chain migration.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  We're not doing that. It's not reasonable. The media always misrepresent what Trump is saying and doing.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  So when he tries something like a partial DACA, the right wing gets bad and says he's sold out on what he said he would do when he never said that.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  And the left wing says, no, we want no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  Trump did this a year and a half ago, remember?
[08:51.000 --> 09:02.000]  He said, okay, I'll give you everything you want on DACA. And they said, no, that's not enough. Now we want completely, totally open borders, period.
[09:02.000 --> 09:13.000]  Just like he did a year ago, almost a year ago, back in February, when they were hyping up the tragic events of Parkland in Florida where the police stood down.
[09:13.000 --> 09:21.000]  That's not been confirmed. And Trump said, okay, told Pelosi and Schumer in a meeting, what do you want? We'll look at anything you want.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  He said, we may not do it, but we'll look at it. The media spun that Trump collapses.
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  Trump gives in and the Democrats came back and said, we want all guns confiscated. We want an abolition of the Second Amendment.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  The New York Times ran the headline, time to repeal.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  So Trump says, okay, I'll compromise with you. What do you want? And they say, the sky's the limit.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  He could say, okay, no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  They say, no, we're not turning the government back on until you resign because they're not there to make deals.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  They're there to get what they want and no one's ever stood up to them.
[09:55.000 --> 10:06.000]  So I'm not even defending Trump on all this, but he's given a very liberal package to just say, can we have a basic border so the smuggling stops and the kidnap kid stops.
[10:06.000 --> 10:15.000]  And the Democrats have said, no, despite the fact the plan he's put forward is a Democratic plan from 10 years ago.
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  And more liberal than what George W. Bush wanted and even what Democrats wanted a few years ago, but they cannot make Trump look reasonable.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  So they're going to keep pressing this period.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  So we've got that report.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  But then let's move on to the fake news that I'll be detailing in great detail coming up the bottom of the hour.
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  Owen Shroyer, Greg Reese and other members of the crew went up for the Women's March this weekend.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  And we have the live video footage, all of it coming to you.
[10:44.000 --> 10:52.000]  For a woman sexually assaults Owen Shroyer, this is the bottom of the hour, the video is about to go live on m4s.com.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  She literally just walks up and grabs him by the genitals and then says, yes, I just sexually assaulted you.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  What are you going to do about it?
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  He could have called the cops over.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  She would have been arrested.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  It's a felony.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  Owen is chivalrous, so he didn't do it.
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  But I talked to him on the phone.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  She grabbed him hard.
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  It hurt.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  Because, oh, Trump grabs women.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  Trump's a rapist, according to them, so she can do it to you because you're wearing a red hat.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  Trump was talking about, like, the Beatles, women throwing themselves or Elvis.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  We have that footage coming up where women are taking their bras off, taking their panties off, rushing up, jumping on you.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  Trump's saying, man, these women, they throw themselves on you.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  They climb on top of you.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  You can do whatever you want.
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.000]  He's saying that clearly.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  And Bill Clinton is the one that's signed off on all these rape cases and made payoffs.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  So the left does this and says, because you're wearing a red hat, I'm going to grab you by the genitals.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  And this woman is so whacked out and so crazy that she says, go tell the cops that Owen doesn't do it.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  Actually, you do that to me, lady.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  I'm going to get your ass arrested because you're a crazy person.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  I don't want my son or my daughter treated like that.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  That's assault.
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.000]  And she grabs him hard by the genitals and she's so entitled that she thinks it's okay.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  This is the crazed nature.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  We also caught all this footage of women running over to men and saying, get the hell out of here.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  This is only for women.
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  Another women's march last week got canceled because they looked at the list and it was too white.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  So this is classic divide and conquer.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  And this is in the WikiLeaks where Hillary's talking to top professors and she says, we're losing control.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  What do we do?
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  And they said, you create racial and cultural division.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  You divide everyone and then you act like you're trying to stop the division.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  It's how the British controlled India.
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.000]  It's called the great game.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  It's absolutely disgusting and sad.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  Now let's talk about another hoax before we get into that more detail because it's so illustrative.
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  You have the Native American coming over with a group marching over saying, let's get them.
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  They march over to a group of high school kids and run in their group and start getting in their face.
[13:03.000 --> 13:11.000]  And then the national news says, oh, these mean kids came and got in the poor Native Americans face when we have all the raw footage on infowars.com.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  Only ABC News admitted actually they marched over and got in their face, but that was buried in the report.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  ABC News's headline said that I've got it right here.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  ABC News said that they basically assaulted them, but here's what's bigger.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  Kathy Griffin of Severed Head fame.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  She, we have her tweets said, go and docks these young people.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  I want them.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  I can't even show this because of TV viewers.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  We have FCC rules.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  I can't show you her tweet.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  Okay, because there's so much cussing, so much threatening.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  And she says, go to their houses, get them.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  She says the reply from the school was pathetic and impotent.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  Name these kids.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  I want names.
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  Shame them.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  If you think these efforts wouldn't docks you in a heartbeat, think again and she goes on and says more.
[13:56.000 --> 14:07.000]  So she wants schoolchildren docks because a bunch of people, a bunch of grown men march over with drums,
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  run into their group or bucking up and calling them names.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  We have to bleep all the cussing.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  The young people just smile at them and they go, look at the arrogant face of the white privileged piece of filth.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  And then they frame them and say that they're bad.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  And it's such powerful footage that some of these kids are like 10 years old.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  And here come these folks beating these drums.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  And at first they're jumping up and down with them.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  They think it's fine until they start insulting them.
[14:36.000 --> 14:45.000]  And that's just arrogant, entitled, you know, leftist, welfare head, anti-white, brainwashed, brown KKK,
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  coming over and getting somebody's face, but then let's shift gears.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  Buzzfeed comes out.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  They're the ones that said there's video of Trump being pee-peed on and fake dossiers.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  Buzzfeed is fake news.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  That's why they don't want us on there to counter their fake news.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  Snopes is fake news.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  Southern Property Law Center is fake news.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  They're famous for it.
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  They said, oh my gosh, Michael Cohen says in testimony, he's a stool pigeon.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  So what he says, that Trump told him to go lie.
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  Well, even if he said that, so what, he's a guy that got caught not paying his taxes,
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  so he doesn't want to go to prison, so he'll say anything.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  He is admittedly a liar, but it's bigger than that.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  Mueller comes out and says it's not true.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  He didn't even say that.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  So Buzzfeed's Trump story, latest in long list of Russia bombshells that weren't,
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  but that's not what's important.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  We have it on good authority.
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  This is totally staged.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  I've had of his report coming out.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  So it makes him look like he's credible that he says this is fake,
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  and they put it out on purpose thinking he had no memory
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  for when he brings out his new disinfo, thinking, well,
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  Mueller said the other stuff was fake.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  So this must be real.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  Another white shoe boy, dirty lawyer tactic.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  Mueller is the lawyer to the mob.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  He's famous out of Boston.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters,
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.000]  The pro pure whole house water filtration system is an advanced four stage compact filtration system
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  that will provide water filtration for your entire home,
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain,

[19:51.000 --> 19:55.680]  to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers. They're cold
[19:55.680 --> 20:03.040]  and failed and feels like being in a tomb. I want life. I want Jesus.
[20:03.040 --> 20:06.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:06.920 --> 20:20.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:20.920 --> 20:26.360]  You know, I told myself about 30 minutes before we went live, I said, I'm going to
[20:26.360 --> 20:31.360]  be real calm, which I can do sometimes and people really like it. They think it's informative
[20:31.360 --> 20:37.040]  and I'm not going to get too upset about this. But then I've got probably 10 hours
[20:37.040 --> 20:44.920]  of preparation yesterday and today for this broadcast and then I should start thinking
[20:44.920 --> 20:48.920]  about every facet and it's hard to not get upset.
[20:48.920 --> 20:54.520]  And then I've got all these other urgent, incredible things happening and if I don't
[20:54.520 --> 21:01.360]  cover some of the things that concern info wars and myself will be shut down.
[21:01.360 --> 21:06.200]  And then when we get shut down, they admit everybody else does. This is true authoritarianism.
[21:06.200 --> 21:14.600]  You know, I told you on Friday, my wife was having surgery on an elbow from tennis injuries.
[21:14.600 --> 21:17.800]  Decades playing tennis couldn't even move her arm anymore. I wasn't really going to come
[21:17.800 --> 21:22.000]  in that day, but I had to come in. She was out of surgery. I had to come up here because
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.960]  I got calls from Washington Post, ABC News, um, that Robert Mueller wants to basically
[21:28.960 --> 21:34.240]  indict me and my dad, all this other stuff for Russian collusion. And I know that's totally
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.720]  fake when they're talking about me. And then they send my lawyer's questions basically
[21:39.720 --> 21:46.400]  saying that and I come on air and tell people and I see this leftist comment brigade saying
[21:46.400 --> 21:52.720]  Jones just wants attention. Jones is just saying this for attention. Yeah, like they
[21:52.720 --> 21:59.080]  shut us down over 100 platforms. They're trying to take our bank accounts away. They have
[21:59.080 --> 22:03.280]  congressional hearings about me everywhere lying where I'm not even invited to speak
[22:03.280 --> 22:09.160]  killing due process. Oh, well, guess what happened on Saturday? The Senate Intelligence
[22:09.160 --> 22:16.560]  Committee subpoenaed us for all the emails from coursing via coursing. And they also
[22:16.560 --> 22:21.240]  want to know everything about quote, dirt we tried to find on Hillary, including her
[22:21.240 --> 22:26.960]  medical issues. Journalism was legal, but the Pentagon papers were legal. Now that's
[22:26.960 --> 22:33.880]  even on CNN as of the next day. So you understand now, like I don't come up here and tell you
[22:33.880 --> 22:40.880]  this stuff. And then I'm just saying it because I'm trying to sound big. I've been under attack
[22:40.880 --> 22:47.080]  for 20 years on air 24 years I've been on air, but 20 years I'm gonna get attacked.
[22:47.080 --> 22:51.000]  They have hearings. We've played the clips, but I don't think listeners understand because
[22:51.000 --> 22:57.420]  I don't spend enough time on it. Understand just how serious this is. So Roger Stone
[22:57.420 --> 23:02.320]  joys the second hour with the most exclusive news ever. They are getting ready to move
[23:02.320 --> 23:08.480]  on Trump. And I'm not saying this about Trump because Mueller's written down my neck. I'm
[23:08.480 --> 23:16.040]  saying it because Trump isn't doing enough to protect himself and others that if Trump
[23:16.040 --> 23:20.400]  won't defend himself, why the hell should I do it? And by the way, I still like Trump
[23:20.400 --> 23:26.240]  way better than Hillary. He's still a good patriot. He's a good man. But man, this new
[23:26.240 --> 23:33.640]  attorney general pick is Robert Mueller's daddy. I mean, he is the guy that worked for
[23:33.640 --> 23:39.520]  George Bush senior at the CIA who brought Mueller in because he was corrupt and known
[23:39.520 --> 23:44.800]  for helping run mob hits in Boston. I mean, reportedly Mueller would do the killing himself.
[23:44.800 --> 23:48.760]  Wadi Bolger was just a cutout half the time. So Mueller's running around killing everybody
[23:48.760 --> 23:53.440]  all over Boston. And then, and then, and then George Robert Walker Bush brings him in through
[23:53.440 --> 24:00.040]  his new AG, who was AG back then, but Trump's new AG, William Barr. And at that point, I'm
[24:00.040 --> 24:06.960]  just like, okay, stick a fork in the country. I mean, if Trump doesn't get that. And by
[24:06.960 --> 24:12.600]  the way, I had a whole theory with Roger last week. I said, maybe these guys say, Hey, we
[24:12.600 --> 24:16.160]  were under globalists before, but the Bushes are out of power. The Clintons are out of
[24:16.160 --> 24:19.440]  power. We were just ordered to do this. We want to make America great again. We don't
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.520]  want one side of deals with China. We realize America is powerful. It has, you know, all
[24:23.520 --> 24:30.240]  this will, even from a sociopathic view, why run America in the ground? So we actually
[24:30.240 --> 24:35.160]  want to join Trump. And I wasn't thinking that. I was just hoping that. And then Trump
[24:35.160 --> 24:43.280]  comes out and says, I had no idea that he literally is Robert Mueller's daddy and that
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.920]  they vacation together and her best friends and their wives and their everything. And
[24:48.920 --> 24:52.840]  Trump said, you know, I was just told he was good and conservative and would get confirmed
[24:52.840 --> 24:58.920]  and isn't a democratic partisan. Trump. It's not Democrats. The neocons, they run the show.
[24:58.920 --> 25:07.320]  They want the power. They want it now. Period. They don't want America to be great. You think
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.160]  the universities and the whole corporate meeting, the whole ecosystem says America was never
[25:11.160 --> 25:15.360]  great. It'll never be great. That was at the women's march this weekend. It's governors.
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.000]  It's Democrats. It's Cortez. It's they're globalists. They're demoralizing and bringing
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.240]  the country down and they're selling it out to whoever will buy it off. And so at this
[25:26.240 --> 25:32.520]  point, it just becomes ridiculous. And I'm only raising the alarm because the move is
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.960]  being made right now. Now again, I don't have time to get into this on radio and TV because
[25:37.960 --> 25:43.320]  we've got hours of it. And we're going to show you, I'm sure being sexually assaulted
[25:43.320 --> 25:48.720]  when we come back from break, he'll be in studio. But media hoax, MSM falsely claims
[25:48.720 --> 25:55.000]  Catholic students harassed Native American. And you've got a group of leftist Hispanics,
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.360]  whites, black guys go, let's go. It's on beep, beep, beep. I've got to bleep all this out.
[26:00.360 --> 26:06.120]  They march across to the group of junior high and high school students who are out there
[26:06.120 --> 26:10.880]  for a prayer march, anti abortion march. It also happened. They weren't even dealing
[26:10.880 --> 26:14.640]  with the women's march. So the leftist march over, it's all raw footage from their own
[26:14.640 --> 26:19.280]  cameras. It's the leftist on cameras. The media got this. They go, let's get them. Oh
[26:19.280 --> 26:24.320]  right. We're coming. We're coming bitches. Bleep, beep, beep, beep. And the literally
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.520]  10 year old kids are like, here come grown men busting in boom, boom. And they don't
[26:28.520 --> 26:34.040]  know what's going on. So they're jumping up and down like it's a football game. And
[26:34.040 --> 26:39.680]  then they start saying, we're going to get you blah, blah, blah. And so all the white
[26:39.680 --> 26:45.040]  kids do, most of them are white is just smile. And the media said, look at these white devils
[26:45.040 --> 26:49.640]  arrogantly who surrounded this poor little Native American man. And they show this crop
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.840]  footage from the point where it's a little Native American guy. Now people coming to
[26:53.840 --> 27:00.560]  basically assault the kids and say, look what they did. Look at how they surrounded him.
[27:00.560 --> 27:06.280]  And every channel in the country is still running it, despite the fact that we have the raw footage
[27:06.280 --> 27:14.520]  of what really happened. And that shows you just how evil this is. I care about Native
[27:14.520 --> 27:21.040]  Americans, man. You go out West or areas they're in. Most are alcoholics on drugs. It's hellish.
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.640]  I'm part Native American. And the way they get used by the system and then bust in to
[27:25.640 --> 27:30.200]  do stuff like this. And the very same news organizations we did reports on this months
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.120]  ago would put out footage where these racist Hispanic women dressed up in Native American
[27:35.120 --> 27:39.800]  outfits. I guess that gets you attention. Go, hey, your mother's married to her brother.
[27:39.800 --> 27:46.760]  You're a subhuman, mongoloid, whites are retarded creatures like the New York Times board member
[27:46.760 --> 27:52.720]  says. And you're just scum, you monkey. And they keep going, monkey, white monkey, white
[27:52.720 --> 27:58.920]  monkey. And so I say, hey, that's really racist. Leave me alone. The media has me doing that
[27:58.920 --> 28:06.880]  saying I just came up to them when they came up to me. The exact same evil formulae. And
[28:06.880 --> 28:09.800]  that's why there is Alex shows the rest of the Native American women. Then they have
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.520]  the edited video. We have the video that's not edited, unedited video of Native American
[28:15.520 --> 28:22.560]  man approaching Catholic school kids. We have that on info wars.com version of the edited
[28:22.560 --> 28:28.880]  version of the kids. And then we have the other footage outrage over viral video of
[28:28.880 --> 28:34.520]  encounter between teens and Native Americans. We have it all there. And it's called the
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.880]  now this that's on Facebook is the group that puts these fake videos out where they have
[28:39.880 --> 28:44.400]  the left come assault people and say horrible racist stuff. And then they say that we're
[28:44.400 --> 28:50.200]  doing it. But all the proofs on info wars.com. In fact, let's add the old videos if we can
[28:50.200 --> 28:54.920]  to that article. What happened a few months ago to me, because it's the exact same formula.
[28:54.920 --> 29:00.760]  We'll be back with Owen Shore being sexually assaulted at the women's March. Words cannot
[29:00.760 --> 29:06.040]  describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. Info wars is being
[29:06.040 --> 29:11.400]  openly targeted by the Democratic Party. Leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.520]  and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[29:15.520 --> 29:20.080]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground. And I knew we had
[29:20.080 --> 29:25.400]  no future. We didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success. But if you will simply
[29:25.400 --> 29:30.520]  realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.360]  the main target. And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles
[29:35.360 --> 29:41.480]  and videos info wars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scum bags
[29:41.480 --> 29:47.000]  will win. We have huge sales and for short.com right now. And we're still able to operate
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.960]  our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[29:54.960 --> 29:59.200]  Soros, the global Spain win. This is info wars darkest hour. We your support. I'm counting

[32:05.280 --> 32:10.440]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[32:10.440 --> 32:17.280]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[32:17.280 --> 32:23.160]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[32:23.160 --> 32:28.560]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[32:28.560 --> 32:34.680]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting chewable tablet
[32:34.680 --> 32:40.240]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[32:40.240 --> 32:45.280]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking
[32:45.280 --> 32:50.680]  the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[32:50.680 --> 32:56.480]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to info wars life.com and
[32:56.480 --> 33:21.960]  grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[33:31.760 --> 33:35.880]  Well he's the host of the war room, 3 p.m. central weekdays right after I get off air.
[33:35.880 --> 33:41.240]  He's Owen Schreuer, the cut slayer. So he and the crew went up to the women's march
[33:41.240 --> 33:46.400]  yesterday in D.C. and they covered that and we're about to premiere eight and a half minutes
[33:46.400 --> 33:51.080]  of this segment and the next. A video that took a lot of time to bleep out and blurt out
[33:51.080 --> 33:57.120]  for TV viewers all the birds and all the cussing and all the you know cuss words on the signs.
[33:57.120 --> 34:00.320]  And when you look at the shift understand there's hours more. It's not like we're even
[34:00.320 --> 34:09.840]  cherry picking this but most incredible is Trump famously in a private tape on a 14
[34:09.840 --> 34:13.520]  years ago or whatever said women throw themselves on me. They climb on top of me. You could
[34:13.520 --> 34:20.840]  do anything you can grab him by the. You can say that word on air pussy, pussy cat whatever.
[34:20.840 --> 34:24.480]  And then they said oh my god that's an admission of rape. No that's not Bill Clinton settling
[34:24.480 --> 34:28.640]  rape cases. That's Elvis Presley having women throw their panties at him and jump on top
[34:28.640 --> 34:33.360]  of him on stage. Trump's saying my god they jump on top of you. They come on to you. You
[34:33.360 --> 34:38.240]  can do anything you want. It means women are throwing themselves at you. Okay we're showing
[34:38.240 --> 34:42.080]  footage for TV viewers of Elvis and women trying to kiss him and they'll throw their panties
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.760]  at him or anything else. This isn't rape. This is when people get excited and they have
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.920]  free will and you know and it's a much cute him kissing kids whatever. Okay so there's
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.360]  famous footage of the Beatles having panties thrown at him. So this woman walks over and
[34:55.360 --> 35:02.240]  grabs Owen by the genitals and it says go ahead call the police on me. Go ahead do it
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.520]  and then we'll show the rest of it and this is just our footage. We have hours of this
[35:06.520 --> 35:11.760]  and others people have videos just frothing evil and then the Native American group marching
[35:11.760 --> 35:17.520]  over to the little kids some of them age 10 running into them basically assaulting them
[35:17.520 --> 35:21.680]  in the raw footage and that turns into evil white kids that are mean to Native Americans
[35:21.680 --> 35:27.600]  Owen. Well Alex this is all again hyped up by the mainstream media that's dividing us.
[35:27.600 --> 35:31.880]  They're the ones that drive these people to madness and insanity. It's mass mental illness
[35:31.880 --> 35:34.720]  is what we're dealing with that these women's marches. I've been to three women's marches.
[35:34.720 --> 35:38.880]  I've been to every single one. I was at the women's march in 2017. I got assaulted. I
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.720]  got hit in the face. That's on tape. I went to the women's march in 2018. I was spit on
[35:43.720 --> 35:49.480]  punched everything in between. That's on tape and then this year I go I get literally grabbed
[35:49.480 --> 35:52.400]  in the genitals and the whole crowd's laughing and pointing at me and you know it's kind
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.720]  of sick almost in a way Alex that I almost really don't even care and I'm not surprised
[35:57.720 --> 36:01.840]  at this point. You know what I'm saying like just kind of reflecting on it and you were
[36:01.840 --> 36:05.720]  saying because they're not about the morals. It's all about their fake high ground to assault
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.840]  us. And you were saying before that and this is my only regret from the weekend and quite
[36:10.840 --> 36:14.440]  frankly this is just how dedicated I am to getting this footage that I don't even think
[36:14.440 --> 36:17.720]  about actually falling through it but with having this woman arrested. But the cops were
[36:17.720 --> 36:23.360]  literally five feet from that incident. Probably five cops saw the whole thing and heard her
[36:23.360 --> 36:27.800]  saying that just like they saw it in 2018 when the guy spit on me multiple times just
[36:27.800 --> 36:31.920]  like the cops saw it in 2017. I was there when we're trying to get into Trump's inauguration
[36:31.920 --> 36:36.360]  and the Antioch was beating everyone up including women and the police did nothing. Because the
[36:36.360 --> 36:42.040]  left is God. They can do this. And then if you want to get into the more cultural issue
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.240]  with these women saying they're so oppressed oh it's so bad for them well you just came
[36:46.240 --> 36:49.720]  up to me and admitted you sexually assaulted me in public and the whole crowd laughed about
[36:49.720 --> 36:53.920]  it and the cops did nothing. And they're fighting to get into the country because we're all
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.800]  a bunch of whims and roll over to it. That's what's happening. America is a giant chump
[36:57.800 --> 37:02.720]  operation where we put up with this. Let's start playing the audio and video here and
[37:02.720 --> 37:05.880]  then we'll stop and start as we go. Here is the sexual assault.
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.120]  So if our president can grab a woman by the pussy I can grab you by the bra. She just
[37:11.120 --> 37:16.000]  grabbed my dick. Is that sexual assault? No. Bye. Is that sexual assault? Yes. So you
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.440]  just sexually assaulted me. I did assault you. So you'd be arrested? Arrest me. I'm
[37:19.440 --> 37:23.160]  not going to arrest you. They're police officers right here. So look at this. Women have so
[37:23.160 --> 37:29.160]  much privilege. She can sexually assault me and get away with it. And she nods her head.
[37:29.160 --> 37:37.560]  It's just total error. Let's continue. This is Owen Schreuer for the Bernie Sanders 2020
[37:37.560 --> 37:44.440]  Coalition and I'm live at the Women's March in Washington DC. Hey, pause real quick.
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.880]  Back in five seconds. I know why you did that. A bunch of reporters couldn't get in if they
[37:49.880 --> 37:53.880]  were known conservatives and so you had to wear a Bernie hat and not put your flag on
[37:53.880 --> 37:57.640]  till you got through the police or they wouldn't let you even march down the road claiming
[37:57.640 --> 38:00.960]  the whole city was a free speech zone for the left. Well, and this was more an issue
[38:00.960 --> 38:04.000]  that I knew I wouldn't even be able to talk to some of these people if I had a Trump hat
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.640]  on because as soon as I put, as soon as I take the Bernie hat off and the Trump hat on,
[38:07.640 --> 38:12.360]  it's game over, it's hatred, it's screaming, it's yelling. And so it was really to just
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.080]  show the dichotomy. So let's go back to it and then what happens when you put it on
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.200]  the Trump hat? I mean, immediately as soon as I put the Trump hat, you'll see in this
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.840]  video, here we go, leave the crowds upset. Excuse me, sir, what brought you out here
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.200]  today? I'm here for the march. Just here for the march. What do you think needs to be done
[38:28.200 --> 38:32.320]  about Trump colluding with Russia? I think we need to be fully investigated. Robert Mueller
[38:32.320 --> 38:37.000]  has got to finish it. So here's the sign. It's very clever. Investigate Trump's ties
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.960]  and then there's ties. Why do you think Trump should be impeached, ma'am? Well, where can
[38:41.960 --> 38:52.920]  I begin? Just about everything he's done since he's been inaugurated. Like criminal justice
[38:52.920 --> 38:56.960]  reform, so blacks don't get triple the time in jail that Hillary signed on saying their
[38:56.960 --> 39:02.920]  animals, their dogs, take them to heal their super predators, or legalizing hemp for production
[39:02.920 --> 39:09.400]  of incredible industrial compounds, or trying to pull us out all these wars. Yeah, the Democrats,
[39:09.400 --> 39:14.280]  they don't want that on one. You always hear this talking point, but the economy had the
[39:14.280 --> 39:18.360]  stock market had record losses last year. Well, no, if you look at the stock market under
[39:18.360 --> 39:22.840]  Trump, it had record, record gain. It doubled and we lost half of it because the private
[39:22.840 --> 39:25.560]  fellow reserve tried to spike him. And of course, that's just what happens with the
[39:25.560 --> 39:28.480]  stock market injury. Eventually kind of balance. Sure. But the point is they've been rooting
[39:28.480 --> 39:46.880]  for it to plunge. Let's go back. Here it is. And now he dawns on his head. Make America
[39:46.880 --> 39:59.560]  better. Hey, can anybody tell me why Trump should be impeached? Can anybody tell me why
[39:59.560 --> 40:05.960]  President Trump should be impeached? Any volunteers? Any volunteers? One reason why Trump should
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.480]  be impeached? Can you tell me why Trump should be impeached? Because he's incompetent, because
[40:10.480 --> 40:16.240]  he's anti-woman. Is America great? Hit pause again. Back in the, oh, I love this guy saying
[40:16.240 --> 40:20.920]  it was never great white boy because I've learned with Democrats, you say America's coming
[40:20.920 --> 40:24.960]  back, we're getting jobs. They go, ooh, their enemy is America. It's not just some minority
[40:24.960 --> 40:31.440]  group of leftist or communist. It's the main line group. But notice she says he's hurting
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.480]  women. The radical Islam is what the left love. It's all they're bringing in. Linda
[40:35.480 --> 40:39.720]  Sorcerer, whose mother writes books about genital mutilation and, you know, making women wear
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.360]  burkas. And Sorcerer says, make women wear burkas in Iran. Women shouldn't rebel against
[40:44.360 --> 40:49.280]  the government. These are literal authoritarians and they're sitting there with these women
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.520]  saying Trump is anti-woman when he's appointed more women than he president ever combined.
[40:53.520 --> 40:59.920]  Let's go back to these idiots. He's incompetent, because he's anti-woman. Is America great?
[40:59.920 --> 41:07.200]  When was that white boy? It's fake news, everybody. It's fake news. The fake news media. It's
[41:07.200 --> 41:15.320]  a fake news media. We're not fake. We're showing you. We can make units. We can make units.
[41:15.320 --> 41:18.800]  So you assume that Trump is a misogynist, so you're out here marching. President Trump
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.400]  has appointed more women. You've got Alexander Cortez saying we're going to pull trains on
[41:23.400 --> 41:28.040]  Republicans, gang rape him. You've got the man running up saying America was never great.
[41:28.040 --> 41:31.160]  Won't be great. You've got women saying we're going to chop your testicles off. A woman
[41:31.160 --> 41:36.640]  just sexually assaulted you. This is a crazed mob of demons. Continue. So you're out here
[41:36.640 --> 41:41.000]  marching. President Trump has appointed more women to his administration than any president
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.920]  in U.S. history. He also has assaulted. Who is he assaulted? He's probably assaulted a
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.360]  lot of women. But probably now it's probably? I'm not saying he has assaulted a lot of women.
[41:50.360 --> 41:56.600]  We know that. Who are women? He's grabbed a lot of women. Donald Trump has said things
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.040]  that are like fostering this rape culture that we're talking about and that are oppressive
[42:01.040 --> 42:06.600]  to grab them by the pussy. Like I think grabbing by the pussy was a huge thing.
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.440]  I mean, that's, that's a horrible statement. And I'm sure you don't endorse that statement
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.080]  as an intellectual being. I mean, the guy's having a conversation and talking. Yeah, I
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.600]  don't endorse the statement, but it's really a minor issue. A minor. I don't. I think,
[42:19.600 --> 42:23.480]  I think the instance in itself could be considered a minor pause right here. We're going to come
[42:23.480 --> 42:27.000]  back where this is where he's saying this woman comes over and assaults Owen, but it's
[42:27.000 --> 42:33.080]  okay because she's a woman. She's a God again. I actually defend Trump on this was even brought
[42:33.080 --> 42:37.600]  up in my custody battle for my kids like Jones offense rape. No, he says women are throwing
[42:37.600 --> 42:43.080]  themselves on you. They let you do anything you can. Yeah, that's kind of his old, old
[42:43.080 --> 42:48.240]  man type deal. Yeah, dude, when a woman jumps on top of you, they're ready to go. In fact,
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.880]  there's a while, but it's like that Gillette commercial shows a guy waving a girl. They
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.440]  go, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't talk to a girl. That's rape. But if you're a Muslim and put
[42:56.440 --> 43:05.080]  them in a slave pit, then it's liberal. CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural,

[43:37.040 --> 43:41.440]  but not the bad attributes. People wonder why I've gotten into CBD oil. Well, because
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.480]  some of the stuff's got problems. Some of it can get you high and some of it can get
[43:45.480 --> 43:51.800]  you arrested. This is not that legal in all 50 States. It's from hemp, not marijuana.

[46:24.880 --> 46:29.640]  I am patient zero in the mass of banning, but you can override the sensors now and if
[46:29.640 --> 46:35.200]  all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together. We've
[46:35.200 --> 46:41.280]  already changed the world together with our laser focus. Do it again with hashtag Alex
[46:41.280 --> 46:45.960]  Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere. Call and talk radio,
[46:45.960 --> 46:51.600]  c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones. That's the rallying cry to restore
[46:51.600 --> 47:03.520]  the First Amendment. Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[47:03.520 --> 47:20.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.280 --> 47:26.280]  So George Soros, the admitted in his own words on 60 Minutes Nazi collaborator, funded the
[47:26.280 --> 47:32.520]  first women's march. The day after Trump got inaugurated, 2017, on January 21, we were
[47:32.520 --> 47:41.040]  there covering it. He spent $84 million just to get women out there marching to brand it
[47:41.040 --> 47:46.880]  that if you're pro-Trump, you're anti-women. And then Trump talks about when he was a TV
[47:46.880 --> 47:50.240]  star, women throwing themselves on him and how he could do anything he wanted. That's
[47:50.240 --> 47:51.240]  the statement.
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.480]  But then a woman comes over and grabs our reporter hard by the genitals. If you're not, if you're
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.000]  a radio listener, you can't see it for Somalcast. There's police right there. And I grabbed
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.080]  it on. I said, you should have called the police. I guess we have the raw footage. This
[48:03.080 --> 48:08.400]  is an edit. He goes over and they say, we're not doing anything. He just won't. So that's
[48:08.400 --> 48:13.160]  why she laughed and why she smiled. Because because literally cops are right there and
[48:13.160 --> 48:16.520]  there's cops. There's cops right there in the footage. And there's cops right in front
[48:16.520 --> 48:20.840]  of us that I'm looking at saying, are you going to do anything? They do nothing. So
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.680]  the headline is feminists now allowed to sexually assault men. And the leftist little little
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.800]  little punk guy, he's laughing. This is funny. He was just like, Oh my God, Trump's grabbing
[48:31.800 --> 48:36.960]  all the women, even though it's not true. Then they turn this into now we're going to assault
[48:36.960 --> 48:41.120]  you. So so back it up and let's play for the point we're at. Back it up, please. Where
[48:41.120 --> 48:44.760]  we were. Okay, because we've got Roger Stone come up with huge, inclusive news as well.
[48:44.760 --> 48:50.680]  But start rolling this because it gets more insane. Here we go. I think I think the instance
[48:50.680 --> 48:59.800]  in itself could be considered a minor issue. Now he's celebrating. She did it. Sexual assault.
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.560]  Is that sexual assault? Yes. Back in the 20 seconds, just saying you they let you grab
[49:04.560 --> 49:10.160]  them by the whatever because they're so into you. That's rape. He soaps. But now when she
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.560]  grabs you right in front of him, he starts laughing and celebrating total disconnect
[49:15.560 --> 49:26.240]  with reality. So play it again. She just grabbed my dick. Is that sexual assault? Is that sexual
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.360]  assault? Yes. So you just sexually assaulted me. Do you be arrested? Arrest me. I'm not
[49:31.360 --> 49:34.800]  going to arrest you. They're police officers right here. But so look at this women have
[49:34.800 --> 49:39.040]  so much privilege. She can sexually assault me and get away with it. Is she nods her head
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.280]  to her? I get arrested. I just told you if you want to go ahead, they're a police right
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.760]  here. This is blue city corruption. You're the one that walks up and grabbed my crotch.
[49:47.760 --> 49:51.760]  Yeah, because it pause again. Oh, and if you would have grabbed her like you'd want to
[49:51.760 --> 49:56.320]  grab that demonic pig, if you'd have grabbed her, they would have slammed you down, rammed
[49:56.320 --> 50:00.240]  your head in and national news would have not showed her grabbing you just like the
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.880]  fake Native Americans slamming into 10 year old and 12 year old and 14 year old kids and
[50:04.880 --> 50:09.600]  attacking them and get and ramming into them and they did nothing and then they assaulted
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.520]  the Native Americans. Same thing. In fact, they may edit this and say you assaulted her
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.960]  even though you didn't touch her. Well, and that's why I know I have to show total restraint
[50:17.960 --> 50:22.400]  when I'm out there and I basically have disciplined myself to be that way. And that's quite frankly
[50:22.400 --> 50:25.520]  why I probably didn't press forward to have her arrested and make a bigger scene of this
[50:25.520 --> 50:28.480]  like I should have. I really should have had her arrested. I should have made a national
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.880]  news story of this. But we already know the news story. The news story is that these really
[50:32.880 --> 50:36.240]  at the base of this Alex, these this is mass mental illness. We're talking about she's
[50:36.240 --> 50:42.040]  literally grabbing your genitals and saying you go you're above me. She says yes, I'm
[50:42.040 --> 50:47.800]  allowed to but then they're here. But then saying women jump on me. I can do anything
[50:47.800 --> 50:53.320]  I want. That's evil. That's rape. But her actually sexually assaulting you is good.
[50:53.320 --> 50:56.920]  I don't know, Alex. I don't know how you how what else did we need to reopen the mental
[50:56.920 --> 51:01.840]  institutions and do the next 2020 women's march. Just march them right in. You know
[51:01.840 --> 51:06.200]  what I'm saying? By the way, folks, there's hours of this post at info wars.com. I can't
[51:06.200 --> 51:11.920]  even track it all. It's like we're not just cherry and it's led by a radical Islamic woman
[51:11.920 --> 51:16.160]  that says women should be made to wear burqas in the Middle East and should be suppressed
[51:16.160 --> 51:22.680]  by men. Linda Sorcer literally says look it up that women should not rebel against Islamic
[51:22.680 --> 51:27.840]  regimes. They should wear burqas and have their genitals cut off. I mean, this is fourth
[51:27.840 --> 51:33.840]  wave feminism is just psychotic evil. Here. Let's play more. Here it is. I don't know.
[51:33.840 --> 51:39.120]  I'm not complaining. You're the one that walked up and grabbed my crotch. Yeah, because I'm
[51:39.120 --> 51:45.600]  fighting for equality here. So women can grab by the fucking plus even I'm gonna grab you
[51:45.600 --> 51:51.760]  by the balls. Do you think has sexually assaulted more women than any other president in the
[51:51.760 --> 51:55.920]  history of the United Bill Clinton? Bill Clinton has sexually assaulted more. Yeah, he settled
[51:55.920 --> 52:05.800]  multiple rape cases. Really? His wife, huh? He sexually assaults his wife. Wow. So you
[52:05.800 --> 52:11.760]  guys still haven't named one woman Trump is assaulted. That's what what are you talking
[52:11.760 --> 52:17.680]  about? Have you ever seen the photos of him with his daughter? Have you seen the videos
[52:17.680 --> 52:26.320]  of Joe Biden groping children? Yeah, no. Are you real? What's that? Are you real? Are you
[52:26.320 --> 52:30.440]  real? What are you doing? This is sad women that couldn't get man. I mean, I'm sorry.
[52:30.440 --> 52:35.840]  I want them in power. All right, go ahead and try. They all look like mental patients.
[52:35.840 --> 52:41.040]  They are. They ought to be. Yeah. So so info wars is known to, you know, spread a lot of
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.360]  misinformation. Do you think that's the best way to kind of go ahead and what are a couple
[52:45.360 --> 52:50.520]  of examples? I mean, it's just kind of known that Alex Jones, give us some examples. Alex
[52:50.520 --> 52:55.760]  Jones. I mean, every day in the show pushes false. Can you give me an example, please?
[52:55.760 --> 53:02.480]  He pushes. Yes. Sandy Hook. You are a white man. You are a white man until you know. I'm
[53:02.480 --> 53:10.520]  not done. It was it was again. It's literally like KKK land where they're always your wife
[53:10.520 --> 53:13.680]  shut up. You're going down, including one. You're like, you're not even against them
[53:13.680 --> 53:18.560]  because they're brown. And it's like, what the hell happened to you? Well, and again,
[53:18.560 --> 53:22.960]  the reason why I mean, you can walk out all day and talk to these people on a Bernie hat
[53:22.960 --> 53:27.240]  and they'll say the exact same crap. You know, but as soon as you put on a Trump hat, it's
[53:27.240 --> 53:32.200]  the hatred. Here's what again, Alex, it illustrates how these people are. Whatever it is about
[53:32.200 --> 53:37.080]  the imagery or the thought of it, it drives the demons out of these people. These are
[53:37.080 --> 53:41.840]  demonic possessed souls. They are mentally deranged people. This is a national emergency.
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.480]  This is a national crisis. How many tell you this footage where they had an event called
[53:46.480 --> 53:51.680]  the lies of Alex Jones that I wasn't invited to. They shut down downtown for it. I show
[53:51.680 --> 53:58.040]  up and people began literally going, we're going to rape kids and going, and like the
[53:58.040 --> 54:02.760]  crowd was like, I mean, I was like, what? There's footage of this. We're just, I mean,
[54:02.760 --> 54:07.200]  imagine the crowd is going rape children, rape children now in America. And they're
[54:07.200 --> 54:12.200]  screaming rape rape children. This is like a demonic invasion force. Every time these
[54:12.200 --> 54:16.320]  people meet up and I think, I mean, I forgot since they put the footage up. I mean, we
[54:16.320 --> 54:22.080]  have them literally saying I'm going to F children and the crowd going F children. Remember
[54:22.080 --> 54:27.080]  the Ted Cruz guy that takes the sign and like screams like a demon. And he's like, I mean,
[54:27.080 --> 54:31.760]  these people are in the footage where the guy goes, I'm going to F kids and the other
[54:31.760 --> 54:36.720]  people start screaming, F kids, F kids, F kids, F kids. I mean, Alex, we have hours
[54:36.720 --> 54:40.160]  of this footage from yesterday and we'll have hours more as soon as there's a next event
[54:40.160 --> 54:41.160]  that these people have.
[54:41.160 --> 54:44.360]  And it's all because they hate Trump and it's all because they're mentally ill. That's
[54:44.360 --> 54:50.040]  what it all comes down to. And it's in the mass media is one of the reasons it's maybe
[54:50.040 --> 54:54.240]  the biggest reason. But that is why Trump calls them the entity of the people. That
[54:54.240 --> 54:58.920]  is why I agree. But let's go back because I forgot about the Austin event last year.
[54:58.920 --> 55:02.200]  Do you guys, I saw the video. Do you have the audio bleep? Because those are the bleep
[55:02.200 --> 55:06.480]  version where the dude runs up in a painter's office. They're talking about sex with kids
[55:06.480 --> 55:09.720]  and trying to lick my face. And then I looked at the crowd and some of them had their tongues
[55:09.720 --> 55:15.200]  out going, and it's like, we have it on footage. It's like, what? What? Is this like an alien
[55:15.200 --> 55:22.360]  invasion or something? I mean, how do you get crowds? We hate Jesus. And we have the
[55:22.360 --> 55:24.480]  footage of the other rallies when they do this.
[55:24.480 --> 55:27.720]  Yeah, there was an event here in Austin where they were tearing down a Confederate statue.
[55:27.720 --> 55:33.480]  I just went to report on it and a bunch of guys started chanting death to America. Okay.
[55:33.480 --> 55:37.480]  So let's, let's figure out what is wrong with these people. They have a mass mental illness.
[55:37.480 --> 55:40.480]  Alex, that's what this comes down to. I don't know if you guys have the foot. Yeah, but
[55:40.480 --> 55:45.360]  what's the, why is it the same spirit? Kill kids, kill America, kill babies. We hate families.
[55:45.360 --> 55:49.880]  That's the propaganda. That's propaganda. They're fed. So, so they'll just buy anything,
[55:49.880 --> 55:51.880]  but that's the transmission. Yes, whatever.
[55:51.880 --> 55:55.240]  By the way, folks, I've heard this before. If you think I'm joking, I have footage of
[55:55.240 --> 55:59.400]  women saying, hell, Satan killed my babies all over Austin. I have footage of people
[55:59.400 --> 56:03.960]  licking my face saying, I'm going to screw kids. I mean, it is the most crazy and we're
[56:03.960 --> 56:07.760]  putting it on TV right now. You're a viewer. I mean, and then I looked at the crowd and
[56:07.760 --> 56:13.120]  they were all half of them had their thumbs up. Like, I mean, I'm in some type of interdimensional
[56:13.120 --> 56:17.600]  vortex. I forgot. He actually hit you in the genitals too. Yes, he did grab my. So, so
[56:17.600 --> 56:21.280]  that was the same thing. So I went to this deal. The lady grabs me in the, someone threw
[56:21.280 --> 56:28.160]  rotting feces on me after this. I forgot about that. I know you can't even, it's like, like,
[56:28.160 --> 56:32.000]  I know that, I know that Greg was just going through all the footage and he's just, and
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.280]  he's just going through. It's like, oh my gosh, like, I forgot how crazy that moment
[56:35.280 --> 56:38.240]  was. Oh my gosh. I forgot about that. I mean, I'm going to my head. We haven't even seen
[56:38.240 --> 56:42.760]  half the crap from, from yesterday. Yeah, there he is, grabs my balls right there.
[56:42.760 --> 56:45.800]  That's what I forgot. Cheers. It's the same thing. Just like at the women's market. The
[56:45.800 --> 56:48.720]  police are like, well, sir, he's allowed to grab your balls. I mean, literally, like,
[56:48.720 --> 56:52.640]  you know, I know Alex, it's the same. It's the same thing. If you ever seen the movie,
[56:52.640 --> 56:56.280]  he's wearing a painter outfit, grabbing your balls, saying rape children. What's wrong
[56:56.280 --> 57:02.400]  with that? I mean, come on, man. You don't, you don't hit Arnie from what's eating Gilbert
[57:02.400 --> 57:05.280]  Grape. You just don't hit Arnie. That's why these people never get arrested. He also
[57:05.280 --> 57:10.040]  slapped me in the face. These are great. He hit me. He basically slapped my testicles,
[57:10.040 --> 57:15.280]  slapped me in the face and then talked about screwing kids. And the crowd's like, yeah.
[57:15.280 --> 57:25.280]  But these are men. The gate is almost open. Look at her. She goes, we eat children. Look
[57:25.280 --> 57:38.640]  at this footage right here. Oh my God, we'll come back and play the rest of it. I'm telling

[59:53.480 --> 59:57.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.520 --> 1:00:06.920]  Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery. I had my guitar on my back. When a stranger stopped
[1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:16.160]  beside me in an antique Cadillac. He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow eyed. He
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:23.640]  said it's a long walk to Nashville. Would you like to ride, son? Waging war on corruption.
[1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:31.280]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. I've been to
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:35.640]  over the years hundreds of Democratic party events and rallies and I challenge people
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:40.720]  that are Democrat voters who don't go to these rallies, go to them and witness it because
[1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:44.720]  it's getting worse and worse. They're like crazed demons. And you were just reminding
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:48.560]  me how a guy came up and slapped me in the face and slapped me in the genitals. A woman
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:53.560]  did this to you yesterday in DC. But since we're ranting here, let's finish the footage.
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:57.280]  It's all wrong in full wars.com. Here's what happened to Owen Troyer yesterday at the Women's
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:12.800]  March funded by George Soros, the Nazi collaborator. Here it is. I don't think anyone disagrees
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:28.640]  with that. Why does me wearing this hat have anything to do with that? It represents hate.
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:46.000]  Why does everyone hate me for being a white male? It seems like she had a bit of a shock
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:02:01.680]  over her reactions. I think it's about the state. Since I came up with that, I want
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:05.520]  that died in slavery. I mean, it's just like, it's like, oh, they hate us, Alex.
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:08.080]  The media has made these people. They've turned minorities into racists.
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.960]  He's going to jail? It's just about the time. For what? For all the stupid stuff he's doing.
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:17.120]  So you say that it was Barack Obama that's responsible for the great economic growth?
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:22.960]  Uh, yeah. Even though Obama specifically said that it's impossible to do unless you have a magic wand?
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:28.160]  No, that's not true. That's not true at all. He had a big stack of all the regulations,
[1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:32.560]  and he literally cut it. So he got rid of all these regulations. So the coal plants and the coal mines.
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:35.120]  But now they've announced they're bringing them back. So the factory's reopened.
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.640]  The manufacturing industry skyrocketed. He did all that in a year. He did all that in a year.
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:43.920]  Yeah. He did all that in a year. Yes. How did he do all that in a year?
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:47.840]  I told you, he got rid of all the regulations at the EPA. That was one thing he did.
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:53.680]  He didn't do it. He didn't do that in a year. He didn't do that in a year.
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:59.760]  But he did. But he did. Okay. Why? Why?
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:07.840]  Oh, I forgot about this woman. Oh my God. He's a pussy grabbing thief. Have you ever had a wife
[1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:14.000]  who's had somebody touch her? Because that's who you fucking voted for. He's a pussy grabbing president.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.040]  By the way, no one wants these women. Did you watch the video?
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:21.760]  They don't have women. Let's not insult women. These aren't women. Like this or like this.
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:24.480]  I mean, this is the West where women are treated the best. They're acting like...
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:28.000]  You know who I am? I'm a woman. That's here to tell you...
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.600]  Like they got some gold mine we want.
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:33.120] ...that might rise in your weakness...
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:34.080]  You look pretty hateful.
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:36.560] ...that you are a teeny tiny...
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:37.520]  Exactly. You're the...
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:39.200]  The job of the hutch shows up over here with...
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:39.680]  Idiot.
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.200]  Oh, that's so loving of you.
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:45.040]  Isn't it? Isn't it? Can I explain it to you? You piece of shit that went...
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:48.160]  You're an aversion. I think we can win up.
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:49.440]  You should have been afforded.
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:52.400]  You gotta love the weird little beta males they bring up.
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:54.720]  I mean, like, this is... This guy was raised by mommy.
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:57.200]  Thank you.
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:58.160]  That's nice.
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:03:59.680]  Thank you.
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:02.160]  The United States, it's terrible.
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:03.280]  Like, then why are you here?
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:05.200]  Because I was born here.
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:06.720]  Look, it's so bad. Why don't you leave?
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:08.960]  Because I'm not old enough?
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.280]  You're a fucking piece of shit.
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:14.400]  I'm not hearing it. I'm not hearing it. One more time.
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:14.800]  What is it?
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:16.720]  So you admit you're a hater?
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:18.800]  Oh, yeah. I admit it.
[1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:19.920]  Yeah, you guys are all haters.
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:20.880]  Yeah.
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:24.000]  Let's be honest. These people are all mutants.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.240]  I think that's what's happened with the toxins and everything.
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:27.680]  These people are all mutants.
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:28.640]  Not gonna be me, but...
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.240]  Or they're just NPCs here for our ultimate challenge.
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.560]  All right. Roger Stone's coming up with Bombshell Info.
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:37.680]  Oh, and you'll be covering this all tomorrow with me on the regular weekday show.
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:38.480]  The morning show, everything.
[1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:41.440]  Great job going into that cesspit of brain damage.
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:42.560]  I really feel sorry for these people.
[1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:44.960]  And I'm sorry you got sexually assaulted by that arrogant woman,
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:45.760]  but that's gonna be the new meme.
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:47.440]  We're like, yeah, I'm allowed to assault you.
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:48.240]  I'm a royalty.
[1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:49.520]  Yeah, let's blast that out.
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.200]  You're the new underclass. You're a male, a white,
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:52.720]  no, you're the lowest form of crap.
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:05:19.120]  I'll be back. Stay with us.
[1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:24.720]  Plus require DHA and EPA.
[1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:55.520]  Now available at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:07.120]  You are listening to an infowarstore.com frontline report.
[1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:13.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:28.080]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide.
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:29.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:38.320]  So I repeat again, the center from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:40.720]  On the intel committee, let me ask you one final question.
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:41.920]  Can you look right into the camera and say,
[1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:45.520]  I know for a fact that the government of Vladimir Putin was behind the hacks
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:46.320]  of John Podesta's email.
[1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:49.840]  Absolutely. The government of Vladimir Putin was behind the hacks of our institution
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:51.600]  and the dumping of information.
[1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:55.040]  Not only in the United States, but also in Europe.
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:56.560]  Okay, you're not, you know what, you're done.
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:06:59.360]  And Tucker, look and say, I know they did.
[1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:00.560]  John Podesta's email, they hacked us.
[1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:02.960]  And I think that Ronald Reagan will be rolling over spray.
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.240]  Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan.
[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:06.000]  You're carrying water for the Kremlin.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.440]  I'm not carrying water for the Kremlin.
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:10.400]  You're making, you're a sitting member of Congress on the intel committee,
[1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:12.160]  and you can't say they hacked.
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:14.800]  You're going to, you're going to have to move your shoulder to our team,
[1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:17.440]  Russian television, because this is perfect.
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:20.800]  That's just so beneath your office because it's so dumb and you're being
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:21.360]  duplicitous.
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:23.680]  I'm asking you, did they hack Podesta's emails?
[1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:24.720]  You can't say it.
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:26.720]  Look in the camera and say they hacked John Podesta's emails.
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.560]  We know for a fact that Putin's government did that.
[1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:32.560]  You can't and you know you can't and you're hiding behind weasel words.
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:37.040]  Russia attacked our democracy this past election.
[1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:41.760]  And then they showed up to his Trump tower, offered the evidence to his family.
[1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:42.560]  They received it.
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:44.800]  They didn't, they didn't turn it down.
[1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:47.360]  Donald Trump for years had been working with the Russians.
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:50.160]  He brought people on his campaign who had ties to the Russians.
[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:55.040]  We have seen a candidate and a president who has spoken in very flattering ways
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:56.240]  about Vladimir Putin.
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:59.280]  All of the arrows continue to point to a personal, political, and financial
[1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:01.760]  relationship that Donald Trump had with the Russians.
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:05.120]  You're peddling the narrative that the Trump administration is putting out,
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:09.680]  which also is the Putin narrative because they're retweeting this with their Russian
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:10.080]  bots.
[1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:14.560]  This, if you're on the same side as WikiLeaks and Putin, if you're on the
[1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:18.800]  same side as WikiLeaks and Putin, you should take a step back and wonder,
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:20.000]  who's bidding are you really doing?
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:28.240]  So that was almost two years ago, those clips of Rand Paul and others stuck across
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:30.720]  and accusing Russian agents for saying, where's the proof?
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:35.760]  And now two years into the fake investigation, we're sitting here asking,
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:36.720]  where's the Russia gate?
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:38.720]  No one's been charged with Russia connections.
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:39.520]  There is nothing.
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:44.560]  But then we learned this week, as I told you on Friday, it broke on CNN yesterday,
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:50.880]  on Saturday, Alex Jones subpoenaed via Jerome Corsi by the Senate Intelligence
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:55.520]  Committee, wanting to know about my communications with WikiLeaks.
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:59.840]  There are no communications other than, hey, give us information, which everybody
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:01.280]  else was asking for.
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:04.320]  So what is Robert Mueller really planning?
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:09.520]  Who is this new attorney general who is literally a CIA from George Herbert
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:10.080]  Walker Bush?
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:11.840]  Is Trump done?
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:12.800]  Is he completely surrounded?
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:15.120]  I've got to be honest with you, folks, I support Trump.
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:16.400]  I like what he's doing.
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:21.280]  But at the same time, just watching this insane witch hunt that never ends and
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:27.120]  then getting ABC news and the Washington Post calling me the whole last week saying,
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:32.160]  oh, you paid hush money to a reporter to work for you, and I've been working with
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:36.560]  for over 15 years, to like stop the WikiLeaks secret coming out.
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:42.400]  It's like getting calls saying, we heard you ride unicorns on Mars with Chinese
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:44.640]  Easter bunnies.
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:47.200]  But they mean business.
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:48.800]  This is their plan.
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:50.240]  This is what they're doing.
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:55.520]  And then you pull back and all these Republicans and Democrats have one thing
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:57.120]  in common.
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:00.720]  They're the traders on the Chinese and Russian payroll for uranium one and
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:05.760]  weapons deals, and they're so pissed that populist nationalists got a president
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:08.800]  in who got rid of the lobbyists and tried to actually build the country.
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.960]  We're going to go to Roger Stone, who I normally tell, hey, Roger, I don't want
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.080]  to get into Russiagate.
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:17.120]  It's all fake for two years, but now it's coming to a head.
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:23.920]  And now they're trying to implicate not just me, but my father as an obvious
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:25.520]  threat.
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:30.240]  And they're threatening to go after Dr. Jerome Corsi's son, I guess, to get him
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:31.600]  to say stuff.
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:33.360]  I mean, this is so desperate.
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:35.120]  This is so ridiculous.
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:36.480]  This is so over the top.
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:41.280]  And here's what I'm getting down to.
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:48.320]  What I'm getting down to is, if Americans continue to put up with this, we
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:50.080]  deserve what we're getting.
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:55.680]  And the way the president has been gelded politically to let these people run
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:02.320]  rough shot with Rosenstein and then McCabe lying to Congress and them trying
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:03.520]  to do a coup against him.
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:08.160]  And then again, they bring in their buddy again, this individual that worked
[1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:14.080]  for George Herbert Walker Bush and was his attorney general, there's no end to
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:17.360]  what these people will try with William Barr and the rest of it.
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:21.760]  So it makes somebody really at a certain point not lose faith because
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:25.280]  nationalism is exploding worldwide, populism is exploding worldwide.
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:26.960]  A lot of great exciting things are happening.
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:31.760]  But at the same time, Trump is not the nationalist patriot movement.
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:33.680]  He's a good guy who wrote in on it.
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:36.880]  But he wrote in on this storm that pushed these waves.
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:41.120]  We have to understand that if he falters or if he's got mental problems or
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:44.480]  whatever it could be, that he's going to let them lie to him and do this.
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:47.680]  We need to start moving on and saying, hey, we're not about Trump.
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:48.560]  We're about the message.
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:53.120]  Because if he abandons himself, if he abandons us, if he does things like this,
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:56.320]  at a certain point, we got a Fisher cut bait, Roger Stone.
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:01.280]  Well, Alex, the president has said numerous times that he understands the movement
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:06.880]  is bigger than him, that this isn't about him, but that he represents a radical
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:11.120]  change in direction from the two party duopoly that was driving us towards
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:15.840]  globalism and who was deeply in bed with the Chinese communists, as you have pointed out here
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:17.200]  again and again.
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:22.240]  But we're also entering a new phase of this that is unlike anything we've seen before.
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:27.280]  I've been furiously counter punching for two years against this phony narrative,
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:31.280]  what I call the Russian collusion delusion.
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:38.400]  But now Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, BuzzFeed, you name it, they no longer feel any evidence
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:41.920]  or proof or collaboration is necessary.
[1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:47.200]  They can just say, Trump is Putin's puppet, despite the fact that he's selling offensive
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:50.080]  weapons to the Ukrainians that the Russians object to.
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:13:01.360]  It is really extraordinary to see the fake news meme that was really only coming from
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:07.440]  partisan Democrats like the shiftless Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell two years ago,
[1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:12.080]  and John McCain, the late John McCain, now being adopted wholesale by the mainstream
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:14.000]  media, Russia, Russia, Russia.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:15.680]  The American people are tired of it.
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:19.440]  There is no evidence, there is no proof, there is no collaboration.
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:25.600]  But you see, unless their articles of impeachment are wrapped around a Russian canard,
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:28.640]  they can't read, they can't get rid of Mike Pence.
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:29.840]  And that's really their goal.
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:31.840]  It's not just to remove Donald Trump.
[1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:36.960]  It's also to remove the vice president clearing the way for Nancy Pelosi to become
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:37.760]  president.
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:43.280]  She would then appoint Hillary Clinton as vice president, then Pelosi would resign,
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:46.640]  and Hillary would get that thing, which eluded her in 2016.
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:48.320]  Well, let's be clear.
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:54.160]  It's Trump's maverick nature never being an office before that allowed him to go around
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:57.200]  the system because they were ready to fight somebody that was from the system.
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:00.160]  He was able to outsmart him because he wasn't from the system.
[1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:03.120]  The fact that he wasn't even trying to outsmart him is why he beat him.
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:04.320]  They didn't know what they were dealing with.
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:06.560]  They thought it was a traditional threat.
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:08.480]  Somebody that just wanted swamp control.
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.480]  Someone that wasn't actually trying to fix the country.
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:14.080]  But now that they've got him dialed in, they've got him surrounded by yes men that lie to him.
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:16.320]  And they're moving against him.
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:18.080]  They're censoring out all his supporters.
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:22.240]  And now they're threatening everybody under the sun that Trump's about to go down.
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:23.280]  I get the calls.
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:24.080]  I've confirmed it.
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:26.960]  Military, CIA, government everywhere.
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:29.200]  They're saying by March, they plan to move on Trump.
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:33.120]  And he's just sitting there, not realizing what he's seeing.
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:34.640]  And then, you know, you see the article.
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:41.440]  Trump was shocked. He couldn't believe that this new individual that they've got at Justice
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:49.040]  Department, who they've gotten him to nominate, he can't believe that William Barr is the best
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:51.600]  friends with Mueller.
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:57.360]  So it's a giant, sick joke of swamp creatures who are careening towards destruction,
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:01.920]  who think they're going to have some leftist civil war in America and defeat us.
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:04.000]  I don't want to go to the civil war.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.600]  But it's just insane because it's insane that Trump doesn't know what's going on.
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:11.520]  It's insane what they're doing.
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:12.400]  It's just crazy.
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:16.880]  Well, Alex, you could have knocked me over when you sent me that CNN story.
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:19.680]  How could the president not know William Barr's pedigree?
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:22.480]  It's in my book, The Bush Crime Family.
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:25.520]  He is a deep stator down to his underwear.
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:32.080]  He and his wife, pardon me, his wife is in the same Bible study group as Mr. Mueller.
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.480]  Mr. Mueller attended two of Mr. Barr's daughter's weddings.
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:38.240]  These guys are intimates.
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:43.200]  It makes sense because Barr was attorney general under George H.W. Bush when Robert
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.520]  Mueller was the FBI director.
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:48.960]  So why, what reason do we believe that he's-
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:55.440]  The Democrats during the confirmation hearing were having orgasms on front of me on television.
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:56.400]  They couldn't believe it.
[1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:01.680]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from info wars.com,
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:04.240]  when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:08.960]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:13.280]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying,
[1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:17.200]  that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:17.680]  world.
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:22.240]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:23.680]  You are the info war.
[1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:27.360]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:32.720]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:36.400]  So there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos,
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.280]  articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:44.880]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:47.280]  to tell people about the local state since you're listening to.
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:54.320]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:57.440]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:00.800]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:03.520]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:09.280]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:13.040]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:17.280]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:21.280]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:25.920]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now.
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:31.520]  And if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:35.520]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:41.520]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:45.920]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:51.920]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:57.920]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:01.520]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:03.280]  Introducing pollen block.
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:08.640]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:14.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:20.080]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:24.080]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:28.080]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later,
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:32.080]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:35.080]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:39.080]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:42.080]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.080]  by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:49.080]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:18:49.080 --> 1:18:52.080]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:57.080]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:18:57.080 --> 1:19:01.080]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding. There is no set stasis.
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:04.080]  There is no managed system. There is no uncontenual.
[1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:07.080]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:11.080]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:13.080]  We won't just be here 100 years. We'll be here forever.
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:16.080]  We'll turn the whole thing around. Our grandchildren on Mars bases
[1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:20.080]  and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back and say,
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:24.080]  we struggled here. We made it. And that's really where this goes.
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:26.080]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:29.080]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:33.080]  and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:36.080]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and ready to build things
[1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:38.080]  and are also ready to fight.
[1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:41.080]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:43.080]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:47.080]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:51.080]  I want to go to the next level. I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:55.080]  Not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[1:19:55.080 --> 1:20:09.080]  I want life. I want Jesus.
[1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:44.080]  That's how it comes down.
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:49.080]  You know, I serve justice in the human species and a better world.
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:54.080]  And I look at the white shoe boys in the corrupt constellation of rogue government in D.C.
[1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:59.080]  that has bipartisanly hijacked our government and I see Third World written all over it.
[1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:03.080]  Why can't Mexico? Why can't Guatemala? Why can't Venezuela?
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:07.080]  Why can't any of these countries ever get out of where they're at?
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:14.080]  Because their security services sometime in the last 56 years went where the security services?
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:17.080]  We can overthrow the president or the prime minister.
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:23.080]  We can install ourselves and then steal the money and all get palaces in Switzerland.
[1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:27.080]  I mean, you go back 50, 60 years ago.
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:32.080]  Venezuela per capita average citizen made more money than a U.S. citizen.
[1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:37.080]  It was an old saying going back over 100 years ago as rich as an Argentine.
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:42.080]  Now it's as poor as an Argentine because they've got security services.
[1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:48.080]  And so they figure out these lawyers, not the average FBI, but these lawyers.
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:51.080]  Hey, we're the domestic police. We're the domestic feds.
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:54.080]  We can let crime go that we want and get paid off.
[1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:58.080]  And we can go after people haven't done anything when we want.
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:00.080]  I found a quote today. I meant to send the crew.
[1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:07.080]  I'll pull up on my phone of Chuck E. Schumer in the Washington Times and New York Times over a decade ago.
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:10.080]  Hardly that was that when Obama first got in and he said,
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:13.080]  we're going to use the IRS to persecute Republicans.
[1:22:13.080 --> 1:22:19.080]  And they persecuted over 30,000 Republican groups and Christian groups and gun groups
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:27.080]  and audited them or arrested them or wouldn't give them 501C345 exemptions
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:30.080]  and got a lot of them to roll over politically.
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:32.080]  But you think about that statement.
[1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:35.080]  And so when Republicans didn't send them to jail for using the IRS,
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:40.080]  tens of thousands of times worse than, I mean, Nixon had a list and a safe.
[1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:42.080]  He was planning to use the IRS on of 100-something people.
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:49.080]  This was 30-something thousand groups harassed for political purposes and MSNBC saying,
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:52.080]  like six years ago, yeah, we went after Republicans.
[1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:57.080]  We went after Christians and conservatives because you deserve it because you're racist.
[1:22:57.080 --> 1:22:59.080]  Yeah, we use the IRS on your ass.
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:06.080]  Imagine if ABC News back in 1974 said, yeah, Nixon used the IRS on people.
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:08.080]  They deserve it.
[1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:11.080]  But Nixon didn't even do that.
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:14.080]  Gun groups, veteran groups, Christian children's charities.
[1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:16.080]  And then they didn't do anything about that.
[1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:19.080]  So why not now shut everybody down and have censorship?
[1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:23.080]  Why not go ahead now and start arresting the press?
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:28.080]  Because it always says censor, arrest, imprison, execute.
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:30.080]  You know, that's how it goes.
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:33.080]  And people say, well, the left says, hey, well, this is great.
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:35.080]  No, that's where all the prosperity goes at the window.
[1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:38.080]  But our own tech giants and our own elite are all sold out to China,
[1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:43.080]  where they do stuff far worse than Hitler ever did in magnitude.
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:44.080]  And so they're doing it.
[1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:45.080]  America has cancer.
[1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:48.080]  There's an excellent article out today from The Hill.
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:49.080]  It's posted on infowars.com.
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:51.080]  America, the new socialist frontier.
[1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:53.080]  I'm going to read part of it last segment with Roger Stone.
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:57.080]  But Roger, we get to the weeds here about Russiagate and all this.
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:01.080]  But as we've talked, probably three, four hours, the last few days,
[1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:03.080]  the deep state is making its move.
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:07.080]  The censorship, the behind the scenes threats, everything that's going on.
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:09.080]  The emplacement, it's clear.
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:11.080]  The bellwether is there.
[1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:12.080]  We know which way the wind's blowing.
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:13.080]  They're making their move.
[1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:16.080]  Yeah, they said they'd make their move in December of 2017,
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:17.080]  and they did other stuff.
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:21.080]  But now they're really making their move with the economy
[1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:27.080]  and with the disinfo and with everything and with the race war preparations.
[1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:29.080]  A, do you agree with that?
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:30.080]  B, you disagree?
[1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:34.080]  And then C, what do we do to get the president to awaken and stop this?
[1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:36.080]  Because this is it, folks.
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:38.080]  It's happening.
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:40.080]  Well, Alex, I do agree with it.
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:42.080]  I think we're, this is the end of times.
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.080]  We are entering the final phase of this effort.
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:50.080]  Therefore, they must feel that the level of shadow banning and internet censorship
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:55.080]  is adequate to cut off our communications when they make their move.
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:00.080]  And you have seen the level of hysteria ramp up just in the last week.
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:05.080]  The buzz feed phenomena where you had a lynch party.
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:12.080]  You had congressmen like King Castro calling for the president's impeachment
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:15.080]  on the basis of a tabloid news organization.
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:17.080]  It turned out to be wrong about everything.
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:20.080]  Shows you how hair triggered this whole thing is.
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:22.080]  So I think they're going to make their move here.
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:24.080]  They no longer need evidence.
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:27.080]  All they need is the ability to whip up hysteria.
[1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:29.080]  I said it here several months ago.
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:31.080]  I want to reiterate it.
[1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:33.080]  Kavanaugh was the dress rehearsal.
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:34.080]  Kavanaugh was the dry run.
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:36.080]  They were testing the system.
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:39.080]  And they came within one vote of defeating and destroying a man
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:44.080]  on the basis of nothing, zero, nada, a completely false narrative.
[1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:47.080]  Now they want to do the same thing to Donald Trump,
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:49.080]  but their plan is even more insane.
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:51.080]  And Ginsburg being on death's doorstep,
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:55.080]  the grim reaper sharpening his, his, his, his sickle
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:25:57.080]  is only triggering them into high gear.
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:00.080]  That plus the strong economy,
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:03.080]  which is why they have been undermining the economy
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:06.080]  through the manipulations of the Federal Reserve
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:09.080]  to create the backdrop for an impeachment.
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:11.080]  They did the exact same thing to Nixon.
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:13.080]  I'm sorry, but I've seen this movie.
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:14.080]  I was there.
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:17.080]  I had a front row seat, although I was a much younger man.
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:19.080]  And therefore I've seen this.
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:22.080]  Here's the only difference between now and 1974.
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:27.080]  Info wars and a cross section of alternative media organizations
[1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:29.080]  that will bring you the truth about what's going on.
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:30.080]  And I want to stop right there.
[1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:32.080]  Why they're so desperate to shut us down.
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:34.080]  I want to stop right there.
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:36.080]  I want to tell radio affiliate listeners, TV viewers
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:38.080]  and people that are on info wars.com
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:40.080]  who are the most hardcore people that get it.
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:42.080]  This is the time to hit your whole email list.
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:44.080]  This is the time to hit everything on Facebook, Twitter,
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:45.080]  even if you get banned.
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:49.080]  This is the time to call Congress call C span and say info wars.com
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:51.080]  forbidden information because we've got massive traffic,
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:53.080]  but we're the early warning system for this.
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:55.080]  You've got to get the articles in the videos
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:58.080]  and this live feed will post later archived
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:01.080]  of the plan to take down Trump revealed they're doing it.
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:05.080]  And as Roger shed, they believe now they have banned
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:07.080]  thousands of prominent accounts,
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:10.080]  hundreds of thousands of medium sized accounts,
[1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:12.080]  millions of small accounts.
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:14.080]  Everyone I know, I mean, I know family that sends
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:17.080]  like a pro Christian tweet with an American flag
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:19.080]  and it gets banned.
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:22.080]  We have video undercover of them saying at the New York Times
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:24.080]  we work with YouTube, we see American flags
[1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:27.080]  or pro Alex Jones, we take it down, F these people.
[1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:29.080]  You've seen the marches, what they're saying.
[1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:31.080]  So they're making their move.
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:34.080]  Now is the time to take everything we do
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:37.080]  and magnify it and get it out because this is the push.
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:38.080]  It's happening now.
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:40.080]  Roger, what do you think the time table is?
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:44.080]  I was told by let's just say folks that acted like they were
[1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:45.080]  my friends.
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:47.080]  I really knew they weren't and I understood what was going on,
[1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:49.080]  but I got a lot of information that only confirmed
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:51.080]  what I already knew back when they thought Trump might win.
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:54.080]  These people hedge their bets, but I've had the folks
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:57.080]  out of Florida and some of the people CIA and other agencies
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:00.080]  kind of call it the last few months back in October
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:03.080]  and say, Trump will be gone by March.
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:05.080]  And so we'll see you then hope you're on the right side.
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:06.080]  Take care of your family.
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:08.080]  Total death threat.
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:09.080]  Great.
[1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:12.080]  All that doesn't make me steal myself a steal against you,
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:14.080]  but we're going to come back from break.
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:16.080]  What does Trump need to do?
[1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:17.080]  What do we need to do?
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:20.080]  Because if you understand, I wouldn't stand up and do this
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:22.080]  as I said a thousand times.
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:24.080]  If the globalists just wanted to run things,
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:26.080]  they want to run it in the ground.
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:28.080]  They want to sexualize your children.
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:31.080]  They're promoting pedophilia, devil worship everywhere.
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:35.080]  And so listen, there's no way in hell
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:37.080]  that I'm ever going to back down or sell out.
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:40.080]  I'm just mad because the average American is so asleep
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:42.080]  it doesn't realize how epic this is.
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:43.080]  They're not more upset.
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:46.080]  And so I'm literally running through my head
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:47.080]  from a lot of scenarios.
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:51.080]  I mean, tell folks what as a man I've been thinking about.
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:56.080]  It's time to realize we're 1776, part two.
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:27.080]  We need to be able to keep up the pace.

[1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.080]  and put it together with our own four years
[1:31:02.080 --> 1:31:05.080]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:07.080]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:08.080]  to detoxify the body.
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:10.080]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:13.080]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:14.080]  It's made in the USA.
[1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:17.080]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:20.080]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:21.080]  and it supports the info war.
[1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:23.080]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:31:23.080 --> 1:31:26.080]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:28.080]  for over a year and now we believe
[1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:30.080]  we have come as close to perfection
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:33.080]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:05.080]  can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico
[1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:07.080]  where the Chiapas farmers have spent years

[1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:12.080]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques

[1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:27.080]  of the land to generate the world's finest coffee bean.
[1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:30.080]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:32.080]  used in big agricultural productions

[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:37.080]  All right, listen to me very carefully listeners.
[1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:39.080]  Because the last few weeks I've been thinking about
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.080]  making this announcement and I haven't done it yet
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:45.080]  because I don't want to be premature.
[1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:50.080]  But I was just thinking before I went live
[1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:52.080]  about two minutes ago during the break
[1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:54.080]  that I don't want to be taken off air
[1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:56.080]  before I give you this warning.
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:58.080]  Not once you understand something right now
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:01.080]  and get it through your head 100%.
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:03.080]  We already sent the bat signal out.
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:05.080]  We already got Trump elected.
[1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:08.080]  You see nationalism exploding everywhere worldwide.
[1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:09.080]  But anybody that doesn't understand
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:12.080]  that there's going to not going to be a globalist counter-offensive
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:16.080]  to that is blind.
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:19.080]  And I can tell you right now for sure,
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:21.080]  they've made a lot of preparations.
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:23.080]  We told you about them spying on Trump
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.080]  and the martial law plans and all that's in the news.
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:31.080]  I'm here to tell you, they may pull back,
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:36.080]  but currently intellectually and gut level,
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:38.080]  they're already in motion.
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:40.080]  The switch has already been flipped
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:43.080]  and a year in politics in life is like a millisecond.
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:46.080]  So a month or two is like a twinkling of an eye.
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:51.080]  The switch has been flipped to not just take Trump out.
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:52.080]  A lot of folks go, well, you know,
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:53.080]  Trump's been great or whatever,
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:57.080]  but what do I worry about?
[1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:00.080]  They were going to have Hillary, captain,
[1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:02.080]  race war, sex war, division,
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:05.080]  economic collapse and then organize us
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:08.080]  and make everybody capitulate to get their pension funds back
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:10.080]  in their 401Ks to agree to whatever they said.
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:12.080]  Federalization of every city,
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:13.080]  every police department,
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:16.080]  every union, the strong cities initiative,
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:18.080]  run by the UN, the chai comms funding
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:19.080]  and all of the universities.
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:21.080]  This is decades of preparation
[1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:23.080]  and traitorous activity.
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:29.080]  So understand, America is on its last legs right now.
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:31.080]  Trump was a speed bump.
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:32.080]  I was even reading this great article
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:34.080]  out of the London Center on the Hill,
[1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:36.080]  America, the New Socialist Frontier,
[1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:39.080]  and they say that Trump was just someone
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:41.080]  that they say slowed it down.
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:43.080]  I was talking to Roger yesterday, I said,
[1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:46.080]  Trump's been a speed hump and that's it.
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:51.080]  So notice all the quote socialist women elected
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:54.080]  and it's all over the news, meet the, you know,
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:56.080]  here it is, opinion, but where are the furies,
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:58.080]  President Trump?
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:00.080]  And it's like, look at these incredible women,
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:04.080]  meth mouth crews and these others marching together
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:06.080]  and it's all that women, oh,
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:08.080]  we're about to take America over and all this crap.
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:09.080]  Nothing to do with women.
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:11.080]  It's just cold blooded social engineering.
[1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:14.080]  And so they plan to overthrow Trump
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:18.080]  and then put America into a civil war.
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:20.080]  See, we're trying to stop a civil war.
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:22.080]  They're saying, yeah, we want your kids.
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:24.080]  Yeah, we want your guns.
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:26.080]  They're trying to push us into it
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:28.080]  and give us no choice.
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:30.080]  So Roger, I'll get your take on this
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:32.080]  as a seasoned political analyst,
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:34.080]  but I know you've been involved in nine campaigns,
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:36.080]  four or five administrations.
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:38.080]  I don't think you disagree with me
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:40.080]  about how dire our straights are right now.
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:41.080]  And I can tell you right now,
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:43.080]  the trigger's already been pulled.
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:45.080]  There's no putting the bullet back in the barrel
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:47.080]  and the bullet's about to leave the barrel
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:50.080]  and then it's going to traverse its trajectory
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:51.080]  right into our head.
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:53.080]  But if we metaphysically understand that
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:55.080]  and move out of the way,
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:36:57.080]  we at least have some chance, but it's on.
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:36:58.080]  Trump doesn't get it.
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:36:59.080]  He doesn't understand.
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:01.080]  He thought he'd turn the economy on.
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:02.080]  He'd let black folks out of prison
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:04.080]  that the Democrats put in there.
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:06.080]  He thought he'd pull us out of these wars
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:08.080]  and the Democrats would like it.
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:10.080]  They never cared about wars.
[1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:12.080]  They just liked to bitch and act like peaceniks.
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:13.080]  They love wars.
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:15.080]  So he's going around at JFK.
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:17.080]  In fact, I'd say Donald Trump's already dead.
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:18.080]  I predict he'll be dead.
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:20.080]  In fact, they're not going to leave him walking around.
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:23.080]  I think he'll be dead by March 15th.
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:25.080]  It's already been decided to kill the president.
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:27.080]  Once they get the new attorney general in,
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:28.080]  he's dead in a door now.
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.080]  What do we do to stop that?
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:30.080]  Or is there any hope for him?
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:32.080]  In fact, let's just say he's dead already.
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:34.080]  What do we do for our children?
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:35.080]  Trump's dead.
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:36.080]  No, no, no.
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:37.080]  He's dead already.
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:38.080]  So he's dead already.
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:39.080]  What do we do?
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:40.080]  No, just admit it.
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:41.080]  He's dead.
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:42.080]  He's gone.
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:43.080]  It's over.
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:44.080]  He's dead.
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:45.080]  So what do we do?
[1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:46.080]  Trump's dead.
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:47.080]  He's dead.
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:48.080]  He died.
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:49.080]  His family's sitting there.
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:50.080]  All cowards lined up except for Don Jr.
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:51.080]  Going along with it.
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:52.080]  He's dead.
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:53.080]  What do we do?
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:55.080]  God, I pray that you are wrong.
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:56.080]  He's dead.
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:57.080]  He's dead.
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:58.080]  He's dead.
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:37:59.080]  Go ahead.
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:02.080]  You know, it was ironic about this, of course,
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:10.080]  because every day goes by we learn more about the plot to lay out this takedown, this coup.
[1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:17.080]  We learned last week that Bruce Orr did in fact warn the FBI about the origins of the
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:22.580]  fake dossier that was used as the underlying rationale for the spying that was meant to
[1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:24.080]  use to take Trump down.
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  The core of what the deep state is so desperate to cover up.
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:34.380]  But the American people, because the mainstream media just doesn't care, that story, an incredible
[1:38:34.380 --> 1:38:35.380]  story by John Paul.
[1:38:35.380 --> 1:38:40.080]  The American people don't know, but what really matters is, Trump doesn't know.
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:41.080]  Yeah.
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:46.080]  Well, how he could not know about Bill Barr is beyond me.
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:51.280]  And of course, the obvious question is, whoever recommended Barr, whoever pushed him within
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:55.880]  the president's circle did not have the president's best interests at heart.
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:58.280]  And the president needs to fire that person right now.
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:00.780]  Look, the time, the hour is late.
[1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:06.280]  He can declassify the FISA warrants, which lead right to Barack Obama.
[1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:08.280]  And I think turn this entire situation around.
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:09.280]  I agree.
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:13.420]  But before, but before this new guy gets in, who does he appoint for the Iranian one that
[1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:16.080]  totally changes the subject to reality?
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:20.600]  Well, right now, the acting attorney general has the authority to appoint anyone.
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:22.400]  What's wrong with Andrew McCarthy?
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:24.680]  I would appoint him.
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.680]  And this FBI director's got to go.
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:31.120]  I would fire him immediately and put former New York police commissioner Ray Kelly.
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:34.680]  Someone Trump has known for 50 years in that job.
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:39.080]  There are patriots who are willing to step into this government, but the call never came
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:44.800]  because right's previous and his minions were blocking those people.
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:47.520]  And that's, that is a sad fact.
[1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:49.360]  And now the chickens have come home to roost.
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:54.400]  I actually wonder whether the seeds of the president's destruction were not sown way
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:59.760]  back in January and February and March, when Steve Bannon made no effort whatsoever to
[1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:05.160]  get Trump loyalists in this administration and the White House and the cabinet was peopled
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:10.320]  by swamp creatures whose only interest was returning to the status quo.
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:14.120]  And by the way, when I say Trump's dead, he's done politically.
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:15.120]  He's dead.
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:16.120]  Everything's dead.
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:17.120]  They're making their move.
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:18.120]  You can see it.
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:24.360]  The total shutdown of all conservative nationalist media, you know, even the famous top previous
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:28.960]  features, big shutdown, it's all happening.
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:30.440]  It's clear as day.
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:32.760]  And if we don't do something, it's our fault.
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:37.440]  And I want to get people ready because I told you Trump was coming.
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:39.360]  I told you the nationalism was sweep the world.
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:40.600]  We're still winning worldwide.
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:43.920]  But those of us that are on the tip of the spear, we got to get ready to pay our pay
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:46.880]  our upwards to, you know, God to get this done.
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:51.480]  But we have to understand that we have to get the base ready for Trump's assassination.
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:52.480]  We close.
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:53.480]  They're not going to just remove.
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:40:54.480]  They're going to kill him.
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:57.920]  They're going to leave him out there, wandering around, saying separate fighting back show
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:00.840]  they're getting ready to kill him in the next 90 days.
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:04.160]  I don't think anybody can discreet and we're only saying this, trying to save the president
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:08.360]  and just separately imagine this is our last broadcast ever, Roger, because it could be
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:09.560]  any day.
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:13.120]  What do we say to the listeners because because this is what this all about.
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:14.360]  This is the dire straights we're in.
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:16.960]  Let's not lie to the audience about this.
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:20.680]  Well, first of all, we we're not folding.
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:21.680]  We're not quitting.
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:22.680]  We're not running.
[1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:24.200]  We're not heading for the tall grass.
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:28.280]  I myself have been fighting for two and a half years and I will continue to fight no
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:33.840]  matter what, but the president is besieged yet today, Alex, he still has the power to
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:35.680]  save himself today.
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:37.800]  Soon that will not be the case.
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:42.360]  What you're looking here, in my opinion, is a complete rerun of the Saturday night massacre.
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:44.240]  Trump will wake up only when it is too late.
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:49.560]  He will then move to fire his new attorney general and that will trigger the the chain
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:51.800]  of events just as it did with Nixon.
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:56.240]  Well, how does he pull this nominee now?
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:41:59.320]  Because his advisors will tell him that it's too late, that he can't do so.
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:01.440]  No, no, but how does he do it now?
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:09.280]  Well, how does he pull the literal, you know, daddy of Robert Mueller out?
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:13.920]  He's got a window here in which Matthew Whitaker is still the acting attorney general.
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:17.680]  Whitaker is by all measures and all reports a patriot.
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:22.880]  He's got the ability to to appoint a special counsel for Uranium One.
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:23.880]  He's got the ability.
[1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:24.880]  No, I get it.
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:26.840]  He should do that now before the new guy gets in.
[1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:27.840]  I agree.
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:30.600]  How do we kill the nomination of the latest swamp creature?
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:35.240]  Well, hopefully the president has woken up, although I think his advisors will tell him
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:36.240]  it's too late.
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:39.400]  His advisors have continued to get him to ignore his.
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:40.680]  Yeah, there are a bunch of wimps.
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:44.200]  There are a bunch of punks and a bunch of scum.
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:46.240]  Here's the deal, folks.
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:48.000]  His borders are being collapsed right now.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  The U.N. is doing it.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  We're on our death bed.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.600]  If we don't wake up and say something, that's all I'm telling listeners is that a lot of
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:57.760]  warnings before, but this is the maximum warning.
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:04.920]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:10.680]  have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:13.400]  This is where everybody's going.
[1:43:13.400 --> 1:43:16.520]  This is what your body actually needs.
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:22.760]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from hemp, now legal
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:28.240]  and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:29.240]  This is not marijuana.
[1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:31.240]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:36.920]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes, but not the bad attributes.
[1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:38.640]  People wonder why I've gotten to CBD oil?
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:42.960]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:44.480]  can get you arrested.
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:45.480]  This is not that.
[1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:47.160]  Legal in all 50 states.
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:49.640]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:50.640]  It's totally legal.

[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:03.520]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:08.720]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:15.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[1:45:15.560 --> 1:45:21.440]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:24.320]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:29.680]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:34.720]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:35.720]  symptoms.
[1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:38.400]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:39.400]  It is not an antihistamine.
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:44.320]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:50.120]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:52.840]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:46:22.400]  Like to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:27.160]  I am patient zero in the mass of banning, but you can override the censors now and if
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:32.680]  all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:36.600]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:42.600]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:47.240]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[1:46:47.240 --> 1:47:01.920]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:17.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:30.400]  All right, Roger and I are talking during the break, bombshell info from Giuliani.
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:48.760]  We were there two and a half years ago when WikiLeaks was all over the news giving interviews
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:53.640]  to the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC and wouldn't give us one.
[1:47:53.640 --> 1:47:57.600]  I called him Hillary's butt plug for not doing it.
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:04.560]  And so now the Senate is opinioning my emails and we learn what Giuliani is saying is coming
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:05.560]  next.
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:06.560]  This is huge.
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:09.120]  Roger Stone, tell us about this.
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:14.440]  CNN has just released an interview with Mayor Giuliani, who of course is representing the
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:16.600]  president as a private attorney.
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:22.360]  Giuliani says he has seen documents that indicate that the special counsel told Jerry
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:27.920]  Corsi that if he would testify against the president, Roger Stone and Alex Jones, that
[1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:30.720]  they would give him probation.
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:34.080]  And that if he did not, he was looking at five years at prison.
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:38.240]  It appears to me that Jerry decided to try to split the difference, won't testify against
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:42.880]  the president, because he knows that he doesn't want to be the John Dean of this drama, was
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:46.680]  perfectly willing, unfortunately, to make up stuff about you and I.
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:48.280]  I recommended him to info wars.
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:49.440]  I was among several.
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:50.760]  There's no doubt about that.
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:55.640]  But the idea that I recommended that you pay him hush money is a canard made of whole
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:56.640]  cost.
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:57.640]  It's nonsense.
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:48:58.640]  It's false.
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:03.160]  And then implicating your father, who gives the guy a severance after you terminate him,
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:06.240]  as if he's done something wrong is just beneath contempt.
[1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:10.040]  I am so disappointed that he's made up lie after lie about.
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:14.000]  Let's make a big, big, big shot here.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.840]  But Roger Stone doesn't make any decisions here.
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:19.000]  No one does but me, which I wish it wasn't.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.180]  I make all the decisions.
[1:49:21.180 --> 1:49:24.360]  The color of the carpet, what's on the video screen behind me.
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:29.840]  I, I built info wars, not the CIA, not the FBI and all these scumbag white shoe boys
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:31.160]  who couldn't wipe their own ass.
[1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:36.720]  I built this and I will not sit there and hear this crap that anyone tells me what to
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:37.720]  say or do.
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:42.840]  And I'm not trying to brag here, but the idea that, that, that, that, of course he's been
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:48.400]  coming on the show for 17 years with four or five number one best selling mugs and the
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:51.360]  top advisor to Lou Dobbs, and he was a smart, good guy.
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:55.760]  And I was betrayed by him and I saw when he was, when he was drunk talking crap to us
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:49:58.240]  in New, in DC a year and a half ago.
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:04.560]  And so the idea, the idea that he would then take our goodness to him when he was a falling
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:08.520]  down drunk and couldn't get his work done and typos everywhere, we have all the emails
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:11.880]  going, what the hell dude, half this article is misspelled.
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:17.240]  That turns into my daddy thinking, they know I'm ready to die, that I would roll over because
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:20.680]  my target, my father makes me sick.
[1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:23.560]  Well, how do you think I feel?
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:28.240]  Here's a colleague who I liked his reporting and is writing it world net daily.
[1:50:28.240 --> 1:50:33.480]  He now claims completely falsely that he told me that John Podesta's emails had been stolen.
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:36.240]  That's a lie, an unsupportable lie.
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:42.080]  Now he's changed his story again saying that I told him ahead of the NBC Billy Bush tape
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:47.360]  release that he should tell Assange to release Podesta's emails to distract from it.
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:49.680]  This is a new iteration of a lie.
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:51.520]  There is no evidence to support.
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:55.480]  And now I'm paying this son of a bitch, Tush money, bull crap.
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:57.080]  So let me ask you this.
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:01.800]  What does this mean that Giuliani, the president's main lawyer, has come out and torpedoed Giuliani?
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:04.140]  I mean, he's come out and torpedoed Corsi.
[1:51:04.140 --> 1:51:09.160]  What does it symbolize that the president's head lawyer, Giuliani has come out and torpedoed
[1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:10.160]  Corsi?
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:13.920]  Well, it says more about Mr. Muller than it does Jerome Corsi.
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:19.640]  I think we see the extent they're willing to go to try to get somebody, Jerry Corsi,
[1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:23.720]  Michael Cohen, somebody to bear false witness against the president.
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:28.880]  Now I know that Jerry Corsi met with the president when he was a candidate for president.
[1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:30.200]  I was not present.
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:32.800]  I don't know what was discussed in that meeting.
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:37.840]  So perhaps Mr. Muller is attempting to put words into Mr. Corsi's mouth within the context
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:38.840]  of that meeting.
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:43.360]  But why would Giuliani, because he's been pretty accurate so far, extremely accurate,
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:46.640]  because he knows the truth is the best defense, why?
[1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:47.640]  This is bombshell.
[1:51:47.640 --> 1:51:50.920]  So he comes out and says that Corsi said what again?
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:54.520]  Again, I've sent you the actual transcript.
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:59.880]  He said he has seen the documents and that Corsi was told that if he would testify against
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:02.280]  the president, they would give him probation.
[1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:04.240]  No, I've got him right here now.
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:05.920]  So how is Giuliani able to get that?
[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:08.120]  I guess they're throwing this at Trump.
[1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:14.080]  Well, somebody obviously leaked this document to the president's attorney.
[1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:19.560]  Look, this all happened within the last hour and a half, so we're going to have to sort
[1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:20.560]  it out.
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:26.480]  I'm just sort of disappointed that Corsi would try to set you and I up in regard to
[1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:28.080]  something that we had nothing to do.
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:30.080]  Well, let's expand on that.
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:31.080]  I mean, let's expand.
[1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:36.280]  The fact that moving on from Corsi, we know he's compromised and sold out.
[1:52:36.280 --> 1:52:42.080]  What does it mean that Giuliani knows that this is happening and is willing to say it?
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:49.360]  The fact that he's coming out and saying that Mueller is basically pushing lies shows that
[1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:53.360]  Trump finally gets that this is crap and stop playing games with it.
[1:52:53.360 --> 1:52:56.160]  Because I can tell you right now, folks, I'm a Russian agent.
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:04.000]  Like I'm a Pluto lawnmower, Easter Bunny, unicorn, purple penguin eater.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.560]  I mean, it's just like it's ridiculous.
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:09.320]  When the globalists are anti-America, they're doing all this.
[1:53:09.320 --> 1:53:14.600]  We all know this and it's just it's ridiculous to change the subject from their treason.
[1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:20.800]  Well, it just being very clear, Alex, Rudy Giuliani is about as popular with the White
[1:53:20.800 --> 1:53:25.320]  House staff and the Trump Inner Circle as you and I, because he's a straight shooter.
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:27.800]  He tells the president what they don't want him to know.
[1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:32.800]  Giuliani has been a truth teller in all this and he is repeatedly trying to get the president
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:35.000]  off of defense and on to offense.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:36.080]  He's hit Comey.
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:37.080]  He's hit Mueller.
[1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:38.920]  He's been one of the few willing to do so.
[1:53:38.920 --> 1:53:43.760]  So believe me, they would like to shut him off from the president as well, but they're
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:47.800]  not able to do so because of his stature and their long relationship.
[1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:49.680]  You know, people like to shoot it really.
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:50.680]  He's done this wrong.
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:51.680]  He's done that wrong.
[1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:53.720]  I think he's done more right than wrong here.
[1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:58.280]  But take those clips this week where he supposedly take the clips this week and I mean, it's the
[1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:03.200]  truth where they said they said that, you know, Trump hasn't included others may have.
[1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:04.520]  He said, I don't know about others.
[1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:06.920]  There's open investigations, but Trump hasn't colluded.
[1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:09.240]  That isn't saying others colluded.
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:10.560]  So that's a truthful statement.
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:13.280]  I don't know about everybody else you're investigating, but Trump hasn't.
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:14.280]  Let's play a clip.
[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:16.560]  We've got the clip of Giuliani talking about this.
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:17.560]  Here it is.
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:22.160]  As far as I know, President Trump did not have discussions with him, certainly had no
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:26.600]  discussions with him in which he told them or counseled him to lie.
[1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:30.040]  If he had any discussions with him, they'd be about the version of the events that Michael
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:33.400]  Cohen gave them, which they all believe was true.
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:35.200]  I believed it was true.
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:40.120]  I still believe it may be true because unlike these people who want to just believe him,
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:42.760]  I believe Michael Cohen is a serial liar.
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:46.280]  If you can figure out where Michael Cohen's telling the truth, you're better than I am,
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:47.280]  Jake.
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:48.440]  And that's what happened to Buzzfeed.
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:51.120]  They bought a totally phony story.
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:55.760]  They weren't going to buy it unless they got some phony stuff about federal agents.
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:59.480]  And then they went with it because they're the same ones who published the Steele dossier
[1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:00.960]  when no one else would do it.
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:02.920]  You obviously have hatred for the president.
[1:55:02.920 --> 1:55:07.720]  But you just acknowledge that it's possible that President Trump talked to Michael Cohen
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:08.720]  about his testimony.
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:09.720]  Which would be perfectly normal.
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:11.520]  Which the president believed was true.
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:14.440]  So it's possible that that happened, that President Trump talked to Michael Cohen about
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:15.440]  his testimony.
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:16.440]  I don't know if it happened or didn't happen.
[1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:19.160]  And it might be attorney-client privilege if it happened, where I can't acknowledge
[1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:20.160]  it.
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:21.800]  But I have no knowledge that he spoke to.
[1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:23.720]  But I'm telling you, I wasn't there then.
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:28.240]  So it's not significant, because the version he gave to the...
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:29.800]  So that's the earlier clip.
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:30.800]  The new clip's out.
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:31.800]  We'll get it.
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:32.800]  The show's almost over.
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:33.800]  The point is, he's come out.
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:40.080]  I got the transcript right here and said that Corsi was promised probation if he'd make
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:42.000]  up stuff and read a transcript.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  I mean, for...
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  For...
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  For...
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  For...
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  For...
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  For...
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  For...
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  For...
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  For...
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  For...
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  For...
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  It's true.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.640]  I spoke on the phone with Donald Trump three days before the disclosure of the WikiLeaks
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:55:59.800]  published, you know, releases.
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:05.280]  And there's no evidence that we spoke about this because we didn't.
[1:56:05.280 --> 1:56:12.560]  But just juxtaposing those dates, I had both Chris Cuomo and Chuck Todd insisting, well,
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:14.640]  you must have spoken to the president about this.
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:15.640]  No, I didn't.
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:16.640]  And there's no proof to the context...
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:17.840]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:18.920]  Here's the bottom line.
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:21.020]  America is in the cross-shares.
[1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:22.380]  The Democrats are all over the news.
[1:56:22.380 --> 1:56:24.420]  We have all these new clips that women's march saying,
[1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:26.740]  we hate America, America shouldn't exist.
[1:56:26.740 --> 1:56:29.940]  This is the group saying America shouldn't exist.
[1:56:29.940 --> 1:56:32.060]  And then people that say it should exist,
[1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:35.420]  they're Russian traders and they should all be arrested.
[1:56:35.420 --> 1:56:36.980]  So we're done.
[1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:39.300]  We have women sexually assaulting our reporters
[1:56:39.300 --> 1:56:40.900]  and laughing in front of police.
[1:56:40.900 --> 1:56:43.020]  We have the Democrat lynch mob out of control.
[1:56:43.020 --> 1:56:44.500]  We are the Americans.
[1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:45.860]  We believe in prosperity.
[1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:46.860]  We believe in justice.
[1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:47.780]  We believe in truth.
[1:56:47.780 --> 1:56:48.820]  We are not Robert Mueller.
[1:56:48.820 --> 1:56:50.100]  We are not Hillary Clinton.
[1:56:50.100 --> 1:56:51.060]  We are not the deep state.
[1:56:51.060 --> 1:56:52.700]  And it's all coming to a head
[1:56:52.700 --> 1:56:54.580]  with all these fake news stories
[1:56:54.580 --> 1:56:57.860]  about Trump's a Russian agent and Buzzfeed fake stories
[1:56:57.860 --> 1:57:00.220]  that are meant to make Mueller look like he's truthful
[1:57:00.220 --> 1:57:01.620]  when he says, oh, this is fake.
[1:57:01.620 --> 1:57:03.420]  The next big bomb shell is real.
[1:57:03.420 --> 1:57:05.340]  It's all coming to a head.
[1:57:05.340 --> 1:57:08.500]  And we will be covering it all at infowars.com forward slash
[1:57:08.500 --> 1:57:11.020]  show, Mike Adams has his counterfeit report coming up
[1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:11.860]  for one hour after.
[1:57:11.860 --> 1:57:14.380]  It's very powerful infowars.com forward slash show,
[1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:17.060]  Roger Stone infowars.com, newswars.com.
[1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:19.340]  We'll talk to you tomorrow at 11 a.m. central
[1:57:19.340 --> 1:57:21.140]  when I kick off my regular broadcast.
[1:57:21.140 --> 1:57:22.580]  But obviously they're making their move.
[1:57:22.580 --> 1:57:23.940]  History's happening now.
[1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:24.860]  And I'm not afraid at all.
