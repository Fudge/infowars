[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.200 --> 00:19.740]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.740 --> 00:45.120]  Texas Alex Joe's oh man I feel not even so much exhausted as I feel completely
[00:45.120 --> 00:50.980]  overwhelmed right now we have got so many big developments from Bilderberg
[00:50.980 --> 00:56.880]  2014 with global leaders going outside the compound being in front about
[00:56.880 --> 01:01.860]  journalists journalists being roughed up new video we've got mainstream media
[01:01.860 --> 01:05.600]  being forced to cover it for the first time even the London independence saying
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.900]  hey it does violate a lot of laws to have world leaders meeting in secret with
[01:09.900 --> 01:15.640]  politicians elected officials setting policy public servants meeting in
[01:15.640 --> 01:22.920]  secret setting policy and I even well I guess we got a video from CNBC where
[01:22.920 --> 01:29.440]  some of the guests and people are going well the public's got a point I mean
[01:29.440 --> 01:32.080]  there are a bunch of powerful elites meeting in secret and we have a right
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.840]  to know what they're talking about this is an official governmental meeting the
[01:37.840 --> 01:41.720]  Bilderberg group bragged a few weeks ago one of their major members to the
[01:41.720 --> 01:49.400]  German press that they created the euro and they set up most of the world's
[01:49.400 --> 01:53.200]  architecture currently and that they are controlling the planet to a great
[01:53.200 --> 02:04.640]  extent and so they admit that they are setting policy yes if 145 or so royalty
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.800]  banking heads heads of industry and government are all friends and they
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.320]  want to say hey next year let's all put in our calendars we're going to go to
[02:13.320 --> 02:17.720]  British Virgin Islands for two weeks and play golf undoubtedly business is
[02:17.720 --> 02:20.000]  going to be conducted at night and stuff and there'll be some breakaway
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.200]  meetings but it's not helicopters and fences and secret police and Ed Balls
[02:26.200 --> 02:30.840]  the deputy prime minister of England who I confronted last year inside BBC
[02:30.840 --> 02:34.360]  studios because I was on television right after him so I was able to talk to
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.440]  him in the studio we have that video where I bring up Bilderberg with the
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.280]  fact that they're setting policy and I named the British laws violating Watson
[02:42.280 --> 02:45.880]  also confronts him in the halls he leaves and mentions the law that he's
[02:45.880 --> 02:54.320]  violating they really are violating these laws and just because the federal laws
[02:54.320 --> 03:01.320]  here and the federal laws in England and others are being ignored doesn't mean
[03:01.320 --> 03:08.960]  that they're not still laws and I personally I'm getting tired of it
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.080]  because these are the guys pushing gun control worldwide these are the people
[03:14.080 --> 03:19.280]  pushing force inoculation worldwide and population reduction these are the
[03:19.280 --> 03:27.560]  people that are pushing everybody around and these are the people trying to put
[03:27.560 --> 03:31.440]  in the smart grid the taxes and tracks and controls is they're moving us into
[03:31.440 --> 03:38.840]  total authoritarianism and that's why I've got a big beef with them and then
[03:38.840 --> 03:43.800]  I'm always on the air with other shows TV shows they ask the question well Alex
[03:43.800 --> 03:47.480]  you know how do we know they're setting up world government well they've bragged
[03:47.480 --> 03:53.200]  about it but I thought it's secret why are they bragging well criminals love
[03:53.200 --> 03:59.600]  to brag and stuff they did 30 years ago 40 years ago 60 years ago they will toot
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.360]  their horn about now but they didn't do it till we exposed it and made their
[04:04.360 --> 04:07.800]  lying obsolete so now they're just trying to act all confident about it
[04:07.800 --> 04:10.680]  well of course we're building a private corporate world government I mean who
[04:10.680 --> 04:13.640]  wouldn't I mean we know how to run stuff better than you and plus we're not
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.560]  racist and you know political correctness you go debate transgender issues
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.000]  while we put cancer viruses in your vaccines or you know we put so many
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.720]  chemicals in the water that the fish and frogs the aquatic life is going
[04:28.720 --> 04:31.120]  sterile
[04:32.360 --> 04:38.040]  don't be sexist and bring that up I mean these people are out of control and
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.080]  it'd be one thing of their run in our lives and building space bases and we're
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.040]  you know we already launched our seventh you know colony mission to Alpha
[04:45.040 --> 04:48.440]  Centuries and that they were trying to get people to have brain boost and stuff
[04:48.440 --> 04:51.640]  I'd be like whoa these people are really the elite we should probably listen to
[04:51.640 --> 04:56.760]  them these people are a bunch of scum narcissists who hate humanity and they
[04:56.760 --> 05:00.160]  are a major problem
[05:00.160 --> 05:05.000]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.480]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[05:08.480 --> 05:12.400]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking

[08:50.600 --> 08:54.840]  have big updates there's been a lot of big developments but I'm just gonna save
[08:54.840 --> 09:01.440]  it until David Knight joins us in about 23 minutes from now at 33 after from
[09:01.440 --> 09:06.800]  Copenhagen Denmark the site of Bilderberg 2014 then Paul Joseph Watson was in a
[09:06.800 --> 09:10.760]  whole another area covering other developments with Bilderberg they're on
[09:10.760 --> 09:15.880]  two different missions he's gonna be joining us at 12 30 central or about an
[09:15.880 --> 09:20.040]  hour and 20 some minutes from now depending on what time zone you're
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.600]  listening to us or rebroadcast so that is coming up we will have totally open
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.720]  phones I pledge take a lot of calls I'm getting pretty good at that when I do
[09:28.720 --> 09:33.680]  open the phones up in the third hour on a Friday free for all wildcard Friday
[09:33.680 --> 09:39.840]  whatever issue you want to raise agree disagree yell at me tell me how great I
[09:39.840 --> 09:42.760]  am we don't want to hear that you're allowed to yell at me no saying how
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.320]  great I am anyways it's just not thought-provoking any issue you want to
[09:48.320 --> 09:51.800]  cover we're gonna do it in the third hour today I'm being a little bit silly
[09:51.800 --> 09:57.720]  where to start let me cover other big breaking news cuz it's a big news day on
[09:57.720 --> 10:05.040]  this Friday 30th day of May and walk through some of what's coming up and
[10:05.040 --> 10:09.520]  then get into embattled veterans affairs secretary a general Eriksh and
[10:09.520 --> 10:17.640]  Seki resigning and before we went live I was in the coffee room I don't usually
[10:17.640 --> 10:22.200]  do this anymore because it's so hard to listen to him and look at him and just to
[10:22.200 --> 10:26.320]  hear the endless deception that comes out of his mouth but I did I did watch
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.960]  pretty much Obama's entire press conference 20 minutes of it so maybe
[10:31.960 --> 10:35.320]  we'll go through it today or a transcript and cover some of the lies but I
[10:35.320 --> 10:41.320]  mean it was all bull so it's really no point at this point I mean should I get
[10:41.320 --> 10:45.560]  up here and prove that two plus two equals four even though they teach it
[10:45.560 --> 10:55.240]  equals whatever he says should I go on air and explain to you that raising the
[10:55.240 --> 11:00.920]  debt limit does raise the debt he says it doesn't should I get up here and
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.880]  explain that it is in the bill $5,000 fine for not getting Obamacare even
[11:05.880 --> 11:08.560]  though they deny it's in there should I show you the bill where it has death
[11:08.560 --> 11:14.000]  panels even though they say it isn't there I mean at a certain point it
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.960]  really just becomes repetitive to go over their lives but we've got to do it so
[11:18.960 --> 11:30.640]  we will I have done a lot of studying and as listeners you've done a lot of
[11:30.640 --> 11:36.760]  studying I know what our guests have covered here on the radio broadcast over
[11:36.760 --> 11:39.160]  the years
[11:42.640 --> 11:56.080]  guest like Doug Rocky who was the head of the DU program for the Department of
[11:56.080 --> 11:59.920]  Defense after he was the head of it for the Army and who wrote the official
[11:59.920 --> 12:07.200]  manual what was it 1987 that is still used by the Army and other armed
[12:07.200 --> 12:14.280]  services for the use containment cleanup of the platoon uranium and munitions
[12:14.280 --> 12:22.560]  now why am I just starting there because to understand what's happening to the
[12:22.560 --> 12:29.160]  troops and understand it's premeditated on record when I even
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.040]  start getting into an area like the veterans and the troops there is an
[12:34.040 --> 12:40.800]  explosion of data in my memory and my mind of publicly available prima facie
[12:40.800 --> 12:51.720]  undisputed absolute incontrovertible facts in thousands of different secret
[12:51.720 --> 12:59.160]  tests that have been declassified that killed tens of thousands of active duty
[12:59.160 --> 13:10.160]  troops from the 30s right through until now and the vaccines and the medical
[13:10.160 --> 13:16.240]  experiments they do it all in plain view so of course there's an attitude at
[13:16.240 --> 13:22.920]  most VA's that the veterans are garbage are scum and are on welfare and we've
[13:22.920 --> 13:26.560]  had countless whistleblowers the last three weeks with Staff Sergeant Joe
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.000]  Biggs interviewing him on the nightly news and on the website info wars.com
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.840]  where senior people at the VA and senior and nurses and doctors and people
[13:37.840 --> 13:44.000]  going public where they call them welfare queens and subhuman and hate them
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.600]  and there is a minority of people in the VA mainly veterans who try to take care
[13:49.600 --> 13:53.200]  of the veterans even though it's a tough job and the money's diverted and the
[13:53.200 --> 13:56.400]  forms are falsified I mean they'll say it's come out in the news I told you
[13:56.400 --> 13:59.400]  this a long time ago but it's in the news this week that they'll say they've done
[13:59.400 --> 14:05.480]  a surgery to remove a cancer and they just won't remove it and won't even do
[14:05.480 --> 14:10.160]  the surgery and let them die and by the way we're not talking about 85 year old
[14:10.160 --> 14:16.840]  Korea War vets or 89 year old World War 2 vets which I think it's really evil to
[14:16.840 --> 14:20.320]  not give them treatment but there's the argument that well they're old and they
[14:20.320 --> 14:24.800]  can't be healthy just better they die we're talking about 25 year old Marine
[14:24.800 --> 14:29.480]  Corps and Army vets that we now learn one of the biggest suicide reasons is
[14:29.480 --> 14:36.760]  that they literally can't get shrapnel removed I mean folks it should have told
[14:36.760 --> 14:42.120]  you everything you needed to know when I I learned about it in mainstream news a
[14:42.120 --> 14:48.400]  few years ago that they are ordering the volunteer army that's not volunteer in
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.880]  automatic re-up and the fact that people don't have the money or the health care
[14:52.880 --> 14:57.240]  they need already they're ordering people who've had their feet blown off
[14:57.240 --> 15:04.960]  and hands blown off they are slapping robot hands and legs on them that don't
[15:04.960 --> 15:14.080]  even work and are ordering them back into combat nobody's ever done that they
[15:14.080 --> 15:21.200]  are using them up like I put 10 gallons of gas in my truck but when I put 10
[15:21.200 --> 15:25.720]  gallons in it it's gonna be burned up it's not alive it's inanimate it creates
[15:25.720 --> 15:30.720]  carbon dioxide plants breathe it puts out some other toxic stuff but I it's not
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.280]  personal give me one thing if they were using up the troops and they were some
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.440]  alien species then just didn't care about them let's say aliens posing as
[15:38.440 --> 15:42.040]  humans were running things and they were acting like this they would you know
[15:42.040 --> 15:49.120]  they've got 7,000 IQs we're dumb animals to them and you know I eat cows it
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.560]  wouldn't be personal I still want to defeat the alien species these are our
[15:53.560 --> 16:00.800]  own humans and they like treating the troops bad on record they enjoy it these
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.200]  people are scum because here's the deal if you're doing bad things to innocent
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.960]  people and you don't want to take care of the old or the young or the the infirm
[16:09.960 --> 16:15.440]  and you don't have a natural nurturing thing in you to want to help people you
[16:15.440 --> 16:22.880]  can just write people off and let them die when you're doing things like that
[16:22.880 --> 16:28.240]  it's going to hurt you and you're gonna feel bad if you've got any soul any
[16:28.240 --> 16:33.320]  humanity but for the people that will do this they like it folks that's why they
[16:33.320 --> 16:39.960]  excel in this system they knew in 1946 and we've read the paper on air with
[16:39.960 --> 16:50.520]  dr. Rocky for the exact name of the Pentagon Department of Defense memo but
[16:50.520 --> 16:59.440]  I think it's radioactive particles and gases as a weapon and in the big multi
[16:59.440 --> 17:03.880]  hundred-page paper that was declassified in the 80s they say we could create DU
[17:03.880 --> 17:09.560]  weapons with our reactor waste and nuclear weapons production waste
[17:09.560 --> 17:12.920]  atomic weapons production waste at the time and it'll shoot through basically
[17:12.920 --> 17:18.560]  anything the kinetic power is unbelievable the problem is it creates
[17:18.560 --> 17:24.680]  particles of it that are a death sentence when any mammal comes in contact
[17:24.680 --> 17:28.080]  with them and will massively reduce lifespan and will cause all sorts of
[17:28.080 --> 17:33.920]  degenerative effects so from the 40s until 1990 no one in the world would use
[17:33.920 --> 17:41.680]  DU the US military had three places they would let the A-10 Warthog tank
[17:41.680 --> 17:46.560]  killers and and and pilots test on and and those were areas you didn't send
[17:46.560 --> 17:52.920]  humans into areas they decided to shoot old tanks up with and they had bunker
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.800]  busters kept with it they were for wartime use and they had caches of it
[17:56.800 --> 18:01.200]  deployed all over Eastern Europe if the Russians with 10 to 1 tank superiority
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.560]  poured in across and a Soviet invasion of Western Europe they would then in what
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.960]  would already become a nuclear war hand out the DU weapons and the Russians
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.960]  have them as well it's a doomsday weapon you're gonna go ahead and have a nuclear
[18:14.960 --> 18:25.560]  war you use it okay it's an emergency weapon what changed from 1946 to 1990
[18:25.560 --> 18:29.240]  what changed in 87 Rocky's report said of course we can't use it they were
[18:29.240 --> 18:33.600]  looking at using it more and it's totally deadly and you know he even kind
[18:33.600 --> 18:36.080]  of worked with them and said well if you wear decontamination suits and then
[18:36.080 --> 18:40.000]  it's drug off and buried in big pits and everyone's washed off immediately and
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.280]  you you know you wear breathers you know the wrist might not be that you know
[18:43.280 --> 18:47.600]  too bad it doesn't go through your skin you understand but but we shouldn't use
[18:47.600 --> 18:54.520]  it and they want you know what we're gonna use it and the Israeli started
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.720]  using it they use it in Gaza and it all blows right back on Israel I mean let's
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.800]  say the Israelis don't think the gods and Palestinians are humans are you human
[19:04.800 --> 19:07.960]  when it blows back on you see this is the classic thing of where you treat
[19:07.960 --> 19:14.640]  someone like they're not a human it blows back on you it's the art type of the
[19:14.640 --> 19:18.760]  Germans in World War one with the first to use nerve gas primitive nerve gas
[19:18.760 --> 19:23.280]  chlorine gas mustard gas they would shoot it across and then the wind would
[19:23.280 --> 19:31.120]  just turn and blow it right back on them half the time I mean this is madness

[24:29.160 --> 24:34.160]  to quantify something here and I'm gonna say a lot of really obvious things but
[24:34.160 --> 24:40.320]  things that I don't think people really focus on so often I hear people saying
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.760]  man you know you're such a pessimist you think there's these evil people that
[24:44.760 --> 24:48.240]  run everything and we have no power no that's the opposite of what I'm saying
[24:48.240 --> 24:52.960]  there are corrupt special interest and different combines worldwide and we've
[24:52.960 --> 24:59.640]  identified the main three groups and substratas and mafias and they use
[24:59.640 --> 25:03.520]  pretty much the same systems because it's what works the best to control people
[25:03.520 --> 25:09.840]  and so it's the system that unifies the evil coral reefs all over the world
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.320]  look the same they're different species of fish different species of coral but
[25:14.320 --> 25:20.440]  they pretty much look the same because that's what works and the systems the
[25:20.440 --> 25:23.200]  globalists have developed out of all these cultures and civilizations and
[25:23.200 --> 25:30.560]  empires are pretty similar because it's what works in an authoritarian model we
[25:30.560 --> 25:37.160]  go through patterns we only live 74 years on average men women 76 it's been
[25:37.160 --> 25:43.040]  that way for thousands of years we feel like we're individuals but we really are
[25:43.040 --> 25:47.960]  in a collective but we are individuals who make individual choices that shapes
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.420]  the collective not globalists trying to create a false collective that they
[25:52.420 --> 25:56.800]  program and shape that's what I'm getting at here is there is a big globalist
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.960]  Anglo-American Dutch German New World Order merged with the Rothschild's
[26:01.960 --> 26:08.800]  mafia that is the dominant global force because the West was the best the West
[26:08.800 --> 26:13.160]  of the best art literature Renaissance and statistically some of the best
[26:13.160 --> 26:19.440]  scientist the talent there's talent everywhere I mean it's like racers I
[26:19.440 --> 26:26.520]  mean if you know if a top runner in a two-mile race is a two seconds faster
[26:26.520 --> 26:30.760]  than the other guy that's not really much but it doesn't matter he's still the
[26:30.760 --> 26:36.360]  world champion well the globalists are a couple steps ahead of everybody does
[26:36.360 --> 26:40.680]  that mean the Chinese elite aren't absolutely evil no they're really evil
[26:40.680 --> 26:45.440]  does that mean the Russian elite aren't evil no they're evil because they're
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.840]  cheating to control society they're using tricks to be in control that are bad
[26:51.840 --> 26:56.240]  because good people don't want to be in power and don't want to dominate people
[26:56.240 --> 27:02.320]  we are then automatically supplanted by the evil ones not because they're better
[27:02.320 --> 27:07.440]  than us but because we won't stand up against them until it's almost too late
[27:07.440 --> 27:11.760]  then we do we defeat them a new Renaissance happens we become decadent
[27:11.760 --> 27:16.200]  in the cycle they creep back in and take control and this time if we don't
[27:16.200 --> 27:20.040]  reverse them they're gonna probably destroy the planet irrevocably destroy
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.880]  the genetic code of the human race and really wreck our chances of becoming a
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.040]  type one civilization and setting up off-world colonies and then you could
[27:29.040 --> 27:32.360]  decide if you want to be a transhumanist and leave one colony and do
[27:32.360 --> 27:35.480]  whatever you want here or you want to go to this colony where people maintain
[27:35.480 --> 27:42.000]  their humanity I mean real freedom we need a Renaissance trailblazing
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.320]  explorer system that's what humans do that's what makes us great we change our
[27:46.320 --> 27:52.160]  environment we do evolve faster than the other species we are incredible and we
[27:52.160 --> 27:55.480]  need to have a view that we're incredible and amazing not the view put out
[27:55.480 --> 27:58.840]  by the Bilderberg group that the general public is trash while they try to dumb
[27:58.840 --> 28:04.320]  us down that sin against life and against true competition is an
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.560]  unbelievable blasphemy and if you don't believe in God that's your issue I'm
[28:08.560 --> 28:13.960]  saying it's a blasphemy against art it's a blasphemy against beauty it's a
[28:13.960 --> 28:19.160]  blasphemy against free will it is a tyrannical authoritarian blasphemy
[28:19.160 --> 28:23.360]  against my soul and my very programming and I have a right to self-determine
[28:23.360 --> 28:28.240]  against it and if I'm attacked I have a right at warfare and I am in warfare in
[28:28.240 --> 28:33.080]  information war with the truth viciously attacking my enemy and I want you to
[28:33.080 --> 28:37.240]  join me in attacking the enemy as well because they're your enemy one way or
[28:37.240 --> 28:42.960]  another they're attacking you whether you admit it or not these people are
[28:42.960 --> 28:50.960]  absolutely anathema to everything good I like driving by beautiful farmers fields
[28:50.960 --> 28:56.360]  and seeing the the beautiful rows of wheat or corn I love seeing happy
[28:56.360 --> 29:00.640]  beautiful excited people these globalists are the pessimists who don't
[29:00.640 --> 29:03.560]  believe in humanity and who think we're ugly and bad so they're making it a
[29:03.560 --> 29:07.520]  self-fulfilling prophecy and who are waging war against humanity because to
[29:07.520 --> 29:12.760]  a man and a woman I've studied them they like ugliness and they don't like your
[29:12.760 --> 29:16.160]  good-looking wife they don't like you have your good-looking they don't like
[29:16.160 --> 29:19.600]  your art they don't like your healthy kids they don't like you having your own
[29:19.600 --> 29:26.200]  wealth they want it all for themselves and they're not gonna stop and they need
[29:26.200 --> 29:32.480]  to be smashed and I mean to smash them because ideas are bulletproof and are
[29:32.480 --> 29:37.400]  spreading quickly right now and we more and more are setting the narrative and
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.200]  our narrative isn't perfect but it points towards the Polestar it points
[29:41.200 --> 29:45.920]  towards justice we're trying to be good and we will defeat the globalists this
[29:45.920 --> 29:52.760]  whole VA thing is on purpose period we're on the march the empires on the

[33:38.160 --> 33:42.280]  breaking news a whole bunch of exclusive videos that really show the
[33:42.280 --> 33:46.440]  illegality that's going on when you get a report out on this not just the photos
[33:46.440 --> 33:52.440]  in the video because it's very newsworthy that add balls the shadow
[33:52.440 --> 33:56.480]  chancellor and in England it's a complex title but he's the deputy prime
[33:56.480 --> 34:00.000]  ministers what it is like the vice president basically the vice president
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.400]  of England is creeping into the meeting and having to show his credentials to
[34:04.400 --> 34:08.240]  the moron security guard people that don't know who he is because it's not
[34:08.240 --> 34:11.400]  enough that he has a bee around his neck and has the lanyard you know they
[34:11.400 --> 34:16.720]  want to check it and so they're sitting there talking to this guy and he's got
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.400]  all these official files in his hands clearly going into set policy and under
[34:21.400 --> 34:26.960]  multiple laws in England it's illegal and then we've got all our different acts
[34:26.960 --> 34:30.280]  here that make it as legal as well Hillary Clinton got fined was it
[34:30.280 --> 34:35.360]  $400,000 back in the 90s for violating the Logan Act and they have similar laws
[34:35.360 --> 34:38.520]  there but in England it's in the newspapers that it looks like what he's
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.280]  doing is illegal so real investigations heating up we're gonna talk about that
[34:42.280 --> 34:46.920]  but but I mean what does he have to do have like in my six files officially I
[34:46.920 --> 34:50.720]  mean he's going with all these files it's so I mean they're in their setting
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.400]  policy ladies and gentlemen with the heads of corporations that give them
[34:54.400 --> 35:02.000]  political donations this is outrageous we're showing that footage right now of
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.880]  balls doing all this and again there's a shot where he's got all different files
[35:07.880 --> 35:10.920]  up against his chest we'll show that in a moment and I guess that's not even a
[35:10.920 --> 35:20.680]  security guard that's the police but we're going to also be talking again to
[35:20.680 --> 35:29.880]  Paul Watson coming up at the bottom of the next hour but I tell you the
[35:29.880 --> 35:34.040]  bureaucracy of them trying to put all of us collectively in a control grid
[35:34.040 --> 35:37.720]  prison to protect themselves shows how they're now in a prison as well of
[35:37.720 --> 35:41.560]  their own making see what you try to do to somebody else generally ends up
[35:41.560 --> 35:47.200]  happening to you and the globalists have knowledge of how to dominate they do
[35:47.200 --> 35:53.640]  not have a long-term wisdom of G is this good for my children and grandchildren
[35:53.640 --> 35:58.880]  and great-grandchildren what I'm doing to humanity well yes I'm making my house
[35:58.880 --> 36:02.360]  powerful and great and big yeah but I look at your kids they're all basically
[36:02.360 --> 36:09.280]  on average messes I mean you are destroying your genetic line you are
[36:09.280 --> 36:15.280]  committing a crime against your name it's just not good and the argument is
[36:15.280 --> 36:21.200]  well I'm not really a bad person I'm in a larger corrupt system and I work
[36:21.200 --> 36:26.800]  within it to try to do better at certain points but you never do I'm not
[36:26.800 --> 36:30.280]  saying everybody Bilderberg is evil I'm not even saying they run the whole
[36:30.280 --> 36:34.640]  world they are a key organization that admits they set up the plan for the
[36:34.640 --> 36:38.520]  European Union and that's been declassified BBC in the 90s reported
[36:38.520 --> 36:43.400]  that and interviewed they had to the Bilderberg group at the time Lord Healy
[36:43.400 --> 36:47.760]  and they were in again German newspapers two weeks ago bragging that they're
[36:47.760 --> 36:52.040]  the most powerful I don't know according to Helmut Schmidt in his book Men in
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.880]  Powers political retrospective German Chancellor he said it was probably the
[36:55.880 --> 37:01.760]  most powerful along with with trilateral Commission and Bohemian Grove and he
[37:01.760 --> 37:05.480]  went on to say we actually get a lot done at Bohemian Grove and it's my
[37:05.480 --> 37:10.120]  favorite place yeah because they have sex by night and party and get drunk and
[37:10.120 --> 37:15.120]  make decisions by day it is a beautiful area in northern California on the
[37:15.120 --> 37:20.960]  prettiest places on the planet but the issue is we don't like you running our
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.680]  lives and then saying you're not see once we force them to admit they are
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.200]  making a lot of the decisions then we have to say what are those decisions oh
[37:29.200 --> 37:35.000]  you didn't have a right to make those decisions and their main decision and
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.360]  we're going to our reporters is and is on record and they've already done this
[37:38.360 --> 37:41.400]  and countless third world and old world countries are now moving to first world
[37:41.400 --> 37:50.480]  countries like Spain like Italy like Germany like the United States like the
[37:50.480 --> 37:58.440]  UK Ireland Scotland England they are taking the pension funds of private
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.640]  pensioners it's their money they've already paid taxes on and on average four
[38:02.640 --> 38:08.880]  times and they are taking them in increments using the same systems worldwide
[38:08.880 --> 38:12.200]  and getting so arrogant they're not taking money directly out of people's
[38:12.200 --> 38:17.440]  bank accounts in Cyprus and other places and seizing of the hundreds of Greek
[38:17.440 --> 38:23.880]  islands there's hundreds oh you owe me three billion I want this island for
[38:23.880 --> 38:28.200]  that that's valued at four billion and they get this giant Greek island that
[38:28.200 --> 38:31.560]  was in the Daily Mail last year and the Associated Press and everywhere else
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.840]  and then it turned out that particular billionaire he got the government to
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.440]  sign on to cover his derivatives too big to fail and then turn around and
[38:40.440 --> 38:46.920]  went see now you owe me money you bail them out and then but now your money's
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.240]  been given to them and now they're the executor and the manager and then they
[38:51.240 --> 38:54.600]  go you know what we want to appoint the new leader of Greece and we're going to
[38:54.600 --> 38:59.120]  appoint the leader of Spain they're moving towards that more and more we're
[38:59.120 --> 39:05.400]  going to appoint the leader of Italy actually did that and it's just oh we
[39:05.400 --> 39:10.160]  now have technocrats appointed and it's the Bilderberg group Bilderberg and
[39:10.160 --> 39:16.040]  Goldman Sachs members rotating door revolving door are now being appointed
[39:16.040 --> 39:20.160]  they were appointing people in Iceland to run things but the Icelanders
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.400]  basically rioted and refused to work and do stuff for one year until they got a
[39:24.400 --> 39:27.640]  new government and they started arresting the finance ministers and found out
[39:27.640 --> 39:32.800]  guess what 93% of the money that was owed was not theirs it it was bankers in
[39:32.800 --> 39:35.240]  England
[39:35.560 --> 39:43.960]  signing them on to their debts and telling 400,000 hard-working Vikings in
[39:43.960 --> 39:49.680]  Iceland who were all out there with their bicycles and their kids and all
[39:49.680 --> 39:56.160]  friendly and so nice and good until they were going to lose everything and they
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.400]  finally became humans again because they were always humans nice sweet Vikings
[40:01.400 --> 40:05.360]  but then they started acting more like mean Vikings and now they've got their
[40:05.360 --> 40:11.080]  country back to the veneer of civilization wipes off very quickly
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.680]  that's why they want police states and checkpoints and nanny states not because
[40:14.680 --> 40:20.520]  they want to protect you I was downtown and I'm going to the guest I was
[40:20.520 --> 40:28.360]  downtown I guess it was Sunday or yeah it was Sunday or was it Monday was it
[40:28.360 --> 40:32.280]  the holiday I was visiting some friends I was out on their balcony we're
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.800]  barbecuing and a big storm beautiful storms blow in and we're looking at it
[40:37.800 --> 40:42.840]  from you know 20 stories up and these beautiful storms blow in over Lake
[40:42.840 --> 40:48.600]  Austin over the river and you can see the sun and then in the distance you
[40:48.600 --> 40:54.280]  see one of those stormy days where you can see 30 miles in all directions and
[40:54.280 --> 40:56.720]  there was no tornado I went in and looked because the police were acting
[40:56.720 --> 41:00.600]  crazy they were running around speedboats saying get off the lake get off the lake
[41:00.600 --> 41:04.480]  emergency emergency and making kayakers get off all the rest is for a rain
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.520]  storm that was coming in so I thought was there a tornado and I ran and you
[41:08.520 --> 41:17.440]  know looked on my buddy's computer now there's no tornado coming and went
[41:17.440 --> 41:22.520]  back out second on my iPhone and then we went back in the storm blew through
[41:22.520 --> 41:27.080]  ate some barbecue and walked back out and it's just barely raining and there
[41:27.080 --> 41:31.360]  are police running around in Lake Austin and at the parks and down by their
[41:31.360 --> 41:37.320]  building on loudspeakers saying don't come outside it's dangerous dangerous
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.440]  weather conditions I mean folks they're now saying don't go outside when it's
[41:42.440 --> 41:48.640]  raining and in England they arrest you if you say the word homosexual or or
[41:48.640 --> 41:52.920]  girl because someone said it was hurtful and Michelle Obama is telling us
[41:52.920 --> 42:00.000]  what to eat now and they are totally destroying the culture destroying any
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.640]  form of debate there's a big video up on drugs right now it's also info wars
[42:03.640 --> 42:09.280]  calm with a big comedian and writer you know coming out and saying you know
[42:09.280 --> 42:14.680]  there's a gay mafia and if you even make a joke everybody should be fair game
[42:14.680 --> 42:18.520]  you are destroyed and shut down and that's pretty authoritarian that's
[42:18.520 --> 42:23.680]  pretty scary in fact there's the headline Adam Corolla on gay mafia and
[42:23.680 --> 42:28.320]  me I've never bashed quote gays but if I want to use the scientific term had a
[42:28.320 --> 42:32.440]  bisexual homosexual you want to have me arrested I mean you're an authoritarian I
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.520]  don't like you and not because of your sexual preference but because you are a
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.840]  control freak trying to use our good will to enslave us in free speech and I
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.920]  don't like that and I'll I'll start you know really coming after people if they
[42:45.920 --> 42:49.000]  want to try to sit there and dictate everything because you're an authoritarian
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.920]  being used by the globalist authoritarians with political correctness to
[42:52.920 --> 42:56.920]  silence any form of dissent or free speech and I don't want to live in North
[42:56.920 --> 43:04.000]  Korea now while we're all busy debating the next revolution transgender
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.120]  because they've normalized everything else now just as a political fighting
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.000]  point then it'll be bestiality on and on and on just to create a fight is the
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.040]  whole issue while we're all busy debating that all day the troops are
[43:17.040 --> 43:20.760]  killing themselves 24 a day that's every hour and most of it's because they
[43:20.760 --> 43:24.280]  can't get health care and they're being treated like crap if that's retreated
[43:24.280 --> 43:28.080]  good they tend to not commit suicide and a just society if we're treated badly
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.040]  they flip out and no one's been abused more than this current generation we
[43:32.040 --> 43:34.960]  hear about greatest-generation World War two vets yeah my grandfathers were in
[43:34.960 --> 43:38.080]  World War two but they both served a couple tours one of them one tour the
[43:38.080 --> 43:43.080]  other two tours I mean it was some rough fighting too but I mean I know people
[43:43.080 --> 43:49.200]  that have served 20 tours in combat like my cousin volunteer 31 years US Army and
[43:49.200 --> 43:53.920]  he is a machine he wouldn't probably be do well outside of it every time he gets
[43:53.920 --> 43:57.040]  out for six months or something he goes and re-ups he just can't help it this is
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.800]  all he knows how to do I mean if your car's got a problem or your guns got an
[44:01.800 --> 44:05.720]  issue or you want you to come fix your roof at 2 a.m. the guy just fixes things
[44:05.720 --> 44:10.080]  and does things and and just carries things and just is ready I mean just a
[44:10.080 --> 44:15.480]  machine beyond my dad my dad's from the same country you know hard-working people
[44:15.480 --> 44:18.920]  he loves to work he loves to get stuff done I mean I've got family members not
[44:18.920 --> 44:24.920]  just one but a bunch of your farm boys who are just machines ladies and gentlemen
[44:24.920 --> 44:29.240]  and they can adjust they can handle it because they're so tough the average
[44:29.240 --> 44:33.320]  I couldn't handle it the average person can't go see three four hardcore tours
[44:33.320 --> 44:36.200]  and then come back and be treated like crap by the VA they're gonna go blow
[44:36.200 --> 44:44.120]  their head off and there's an attitude of anti-humanism anti humans are good
[44:44.120 --> 44:48.280]  in the globalist the trickling down now and that's what you hear at the VA they
[44:48.280 --> 44:51.240]  all we all just take these vets out and shoot them they're a bunch of scum all
[44:51.240 --> 44:55.320]  they're getting welfare all they want surgeries all just get you know it's
[44:55.320 --> 44:59.600]  because they've put people in place that will take the funding away and
[44:59.600 --> 45:04.640]  siphon it off they don't want to take care of the veterans of course it got
[45:04.640 --> 45:09.640]  worse under Shinseki that's the directive of course it got worse under
[45:09.640 --> 45:16.600]  Obama we've got death panels now the VA is the model of everything people go
[45:16.600 --> 45:18.920]  but government wants to give us something free help old ladies they use
[45:18.920 --> 45:23.360]  your soft heart they want control of health care to run your life and it's
[45:23.360 --> 45:26.720]  come out of the club of Rome and Bilderberg and the trilateral Commission
[45:26.720 --> 45:31.240]  in these groups the people that write the Obamacare to bankrupt the old system
[45:31.240 --> 45:35.360]  to get control of your life to give you less health care for more money it's a
[45:35.360 --> 45:40.600]  screw job because evil people don't like to manage stuff and compete so they
[45:40.600 --> 45:45.040]  argue that in a gen 21 imploding society is something they built and designed
[45:45.040 --> 45:50.920]  all they're doing is actuarying and sucking off a collapse blowing up the
[45:50.920 --> 45:55.560]  building and saying what artists they are in command destruction because
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.240]  they're not good managers they're not good people they're not good leaders they
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.640]  don't want to compete with the Renaissance they are the dark age they
[46:04.640 --> 46:09.360]  are neo feudalism and the club of Rome in 1967 I've gone to the UT library I
[46:09.360 --> 46:13.480]  show shots of it in my film in game they say they want to recreate neo
[46:13.480 --> 46:19.320]  feudalism they want to recreate feudalism I mean these people are scum
[46:19.320 --> 46:23.520]  and then they're saving the earth by screwing it up and I'm supposed to crawl
[46:23.520 --> 46:27.880]  in some ditch and just give up my destiny and my children's destiny and
[46:27.880 --> 46:32.520]  your destiny it doesn't mean you have to accept my destiny doesn't mean you have
[46:32.520 --> 46:36.240]  to accept my view of the world but believe me folks you better decide what
[46:36.240 --> 46:41.080]  you want because they've already decided you're not in the future and if they
[46:41.080 --> 46:45.960]  can treat foster kids and minorities and veterans anybody in their clutches like
[46:45.960 --> 46:50.600]  absolute hell with secret experiments and all the control and all the dumbing
[46:50.600 --> 46:57.320]  down it they'll do it to you next and they are doing it to you already these
[46:57.320 --> 46:59.840]  people are the scum of the earth now we're gonna have David Knight with us
[46:59.840 --> 47:04.640]  15 minutes into the next hour then we're going to have Paul Watson with us
[47:04.640 --> 47:07.960]  and open phones the full next hour there's so much breaking Bilderberg news
[47:07.960 --> 47:12.520]  at info wars.com and prison planet.com we need some big master coverage
[47:12.520 --> 47:16.440]  article that has the right headline so it captures people's attention because
[47:16.440 --> 47:19.960]  this is sensational information for liberty and exposing tyranny but it's
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.360]  there's just so much of it it's all just kind of blurbed out we've got Schmidt
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.280]  caught on video and photos we've got them the head of Google we've got them
[47:27.280 --> 47:31.800]  with you know files falling out clearly doing official business that needs to be
[47:31.800 --> 47:35.240]  investigated there's already criminal investigations in England this puts it
[47:35.240 --> 47:38.640]  over the top balls with official files going in claiming they're having
[47:38.640 --> 47:42.440]  impromptu cocktail parties clearly they're setting policy we need articles on
[47:42.440 --> 47:49.320]  that they're deciding the future of NSA spying worldwide that's come out in
[47:49.320 --> 47:52.760]  their agenda that should be investigated policies being set that's
[47:52.760 --> 47:59.800]  really the angle that should be looked at here and their anti-human move to cut
[47:59.800 --> 48:05.440]  the pension funds and not give vets care and to quote cut entitlements yeah they
[48:05.440 --> 48:10.840]  can cut entitlements how about their banker bailouts first you see these are
[48:10.840 --> 48:16.080]  the people setting the agenda and we've got bombshell HD video and photos we
[48:16.080 --> 48:20.680]  did all condensed and boiled down into one big article dealing with official
[48:20.680 --> 48:24.600]  business being set and there needs to be a serious investigation and the people
[48:24.600 --> 48:27.600]  need to push for it that's what the independent and others are saying we're
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.000]  the Bilderberg experts we need the big articles on this and the videos on this
[48:32.000 --> 48:38.040]  boiling it all together now we're gonna go to break in a few minutes but I want
[48:38.040 --> 48:42.920]  to come back right now after the break to David Knight for 15 minutes of the
[48:42.920 --> 48:48.440]  next hour and kind of go over all the stuff that's been breaking at info wars
[48:48.440 --> 48:54.520]  calm and prison planet calm but I need to watch it and others to do that big
[48:54.520 --> 49:00.480]  article now now's the time for over the weekend to really boil down that why
[49:00.480 --> 49:05.760]  this is bad we're gonna go break in a moment I first want to say something we
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.280]  fund this operation selling incredibly high quality stainless steel gravity
[49:10.280 --> 49:13.320]  fed filters that cut off the glyphosates and fluoride and annihilate the
[49:13.320 --> 49:16.320]  competition and my point is there's just no reason to buy any other water
[49:16.320 --> 49:20.440]  filter but propure with a g2.0 for the price is the same price as the
[49:20.440 --> 49:25.680]  competitor or lower with 10% off promo code water and it'll help you and your
[49:25.680 --> 49:30.600]  family at a massive level and it'll fund this vicious truth-telling open bias
[49:30.600 --> 49:38.360]  towards truth open pro human pro god pro family pro honor and chivalry we need
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.680]  your support and you get a great product at the same time info or store.com
[49:42.680 --> 49:48.840]  we only got a few thousand test run bottles the super feminine vitality
[49:48.840 --> 49:54.120]  it's almost sold out it will be sold out by next week and it will probably take
[49:54.120 --> 49:57.240]  three weeks to a month to get more of it and we're having even bigger responses
[49:57.240 --> 50:01.440]  with women's energy work out libido with this than men have a super male and
[50:01.440 --> 50:05.760]  super male had a bigger effect on women and we didn't know why I guess women are
[50:05.760 --> 50:09.320]  more sensitive of these herbs now with the feminine one for women it's even

[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.480]  operating in official capacity that may mean in his country that's not illegal I
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.840]  doubt that when he said we're not trying to prop up the euro he said no nine
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.400]  with what shows they are that's what they're really trying to do that's their

[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:06.720]  that's it that's the advantage of having no cameras inside this is no
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.280]  transparency that the advantage is that everybody can speak freely and this do
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.000]  you know what happens to worry that when people it's such a government
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.280]  and people like this is never happen for folks what's happening right now in
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.120]  front of banks at the meeting I think he's even violating internal agreement

[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.760]  completely but more free no more freedom when the camera I love it that
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.040]  politicians having frank and free discussion but not in front of them
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.320]  Lazarus or Goldman Sachs yeah no it's even better it's even better because we
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:02.600]  should know because we talk about we talk as the trend no as politicians I
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.960]  talk about as a politician worried about banks I talk about the need for
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.440]  asking about live or and carbon taxes tell David to do that or put the earpiece
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.600]  in it can you tell us have you talked about live or the live or scandal or
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.400]  carbon taxes no I think the library I think the library set a scandal is a
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:27.720]  good example of banks not behaving yeah it's a good example who is on the
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.160]  steering committee actually had to resign from a CEO bring up the law
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.680]  scandal and Prince Bernhard that'll hit him hard there was a Dutch bank with
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.680]  us very trusted now the guy who started this Prince Bernhard he was caught up
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.480]  in a Lockheed scandal yeah do you know about that I know about it but it was
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.160]  in the 70s I mean I read it but it was before I was born next
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.480]  well you know before you were born they plotted the the euro as well as the
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.920]  European Union I think that was that was that was

[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.560]  job I'm just I'm not saying you planted I'm saying that the Bilderberg did so we
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.000]  believe that there's real policy being crafted here maybe not in the discussion
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.600]  groups that you're part of policies crafted the Bilderberg brag to the
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.400]  German news last week they're the most powerful and they do set policy throw it

[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.480]  felt that this was far more important than Davos that Davos was just a PR group
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:34.480]  I wasn't the Davos but I think it's not it's it's it's a similar type of

[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.080]  all right David Knight is there talking to the leader of the parliament of the
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:40.200]  Netherlands there's a Bilderberg member talking to them through the fence this
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:46.400]  is unprecedented let's go to the feed oh I just want to ask you a quick question
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:51.320]  okay that was there was a question does privacy exist have they answered that
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.800]  question yet because we have we have exactly we have a former head of the
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.800]  NSA and CIA are there it will be on the next days
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:09.760]  okay I'm normally this discouraged to take out to the media anything that
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.480]  happens in here well I'm not yeah exactly nobody likes why why have you
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.840]  approached me are you breaking protocol no no no I'm not breaking protocol I'm
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.400]  allowed to do this I'm a former Greenpeace activist maybe that's why I
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:28.040]  understand what happens when you when you stand outside after behind the gate
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:33.200]  well thank you for talking to us appreciate it thank you so much all right
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.640]  Alex I'm president and give us your take on what we missed during break well
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.760]  he was the labor leader what was the country that he was from Holland yeah for
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:47.320]  the Netherlands the Netherlands so so that social Democrat labor leader he said
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:50.680]  he had been a former Greenpeace activist so that's why he wanted to come out and
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.640]  talk to us he said he knows what it's like to be on the outside let me get here
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:59.840]  date Rick Sam some yes yes that's correct now you know Alex we we've we've
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.640]  talked to him and we had the video of George ball with all of the fun the
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.040]  paper files and I think it's kind of interesting that he had so many paper
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.200]  files because one of the things that they're talking about here is does
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.480]  privacy exist and he said I asked him about that he says well that's the
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.200]  next meeting that's coming up right now so they're gonna find out if privacy
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.760]  exists and balls knows privacy doesn't exist that's why he's got all of his
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.840]  stuff down on volume after volume of paperwork because that's the only thing
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.640]  that security more why because of men like the former NSA chief Keith
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.720]  Alexander and David Petraeus because they have basically penetrated
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.400]  everybody's personal and private information that includes these people
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.040]  so they put this stuff on paper they meet in secret face-to-face so they can
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.360]  say the things that they can try can't transmit via email so that's that's
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.360]  what's going on here essentially and the story that this morning the key story
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.520]  this morning was not what's people asking what's going on inside of
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.280]  Bilderberg it wasn't even the Danish people asking why are we spending
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.400]  millions equivalent of millions of dollars on security here because they
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  put up a massive amount of barricades concrete barricades they worked
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.720]  you know essentially 24 hours I mean they work through the night because we
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:22.520]  were here late at night that first feed that we did and most of these barricades
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.960]  were put up after we left and we we probably didn't leave till about 9
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.320]  9 p.m. here this time and so they've got a massive amount of security
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.440]  infrastructure here as well as a massive amount of police officers it's
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.520]  costing them a fortune they didn't ask about that the lead story Alex today
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.800]  was info wars criticizing the police for the way they arrested that fellow
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.840]  where they're not hit they used excessive force that was a lead story this
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.440]  morning we came down here early this morning Karen was over in the
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.120]  photography area where she'd been successful getting joggers we figured
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:00.040]  we'd get some people before they were doing morning jogs before breakfast and
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.320]  evidently they'd seen the picture of David Petraeus so we didn't get any
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.320]  joggers what we did get was a journalist from the leading television
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.480]  station here in Denmark it's channel 2 and his name is Christian Ring Hansen
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.000]  Holt journalist and political correspondent and what he wanted to do
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.720]  was to talk to us and to essentially defend the police he thought we had
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:28.120]  over criticized the actions that took place ignoring what happened to Josh
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.400]  Karen brought that up you know the fact that he was accosted by the police they
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.880]  wanted all of his identity papers please because he was merely carrying a
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.960]  camera through the hotel lobby that we were staying in he wasn't taking any
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.080]  pictures somebody reported him as a suspicious person so they tracked him
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.360]  down that happened before any of the reports went up but evidently this was
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.720]  the number one news story we've seen this happen before when they went to
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.960]  Bilderberg in England what they did was they singled out the the protester that
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.320]  was the craziest dressed and they made it about that so there weren't that many
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.080]  protesters this year so what they did was they made it a story about us
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:10.120]  covering the arrest and what we feel is excessive force we've uploaded a report
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.080]  or at least it was uploading before we came over here my response to it I
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.760]  basically addressed the Danish people said you need to have a discussion as to
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.280]  what excessive force is we really haven't had that discussion sufficiently in
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.080]  America yet but the same people who are meeting over here are going to be
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:30.040]  selling military industrial complex type weapons are going to be selling the
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:35.440]  police surveillance state equipment to the Danish police as well as they do to
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:39.080]  the American again folks that worldwide if you just joined us David Knight is
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.680]  reporting live from Copenhagen Denmark site of Bilderberg 2014 the event is now
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:53.720]  in full swing and the unprecedented issue is for me the fact that we had a
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:00.160]  Bilderberg group member the head of the Dutch parliament which is a prime mover
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.640]  in Europe and of course the Dutch founded Bilderberg Prince Bernhardt
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.640]  literally coming over the talk to the press for 20 minutes and answering a
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.200]  lot of our questions and you notice I brought up one of Estaline's internal
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:18.520]  points that is sourced they're gonna be discussing the NSA and the spy grid
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:23.360]  noticed that he said oh yes that meeting is coming up now so the truth is
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.360]  they've got all these governments and industry heads in there to agree with
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:31.160]  each other the set policy Bilderberg has bragged about that just a week and a
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.840]  half ago in the German paper by name one of the members so we have that balls
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.920]  because he's violating as the deputy prime minister of England the shadow
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:46.320]  prime minister as they call him he's violating their law our politicians are
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.440]  violating the Logan Act Hillary got fined for this back in 96 they need to
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.360]  get in trouble this information needs to come out and look how far we've come
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.000]  David Knight from no coverage of Bilderberg a decade ago in mainstream
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.160]  media to now it's all over us news it's a major issue drudge report calm they'll
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.640]  break that Berlin wall covering our stuff the last six years carrying our
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.680]  Bilderberg coverage the US was the last place ever report on this they would
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.160]  make fun of it and go Alex Jones and other nuts believe there's something
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.240]  called a Bilderberg group with elites meeting to take over no no they already
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.040]  took over most the world now they're trying to put smart meters in my house
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:29.080]  and gouge me now they want my car to drive itself and tax me now they say my
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.640]  kids belong to them now they want the pension funds now they want to take the
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.840]  veterans pensions and then again it's not like it's even mismanagement they
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.080]  want to take them they openly want to take them to make people poor under a
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.840]  gender 21 and Bilderberg doesn't run at all it's one of their key meeting
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:51.720]  conferences where they are at and then they go and the same people that run
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.440]  Bilderberg run trial lateral and they run the other major groups in other
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.800]  countries like the Royal Institute of International Affairs the everyone in
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.320]  Bilderberg all the major members the steadfast members not the guests that
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:07.240]  come the 20 or 30 each year but the 115 or so long-time members all of them head
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.040]  up and share other governmental and non-governmental organizations and
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.200]  corporate groups on record and then line their pockets with trillions they've
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.840]  been caught over and over again we will we listed the Lockheed Defense
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:24.120]  Department scams all of it and people keep asking are they setting policy
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:29.560]  does it violate this and that law yes of course it does you know did generals
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.840]  and second you know they were falsifying reports nationwide that troops had gotten
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.680]  treatment they hadn't yes that's a top-down order like fast and furious so
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:44.280]  that's the issue you're not covering it up anymore we're gonna point at the
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.120]  illegitimate corporate fascist government that in the words of
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.400]  Congressman Larry McDonald is super capitalist merging with communism
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.960]  controlled by very few China is their model China is their dream world where
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.200]  everybody's a slave except one-tenth of one-tenth of a percent who are
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.080]  billionaires and live in armored compounds and eat organic food how is it
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.760]  that billionaire Chinese generals run a communist country because it's not it's
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.560]  Bilderberg government that's what it is and I don't want to live under it these
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.160]  are the people that run our politicians that want our guns David Knight the
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.760]  that's the issue and this is a huge victory I wouldn't let them get you off
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:31.720]  balance diverting off into police and stuff go ahead no no no that's what what
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.040]  I was what the point I know you were you were you were saying that I understand
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.040]  well what they're doing is the media of course is not covering the substance of
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.400]  Bilderberg or asking any questions about the expense of Bilderberg
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.480]  instead what they do is they focus on us because we're the only media here
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.600]  there's not that many protesters so instead of focusing on a crazy
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:53.040]  protester they talk about that but the thing with Ed Balls now he's the shadow
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.760]  chancellor of the Exchequer but the actual chancellor of the Exchequer
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.800]  George Osborne is here and that's essentially equivalent to the Treasury
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.520]  Secretary in the US so this is the person who the bankers want to interface
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.760]  with this is the financial person and it's all about what the bankers are doing
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.920]  with everyone and as we saw the the tremendous amount of paperwork that he
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:19.040]  had there again Martha Stewart was made a poster child for insider trading and
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.640]  yet our own congressmen are trading as insider trading and yet nothing happens
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.000]  with that when people noticed it made a stink about it they put a law out and
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.640]  before the law took effect they eviscerated that law so they still
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.240]  are doing insider trading nobody's paying attention to it they thought it was a
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.560]  it was a scandal that was a blip on the radar they passed some legislation that
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.600]  really wasn't effective they then took even that away and everybody thinks well
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.240]  it's done it's finished this is what we're talking about with insider trading
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.000]  this is where the politicians are meeting in secret with these people and
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.440]  whether or not this this fellow that came out and was was a transparent enough
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.520]  to talk to us and candid to talk to us whether or not he's been involved in
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.280]  that whether or not they're not I'm sure they're not doing that in the no he's
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.320]  a rising star now runs their parliament of course is the type they're gonna bring
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.480]  in because he can end up being the main leader of the country now let's expand
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.800]  on this though David because when we come back I want to break down more of
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.760]  what we're learning about their secret agenda from Esteline we've also been
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.280]  able to confirm we have an article coming out on that today but but you guys
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.120]  have done an incredible job and everybody else in the media the real media has
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:28.920]  because look Beldenberg members never come over and talk to people especially
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.720]  during the conference this is a big deal and it shows that they know ignoring us
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.280]  isn't working anymore no it's not no they've tried to do more transparency last
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:42.200]  year I think they released I maybe it was you can correct me if I'm wrong I
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.800]  think it was the first time they had released a an official list of attendees
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.480]  it was done after the event this year they did an official list of attendees
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.920]  before the event they acknowledged that they were having it before the event
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.800]  here so they have tried to be a little that's right that's right it's got cut

[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:14.600]  I tend to get pretty wound up when I'm watching my reporters my great
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.520]  reporters our great reporters your reporters we're all part of the info
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.480]  war if we're against the globalist out there in the streets and Bilderberg
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.400]  guys are popping up and the police are popping up and I'm like a dog running
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:33.560]  around a butcher shop not knowing which filet mignon or chateau brignon or or
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:40.000]  you know cutlet I want because there's just so much going on it's such a
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.840]  target-rich environment and it just as David said they're trying to distract
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:51.280]  off into me going look at that the police drag a guy behind the fence
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.080]  clearly you're stomping on him and hitting him and then they chase another
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:00.800]  reporter away we need to know where that guy went now it turns out that guy was
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.760]  yelling and screaming at people and stirring stuff up and getting in our
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.560]  face and saying horrible things about me which makes it kind of comical in a
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.760]  way that the cops came over to grab somebody and take them and it looks like
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:18.240]  beat them up because they were messing with our reporters but still maybe he
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.880]  resisted them or something behind the thing it just doesn't look good to have
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.400]  the cops I don't want to be drugged behind a curtain and then and you see
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.960]  through a six-inch gap them stomping and hitting him and and even if somebody's
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.520]  yelling and screaming and getting in my face the cops should tell them back off
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.880]  don't get in the fight and then we do it again arrest them and I guess if he
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:41.880]  resist I guess beat them up I mean I you know so if we're wrong we apologize the
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.400]  police we'd already said that the police overall were being pretty good other
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.400]  than messing with our reporters a few times and wanting their IDs and stuff
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.920]  but compared to a lot of police around the world I mean it you know they're
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.800]  pretty good and then I saw that scene and all I was seeing was that scene it
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.680]  looked pretty bad to me and later I said well maybe it's not that bad but not
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.080]  because the guy was messing with us and the police did this but because I
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.920]  learned that some said he might have been resisting still doesn't look good to
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.440]  me when they chase the other reporter away that's trying to get footage I
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.720]  think that's where the police going to the wrong does it mean they're monsters
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.840]  no I don't think so okay somebody's yelling screaming at you and shoving on
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:27.400]  you want to punch them in the face I get it the point is is that is that the
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.360]  police need to be at a higher standard ladies and gentlemen or we turn into
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.880]  North Korea okay now I'm saying let's not get distracted by that now we're
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.000]  spending all day on it the point is is that the media the story is they are
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.360]  trying to change the subject to that because what can they do we've defeated
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.760]  them here's the Bilderberg group we're gonna continue to expose it now it's
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.920]  gonna look at all the other influence peddling all the other secret meanings
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.280]  and all the other stuff that's going on I mean we've got it balls we'll show the
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.120]  video you're a TV viewer you go to info wars.com for slash show see the free
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:03.160]  feed we've you see a big all seeing eye pyramid on the site and people are like
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.920]  what is this Illuminati oh my god yes folks we're programming you for the
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.960]  Illuminati no it's only my minority of folks saying that it's the Bilderberg
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.360]  coverage just like Drudge has a pyramid on there symbolizing the elite at the
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.560]  top for the Bilderberg coverage we have it as the Bilderberg coverage is just an
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.880]  icon associated with the New World Order it says New World Order on the dollar
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:27.400]  bill under the all seeing eye you go there that's the Bilderberg coverage page
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.480]  where we bold on a lot of it there's also breaking news on the front page we've
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.640]  got two big reports coming out later today with the secret agenda we've gotten
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:42.600]  that we've confirmed this is big and on these the the fact that they're
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.160]  definitely setting policy inside of there David other points and other
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.320]  reports you're about to file other things that you've seen unfold since we
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:55.680]  talked yesterday well Alex you know just briefly touching on that my point was
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.160]  was that the guy who came down here and talked to us was a political consultant
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.520]  and so I would expect that he would be covering Bilderberg but instead he tried
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.720]  to make the story about us that was the point I was trying to make as well as
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.960]  the fact that that I do have a report why address what happened I saw some
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.680]  additional footage of of the arrest over here and there were some elements there
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:18.240]  that I have seen in the in the US once the person is on the ground subdued you
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.800]  know the cops basically standing on them with an E in the back that type of thing
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:26.800]  you know I just have zero tolerance for that kind of abuse and as you said the
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.360]  police need to be held to a higher standard I understand whether you're
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.480]  physical with somebody they start to get into that but what's happening here
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:36.680]  of course they're coming periodically coming out here on the terrace and
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.880]  that's where we've been able to get some pictures of conference attendees we
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.240]  actually got a picture of Eric Schmidt eating earlier and so now we know that
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:50.880]  he has not made the singularity jump yet to a robotic body but that's an
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.120]  important thing to know it's not there yet you know they're still sticking to
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:29:00.920]  their 2025 schedule I guess and we also saw him on the phone presumably an
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:06.000]  android but they're coming out and in such tight quarters because I think
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.680]  they did put some limitations on them you know in a town like this that's
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:13.240]  crowded even though this area is kind of sparsely populated it is a seaside area
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.280]  and they were meeting on a day yesterday was a national holiday here in Denmark so
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:22.840]  I think that wound up having these barricades fairly close and so as they
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.920]  walk out on these terraces it's the only place that they can go to get outside
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.480]  the hotel we can photograph them as they come out and go jogging we can
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:32.440]  photograph them that's why we've been able to get the kind of pictorial
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.120]  coverage that we have but that's pretty unprecedented for somebody to say this
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.120]  is one of the most successful years for Bilderberg coverage ever is Watson there
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.560]  with you right now yes he is good I want to come back and finish up with you
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.320]  David and then I want to talk to Paul and and get all the developments he's been
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.040]  saying oh he's been working on some other stories we're on the March the
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:58.320]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and I'm pointing out it's big they don't want
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.400]  you know they exist want to hide a chemical spill contaminating the water
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:07.520]  supply in nine West Virginia counties this year alone over 300,000 people in
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.040]  West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate what are the health effects
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.800]  of having these drugs in our drinking water it's forced medical treatment
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.400]  without the consent of residents my friends water filtration is one of the
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.680]  most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.520]  harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water on average the county said it

[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.520]  shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.040]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.800]  chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.640]  United States well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.320]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.440]  with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:39.080]  statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:42.600]  to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight

[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:22.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:37.960]  infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones you know I don't engage in Monty Python
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:42.920]  style humor or gutter humor but we had a big double-on tondra earlier talking
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:47.560]  about Ed Balls was I'll say get the clips ready get the Obama clips ready get
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:54.800]  the bush clips ready I go get both of the clips of Ed ready it was a big joke in
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.120]  there in the studio but while we're trying to get Paul Watson and David
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:04.840]  night skypre connected it's almost like it's being jammed it just won't connect
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.160]  either totally clear it won't connect while we're trying to line that up to
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:12.280]  Copenhagen if not just just go to phone in about five minutes default to phone
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:19.920]  let them know that if it's not working he is the shadow chancellor of the ex
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:24.760]  checker and there if such as parliamentary power-sharing you can have
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.680]  multiple you know basically members that are over it but he's also when I was
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:32.320]  there in England they were calling him the shadow prime minister because he
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.720]  does a lot of work in his party with David Cameron the prime minister but
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:42.320]  the point is he's coming in with big giant files and the police are wanting
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:49.080]  to see his ID and he does look like a really sneaky crazy person in person I
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:54.680]  mean he looks okay on TV when I saw him in person at the BBC studio when I went
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.560]  in to be on TV next he was coming off we have that clip come up in a moment he
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.680]  you know did look like he didn't look as distinguished as some of the other
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.560]  globalist I think that's why the police didn't believe anything he was saying
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.920]  it made him to show a whole bunch of forms of ID and make phone calls with
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:15.600]  his assistant on top of everything else which I'm sure is an elitist he didn't
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.480]  like happening but that footage of those files he needs to say what was in those
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.600]  files because you notice the Guardian reporter was talking to him earlier
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.760]  talking to Bilderberg remember that came over and was talking to our people to
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.280]  the fence unprecedented as they realized their covers blown the leader of the
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:39.440]  major Labor Party and the leader of the Parliament in the Netherlands in the
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:50.160]  Dutch Federation she was bringing up your setting policy in there and he said
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:56.040]  yes we are setting policy we are discussing policy in there and that's
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:01.240]  illegal in most countries so they won't oh no no all these billionaires and
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.560]  royalty and people meet in a secret and do all this because we're discussing our
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.000]  golf swing and we play golf on Sunday afternoon after the three-day conference
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.040]  is over then we leave on Monday and you know nothing's going on at the event so
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:21.280]  let's go to the clip here I am asking balls about what they're doing at
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.960]  Bilderberg and then we've got Watson when he leaves out in the hallway Watson gets
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.480]  him again so here is that clip from last year in London can I shake your hand
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.560]  Mr. Balls can I shake your hand hey I'm Alex Jones I've kind of led the
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:38.200]  demonstrations no no no they could see you why can't you guys talk about
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:43.040]  Bilderberg the rules of these things are all decided by
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:48.720]  people you know for a long time I mean it is a corporate world government I'll
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:37:04.040]  go down your head all right thank you there you go talk to the builder all right
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:09.600]  there I am now let's go to the next video clip as balls walks out we get him
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:20.840]  twice Watson hits him I mean hi Ed nice to meet you how are you what did you talk
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:27.240]  about Bilderberg yeah yeah yeah come on break any ministerial code give us a
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.920]  word please make it a ministerial code yeah I'm not a meeting with secret private
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.880]  meetings I'm not a minister yeah but you meet your conspiring with private
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:42.840]  individuals gonna do a freedom of information that request who did you
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:51.800]  meet with the Eric Schmidt what do you think of Alex Jones don't be silly break
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:57.040]  any ministerial code yes so again the last thing they want is their private
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.840]  secret meetings becoming an event a paparazzi because see then people won't
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:08.240]  care about whatever her name is baby Kim Kardashian's baby they will start
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.880]  caring again like we did a hundred years ago about the robber barons and what are
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.240]  they up to and how are they trying to get tax money there's a high-deaf video
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.680]  that our crew got David Knight Josh Owens Paul Watson Karen Knight just an
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:28.080]  incredible job and a crew out there I tell you we should be absolutely a
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.960]  static I don't say this most years I said it last year in the year before it's
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.360]  getting better and better David do you think I'm being too optimistic but or is
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.080]  this really a big victory that a Bilderberg group came over and talked to
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.080]  you member that we're getting all this high-deaf footage that it's all over the
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:48.280]  news that a lot of even US publications are saying yeah this looks pretty serious
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.880]  why is it this being covered I mean they're going now from ignoring it to
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:55.920]  laughing at us and admitting it's real to not laughing at us only a few
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.520]  publications called us people that believe in space aliens and lizards I
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.120]  think the evening standard did that now sure the Dutch media is trying to
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:06.960]  distract off into are we reporting on the police accurate that doesn't matter
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.640]  the elephant in the room as you're saying is this global governance meeting
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:15.640]  that's right Alex and you know I'm glad that he came out and talked to us and
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:21.360]  of course he's a politician he's a leader of a major party perhaps the majority
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.440]  party in Holland I'm not sure what they are Netherlands I'm not sure what the
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.520]  the politics are there but the interesting thing to me is that the
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:34.000]  mayor of Atlanta is here now you know I understand why the leader of the Labor
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.200]  Party in the Netherlands is here I don't understand why the mayor of Atlanta is
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:42.280]  here what is he an expert on well he's major presidential material seem read
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:49.480]  exactly he made me also only Atlanta and Austin and one other city I forget
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:53.360]  which one I was reading like a I think a Wall Street Journal article a few months
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.200]  ago halfway and it was describing that Austin Atlanta and only one other city
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.760]  are known as mega growth cities where a lot of money is being made in real
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.720]  estate you name it and the elite like investments just like the year before
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:12.640]  they did the pump and dump with Facebook they had Zuckerberg there and then
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.840]  he's not been there the other years you know to decide how they all got into the
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.520]  hundred billion dollar scam which was an admitted pump and dump so it's the same
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.440]  thing over and over again I mean they're probably running Bitcoin you know the
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:29.760]  point is they're in there as businessmen running getting all the inside intel and
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.760]  deciding things that's why I think they've got the mayor there because he's
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.560]  an up-and-comer and they want to get preferential treatment with their
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.120]  projects in Atlanta go ahead yeah exactly I hope as he's a politician maybe
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.320]  he would want to have the transparency to come out here talk to us and and we
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:49.720]  could ask him is he auditioning to be a puppet president or is it that he's
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:54.400]  handing them some sweet deals on real estate that they can pick up in Atlanta
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.720]  a growth city that's a good point Alex exactly and expanding on that David
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.040]  night again at Copenhagen Denmark covering Bilderberg 2014 they always do
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:07.480]  things that cover a bunch of bases and it just popped in my head Atlanta is in
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.720]  the North American Treaty Agreement under spec the the preliminary agreed
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:17.480]  upon capital of the North American Union and they're looking at it perhaps
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:25.200]  being the new main global capital even above New Yorker or Tokyo or London and
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.720]  so I know that as well that the Atlanta they think is very special for a bunch
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:36.560]  of reasons I didn't know that but yeah it's even fairly close to the Georgia
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.960]  guide stones to I guess they can go there and and have an outing and worship
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.960]  their their plan to depopulate the world also they are pretty racist and
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.880]  anti-Africa and destroying Africa and destabilizing it on record and Prince
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  Bernhard got caught with World Wildlife Fund fronts that he ran using it as a
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:58.320]  front to hunt animals and and and and sell that you could make hundreds of
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:02.920]  millions off of sell their tusk and things and for diamond running and
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.520]  money laundering remember he got caught not just the Lockheed scandal the king
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:12.040]  of well he was married to the Queens who's the prince the German prince who
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.140]  the SS officers she married so I'm sure you got 80 yellow words I don't know
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:20.480]  if he did but most Nazis actually get them like like George Soros that's a
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:26.200]  side issue they probably again for political correctness now because they
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:31.040]  are being watched oh this guy gonna be in president he's in Atlanta he's black
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:36.560]  let's bring him up I think that's part of it too yeah yeah absolutely well I'm
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.560]  interested to talk to some of the people here in Denmark and actually I was able
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.560]  to find a place where there were a lot of people because around here it's very
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:47.720]  sparsely populated as you saw the first report we did you you ask is this the
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.160]  Omega man movie because the streets were totally deserted but we did find a
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.880]  place where there's a lot of people like a shopping zone or whatever tourist zone
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:01.120]  so I do want to ask them some questions about their take on the euro and as well
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.440]  as the EU I know they don't like the euro they rejected it even though they
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.000]  hopped into the European Union at a fairly early date and hey if Karen ever
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.280]  wants your wife's doing photography for us she's got some of the great photos and
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.400]  some of these globalists folks will find it real Alex Jones on Twitter and info
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:21.040]  wars.com prisonplanet.com we've got some big master coverage articles again
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:24.440]  boiling all this down coming out later this afternoon but but if she wants to
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.560]  pop in later or do some YouTube reports giving her perspective on what she's
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.360]  seen and we would love to talk to her David Knight we'll get more updates for
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.560]  you tonight on the nightly news and throughout the weekend and then
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.960]  obviously next week you're gonna be co-hosting in studio at least three of
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.840]  the five days I told him to tell you this a few days ago if you're able to do
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.160]  it then you can take off the next week if you want you've been working really
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:54.200]  hard but if not I will see you back here sometime the week after that. My only
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:58.160]  concern is the flights it was such a Keystone cop thing coming out here but
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:02.680]  with the weather cancellations and then the other cancellations missing our
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:06.160]  flights having our luggage lost I mean it was it was a pretty amazing trip out
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.840]  here hopefully it'll be more normal when we go back. It must be nice for the guys
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:13.400]  that have to go through TSA all those elitist on their wide-body private jets
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:19.280]  with their top-of-the-line hookers taxpayer paid for in most cases must be
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.640]  fun for them to not have to go through all that. Yeah but you know Alex remember
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.080]  when we went through that turnstile the other day I mean we were immediately into
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.160]  a metal detectors and you know put your bags over here to be checked so maybe
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.720]  they have a walk around for the attendees and maybe that's just for the
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.600]  hotel staff I don't know what that was but I was surprised to see that at a
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.280]  Bilderberg meeting when we first walked in there. I'm interested in it but again
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:45.160]  we're blowing the shadow government wide open we're gonna get Paul Watson on
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.200]  now thank you very much David Knight. Okay all right and again folks so many
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:55.040]  different angles of this he's gonna get set up with Paul Watson now but it's a
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:59.280]  big deal I know I keep saying that they don't want us to think of it as a big
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:03.760]  deal that's the main talking point there is a corporateist world government if
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.880]  you go to the front page of info wars.com you'll see one of the great
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.160]  graphics our crew put together and it says Bilderberg 2014 the drive of the
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:17.480]  Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:23.120]  super capitalism and communism under the same tent all under their control
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:30.160]  Congressman Larry P. McDonald who was a Democrat who was a libertarian who was
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.120]  super good-looking super smart super patriot they were so scared of him he
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.400]  was gonna be president folks and they had his plane forced down by the Russians
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:42.960]  in North Korea and the word is they tortured the hell out everybody on that
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:47.440]  plane they stopped the plane and then what was it in Alaska and got the
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.480]  speaker of the house everybody else off he's like what's going on you just go
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:56.360]  on you just you go just you just head on to your mission to Asia and they were
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:03.240]  so he was that leader of the John Burke Society I mean on every front Larry P.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.360]  McDonald ladies and gentlemen was beyond Ron Paul because Ron Paul's smart a
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:15.400]  statesman great but not really a fiery speaker and and he he's great speaker and
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:21.560]  a statesman and more of a Gandolfian type guy but when you look at the art
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:26.000]  type of Larry P. McDonald I would have loved to have gotten to meet somebody
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  like that I mean you could just tell he was the real deal cared about this
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.760]  country was a hard charger was calling him out you can see a Larry P. McDonald
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:40.160]  debate about the CFR on hardball we ought to air that sometime from the 80s I
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:46.400]  mean it's just amazing how on his feet he was how well-spoken I just and they
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.600]  killed him and the word is word is they kept him alive quite a while they did
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.400]  not like him so he's just a hero they they got him folks they they really
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:01.000]  tortured the hell out of that guy from the Intel I've got and they wanted to
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.960]  know because again he had a plan with a lot of other Patriots their Patriots in
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.320]  the establishment there are people that don't want to turn the world over to
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.920]  pure evil he was known for his staunch opposition to Communism and believed in
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:15.480]  a long-standing covert efforts by the Trilateral Commission and other powerful
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.000]  groups to bring about socialism and world government he was the second
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:25.680]  president of the John Burt society and also a cousin to George S. Patton and
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.000]  they also killed Patton I've interviewed the guy that the hitman at
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.040]  Kildon and the author and it's what the military all said happened they shot
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:40.240]  him with a big high-powered air gun with a big slug in it so wouldn't even
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.320]  wouldn't even penetrate him it would just break his neck try them right this
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:47.960]  you know wrecked a train parked the car in front of it shot him and he still
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.400]  held on they went and poisoning the death because he didn't want to you know
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.600]  build up the Soviet Union it's just it never ends of course the family knew
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:00.880]  about that let's go to Paul Joseph Watson Paul thank you for joining us
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.160]  from Bilderberg 2014 what do you take away from what's happening and what
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:11.160]  you've witnessed I like to be right the first thing to mention is obviously the
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.400]  footage we got last night while we uploaded last night got the article out
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.200]  this morning which was the shadow chancellor of Great Britain Ed Balls
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:25.360]  who of course we confronted last year in Watson in England he was denied entry
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:29.360]  to Bilderberg naturally this has generated a lot of media attention London
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.920]  Guardian independent of picks up our video he didn't have his credentials he
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.240]  couldn't get into the meeting so he was stood there talking to police for several
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.720]  minutes while they tried to check his credentials what was interesting to me
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.560]  of course is he had this giant bag full of files thick files literally you know
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:54.440]  two dozen files so to say that Bilderberg is a mere talking shop as much of
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:58.920]  the mainstream media and it's clearly some type of voting agenda package for
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.200]  the heads of committees I'll I bet my right arm it's heads of committees
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.800]  voting packages for corporate minutes where they make decisions in a corporate
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.840]  boardroom it's an illegal shadow criminal corporate boardroom and they bragged
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:16.880]  out of the other side of their mouth that that is what they do go ahead walk
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:23.920]  Paul well he's obviously giving some kind of presentation and the chancellor
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:27.200]  of the Exchequer George Osborne is also there his so-called opposite in the
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:31.640]  Conservative Party so they're scheming together when they're supposedly on
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.640]  opposite sides of the political fence so we got that video up it's since been
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:40.360]  picked up by the God in the independent and others that was a major coup of
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.720]  course then we were down here in the afternoon when some of the Bilderberg
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:47.920]  members were coming out after their first conference in the morning we are etienne
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:54.920]  Davignon we got James Wolfenston Google CEO CEO Eric Schmidt they didn't stay out
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:59.120]  for long they obviously knew we were here they kind of moved away from us when
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:04.600]  they saw Rose they turned away from us moved further back up so obviously as
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:08.760]  you probably know now there's a huge group of them right outside schmoozing
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:14.200]  into the evening hours well I would like to continue into the next hour then get
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:17.960]  an update from you guys at the bottom of the hour if you're still able who got
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.840]  that great HD of Schmidt and all them sitting around with world leaders
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.720]  obviously drinking and making decisions because that is just amazing footage and
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.480]  I want to get some more of that I know we sent some telephoto lenses how are you
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.320]  guys able to get this I can see I can see Wolfenston over there smoking a
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:40.920]  cigar I mean that is with Etienne Davignon isn't that the head of Fiat
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:45.720]  and that they had a fiat right there who's getting Jeep putting his jacket on
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:51.400]  go ahead it's hard the guy stood up behind Wolfenston is Etienne Davignon
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:56.120]  of course he was the guy who bragged in 1999 that the Euro single currency was a
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:02.200]  brainchild of Bilderberg we're gonna come right back to stay there amazing

[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.640]  get more IDF footage of the meeting that is powerful information we're
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:04.680]  exposing the true shadow controllers they want us fighting with each other
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:09.640]  over religion sex region while they the globalist meet and steal literally
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.160]  trillions a year in banker bailouts exempt themselves from regulation that's
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:16.880]  what's really going on in these operations we're going back to Paul
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:24.160]  Watson with other observations and points that he's made Paul Joseph Watson yeah
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:29.000]  there was another incident while we were down here filming over in the protest
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.360]  area I know a delegate came out earlier on the show to talk to us but there was
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.720]  a separate delegate a Dutch politician who came out of the Bilderberg group
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.780]  meeting and went to over to talk to the protesters we weren't there Julia was
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:46.360]  there so you should probably get her on after the next segment or whatever and it
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:51.480]  was a it was a kind of olive branch as far as I understand it but it's Samson
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:54.920]  is the leader of the Labor Party we were able to get in on that unless it was
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:59.840]  another Dutch one and and and yeah they're basically starting to mainline
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:03.440]  themselves was it somebody other than Dietrich Samson that that's unprecedented
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:08.200]  it what it was the same guy but it was in a different area he went out to the
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:13.000]  protest camp and start speaking to those people so well definitely being
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:18.920]  dispatched to for public relations purposes by the sounds of it very
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:22.680]  interesting again Paul I've been interrupting other points that are
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:28.160]  important well we've just been going back and forth from here to the hotel
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:31.800]  basically uploading the videos getting the articles out tomorrow is going to be
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:36.520]  interesting because obviously there are no conferences no meetings inside the
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:41.040]  hotel as far as we know it on Saturday or at least very few so they could go on
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.440]  a little walkabout which might be might present some options so we're looking
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:51.160]  forward to that tomorrow could be very interesting absolutely tomorrow we've
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.280]  got to hunt them in the First Amendment in free speech and but we will be
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.560]  hunting them to try to get the questions and we'll probably only get one or two
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:03.680]  questions the best tactic is to say hi Eric Schmidt or oh are you with the
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:09.040]  conference and get their hand reach out get their hand and once you've got their
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.120]  hand don't let go of it that's what I did with Ed Balls last year I was like hey
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:17.760]  Ed nice to meet you rather than just going in you know confrontational from
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.840]  the off because you know I want to talk to them I want to hear what they've got
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.840]  to say you know if you go into aggressive they're just immediately back
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.600]  away and you know we're not aggressive we're just trying to get information
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:32.720]  trying to talk to them but in terms of media coverage it's gone from a trickle
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:37.480]  to starting to become a deluge a lot of reports many of which are quite straight
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:41.160]  and positive a few of which are just horrible I mean there was a telegraph
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.640]  article which was just full of errors for example they said that Bilderberg
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:50.280]  peaked in terms of the protest before 9-11 before 9-11 there was nobody at
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:53.560]  Bilderberg there was a Jim Tucker maybe a couple of other journals we had like
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:58.480]  4,000 it peaked last year unless it keeps really growing but but there's
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:02.480]  hardly anybody this time just because it's hard to get there and expensive they
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:05.880]  mean that they made a big mistake doing it north of London I'd say what 4,000
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:10.720]  max at one time I mean that's unprecedented oh it was absolutely huge
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:14.800]  I mean compared to this year the numbers are minimal I guess it's gonna be bigger
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:20.280]  tomorrow but you know obviously you were a big draw Ike was a big draw but there
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.200]  was another article in The Week which is quite a big publication in the UK and
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.120]  they were very keen to make the point that Osama bin Laden and Timothy McVeigh
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:31.680]  also believe that the Bilderberg group has power so it's not the fact that you've

[01:59:50.240 --> 02:00:01.480]  we're on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:13.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:20.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:24.440]  Alex Jones
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:32.040]  all watchers just continues to drop bombshell after bombshell on us he was
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:36.080]  getting into the German magazine newspaper big one last week I forget
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.080]  the name he wrote an article about it talking to one of the members saying yeah
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:42.620]  we basically run things yeah we're one of the most powerful groups we just
[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:45.720]  talked to the Dutch leader of the parliament and the leader of the
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:51.240]  Labor Party and he admitted they're in their setting policy that that clip
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:54.880]  needs to get put an article that I know that some of the crews working on in
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.360]  there pointing out that they're setting policy and the files and the rest of it
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:02.880]  but it's just confirmed Dietrich Samson confirms their setting policy
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:07.280]  discussing policy that's illegal in all these countries I don't know about the
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:10.880]  Netherlands but most of them it is the US England Germany we've checked into
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:17.360]  those so Logan acts official meetings act all these things Paul for me this is
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:21.440]  the big issue I know we can look at the media saying we're terrorists and you
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.560]  know bin Laden believed in Bilderberg so we're we're with bin Laden when he was
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:30.160]  CIA but I mean other than looking at media tactics establishment media
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:36.480]  tactics they're imploded what do you think the biggest issue is this year and
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.280]  would you say Bilderberg is peaked in coverage because I think we're getting
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.280]  more coverage this year than we got last year we had much bigger crowds last
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.880]  year but I think it's only getting bigger and bigger and so I think the
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:50.920]  announcement that you know 12 years ago it peaked is like saying the moon's
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:55.800]  made of cheese well it's just factually inaccurate I mean there were no protest
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:00.000]  as whatsoever outside Bilderberg 12 years ago and then the rest of it was just
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.760]  oh world power is dispersed it's moving over to the east just a litany of BS
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:10.160]  basically they failed to mention of course that they created the euro they
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.400]  were positioning themselves for the 2008 financial collapse two years before
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:21.280]  king makers in terms of Clinton Blair the 12 NATO Secretary-General's every
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:24.480]  single one of them has been a Bilderberg member and many of them were
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:28.600]  selected by Bilderberg before they became the head of NATO so as long as the
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:33.360]  mainstream media can avoid mentioning the actual facts that are confirmed that
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.520]  prove they have power that prove they have influence then they can continue to
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.360]  get away with it I think that some kind of directive must have been issued to
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.520]  mention either 12 foot shape shifting lizards or tinfoil hats in the first
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:51.320]  paragraphs of these articles because almost every single one that's a debunking
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:56.720]  piece mentions those two buzzwords so again it's using this pejorative term
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:01.480]  conspiracy theory when this is conspiracy fact not we're not saying that
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:05.160]  we have the documents proving it but they're saying it they come out and
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:10.360]  admit it willy class and another NATO Secretary-General came out in 2010 in a
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.160]  Belgian radio interview and he said yes we have power we go in there we set the
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:19.360]  consensus then it's up to us it's our mission to implement that consensus that
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:24.600]  agreement in our relative spheres of influence so numerous Bilderberg members
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:29.400]  prominent ones including Etienne Davignon on the steering committee have
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:33.600]  admitted that they set the consensus they set the policy and it's broadcast out
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:37.960]  amongst them of course they have people that they groom as well that the mayor
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.880]  of Atlanta's there so you know his he Barack Obama 2.0 in in eight years or so
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:51.680]  after they will he groom Queen madras's stool well we've got Queen
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.360]  Sophia of Spain I tweeted that out about an hour ago so actually that was
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:02.520]  that's gelton that got that one is that on your right no it's on some real Alex
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:09.040]  Jones tweety pie we got um Petraeus as on his jog as well Peter teal that's
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:13.040]  another interesting one because of because he he put two million dollars
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.680]  into Bitcoin I think teal is here to explain Bitcoin to Henry I know it I
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:25.080]  know that that's a very difficult task to explain Bitcoin to Henry Kissinger so
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:34.440]  you know a lot of people coin a term tweety pie tweety pie yeah but um it's
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:38.680]  kind of racist I think it's it's got to be one of the it's got to be racist or
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:45.040]  sexist but yes they're trying to um they're trying to control Bitcoin I
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:48.320]  think that's why you got more to say and I want to get any final comments from

[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:32.360]  one big thing we've gotten out of one of the most powerful globalist meetings in
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:39.680]  the world very apex of control Bilderberg 2014 Copenhagen Denmark is that
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:43.440]  they're very mad at Obama they thought he would literally be able to get more
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:47.880]  done and they're talking about what are they gonna do with it and you notice
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:53.200]  they just had the head of the VA step down Jay Carney is resigning right now
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:58.400]  giving a teleconference press conference and so they're throwing a bunch of rats
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:03.400]  overboard so that it looks like Obama you know is blaming all these people that
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:07.640]  are falling on the sword it's not gonna work Drudge report commas the
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:14.960]  headline Obama cleans house another headline I noticed record 13 or 3,100
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:20.920]  days 3,100 days since major hurricanes strikes USA and yeah they said that
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:25.760]  last year new hurricane season is about to start record low hurricanes for like
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:31.320]  four years lowest level of tornado since 1960 Noah admitted that their
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:36.480]  computer model and then I'm on shows Democrat shows and they'll go Jones you
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.560]  know there's more hurricanes and tornadoes and I'm like no it's not
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:45.440]  they're at record low oh yeah got any other conspiracy theories I mean it's
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.400]  just it's just people just just literally wallow in their ignorance
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:53.760]  nowadays finishing up with Paul Watson they've moved over to a fellow that's
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:56.920]  got a bullhorn the crowd that's I guess there's a crowd of protesters now
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:02.360]  showing up wants to get my view on it I guess I can bullhorn the globalist from
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:07.760]  a distance if there's somehow able to rig up the thing to a microphone or send
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:11.400]  the Skype down I don't know there's a way to do it I've done this before it's
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.760]  like having my hologram there to do it but if they can figure it out I'd love
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:18.880]  to do it maybe we just plug the earpiece directly into the jack on the
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:23.280]  megaphone I don't know I'm not there obviously I'm in FEMA region 6 formerly
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:34.360]  Texas but Watson any other points before we go to this feed and I guess they're
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:39.760]  having some really bad Skype issues right now the Mars rovers not doing too
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:47.160]  well hey Paul Watson can you hear me it's very faint all right Paul any other
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:51.560]  points you want to make before we do this bullhorn stunt yeah we should
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.760]  probably talk to Julia who witnessed the interaction with the Bilderberg
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.680]  member earlier in the protest pen so it's like the movie aliens apparently she
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:05.840]  saw one this is this is momentous yeah you can do that quickly yeah yeah let's
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:10.240]  talk to her here we go hey Julia
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:19.880]  quick quick quick quick fall horses tell us what you witnessed earlier over in
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:24.360]  the protest and is directing the women around addressing the protestors it was
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:29.960]  Dierdrex Samson who's actually on the list and he's Labor Party Dutch Labor
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:36.520]  Party and former Greenpeace member and he came out and stood in front of the
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:40.600]  freedom pen and spoke to the protesters and I was walking by to go back to my
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:46.040]  room and the whole thing felt like he was trying to appease us or gauge the
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.640]  protesters for you know how they're feeling or what they think of the
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:54.280]  people tied in the Bilderberg group and the whole time you know people are
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:57.880]  asking some people are asking him very interesting questions like there was X
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:02.440]  member of the ministry of labor the Dutch ministry labor and he asked him
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.400]  about the Blackwater presence in Ukraine and people were asking about
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.640]  health care and all this and it was almost direction and all he kept talking
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:13.120]  about is these wonderful social policies they're being discussed inside and how
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.160]  wonderful it is that the Dutch people are living longer and the health care
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:21.040]  system's great and how they're just discussing the future for our future
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:27.640]  and how they're trying to do their best for us with renewable energies and he
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:31.720]  just I am and he also kept reiterating that this is not a private meeting that
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:37.240]  it's public and him coming out is you know the demonstration of how public it
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:40.680]  is and I said the mighty you guys signed on disclosure agreement and he just
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:45.120]  looked all right me wait a minute wait a minute tell her hold on she's a genius
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:48.920]  and I want to hear about her and where she's from I don't know seriously she is
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:52.600]  she just realized it was having a blame view they're coming out and talking to
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.600]  people now claiming their meetings public because it's illegal and almost all
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:02.320]  those countries I'm sure it's in all of them but especially in Europe but I don't
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:06.800]  know about the Netherlands specifically so they want to claim it's public and
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.640]  transparent because it really is super secret and now they're worried about
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.840]  criminal investigations so I think they're trying to now have it both ways
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.120]  and be able to argue in legalese that it's really a public meeting but that's
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.480]  not going to hold water she figured it out well Watson tell her that she is
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:29.960]  Sherlock Holmes Alex says that you're Sherlock Holmes the point he made was
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.440]  they're worried about criminal investigations and transparency so they're
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:36.680]  getting more desperate and having to address as more what do you think about
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:42.200]  that to be honest I don't know it's not like shows maybe they said though
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:46.680]  somebody go out there and talk to them the fact that he was talking to the kind
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:53.480]  of the loud more radical protesters within the pen well there were several
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:57.800]  people outside talked indirectly he didn't want to engage those people and
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:04.680]  it's like he was just trying to appease us and to go back and declare what we're
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:07.760]  thinking what we're talking about and what the little people are saying outside
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:13.200]  it's not like a little it's all like a game he they want to go to the they want
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:16.880]  to go to the wild people so that the mainstream media can shoot it and make
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:21.040]  us look bad and make them look good that doesn't work anymore folks are angry
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.040]  they're gonna like the fact that the folks are angry that's why the media
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.080]  doesn't get its backfiring they're coming from an elitist perspective and
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:33.360]  also a 50 year old perspective that it's like dinosaurs fighting star
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:38.520]  destroyers they just don't have any hope Paul Watson get her to tell us about
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.120]  herself I think it's interesting to see where she's from why she came out I
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:46.960]  know she's been out there for two days and she's been with you guys get her to
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:52.640]  tell us about herself my name is Julia Transky and I have a channel called
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:59.200]  raise the world and I guess that's what I'm doing here and I'm from Toronto and
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:04.040]  what's the most interesting thing to me and currently about the meeting is it's
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:06.760]  a little bit more narrow-minded than what you guys are doing but I'm really
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:13.480]  into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and all that and Peter Thiel is here and you
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:19.800]  said dinosaurs and there is this like anti-diluvian kind of presence here
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.520]  because there's such old people and I think Peter Thiel is here to maybe
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:28.520]  explain Bitcoin to them and kind of give them an in on what they're having to
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:31.400]  deal with in terms of control I don't know he's supposed to be in our site
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:34.760]  supposed to be the self-proclaimed libertarian I'm very interested in that
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:41.440]  and I don't know I know I know that there is it's a very difficult thing to do
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:46.000]  to make these jumps and rationalizing or what they're doing what they're talking
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.880]  about and why people are sure sure but listen listen they know about fiat
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:55.040]  currencies and they know about derivatives and stuff believe me their
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:00.360]  great-great-grand-granddaddies wrote the book on on on things like Bitcoin and
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.600]  again I'm not saying Bitcoin's purely bad I just I know it's racing up right
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:07.800]  now and everybody's making all this money I just know when the bubble implodes
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:12.280]  if I promote it I will be blamed for it so so that's why I've been a bit
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:15.840]  wary but more power to people creating their own fiat currency because at
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:18.480]  least it competes with the globalist I don't like the fact that they're the
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:23.840]  only ones that can make money off their Federal Reserve system I think they're
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:29.040]  worried about I think that's why he's there I mean it's interesting to me I'm
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:34.400]  kind of more hopeful about that fact I think it's a good sign that he's there
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:38.680]  and I think their ears are perked up about the possibility of sovereignty
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:44.240]  through currency for the people instead of money being power who controls money
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:50.040]  being power and said money being power in the hands of the people so that's not
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:53.400]  my biggest interest years this year well they're getting ready to get rid of a
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:56.280]  lot of world currencies I want a new fiat when they control they're looking
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:02.400]  at a global carbon tax to underpin and give value to the new SDR system and
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:07.480]  again when I send packages overseas it says SDR on the USPS so we're already
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:11.680]  under a global SDR they've said that at Davos hundred trillion dollars they
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:17.160]  want of the SDRs every decade of taxpayer money that's how much carbon
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:21.040]  tax they want but a very interesting ask her if she has any other points
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:23.840]  Watson and then let's see if we can do this bullhorning and then I'm gonna take
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:29.880]  phone calls oh well I guess I'll end with more Alex they're talking about the
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:36.440]  future of renewable resources and it's all for own good as Mr. Simpson says all
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:40.600]  right well are you having fun are you glad you came to Bilderberg
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:46.880]  um you know I am but it's it's like a blanket of despotism here and it I
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:50.760]  really react to it in a negative way I had a nightmare the first night I was
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:57.160]  here and it involves me being taken captive at the Marriott by these people
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:01.240]  and I there's there's a really really sinister feeling that I'm not just
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:06.920]  imagining because I've I had I came here with no um no ideas and no
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:10.560]  expectations and just the first day so you're picking up the creepy crawlies of
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:13.520]  David Rockefeller or Kissinger who do you think you're picking the creepy
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:21.280]  crawlies up from oh maybe yeah maybe Kissinger he's quite a quite a troll
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:25.480]  isn't he you don't think he's he's he's hot
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:30.280]  who do you like better Paul Watson or Henry Kissinger

[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:37.720]  all been done by design it's gotten much worse under Obama by design to cheat

[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:25.960]  matter you have to destroy their graven image that they have got their whole
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:30.440]  agenda on and then the next puppet and the next puppet and then say this
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.440]  person's bad and then there's these people behind it that's how human
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:38.960]  communication works that's how we defeat their operations we expose their
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:43.200]  global warming thing as a global taxing scam to control and regulate everything
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:47.160]  we expose gun controls a way to disarm us and make us slaves under their
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:51.720]  authoritarianism while they arm to the teeth against us now towns and cities
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:55.000]  it's all over the news why are the police getting tanks why are they
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.840]  training to take on the tea party fire the police chief I mean it's happening
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:05.840]  the state houses are coming out talking like me and I'm not on a power trip about
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:09.560]  that folks I've studied history so because I was into history instead of
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:14.400]  comic books and stuff when I was a kid it was more entertaining and I'd read
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:17.680]  like time-life books on World War two and World War one and stuff and other
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:20.960]  things and there was other kids like comic books this was the real comic book
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:24.800]  I mean I wanted to learn more about Heinrich Himmler I wanted to learn more
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:31.000]  about Julius Caesar I wanted to learn more about the Emperor Harajito of
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:38.720]  Japan I wanted to learn about British royalty I wanted to learn about George
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:44.360]  Washington and so when I saw what was happening in high school in college I
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:49.000]  was like this is history repeating and they're like nothing's happening there's
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  no corruption in government there's no secret groups there's no court intrigue
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:01.840]  and I went you're lying and I said I'm gonna fight you and here we are 19 years
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:09.160]  later I'm 40 years old I'm nobody when I say we are setting the agenda more and
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:12.840]  more it should show you that if you will just believe in yourself learn how
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:16.800]  things work stand up and get involved you'll be incredibly successful in
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:23.200]  business you'll be incredibly successful in life with everything if you can just
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:27.360]  find good team members because it's not enough for you to get your act together
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:31.000]  or for me to do that to get your you know what together there's another word
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.960]  that says it better you've got to learn to get the proper family around you and
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:41.000]  the proper crew because it doesn't matter how smart you are committed you
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:47.560]  get the wrong people around you they will bring you down every time and you
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:51.320]  know sometimes you have relationships that are like time bombs that go on for
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:56.040]  decades and then get so bad your loyalty is used against you and you're forced to
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:58.800]  cut people off and cut them out of your life and as you get older you learn to
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:06.080]  do that quicker and quicker you can get too quick to though but there's just all
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:12.520]  these predators out there and I don't like them we ever get their Skype back
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:18.360]  just got it back great job yeah okay let's go back to Copenhagen sure we'll

[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:29.000]  it's just kind of like a train wreck sometimes that's good it's real in fact
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.640]  maybe I shouldn't care sometimes people are being noisier tromping around I mean
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:35.000]  this is real we put a microphone out there that's just randomly folks can
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.080]  tune into no I'm joking okay they're walking down right now here let's get
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:43.560]  some of the ambient noise on the street there at the capital city of Copenhagen

[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:43.720]  nice in their suits while they figure out with corporations how to put stuff
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:47.240]  into all the major food linings to sterilize you and your family and give
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:50.840]  you horrible degenerative diseases and then you even find books they've written
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:55.360]  bragging about it well they all sit around telling we don't exist we don't
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:34:01.080]  exist you do exist and we're exposing you all right let's shift gears right now
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:04.600]  and go back to Paul Watson finally before I go to calls there and he's with a
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:09.160]  reporter who got photos of the Atlanta mayor they're very exciting Paul and
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:12.320]  then maybe we can shove the cameras in the fence where is this you're able to
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:19.040]  get these shots of them outside having cocktails the builder rats it's it's
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:23.000]  around the side of the Marriott it's across from the night building so it's
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:28.240]  just adjacent to the Marriott and next to the bridge next to the water so it's
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:32.880]  a really good spot they didn't allow us in there a couple of days ago but they've
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:36.520]  opened it up so we were able to get in there earlier and yeah as I said you
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:40.760]  know Etienne Davenyon Wolfenson Eric Schmidt basically came out for a quick
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:45.480]  drink after their initial conference and we were there pretty much for a few
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:48.840]  hours we got some good shots got some video and then we got it up on the
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:51.720]  website and then we came back and obviously now there are more of them
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:55.680]  there having probably after dinner drink so listen we can even do a little bit
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:59.360]  overdrive five minutes or so get over there and show that I want to see a lot
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:03.360]  of feet of that that's amazing and again I figure they were blocking the main
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:06.720]  walkway that's public that's why they had to probably open that because I was
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:10.160]  marveling that they blocked the boardwalk for the whole city just because
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:14.400]  they felt like it because the royalty is their literal royalty who got the photo
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:20.640]  of the Queen was that then David Night's wife Queen of Spain Queen of Spain that
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:26.560]  was skeleton good job the former Queen of Netherlands was out there earlier so
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:30.920]  yeah we got quite a few we got some good shots and you have that reporter with
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:37.680]  you that took the snapshot of of them the Atlanta mayor no I don't know who that
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:41.360]  was I wasn't around when that was happening so okay I must have misunderstood
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:46.280]  they popped my ear and said that they have that person was able to be for an
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:51.360]  interview but I must have misunderstood now Paul again specifically I want you
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:55.840]  guys to go over to that area and you said there's more of them than there now
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:59.880]  have we deposited one of our photographers over there secreted
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:04.200]  someone there to be catching all this we were just there earlier we got we got
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:08.320]  tons of photos earlier we were just broadcasting from there earlier so that's
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:12.360]  where you were at okay okay well I'm just understood I guess you're now in
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:17.760]  the protest pen then yeah okay so I was saying go where you already were so now
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:21.480]  you've gone to the other place okay what do you think you guys should go cover
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:27.520]  next in terms of tonight or tomorrow do you mean Alex well the Bilderberg people
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:31.840]  are only gonna get drunker and they follow their own rules so they're out
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:36.400]  there smoking so I would go nest out there and I would I would get a night
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:40.960]  vision camera and you're gonna get a bonanza yeah well we've been there
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:43.880]  pretty much most of the day really we just also they don't let them bring
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:48.960]  hookers in they're gonna try to leave at night and if you tail the Mercedes out
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:52.960]  of there you could catch some really good stuff that's something we did in
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:57.400]  Switzerland I remember in 2011 they weren't happy about that but I mean if you're
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:00.200]  willing to go if you're willing to go in the gay bar you can go in there and get
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:02.560]  some pretty good intel which I don't think it's a big deal go ahead and go in
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:06.360]  there Paul I mean it might be an S&M place or something but I mean kiss you
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:11.320]  know we actually talked to somebody who was a gay escort back in 2011 who went
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:15.600]  to service some Bilderberg members only as bar staff obviously then they're up to
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:20.400]  nothing nothing untoward but yeah as I said there's a potential of walkabouts
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:24.680]  happening tomorrow so that's when we hope to catch some of them out of their
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:29.040]  protected bubble out of their security bubble so then we can really get some
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:34.320]  good some good conversations amazing Paul yeah and I mean I wasn't joking when
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:40.320]  I said that I wasn't just making a joke and I was just saying statistically that's
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:45.680]  that's where if you follow some of them you would find them going for whatever
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:49.960]  reason that would be newsworthy but you know kind of morally maybe we should
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:52.600]  leave them alone if they're going to visit hookers you know I mean isn't that
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:58.480]  their private business Paul if they're hanging around the hotel if they're
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:01.760]  going for jogs they're going for walks which I expect at least some of them to
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:04.920]  do of course in Bilderberg they were surrounded by a lot of security but this
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.720]  year it's like Petraeus for example he went outside of the protected area he
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:14.600]  just basically ran along the main street in Copenhagen across the bridge so if
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:17.920]  if more of them are gonna do that and that's gonna be a good opportunity no
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:22.360]  no no I agree I was just making the quasi joke about the prostitutes but it
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:27.360]  really is true my whole issue is that's not the type of intel we even want we
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:31.520]  don't care what you know shoe size somebody is or what their favorite you
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:35.320]  know dinner is or or you know where they like to vacation or what their sexual
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:40.760]  issues are what we want to know is from staff and people as you know what were
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:46.320]  they really discussing on the agenda well we know we know that they leaked the
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:51.320]  vague agenda I'm hoping to get some more tips and you know more specific stuff
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:56.240]  and that sometimes that comes sometimes it doesn't but I'm just talking about
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:00.360]  just approaching them in a friendly manner as we did last year with sure
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:05.680]  I agree can you have him pan around the camera guy Josh so we can see some of
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:12.000]  the protesters there in the pen and see what they're up to and again if you're
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.920]  a radio listener I'll describe it looks like about 25 30 protesters max but I've
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:21.920]  seen a lot I guess there's some more maybe maybe 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:30.600]  30 40 20 yeah yeah what would you say about 40 people there now yeah probably
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:35.880]  about that maybe a bit less but yeah tomorrow's gonna be the big day for
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:40.920]  protests obviously I mean it's not gonna be 2000 I think that was wildly
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:44.280]  optimistic but you know I think it was well over 3,000 that were there for the
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:48.560]  big speech that's what the cops said England they couldn't get in there were
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:51.840]  keeping around the block I mean that that was why hey let me bring up this cop
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:54.640]  controversy and I want you to run back over there I'm sorry we got our wires
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:59.520]  crossed and with the camera show me them out there eating and drinking I think
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:02.600]  the viewers would obviously want to see that we have some of those videos up on
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:06.480]  info wars.com but as they gather I'm gonna stay on top that that's important
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:12.360]  but going back to the police and this guy that was yelling at you and yelling
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:17.240]  at David and yelling about me I mean we make jokes about it but they did drag
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:20.520]  him off it looks like they're stomping on him and hitting him now maybe maybe
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:23.820]  he hit them first but they were they took him behind the screen that's my
[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:28.080]  issue but you know now the media is acting like we're being too hard on the
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:32.680]  police distracting off into that my issue is then they chase another camera guy
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:36.800]  not wanting him to film whatever they really did I think that's wrong even if
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:41.640]  they beat the guy up who was messing with our reporters I still we make jokes
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:46.040]  and say oh you know that's just terrible but no seriously I do have an issue with
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:49.680]  that what is your real feeling on this because I'm told it's in the newspapers
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:56.800]  and on TV over there well obviously this guy was harassing us for a good hour or
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:02.080]  two beforehand and I think he tried to get back into the press area and the
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:05.480]  police stopped him and he was very insistent on getting back in towards us
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:09.440]  so we could I didn't understand that he'd been doing it for hours and had been
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.440]  already thrown out well then I think he deserved to be arrested I didn't know
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:16.400]  that we got a press area just for the press and then he did that and then
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:20.520]  maybe he resisted them so maybe maybe we're wrong yes go ahead at least they
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:24.280]  released him after about 15 minutes and he was actually he came back today and
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:27.680]  there was another incident which I got on camera where they grabbed him but they
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:36.160]  they didn't do anything with him did he look roughed up when you saw no I don't
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:39.840]  think he had many injury it may have been wrong to drag him off in that manner
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:43.960]  but some of the police are on little ego trips little power trips like I said
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:47.320]  with a guy you can't stick your camera two inches through the through the metal
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:52.560]  fence when we're already you know 50 feet away from Bilderberg members most of
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:56.320]  them have been alright some of them are just on little power trips and they like
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:42:00.920]  to enforce these ridiculous rules so you know it's a mixed bag as always with
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:06.160]  the police and we'll see what happens in future when you know more people show up
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:11.120]  now this guy went through a lot of trouble to attack us I think we should
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:15.520]  give him some airtime I'm interested in what he's saying what repeat verbatim
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:22.200]  what he says about us he was saying that we report that dinosaurs existed and
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:28.320]  that we're part of the conspiracy and that you're a CIA agent basically Alex
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.760]  Jones is CIA your response that's what he says over and over again
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:37.120]  able to be honest but turning into quiet the character let me just be honest I'm
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:42.040]  far beyond CIA folks okay let's just get that straight I work for a much higher
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:47.600]  power than that and it's called God and I'm not saying I'm on some sacred mission
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:52.720]  but I really believe everything I'm saying I love humanity and I'm getting
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:57.680]  I'm getting spiritual directives if you really get down to the you know in my
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:01.240]  gut in my spirit the media will run crazy with that but no I mean I go with
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:06.640]  my conscience and so I'm being directed by honor okay I don't work for the CIA
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:11.920]  folks that's like working for Coca-Cola in Texas every third person is an asset
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:16.800]  of the CIA in this state I'm literally swimming in CIA people I mean I am so
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:23.760]  sick of the movies like it's ooh CIA ooh I mean I'm so tired of it Watson what
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:28.920]  about you who do you really work for Watson 12 foot shape-shifting reptoids
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:35.360]  obviously I mean who wouldn't the other the other thing is there's this a law to
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:39.000]  believe in really wild stuff that doesn't exist when there's so much good
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.640]  stuff we can prove it's like there's still a lot of talk about this isn't the
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:46.080]  real site of the conference and that they're off meeting at some castle you
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:50.080]  know we've seen royalty arrived we've seen NATO heads arrived we've seen them
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:55.040]  right now out there drinking talking so we know that here same speculation last
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:58.440]  year but we saw them all coming in it's like Washington Times gets from the
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:02.640]  Army the official document of preparation for war with drones against the
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:07.280]  American people for civil unrest and no one cares no one's covering it but
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.400]  drudging info wars and and we have actual FEMA camp documents no one cares
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:17.360]  but if I go point something at a shed randomly and say that Easter bunnies
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:21.880]  live in it everyone would just freak out and believe it I don't understand it
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:28.000]  what's the cop doing now what's going on here she's taping a sign onto a
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:37.720]  protester the police are having some fun with the protesters that's a community
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:41.440]  relations officer she's getting them to mark themselves literally like it's
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:45.040]  Nazi Germany that you're a protester but notice she's the sweet charming one to
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:50.120]  do it literally I don't think it's mandatory though now she's hugging him
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:45:02.800]  oh my goodness you know tell room fucks anyways public relations hey go talk to
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:08.280]  her ask what it is ask what the pink stuff is as we can pull across your
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:12.760]  mouth what's going on here what are you doing this is a peace-loving harmony
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:23.280]  okay right so love for everyone love love please love yes I love you
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:29.880]  tagging them with love stickers Alex this is a very effective sigh up because
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:32.880]  this woman means well that's what you pick a salesman that you believe in what
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:36.560]  they're selling and and and they did this in England as well and the cops
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:40.480]  actually were on our side and did follow the show so it's real as well but
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:47.180]  still they're still they're being marked folks and there's a sigh up above this
[02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:51.560]  that I bet this cop isn't even aware of watching you agree with what I just said
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:55.400]  I don't know I don't really know what's going on with this but they were filming
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:59.120]  as earlier when we were outside the other area after we initially filmed the
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:03.240]  Bilderberg members Paul ask her for one and stick it across your mouth to end
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:06.480]  the transmission sorry Paul are you saying I don't know where they've been
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:13.640]  you know I'll avoid that no no you want a sticker I don't want to ruin my shirt
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:21.840]  it's an expensive shirt oh my goodness I'll refrain from that Alex if it's

[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:46.960]  on here that cop looks like he's having a little too good of a time it is it is
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:54.080]  evening sees on Alex I'm telling you all right I gotta stop it I gotta stop it
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:57.600]  right now if you're not watching this it's ridiculous yeah I think something's
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:03.920]  going on over here with that cop that's what I think crazy world not just
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:08.800]  somebody who's dressed up as a cop that's a cop alright anyways you can see
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:13.160]  the other cops laughing at her all right anyways and then is that that reporter

[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:17.360]  I shouldn't screw around my crew I apologize let's talk to Eric in FEMA
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:22.280]  region 7 formerly in the US let's talk about the head of the CFR Richard Haas

[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:39.520]  called Richard Haas explains that the US Near East Strategy is the worst of all
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:45.600]  foreign policies yeah I know I mean the CFR has a lot of different ideas in it
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:51.800]  but what's your take on that well I want to make sure I was quick as I know you
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:56.360]  got our calls I basically said is it an analogy to the Arab Spring to the
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:03.200]  Bolshevik Revolution you're talking about the Arab Spring I'm sorry I'm
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:06.160]  making everything you're saying
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:12.320]  well I mean his point his point is good if I take it that a lot of these Arab
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:17.680]  Springs and the stuff in Europe as well run by Soros when he admits that are like
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:21.520]  the Bolshevik Revolution they overthrow one bad thing to put in something
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:27.040]  even worse so yes I think but I'm not sure what spring you said so I can't
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:29.720]  really say if I agree with you but if you were saying that yes I do agree with
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.560]  you Joseph in Canada you're on the air thanks for holding
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:42.040]  is that me absolutely brothers if your name is Joseph yes it is thank you keep
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:47.160]  talking with you Alex actually just want to make a couple of points about the
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:53.040]  the Bilderberg thing and actually the outbreaks that have been happened in
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:59.480]  Africa with the with the disease in that but with the Bilderberg thing how is it
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:05.280]  that you know they can walk around with just like armfuls of you know obvious
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:12.000]  documents that you know are displayed they should be somewhere else and there's
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:19.360]  no way to have a law force go in there and and you know acquire those under a
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:23.680]  look the point is they're not just hearing presentations they're being given
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:28.000]  handouts they're doing corporate meetings they are those it's an it's an
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:34.240]  illegal governmental corporate global governance boardroom meeting they founded
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:39.400]  the euro that's in the BBC they admit it they're making big decisions we're
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:43.640]  stepping this network break I hear you I appreciate that call Joseph Nick in
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:51.720]  California listening on KOM Y 1340 and Santa Cruz you're on the air Nick
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:55.120]  hey two years ago you got a call from Canada while you're on your road trip
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:51:00.280]  to Bilderberg he he's mentioning ice chemical ice do you think then he's
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:03.960]  called it bias and I got a report this year that they're doing chemical ice in
[02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:08.600]  US but last year they were going hi Alex hi Alex you were overseas at Bilderberg
[02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:13.440]  and I was going hey these guys are like a team of like Israel and in the hotel
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:20.360]  remember that team with a assassinated guy yes I appreciate your call some of
[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:23.920]  these callers are bringing up is so esoteric and that no one will understand
[02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:28.160]  it because they're remembering something from a radio show eight years ago or a
[02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:32.640]  radio show six years ago that yes a lot of times when I go to Bilderberg the day
[02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:37.160]  it ends I get death threats or my family does and they tell you what you're
[02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:42.000]  talking about on the phone to freak you out or you know they say I hope your mom
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:45.420]  or dad dies in the hospital one I mean but they do that too not just at
[02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:49.360]  Bilderberg it's just that's happened twice with Bilderberg maybe three times
[02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:53.520]  you'll have a family member that's sick or something bad happening and then
[02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:57.400]  that's when the call comes in so they're just sitting there waiting you know
[02:51:57.400 --> 02:52:00.080]  listening to what you're doing and then they want to emotionally mess with you
[02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:05.040]  hey I can be totally tired have a headache and somebody death threats me for
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:10.200]  real you just gave me months of energy I'm in a war I expect they'll kill me
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:14.080]  someday I'll expect they'll torture me I'm not looking forward to it I don't
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:21.840]  want it but buddy I'm in the game whatever it takes I'll go as far as I
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:26.200]  have to I'm beyond committed and they don't like that that's the one thing
[02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:29.040]  they're scared of folks you got to just get committed against these people I
[02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:37.440]  want to say this again so many people act like that I'm trying to scare people
[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:42.960]  no I think you're like me illegitimate crooks are taking over so what if they
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:46.960]  got power and weapons they don't have moral high ground we're gonna expose
[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:50.960]  them I'm not gonna just let them run my life and run me over because they're a
[02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:56.200]  bunch of killers and scum I instinctively want to deal with them not
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:00.280]  because I'm a hero folks I want to live I want to survive I want to thrive I have
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:05.920]  an instinct to have a good civilization and I'm committed and I'll use the
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:13.640]  analogy for the 500th time probably World War two pilots folks they flew into
[02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:17.800]  the flak it wasn't like you know there's guns out there that fire artillery that
[02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:21.200]  explodes with flak that goes into your engines and goes through your windows and
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:27.720]  kills you you know moving 800 miles an hour on average flak once it detonates
[02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:32.080]  you know you know you know you could die
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:39.040]  oh look you know you we could get you when you fly over our city we're gonna
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:45.560]  be sure of yes I know yes yes yes so calling death threat all you want pull
[02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:49.520]  out the stops dirty tricks whatever I don't want it to happen but I'm at a
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:53.200]  certain level do because that's how I get through any fears I had whatever it's
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:56.720]  already done you've already killed me in my mind I'm beyond your grasp you
[02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:00.800]  understand that you could even get me torture me and turn me into a mind-numb
[02:54:00.800 --> 02:54:03.800]  zombie down the road and say you defeated Alex Jones no you didn't
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:09.440]  understand the Zen belief which I do buy into it's prima facie true that I did
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:14.240]  this in the time space continuum it lives forever it it happened I am free
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:18.680]  now this is me I made these decisions I'm committed if I'm defeated I win
[02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:26.000]  because I fought back I win you lose your evil I'm not I love life you decided
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:32.080]  to be failures it's that simple it's the animating contest of liberty it is the
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:35.320]  journey not the destination it's about making the right decisions in this life
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:38.600]  real quick we've got a Polish journalist who got some interesting photos when
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:41.760]  we're gonna talk to them real fast then we're gonna get some footage in of the
[02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:44.480]  globalist that's the number one thing I want and then we're gonna take some more
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:49.560]  phone calls from Michael and Toby and Sean and Mike and Clay so wake up callers
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:51.880]  because I know when I make a similar over 30 minutes they sound like they've

[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:53.800]  told them both I said listen you know the Logan Act you know it's a violation of
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:57.560]  law to meet in this capacity and I want you guys to investigate it you have a

[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:09.440]  senators like well it's not a message it's a request for action because you
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:14.480]  have a responsibility under federal law to do something I mean what is it what

[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:36.200]  compartmentalization great point great caller Michael great thank you so much
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:40.760]  Mike Clay and Toby final caller straight ahead and overdrive this Sunday 4 to 6
[02:58:40.760 --> 02:58:46.120]  p.m. folks the video feed continues on at info wars.com
[02:58:46.120 --> 02:58:59.120]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[02:58:59.120 --> 02:59:03.120]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:06.120]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:14.120]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:18.120]  On average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:22.120]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:59:22.120 --> 02:59:28.120]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:32.120]  Alright it is intense and coffee and water and breads and toothpaste.
[02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:35.120]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:59:35.120 --> 02:59:37.120]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:38.120]  It's time to take action.
[02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:40.120]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:59:52.120 --> 02:59:56.120]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.120 --> 03:00:01.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:01.120 --> 03:00:08.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:09.120]  You want answers?
[03:00:09.120 --> 03:00:11.120]  Well so does he.
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:15.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:39.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:45.120]  Alright folks, the Bilderberg Creeps have snuck back into the building, but we've got Paul Watson and others.
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:47.120]  Activist journalist out there on the street.
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:48.120]  I want to take a few final calls.
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:50.120]  Paul, I know you have more on the news tonight.
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:51.120]  Great job.
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:53.120]  I know it's already evening time over there.
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:57.120]  Go take a break, but you know, Saturday and Sunday's when we'll get another media push.
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:03.120]  Friday's not the best day to put news out, but we've got to get into the fact that they're violating laws and a certain policy.
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:04.120]  We need articles on that.
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:07.120]  We need a master article with the best photos and videos all together.
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:09.120]  I know my crew's doing that here.
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:17.120]  But just round of applause to the whole Info Wars team and Karen Knight and David Knight, husband and wife team and Josh Owens.
[03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:18.120]  Fabulous job.
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:24.120]  Any other points from your friend there, the Froy Line?
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:29.120]  Yeah, I guess I'll end with, you know, they're not in there deciding our future.
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:31.120]  They're deciding their future.
[03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:33.120]  That's what they're interested in.
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:37.120]  And of course that affects our future, but I just want to make that distinction.
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:42.120]  That's what I believe is going on in there.
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:43.120]  No, I tend to agree with you.
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:44.120]  That's a good point.
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:47.120]  And again, if we can just point the camera over at the area where they're normally at.
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:52.120]  So people watching this in Denmark who are going to be protesting tomorrow know where to go.
[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:56.120]  And I guess you've got a telephoto lens because, I mean, no, I understand they're in that building,
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:01:59.120]  but where is it where they're having the cocktails and smoking the cigars?
[03:01:59.120 --> 03:02:04.120]  On the left-hand side around the corner adjacent that way where they're having the cocktails.
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:08.120]  That's why we were earlier when you had the interaction with the Bilderberg member.
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:10.120]  What kind they're having?
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:11.120]  What kind they're having?
[03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:14.120]  You know what they were drinking?
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:16.120]  I saw champagne.
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:17.120]  I saw champagne.
[03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:20.120]  Oh, champagne.
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:22.120]  Liquid headache and a bottle.
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:25.120]  I walked by there.
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:30.120]  It's an open kind of boardwalk for it's the public and you can walk and there's like a playground.
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:34.120]  People are jumping off into the water and like sunbathing and stuff.
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:35.120]  And it's interesting.
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:39.120]  They're just allowed to block all that off even though it's a pedestrian area.
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:44.120]  So Henry Kissinger is out there just bashing like a dead whale.
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:46.120]  Yeah, I think we got Kissinger as well.
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:47.120]  We just got the back of his head.
[03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:53.120]  But if you go, if you look at the picture, which is on the infowars story of Wolfensohn and Etienne Davignon,
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:55.120]  they're both smoking a pipe.
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:56.120]  They look completely smug.
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:02:58.120]  I think that's quite an icon.
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:01.120]  Well there, I do run the planet to a great extent.
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:02.120]  Why not be smug?
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:05.120]  And again, Kissinger does go out in a dress sometimes.
[03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:06.120]  I'm not kidding.
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:11.120]  So if you see like a really horrific looking old woman, like a troll dressed up in a pink dress,
[03:03:11.120 --> 03:03:14.120]  that may be him meeting somebody.
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:15.120]  It may be.
[03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:18.120]  David Rockefeller's not here this year, is he?
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:23.120]  David's always attended until now. That means he must be near death.
[03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:24.120]  Well, you would imagine.
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:26.120]  I mean, come on, been waiting so long.
[03:03:26.120 --> 03:03:29.120]  What is the 87, 88?
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:31.120]  He's in his 90s, isn't he, Rockefeller?
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:33.120]  Yeah, none of them ever made it past 100.
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:34.120]  It's an ongoing bet.
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:37.120]  John Dee, the first tried to make it to 100 and died a few months early.
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:38.120]  I mean, it's a big deal.
[03:03:38.120 --> 03:03:40.120]  He's trying to go to 98.
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:41.120]  He's 98.
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:44.120]  Satan has the pit opening the portal.
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:47.120]  Ah, come to me, my baby.
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:48.120]  All right.
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:50.120]  Absolutely great.
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:53.120]  I hope they know we're ready for them when they come out.
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:58.120]  Where do you think, where do you think he's going when he dies?
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:02.120]  Oh, purgatory for a lot of questioning.
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:04.120]  He'll probably just come back as a zombie.
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:06.120]  Nobody will know it's the difference.
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:10.120]  He probably actually gets sent to Santa Claus's workshop.
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:12.120]  He's going to be a mushroom, Alex.
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:13.120]  Do what?
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:16.120]  He's going to be a mushroom in his next life.
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:17.120]  Exactly.
[03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:18.120]  People will eat him and hallucinate.
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:19.120]  All right.
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:20.120]  Listen, great job.
[03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:21.120]  I'm sorry to all the callers.
[03:04:21.120 --> 03:04:22.120]  Sunday, more calls.
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:23.120]  Whatever, Monday, everything.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:24.120]  Great job, crew.
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:26.120]  You guys be safe watching others.
[03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:27.120]  All right.
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:28.120]  And we salute you out there.
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:31.120]  Everybody's really rooting for you.
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:32.120]  All right.
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:33.120]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:34.120]  All right.
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:36.120]  There goes the wassill hoff, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:37.120]  All right.
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:38.120]  Sorry to the callers.
[03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:40.120]  I got a lot of you, though.
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:41.120]  Great job to the crew, everybody.
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:42.120]  I keep saying great job, great job.
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:47.120]  It's very fulfilling to have our reporters out there to be breaking big news, to be forcing
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:48.120]  this out in the open.
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:52.120]  I feel like my team just won a Super Bowl again.
[03:04:52.120 --> 03:04:54.120]  And this is how we defeat them.
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:55.120]  And we build optimism.
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:57.120]  We're not pessimistic.
[03:04:57.120 --> 03:04:58.120]  We can win.
[03:04:58.120 --> 03:05:00.120]  See you back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:12.120]  Notly News Tonight.
