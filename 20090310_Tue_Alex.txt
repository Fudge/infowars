[00:04.880 --> 00:11.120]  But the results. Have you checked the pricing and the funky three month contracts and all that stuff?
[00:11.120 --> 00:14.640]  Have you checked the results? Oh, that's right. I said that. Did you check the ingredients and
[00:14.640 --> 00:20.880]  you checked for caffeine? Yeah. Life change tea is the real deal. Not a new yippee-yay-yay tea,
[00:20.880 --> 00:25.440]  but a tea if you drink it daily, it will change your life and it will clean your body.

[00:48.880 --> 00:56.160]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04.800 --> 01:12.080]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:12.080 --> 01:21.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:21.360 --> 01:45.760]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen. It is the 10th day of March 2009. We're gonna be live here for
[01:45.760 --> 01:58.160]  the next four hours. Congressman Ron Paul joining us from the Hill is scheduled to be on in the next
[01:58.160 --> 02:06.560]  hour. But when we do do interviews with him from the Hill, it is notoriously fluid. He always ends
[02:06.560 --> 02:12.800]  up making it, but it might be at 1130. It might be at 130 that he joins us because when they're
[02:12.800 --> 02:18.400]  voting and committee hearings are going on, his first duty is to what's happening in the Congress.
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.360]  And I have a host of important questions for Congressman Ron Paul on the economy and a lot
[02:25.360 --> 02:37.360]  more coming up. We also have Keith Bryan joining us from Ireland. We are changed. I want to get
[02:37.360 --> 02:41.760]  their take on the two members of the British military that were shot dead two nights ago,
[02:41.760 --> 02:48.560]  and then a policeman shot dead by the quote, real IRA and the provisional IRA to supposed splinter
[02:48.560 --> 02:55.200]  groups. Over 75% of the shootings and terrorist bombings in Northern Ireland, Ireland and in
[02:55.200 --> 03:01.920]  England have been confirmed even in mainstream news. Though after the reports first come out,
[03:01.920 --> 03:06.880]  the British government puts a D notice on them, not allowing the media to report on it any longer,
[03:06.880 --> 03:17.040]  that British intelligence, British MI5, MI6 and special air services command the IRA and command
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.880]  the splinter IRA groups. They're not just infiltrating them. They command them and that they order
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.920]  their subordinates who many times discover they're working for British intelligence to carry it out,
[03:27.920 --> 03:37.120]  and when they don't, British intelligence working as the IRA murders them. And the people of Ireland
[03:37.120 --> 03:42.800]  are desperately trying to get their sovereignty back, and they're trying to do it peacefully
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.640]  and having success. They've also successfully thrown off European Union membership. And so
[03:50.080 --> 03:56.560]  I would say a 90 plus percent chance or more that this is British intelligence carrying out
[03:56.560 --> 04:04.400]  these operations. But we will check in with the Emerald Isle and with the Irish coming up
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.600]  at the end of the show today. We also have Webster Tarpley joining us. We're an article
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.560]  called Obama Vils. There's more and more tent cities pop up around the country.
[04:14.560 --> 04:27.120]  We have Mr. Cain joining us who runs trutham.com, a great way to put up little AM transmitters
[04:27.120 --> 04:31.120]  that go out three miles when you put them upright on top of your house, little antenna,
[04:31.920 --> 04:36.800]  and then you put up signs for three miles and can reach in some areas tens of thousands of people
[04:36.800 --> 04:44.960]  in rural areas, hundreds. Very, very exciting FCC, completely legal and lawful. This is the most
[04:44.960 --> 04:50.320]  powerful lawful unit out there, but they know how to boost it with the antenna. Then you just plug
[04:50.320 --> 04:56.720]  it into the internet, stream this show or whatever you like or do your own show or both. So that is
[04:57.360 --> 05:02.800]  coming up. We'll also talk to the fellow from checkpoint USA.com. They're now setting up 100
[05:02.800 --> 05:07.760]  plus miles into the country border checkpoints, but they wave illegal aliens through. They use it as
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.880]  an excuse to search citizens' cars. They say it's a constitution free zone for 100 plus miles
[05:13.440 --> 05:17.200]  on the northern and southern border. More than two-thirds of our population lives
[05:18.080 --> 05:25.120]  on the coastal borders or on the contiguous borders with Canada and Mexico. And so this is
[05:25.120 --> 05:31.360]  being used to harass citizens just like the stimulus bill has a waiver so illegal aliens
[05:31.360 --> 05:37.200]  can be hired to get the money. It's just amazing. So those are some of the guests that are coming
[05:37.200 --> 05:44.240]  up today. Massive important news straight ahead after this break. I will news blitz when we get back.
[05:45.440 --> 05:49.760]  Here's a nice headline. Canadian military units to undertake domestic security.
[05:49.760 --> 05:54.080]  Newties would include mass internment of citizens. That's in the mainstream news.
[05:54.080 --> 05:59.280]  After terror attack, mirroring militarization of law enforcement in U.S. and Britain.
[05:59.280 --> 06:05.120]  Hello, this is Steve Shank. Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food. But Alex and I
[06:05.120 --> 06:09.520]  have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food. If you're a politician
[06:09.520 --> 06:14.640]  who voted for the bailout, don't call eFoods direct. If you agree with one guy screaming about
[06:14.640 --> 06:20.960]  global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the earth is cooling, don't call eFoods direct.
[06:20.960 --> 06:25.600]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food. If you think waiting
[06:25.600 --> 06:29.600]  for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime,
[06:29.600 --> 06:34.720]  don't call eFoods direct. If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[06:34.720 --> 06:39.440]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call eFoods direct. For the
[06:39.440 --> 06:47.040]  rest of you, go to eFoodsDirect.com or call 800-409-5633. You can't possibly know or control what
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.680]  government, corporate America or others will do, but you can control what you do. Complete your

[07:21.680 --> 07:28.240]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[07:28.240 --> 07:34.960]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.240]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government. This film documents who
[07:42.240 --> 07:49.520]  Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception
[07:49.520 --> 07:57.440]  today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prismplanet.tv. The Obama deception,
[07:57.440 --> 08:20.400]  the people strike back.
[08:27.440 --> 08:39.360]  The Obama deception, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[08:57.440 --> 09:15.360]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.400]  Control and Corten locked down that their main mission is to not have casualties as they engage
[09:34.400 --> 09:41.760]  the people of Canada. All over the mainstream news of Canada right now. We are going in to
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.800]  total tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. This is not a drill. This is not an exercise. This is it.
[09:46.800 --> 09:54.000]  Toe-to-toe with the New World Order. We're going in. A key article by Curt Nemo up on infowars.com
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.600]  right now. Fight back against the banker onslaught with the Obama deception and then he gets into
[10:00.400 --> 10:07.840]  the rollout of the Obama-noid zombies on the streets of America. Now that Obama 2.0,
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.240]  also known as Organizing for America, will be going door to door publicly with hundreds of
[10:12.240 --> 10:16.720]  thousands of preachers they've now announced to map out and identify support. That's a quote.
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.480]  To map out and identify support for the Bankster scam 2.0, it's time to have plenty of copies of
[10:22.480 --> 10:30.480]  the Obama deception at hand for family neighbors and for the Obamatrons who show up at your doorstep
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.680]  in need of education. And folks within four minutes of the film starting, we break the
[10:35.680 --> 10:41.040]  left-right paradigm. We go after George Bush, show him as a New World Order. Then they drop their
[10:41.040 --> 10:47.760]  left-right paradigm shield. We could instantly, if they watch this film, deprogram them. They can
[10:47.760 --> 10:53.360]  take the red pill. All we're offering is the truth, nothing more. The article continues,
[10:53.360 --> 10:59.440]  Obama is tooling up, or rather his DNC and Wall Street Handlers are, a massive campaign to enlist
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.880]  millions of mesmerized and brainwashed supporters to quote, build support for the largest, most
[11:04.880 --> 11:11.360]  expensive, most audacious and ultimately debilitating, borrow and spend bill in the history of the
[11:11.360 --> 11:16.400]  world. That's right, they now want more banker takeovers. It is a banker dream come true,
[11:16.400 --> 11:20.320]  a scam designed to ensure your children and grandchildren are in hawk to the international
[11:20.320 --> 11:25.680]  bankers for generations to come. And they all make it out of nothing, fiat currency. The Dow
[11:25.680 --> 11:31.120]  Jones industrial average has dropped 53.4 percent since it's high in October of 2007 and an
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.880]  unbelievable 31 percent since the inauguration of the new savior. Since Obama entered the White
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.400]  House, we have weathered a whopping 1.6 trillion loss in equity from a crippling concentration of
[11:42.400 --> 11:49.440]  the American economy by 6.2 percent. Unemployment jumped to 8.1 percent in February after increasing
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.640]  7.1 percent in January and 5.9 percent in December. And that's their cook numbers. It's more like 20
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.920]  percent and intensifying. You got the working poor out there and make up the other folks.
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.240]  According to Mitch Stewart, director of organizing for America, Obama's budget provides a bold
[12:04.240 --> 12:08.960]  blueprint for our country's future, a dismal future of third world status and humiliating
[12:08.960 --> 12:15.760]  servitude under the yoke of high-tech surveillance and control. Obama 2.0 zombies will take to the
[12:15.760 --> 12:21.120]  streets to sell you the horrendous prospect of trillions more in federal spending, taxes,
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.680]  and debt. All of it designed to destroy real wealth and usher in a brave new world of serfdom
[12:25.680 --> 12:33.040]  and servitude to the global elite under the fallacious, yes, we can, exterior. And the news
[12:33.040 --> 12:36.800]  media is going to point at these renaub mobs. They're going to point at these millions of Obama
[12:36.800 --> 12:42.560]  noise going, we are socialists. Give us money. They'll say, well, the people want it. It won't
[12:42.560 --> 12:48.160]  matter if the poll shows that one out of a thousand were for the bank or takeover or 95 percent were
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.880]  against the stimulus plan. It was really a federalization plan. The media will just ignore all
[12:52.880 --> 13:00.080]  of that and say, the people love it. The people ask for it. And they're also billing it as socialism.
[13:00.080 --> 13:07.840]  Now, socialism is bad because it makes us dependent on the establishment and they always use that to
[13:07.840 --> 13:13.040]  control us. But actually, the socialism phase is now ending. Getting everybody domesticated,
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.720]  that's how you domesticate wild hogs or horses. You feed them for a few months and get them in a
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.840]  pen, close the pen when they come in to eat. And then really, usually you grab the youngins and
[13:21.840 --> 13:27.200]  tell you to domesticate wolves is the best way or horses. You get the cult or you kill the adults
[13:27.200 --> 13:30.400]  and grab the piglets and make them stay with you for a while till they get trained. You put them
[13:30.400 --> 13:36.080]  in with other trained pigs, other trained horses, other trained cows, that is domesticated cows.
[13:36.080 --> 13:39.760]  That's what the state sees as the children. And then most of them end up being government bureaucrats
[13:39.760 --> 13:49.440]  themselves. This is their own cult. They replicate themselves. But imagine the power of getting the
[13:49.440 --> 13:56.560]  Obama deception on high quality DVD at infoawards.com, burning copies of it and nicely going to Obama
[13:56.560 --> 14:04.640]  meetings using their service USA.org website and going to local group being friendly and saying,
[14:04.640 --> 14:09.200]  Oh yeah, Bush was terrible with all the lies and the wars and the warrantless wiretapping.
[14:09.200 --> 14:14.640]  Why is Obama continuing that? I saw this video that exposes George Bush because it really does.
[14:15.200 --> 14:19.520]  Will you tell me what you think about it? Because they've always got local controllers. If you go
[14:19.520 --> 14:22.720]  in there and start saying he's new world order global government, they'll kick you out.
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.480]  Other little meeting. No, just go in and observe and hang out and talk. You are infiltrating for
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.920]  the republic. You are the counter revolutionary force. You are the restorations. They're destroying
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.960]  the republic. You are white blood cells going into the infections. You go into the infection.
[14:39.520 --> 14:48.320]  You act friendly as a tea lymphocyte as you scan the enemy operation. You get intel and then you
[14:48.320 --> 14:58.960]  go in and you deprogram. You deprogram. We must engage them at point blank range, ladies and
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.880]  gentlemen, and you can do it. These are good people that believe that Obama is saving them
[15:04.880 --> 15:08.640]  from the horrible Bush agenda. They believe they're repudiating all of those horrors.
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.040]  They have no idea they're being set up, but some of them are starting to wake up to that fact.
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.640]  And when the Obama noids come to your door, but I wouldn't wait for them to come to the door,
[15:16.640 --> 15:21.760]  I would go out to them. Time is too short. Everything the enemy has miscalculated.
[15:21.760 --> 15:27.440]  They have bet everything they've got on Obama and they are going to fail. If you take action,
[15:27.440 --> 15:36.320]  if you set yourself in motion, it's over. I will tell you right now that coming up Sunday night,
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  the Obama deception is going to launch
[15:40.000 --> 15:49.520]  at prisonplanet.tv at 6 p.m. central when I end the abbreviated two-hour Sunday show,
[15:49.520 --> 15:55.600]  the final edition. There's going to be a DivEx format, which with a point and click,
[15:55.600 --> 16:01.120]  you can burn to DVDs and discs and it is, I'd say, 90% of the quality of a high-quality DVD.
[16:02.320 --> 16:06.400]  It looks like old-fashioned broadcast TV, you know, like a year ago before they went digital.
[16:06.400 --> 16:12.240]  It looks good. It looks so good. The way we encoded it, it isn't high-deaf. It's shot in
[16:12.240 --> 16:16.720]  high-deaf, but you have to downgrade it to put it on DVD. But the way we've learned how to compress,
[16:17.360 --> 16:21.680]  we actually got a consultant on this for truth rising and now we know how to do it.
[16:21.680 --> 16:25.280]  It looks like high-deaf. I mean, it's just so crisp and clear on the
[16:25.280 --> 16:29.520]  DVD and that does support us. That's the seed money for us to operate. I hope you'll order the
[16:29.520 --> 16:37.920]  DVD at infowars.com or by calling toll-3888-2533139. It'll take a few days to get these, you know,
[16:37.920 --> 16:44.640]  shipping out coming up next Monday. Do not wait. If you don't know how to point and click and burn
[16:44.640 --> 16:50.000]  the DivEx copy or the Windows copy or the QuickTime copies or the Flash copies to disc,
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.400]  you get your tech-savvy brother or sister or son or mother or neighbor over and let me tell you,
[16:56.400 --> 17:01.280]  you pop those DVDs in there, you pop those discs in there and you start burning DivEx.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.160]  About half of the new DVD players that have been sold the last few years are DivEx.
[17:06.160 --> 17:12.560]  They play regular DVDs and DivEx. And you just go out there and I'm telling you, folks,
[17:12.560 --> 17:19.520]  you buy a couple hundred copies of disc and DVDs, very inexpensive, and I want you to burn,
[17:19.520 --> 17:26.640]  burn, burn, burn, burn, burn. And every one of them is an info hang grenade. You throw the hang
[17:26.640 --> 17:31.920]  grenade into a group of Obama supporters in the info ward of the truth bomb. It blows up with red
[17:31.920 --> 17:37.840]  pills, red pill shower, blast through them, and they wake up and realize they're being conned.
[17:37.840 --> 17:46.000]  It is a war. This is a weapon. The weapon drops 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. What is that midnight
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.680]  Greenwich meantime? The weapon system has been prepared. The weapon system has been forged
[17:51.680 --> 17:57.680]  and carved out of truth. It is a powerful weapon to be plunged into the lies heart, ladies and
[17:57.680 --> 18:09.600]  gentlemen. The info war countdown has begun. This is a weapon of truth and enlightenment.
[18:09.600 --> 18:14.800]  The info war, the info war, the info war starts with you.
[18:18.720 --> 18:25.040]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen, get ready at prisonplanet.tv. Get ready for the launch
[18:25.040 --> 18:33.920]  of the Obama deception. Incidentally, we have multiple computers around the country and in
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.560]  Austin, Texas with it already loaded into them, ready to jam it into the file sharing networks,
[18:38.560 --> 18:44.560]  Google video and YouTube. We will not be stopped in bringing this information out.
[18:45.600 --> 18:51.760]  We've been getting a lot of threats and a lot of chicanery going on. The enemy knows this is
[18:51.760 --> 18:58.960]  going to be powerful and I will tell them now. This film is going out. We trust in God and we
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.400]  know it's going to make it out. We know it's going to get it out. I'm tempted to slam it
[19:02.400 --> 19:09.120]  in high gear and release it right now. In fact, I may just release it. I may release it right now,
[19:09.120 --> 19:16.640]  because this sucker is going to blast the new world order big time. And I want you when it goes up
[19:16.640 --> 19:22.400]  on Google and YouTube, I want you to get it and I want you to put it on every MySpace account,
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.680]  every Facebook account. I want it to every email list over and over again. I want it to be posted
[19:27.680 --> 19:33.440]  on every message board and forum out there. I want it to immediately go mega viral supernova.
[19:34.720 --> 19:39.120]  And then when these zombies come to your door, I want you to have Divx copies ready for them.
[19:39.840 --> 19:43.280]  And I want you to tell them, this is the red pill, you know, the matrix,
[19:44.080 --> 19:50.400]  all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more. You've been betrayed, Bush and Obama are evil.
[19:50.400 --> 19:53.840]  Do you truly want to fix things? Do you truly want real change?
[19:53.840 --> 19:59.360]  Here's the red pill and then just shut the door.
[20:02.960 --> 20:09.920]  Countdown. Countdown. In fact, that's it. We're launching early. I can't control myself.
[20:10.880 --> 20:14.560]  You know what? I mean, in a way, there's two schools of thought building up the momentum
[20:14.560 --> 20:19.360]  and then launching it on that date. I'll have to think about it. I have to think about it.
[20:19.360 --> 20:26.880]  I have to think about it. It's just so much is going on. So much is happening. The enemy
[20:26.880 --> 20:32.480]  is moving so quick. I want to drop now. I'm over the target right now. Why not?
[20:33.280 --> 20:42.000]  Should we release it now? Bombs away on the info or should we wait building up the momentum,
[20:42.000 --> 20:52.240]  building up the big dynamos, the servos, the reactor core as the huge generators
[20:53.280 --> 20:57.840]  power up to fire a devastating blow against the globalist.
[21:01.200 --> 21:07.440]  The new world order beast is genetically modifying your food, genetically modifying
[21:07.440 --> 21:12.640]  mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[21:13.840 --> 21:21.680]  Without a long term food solution, you will have just two options, starve or surrender.
[21:22.480 --> 21:27.280]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out. What then?
[21:29.920 --> 21:35.520]  Go your own healthy food and feed your family forever. Survivalistseeds.com is now the nation's
[21:35.520 --> 21:40.240]  largest bulk heirloom seed company and it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.

[21:59.120 --> 22:06.640]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[22:06.640 --> 22:11.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[22:11.280 --> 22:17.680]  just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that
[22:17.680 --> 22:20.800]  Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[22:20.800 --> 22:25.280]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[22:25.280 --> 22:30.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[22:30.560 --> 22:36.880]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[22:36.880 --> 22:40.400]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[22:40.400 --> 22:46.720]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[25:24.880 --> 25:43.040]  This is an SOS, the Republic's been seized by offshore banks. England, Australia, New Zealand,
[25:43.040 --> 25:48.080]  Canada, the United States are falling to classic military tyranny. The coup d'état has been
[25:48.080 --> 25:53.440]  launched, a corporate takeover is near completion. The people must be alerted to this fraud immediately,
[25:53.440 --> 25:57.760]  they're going to go into the next phase. Total depression, total implosion by design
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.160]  to cause worldwide rioting and bring in a world government. They'll then turn the economy on
[26:02.160 --> 26:06.400]  for a time to sell everybody that globalism is the answer, and then they will clamp down even
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.200]  stronger after that, ladies and gentlemen. Fight back against the banker onslaught with the
[26:11.200 --> 26:18.560]  Obama deception. Order your DVDs now at infowars.com and get ready for the release coming up this
[26:18.560 --> 26:26.400]  Sunday evening at 6 p.m. We're having an intense debate about launching it Friday. I will tell
[26:26.400 --> 26:33.280]  you that right now. I normally do launch things about 12 hours early, and then we don't announce
[26:33.280 --> 26:37.040]  that it's a beta test to make sure everything's working, but we have so many CDNs and backup
[26:37.040 --> 26:44.880]  servers and systems out there, but get ready at prisonplanet.tv. Why am I so hyped up, folks,
[26:44.880 --> 26:54.160]  because things are getting absolutely crazy right now. Look at this story. This is from
[26:55.120 --> 27:01.440]  prisonplanet.com, and it is hyperlinked to all the mainstream news backing up the claims we make
[27:01.440 --> 27:05.840]  here. In fact, most of this article is simply quotes from the mainstream news. Now, listen to
[27:05.840 --> 27:12.720]  this carefully. Glenn Beck says he doesn't know if the FEMA camps are real. Listen to this. Canadian
[27:12.720 --> 27:20.400]  military units to undertake domestic security. Duties would include mass internment of citizens
[27:20.400 --> 27:27.360]  after terrorist attack, mirroring militarization of law enforcement in U.S. and Britain. The
[27:27.360 --> 27:36.000]  Canadian military is reorganizing its priorities to suit a post-911 world by creating reservist
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.760]  units for each area of the country that would be tasked with providing domestic security.
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.960]  That's a quote and involves such roles as the mass internment of citizens in the event of a
[27:44.960 --> 27:49.680]  terrorist attack. And when you read their Army War College, and our Army War College, they say
[27:49.680 --> 27:55.600]  it's for the American people to fight us. The Canadian military is embarked on a wide-ranging plan
[27:55.600 --> 28:01.120]  to turn its reserve soldiers into force units trained and equipped to respond to nightmarish
[28:01.120 --> 28:05.520]  array of domestic threats, reports the National Post. Same things have been announced by the
[28:05.520 --> 28:12.640]  Pentagon or Northcom. The remodeling of the reservist will see the development of specialist units
[28:12.640 --> 28:19.520]  in four of the military's regional divisions, Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario and the West. We're
[28:19.520 --> 28:24.160]  broken into 10 FEMA regions here in the United States. This is an open announcement that Canada
[28:24.160 --> 28:29.840]  has been subdivided into military units that will be policed by military reserves who will take a
[28:29.840 --> 28:36.400]  quote dominant role in domestic operations in the future according to the article. Of course,
[28:36.400 --> 28:40.800]  the necessity of the change is dressed up using the notion of troops helping people
[28:40.800 --> 28:45.280]  in the event of earthquakes, floods and nuclear accidents. But we also learned from one of the
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.160]  duties that the reservists would potentially undertake would be mass internment of citizens
[28:50.160 --> 28:57.920]  in camps or quarantine zones after a biological terror attack. We are training to establish a
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.320]  perimeter. What was the Ohio Guard doing when they go door to door to search people's houses
[29:02.320 --> 29:07.520]  and cupboards? Remember, cordon and perimeter. We are training to establish a perimeter, said
[29:07.520 --> 29:16.160]  Brigadier General Jean Collin. Do I see a scenario when we might be obliged to keep people in?
[29:16.160 --> 29:23.840]  Probably. Oh, probably. Let me read what the Brigadier General said. Do I see a scenario
[29:23.840 --> 29:29.520]  when we might be obliged to keep people in? Probably. Close quote. You need to be trained
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.800]  to be able to make sure that you don't become a casualty in the process of doing security.
[29:34.800 --> 29:39.040]  That's another quote. You don't want to be a casualty when they're dealing with the Canadian
[29:39.040 --> 29:44.880]  people. We are trying to establish perimeter. In light of that comment, it is interesting to
[29:44.880 --> 29:50.880]  note that according to the report, Brigadier General Collin, who has served in Bosnia and
[29:50.880 --> 29:55.920]  Afghanistan, has also been a special advisor to the Chief of the Defense Staff of Homeland
[29:55.920 --> 30:01.680]  Security Issues. Other roles for the military reservists would be to undertake law enforcement
[30:01.680 --> 30:07.280]  and other security duties for domestic events such as the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver
[30:07.280 --> 30:13.680]  and the 2010 G8 Summit of World Leaders in Huntsville. The story dovetails with a report out of
[30:13.680 --> 30:20.240]  Ontario, where authorities, and that's the mainstream news, are considering using, and
[30:20.240 --> 30:24.560]  then you read the article, are you doing it, using troops from local army bases to patrol
[30:24.560 --> 30:29.760]  bar areas on weekends in a supposed attempt to prevent rowdiness. It's like the Marines are
[30:29.760 --> 30:35.440]  here running DWI checkpoints, breaking the ice, conditioning you, PR. We'll come back, finish
[30:35.440 --> 30:42.320]  up with this, and a lot more. Vital economic news, vital news on Iran and the military.
[30:42.320 --> 30:49.200]  It's all coming up. Ron Paul and others, stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[30:50.800 --> 30:57.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[31:00.800 --> 31:05.360]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future. You worry about economic turmoil and
[31:05.360 --> 31:10.080]  food shortages. How to be prepared while preserving your sanity. Your answer may be at hand.
[31:10.080 --> 31:15.040]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land isolated from civilization. She knows that as long as the
[31:15.040 --> 31:20.080]  sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth. Perhaps the only sane
[31:20.080 --> 31:25.520]  insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants. The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows
[31:25.520 --> 31:29.840]  everywhere and you will see it everywhere. It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our
[31:29.840 --> 31:35.040]  modern diets. Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books,

[31:59.280 --> 32:06.480]  impossible. In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[32:07.120 --> 32:12.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[32:12.000 --> 32:17.920]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[32:17.920 --> 32:23.120]  interest of the American people. Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in
[32:23.120 --> 32:28.160]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[32:28.160 --> 32:34.880]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[32:37.040 --> 32:42.720]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama

[34:05.280 --> 34:12.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. It's the front lines of the end for war as we
[34:12.000 --> 34:29.280]  crash through the lies and disinformation as we wage war on corruption. There's a warning sign.
[34:42.320 --> 34:52.080]  Keep on rocking. This is it. You want to be part of history? You want to stand up to evil?
[34:52.720 --> 34:56.960]  You want your life to really matter? This is the fight with the global bankers that funded
[34:56.960 --> 35:04.480]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot and many others. The globalists publicly funded Ho Chi Minh and set
[35:04.480 --> 35:08.800]  him up. Then double-crossed him to have a war. They publicly funded Fidel Castro.
[35:08.800 --> 35:15.280]  They want to wreck societies so they can consolidate. They hate our republic. They hate the United
[35:15.280 --> 35:21.440]  States and they must be defeated. Your children have no future if you don't rise to the occasion
[35:21.440 --> 35:27.760]  and engage the new world order. This is it. No more time to suck your thumbs or screw around.
[35:27.760 --> 35:38.640]  It's now time to take action because there's a woman in the night.
[35:58.160 --> 36:10.000]  How dare them increase the amount of opium by 10-fold and publicly have the military
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.240]  protect the poppies in Afghanistan and ship it into our country. How dare them ship in cocaine
[36:16.240 --> 36:22.240]  and make it cool through Hollywood. How dare them try to put our children on Lindland and Prozac.
[36:22.240 --> 36:28.800]  How dare them kidnap over a million children a year outside the court system through CPS.
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.320]  How dare them inject the public with their deadly vaccines killing and maiming millions.
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.240]  How dare the globalists carry out their disgusting totally wicked eugenics program.
[36:41.360 --> 36:47.680]  And how dare us not fight harder. How dare the people not resist in this one life to live
[36:47.680 --> 36:54.400]  over faced one inch away from our noses with pure wickedness. How could any of you deny
[36:54.400 --> 36:58.400]  what we're seeing. How could any of you not rise to the challenge.
[36:58.400 --> 37:16.400]  How could any of you not fulfill your destiny. Take it in your hands. Be what you were meant to be.
[37:16.400 --> 37:32.400]  We got a kinder gender machine gun hand. Yeah the machine gun hand.
[37:32.400 --> 37:46.720]  We are back live. We are defending the free world in its darkest hour.
[37:49.360 --> 37:55.280]  The United States and every other free nation cannot fall from without. They must fall from
[37:55.280 --> 38:03.760]  within to the battle where the Republic is within. And it is to each of you out there to be part of
[38:03.760 --> 38:08.720]  history on the side of good and to come in and be part of the big win against the new world order.
[38:09.360 --> 38:14.720]  Intellectually the police and military want to join us and are joining us and in their heart and
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.480]  soul they know we're right and they want to join us. They are pulled towards the light they
[38:20.480 --> 38:24.800]  don't like the dark but through peer pressure and conditioning they have been made to accept it.
[38:26.640 --> 38:32.000]  Money doesn't matter. Power doesn't matter. Trinkets and status don't matter. Liberty
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.400]  and justice and honor and duty and everything decent and wholesome is what matters and it
[38:38.400 --> 38:44.160]  must be paid for. It doesn't come free. It doesn't come cheap.
[38:44.160 --> 38:53.840]  But the truth is you will not be fulfilled until you are fighting evil.
[38:55.440 --> 39:01.520]  You were meant when God formed you in your mother's womb. He knew you and you were meant
[39:01.520 --> 39:06.480]  from the foundations of the earth. The creator of the universe knew you and loved you and gave
[39:06.480 --> 39:14.240]  you free will. And the God of this world wants to ensure that you don't get a chance to take part in
[39:14.240 --> 39:20.000]  the great things of life and the great mysteries and that you not grow and that you not go through
[39:20.560 --> 39:24.960]  tribulation, that you be weak and sit on the sidelines so that you can fall and be engulfed
[39:27.280 --> 39:32.320]  and be overtaken by evil. All right, continuing with the news,
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.480]  what's here as we have Ron Paul coming up and others. It is being reported by the way in the
[39:40.240 --> 39:47.360]  Irish newspapers that just as last week the cricket team got machine gun and police just a
[39:47.360 --> 39:52.560]  few feet away stood down and weren't even scared of the shooters. Clearly knew them,
[39:52.560 --> 39:55.680]  the body language is there for multiple surveillance cameras and walked away.
[39:55.680 --> 40:05.280]  Walked away, taking their time. It's now being reported in the Australian,
[40:06.640 --> 40:15.120]  in the Metro news of the UK, London Guardian. It's being reported in the Belfast Telegraph.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.080]  It's being reported in the Sunday Mail.
[40:18.080 --> 40:26.320]  Headline, armed guards stood by as Brit soldiers shot at Northern Ireland base.
[40:28.320 --> 40:32.000]  Another headline, guards stood by as soldiers murdered, always the same MO.
[40:33.120 --> 40:36.640]  We're now getting intel that was probably a drill going on at the time. That way of the
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.640]  terrorists were caught. MI5, MI6, AS, they could say it was just part of a drill.
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.400]  Remember what was in the London Guardian and BBC? They had to admit they were caught in
[40:46.400 --> 40:52.160]  Basra. It's in my film Terror Storm. This happened three and a half years ago, dressed up like Arabs,
[40:52.160 --> 40:58.720]  running around, shooting and killing Iraqi police and at US and British troops.
[40:59.520 --> 41:05.280]  They were caught. They were put in the jail cell. British forces then struck their own
[41:05.280 --> 41:10.960]  provisional police and went in and removed them. But not before the photos of them with the fake
[41:10.960 --> 41:17.040]  beards were put out and it was admitted they were staging terrorist attacks. They don't want
[41:17.040 --> 41:20.880]  the people of Northern and Southern Ireland living in peace. They want the fighting to
[41:20.880 --> 41:26.320]  continue. It's been documented that more than 75% of the leadership of the different IRA
[41:26.320 --> 41:37.200]  subgroups were commanded by MI5, MI6, British SAS. We've had former SAS commandos on the show.
[41:37.200 --> 41:45.600]  We've interviewed people that were killed after they were on the show. That's right. People die.
[41:46.640 --> 41:51.760]  Again, this isn't a game. This isn't a joke. People ask how I could be so intense or why I don't
[41:51.760 --> 41:59.280]  talk about cooking recipes and why I don't talk about barbecuing tricks because I, ladies and
[41:59.280 --> 42:06.400]  gentlemen, have put myself in the center of the arena. I am committed and it feels good
[42:06.400 --> 42:12.400]  because this is where I'm meant to be. This is what I was born to do. And there are those of you
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.480]  out there much stronger, much more intelligent, much harder working than I that could blow away
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.840]  all of my work. And I want you to. I want you to realize that you don't believe you have power,
[42:23.840 --> 42:31.600]  but you do have power. The leaders we need to defeat this system are out there everywhere right now.
[42:31.600 --> 42:37.680]  So get past your fear and join the battle for the Republic.
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.520]  Join in the defense of the planet against the New World Order. So that is coming up
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.920]  later in the show. One police officer shot dead, two members of the military,
[42:51.920 --> 43:03.200]  clearly a staged event. It was an inside job, just like it always is. And while you were sleeping,
[43:04.080 --> 43:11.520]  this little island disappeared. While you were looking the other way,
[43:11.520 --> 43:21.520]  they took your right to own your own ideas. And it's an inside job.
[43:24.720 --> 43:30.240]  Meanwhile, Canadian military units prepare to put their citizens in FEMA camps and for the
[43:30.240 --> 43:35.920]  military to patrol the streets of Canada, openly being announced as it's openly being announced
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.440]  in every other Western nation being overtaken by the private banking syndicate, the criminals.
[43:44.880 --> 43:50.240]  You know, I began plugging the Obama deception as explosive release coming up this weekend.
[43:51.920 --> 43:54.880]  And I didn't even give out the toll free number, I believe. I hope everybody will call
[43:54.880 --> 44:07.120]  and order the DVD now at 888-253-3139. That's 888-253-3139. And I want you to get the DVD
[44:07.120 --> 44:12.240]  and I want you to make copies of it and get it out to everyone you know. And when these Obama
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.880]  zombies come to your door promoting their New World Order, which they're now launching them to do,
[44:17.600 --> 44:22.400]  you can give them the Obama deception, which is a red pill to get them out of the matrix.
[44:22.400 --> 44:29.200]  It is a rope, a ladder to help them get out of the muck of mind control and bondage that they're in.
[44:33.040 --> 44:37.360]  Finishing up with this article. The Story Dove tells of the report out of Ontario,
[44:37.360 --> 44:41.200]  where authorities are considering using trips, and then it admits in the article they're already
[44:41.200 --> 44:45.520]  doing it, with a local army base to patrol bar areas on weekends. You're for stopping drunk
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.440]  sorries, the same thing being done in the U.S. The Marines are here at the checkpoints to stop
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.640]  drunk. You're not for drugs, are you? We've got to do something about the drugs. Meanwhile,
[44:52.640 --> 44:55.200]  they admit, oh, and by the way, when I put you in FEMA camps, we're just getting you ready.
[44:56.240 --> 45:00.160]  Using trips in the local army base to patrol bar areas on weekends in supposed attempt
[45:01.040 --> 45:09.280]  to prevent rowdiness. Mention is also made of scenarios that might require a form of
[45:09.280 --> 45:14.880]  a stabular or policing function for reserves in civilian containment and security.
[45:14.880 --> 45:22.640]  Civilian containment, containment of your cities, FEMA camps, the Warsaw Ghetto, it is here.
[45:22.640 --> 45:28.240]  They are announcing it because they're preparing to launch. They are considering pulling the trigger.
[45:28.800 --> 45:33.120]  And you're not going to hear this radio show anymore. It could come any day, any week, any
[45:33.120 --> 45:38.800]  month, any year. Every time we have victories and back them off, our enemies crow and cackle and say,
[45:38.800 --> 45:42.080]  where is the martial law as they openly put trips on the streets and build the camps.
[45:42.080 --> 45:49.760]  Understand this is an ongoing battle, ladies and gentlemen. We back them off from the North
[45:49.760 --> 45:53.920]  American Union, Security Prosperity Partnership, Manhattan Superhighways, Trans Texas Corridor.
[45:53.920 --> 45:57.280]  And of course, they come back and rename it and continue it. And then we go back and expose
[45:57.280 --> 46:01.440]  how they're liars. And then they come back again with more lies and we expose them again. We fight
[46:01.440 --> 46:06.400]  them and we fight them and we fight them and we fight them and we fight them and we fight them
[46:06.400 --> 46:13.440]  and we fight them and we fight them and we never surrender. We never give up. We stand up in a
[46:13.440 --> 46:22.320]  bold fashion against these criminals and we expose their criminal operations to the fullest extent.
[46:24.400 --> 46:31.200]  And I love the idea of the guy with the Alex Jones 2012 website. I forget the exact address.
[46:31.200 --> 46:35.360]  They're saying, you know, male terror storm and in game and Obama deception when it comes out
[46:35.360 --> 46:40.720]  to all the National Guard who are now North come. I mean, if you know somebody in the National Guard,
[46:40.720 --> 46:47.520]  that is a jewel in the fight against the New World Order. That is, you ought to be fighting with
[46:47.520 --> 46:53.280]  yourselves, you know, stumbling over each other, trying to get to the military to wake them up
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.520]  and to inform them. And you're going to find they're already freaked out. They already know many of
[46:57.520 --> 47:03.280]  them because if we can reach the police and military, the bankers will back off and they
[47:03.280 --> 47:07.040]  will turn the economy back on. They're the ones badmouthing the economy. They're the ones that
[47:07.040 --> 47:12.720]  caught off liquidity. They're the ones bragging how they engineered this. They're not ever going
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.920]  to turn the economy back on until we have them arrested for treason and criminal racketeering.
[47:17.920 --> 47:23.360]  You understand that? The only solution is the republic rising and arresting these criminals.
[47:23.360 --> 47:36.240]  I am boldly calling for their arrest. And boy, I can feel the sort of damocles come closer to
[47:36.240 --> 47:42.800]  my neck when I do that, but it doesn't matter. I have committed to go on to the end, whatever
[47:42.800 --> 47:51.200]  the cost may be, and to never surrender. Like Winston Churchill said, we should go on to the end,
[47:51.200 --> 48:00.320]  whatever the cost may be, we shall fight. We shall fight in the hills. We shall fight in the
[48:00.320 --> 48:09.200]  valleys. We shall fight with growing strength and confidence on the internet. We shall fight in
[48:09.200 --> 48:16.080]  the churches. We shall fight for the minds of free humans everywhere. And we shall never surrender.
[48:16.080 --> 48:23.440]  In fact, I want to come in with that in the next segment. I think I sent it to you a year ago.
[48:23.440 --> 48:30.800]  I think I heard it play, John. YouTube aces high. And I want it with the intro with Churchill when
[48:30.800 --> 48:46.160]  we come back in. Okay, buddy? Aces high. And we'll come in with that in the next segment.
[48:47.680 --> 48:50.480]  What an abomination this article is to see what they're doing.
[48:56.320 --> 49:00.000]  Would reservists opposed to the use of military units for purposes of domestic law enforcement
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.480]  not show up, or would they just follow orders under the jurisdiction of a breakdown authority
[49:04.480 --> 49:08.800]  after a biological attack or a mass rioting after a total economic collapse? I'm not so confident
[49:08.800 --> 49:12.560]  that people who have been kicking down doors, abducting, torturing, and killing people in
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.600]  Afghanistan for seven years under the justification that they are terrorists would be unwilling to
[49:17.600 --> 49:22.880]  do the same to Canadian citizens if they were drilled with the same propaganda. The militarization
[49:22.880 --> 49:26.960]  of law enforcement duties in the U.S., Canada, and Britain is accelerating at a pace never before
[49:26.960 --> 49:33.360]  seen. Yeah, it's at warp 10. Last week, it was revealed the British Army is on standby to deal
[49:33.360 --> 49:37.040]  with rioting in the U.K. streets as a result of economic crises, according to the newspaper
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.360]  report, which states that MI5 is targeting political activists who could help to create a
[49:41.360 --> 49:45.600]  summer of discontent. And then these very anarchist groups that they list, we've tracked them,
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.920]  they're feds, been proven to be feds. They'll have peaceful people out with baby strollers
[49:49.920 --> 49:54.080]  protesting. Feds will attack other police like they did this year in Denver. Now Denver Post,
[49:54.080 --> 50:00.560]  police admit it, and they are going to savagely attack crowds.
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.680]  But what are you going to do in the U.S.? We're not disarmed like they are in Australia and the U.K.
[50:07.920 --> 50:11.440]  Meanwhile, in the U.S. urban warfare training drills are taking place across the country,
[50:11.440 --> 50:15.120]  as Northcom announces that tens of thousands of active duty troops will be stationed inside
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.360]  the United States for domestic purposes. The U.S. Army War College in November released a
[50:19.360 --> 50:25.120]  white paper called, Known Unknowns, Unconventional Strategic Shocks in Defense Strategy Deployment
[50:25.760 --> 50:31.360]  Development. The report warned that the military must be prepared for a violent strategic dislocation
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.440]  inside the United States, which could be provoked by unforeseen economic collapse. They foresaw
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.280]  it. They triggered it. Purposeful domestic resistance, that's a quote, purposeful domestic
[50:39.280 --> 50:44.480]  resistance by the states. Northcom is aimed at the governors. Pervasive public health emergencies
[50:44.480 --> 50:51.440]  are a loss of functioning political and legal order. The widespread civil violence, the document
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.800]  said, would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities and extremes to defend basic
[50:56.800 --> 51:05.600]  domestic order and human security. I think this article needs to be read by more people,
[51:05.600 --> 51:10.160]  Canadian military to undertake domestic security, especially if you live in the United States,
[51:10.160 --> 51:15.120]  Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand under the Queen's control, and we are under the Queen's
[51:15.120 --> 51:20.800]  control. Obama, of course, will go kneel before her ahead of the Globalist Summit. An unprecedented
[51:20.800 --> 51:27.040]  act by a U.S. president, they're publicly nighting the last gaggle of crooks that left the Bush
[51:27.040 --> 51:35.920]  administration. The move is upon us, military and financial dictatorship over our beloved
[51:35.920 --> 51:41.440]  Republic. All of you that claim you swore an oath to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and
[51:41.440 --> 51:47.440]  domestic. There's no more time to live in denial. The facts are in your face. We were right about
[51:47.440 --> 51:52.880]  it all. We were only reading the Globalist Blueprints and White Papers. I ask you now,
[51:53.600 --> 51:59.360]  which side are you on? Who do you stand with? Make the decision. Choose now.
[52:00.560 --> 52:05.360]  What will you do when the economy collapses? Store shelves are empty and your stored food
[52:05.360 --> 52:10.640]  is gone. How will you feed your family? True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being
[52:10.640 --> 52:16.480]  able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family. Getseeds.net

[52:59.920 --> 53:06.720]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[53:06.720 --> 53:11.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[53:11.280 --> 53:18.240]  just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama
[53:18.240 --> 53:23.440]  is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[53:23.440 --> 53:28.240]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[53:28.240 --> 53:35.520]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[53:35.520 --> 53:41.120]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[53:41.120 --> 53:48.400]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[53:48.400 --> 53:55.600]  Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super-high quality at prisonplanet.tv,

[55:22.720 --> 55:30.800]  England, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Western Europe, Northern Europe.
[55:32.320 --> 55:40.320]  Latin America, Africa. Their assassinations, killings, overthrows. It's all beginning across the
[55:40.320 --> 55:56.240]  planet. The New World Order is marching. They're pulling out all the stops. They're on the move.
[56:01.600 --> 56:04.720]  The attack is now. Let's go ahead and play a little bit at Winston Churchill, of course,
[56:04.720 --> 56:10.160]  who actually helped fund Hitler and the Milner group and set it all up. But here he was rallying
[56:10.160 --> 56:14.400]  the British people during the Battle of Britain. Here it is.
[56:40.160 --> 56:46.880]  And on us, Hitler knows that he will have to break up in this island or lose the war.
[56:46.880 --> 56:53.200]  If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be freed and the life of the world may move forward
[56:53.920 --> 57:03.040]  into broad, funded uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States,
[57:03.040 --> 57:09.200]  including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age,
[57:09.200 --> 57:19.120]  made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the likes of possessive science. Let us therefore
[57:19.120 --> 57:26.640]  brace ourselves to our duty. So bear ourselves the gift of the British Empire and its Commonwealth
[57:27.680 --> 57:34.640]  lost for a thousand years. Men will still say this was their private hour.
[57:34.640 --> 57:42.080]  Ah, the empire. It's actually the empire taking over right now. And whether you're American or
[57:42.080 --> 57:47.600]  British, it doesn't matter. We are being enslaved and completely bankrupted by the transnational
[57:47.600 --> 57:55.440]  banks right now publicly. And they've now had Larry Summers crawl out from underneath a rock
[57:56.560 --> 58:02.160]  at the White House and say we need trillions more for the bankers and smile and snicker and rub his
[58:02.160 --> 58:08.320]  rat-like hands together. This is an economic takeover, not some enemy coming across the sea.
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.840]  But to back up their corporate seizure, their hijacking of our free nations,
[58:16.800 --> 58:21.680]  they use Northcom. They use their military forces to do it. But these military forces,
[58:22.560 --> 58:26.480]  their grandmothers, their fathers, their mothers, their cousins, their brothers, their neighbors,
[58:27.120 --> 58:31.760]  their communities are going to be enslaved by this and they're going to lower our standard
[58:31.760 --> 58:38.640]  of living and bring in a high-tech Stasi-type state. So I say to those out there,
[58:41.120 --> 58:46.480]  I say to those who have sat on the fence about this, there's no more time for that. Now, I know
[58:46.480 --> 58:50.400]  that I do radio interviews almost every day. I'm going to cut back because I've been so busy.
[58:50.400 --> 58:53.280]  And these talk shows, many of them are people that would attack me in the past. And now they
[58:53.280 --> 58:57.920]  say, I guess you were right. What do we do? Because they realize they're not pet puppies. They're not
[58:57.920 --> 59:06.720]  part of the system. They realize that this is real. The New World Order is real. They are
[59:06.720 --> 59:11.040]  tyrannical. They are putting cancer viruses in the vaccines. You know, it's scary to admit all
[59:11.040 --> 59:17.120]  this. It's scary to face all of this. It's scary to deal with the New World Order onslaught. But
[59:17.120 --> 59:22.960]  it's more frightening to just crawl in a hole and hope that the wolves pass you by. No, let's stand
[59:22.960 --> 59:32.320]  on our own hind legs and let's meet the challenge today. We can't wait any longer. So get the word
[59:32.320 --> 59:38.000]  out, warn the people, go to every hill and mountain and let them know the time to defend the Republic
[59:38.000 --> 59:48.400]  is here. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:48.400 --> 59:55.040]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[59:55.040 --> 59:59.760]  And today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[59:59.760 --> 1:00:03.680]  You'll never have to stand in a red line until you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to
[1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:08.880]  the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:12.480]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you. You know,
[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:16.480]  eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:20.800]  salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports. And they do it at almost half the cost

[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:21.360]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:27.600]  All right, my friends, the Obama deception will be released coming up March 15th at
[1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:34.240]  PrisonPlanet.tv and on DVD, exposing his real agenda. So take action, activists.
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:38.240]  We're joined for the next 20 minutes by Congressman Ron Paul, who's up there on the
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:42.880]  hill today, a very busy man. And everything he talked about for 30 years is unfortunately
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:48.400]  unfolding. So his credibility is at the gold standard right now as the mainstream is forced
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:52.720]  to check into the facts he's been laying out. I wanted to talk to him about the deepening
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:57.520]  depressionary system we're going into, what the private Federal Reserve is up to and his bill
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:01.120]  to abolish it, how we can support that. Congressman, thank you for coming on.
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:02.880]  You're welcome. Good to be with you.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.200]  Every few weeks they come before the banking committee and you bring up the fact that what
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:12.560]  they're doing is destroying us. What do we need to do to bring the private Federal Reserve under
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:19.200]  control? Well, it has to be an uprising by the people. There has to be enough people who will
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:27.360]  demand that their congressmen respond. And that is building. A year ago or two, nobody in Washington
[1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:32.240]  even thought about the Federal Reserve. Today, there's a lot more thinking going on and a lot
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:39.440]  more support for our position. So it is growing. And yet we're not on the verge of changing it.
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:45.280]  I have the bill to get rid of the Federal Reserve. That's the major step and the ultimate step.
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:48.880]  And they'll probably self-destruct before we actually pass legislation.
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:55.440]  But the bill that is more important in the short run is the auditing bill, the 1207
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:00.160]  bill, because that means that they have to start answering our questions. Today, they're protected.
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:06.000]  They're in total secrecy and they're protected by the law. If 1207 is passed, we have an audit
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:12.240]  and they have to answer the questions. And I figure if we ever get that far and get the exposure
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:16.400]  and get the transparency that we need, then people will wake up and realize,
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:22.000]  why do we have them at all? Senator Sanders grilled them, as you know, last week saying that
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:28.960]  he's supporting 1207 or a version in the Senate because Bernanke, private Fed chief, just said,
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:33.360]  I'm not going to tell you where the money went, buddy. I mean, that's amazing to see our elected
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:37.840]  Congress, the most powerful branch of government, according to the founders, being told, kiss off.
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:42.800]  Right. And I know Senator Sanders real well. He was on the banking committee with me before he
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:49.040]  went into the Senate and I called him after that. And I believe he has now introduced my version
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:55.120]  of the Transparency Bill and he and I've introduced his version. So both bills exist.
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:59.920]  Mine's a little bit more conclusive and it removes the total authority for them to
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:07.520]  not answer questions. His is specifically designed to answer certain questions and reveal where so,
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:12.800]  you know, the trillion dollars went. They're very similar, but somewhat different in nature.
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:17.440]  So we both support each other's bill and they've been introduced in both chambers.
[1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:22.160]  Well, public support for this and the Congress itself, the majority are saying they're angry to
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:27.120]  not know where the money is and Bloomberg sued to find out and has been told no on their foyer.
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:31.600]  I mean, if this gets media attention, I can see no way that Congress wouldn't vote
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:33.840]  for a proper audit of the private fellow reserve.
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:41.760]  No, they're going to if we can get it that far. And, you know, it's a good issue. So,
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:47.200]  like so many of our issues, we bring different factions together, liberal and conservative,
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:52.480]  under the Constitution, because if you're a good, honest liberal like Bernie Sanders,
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:58.080]  he, he's an honest person, but he's very, very liberal and calls himself a socialist,
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:03.680]  but he agrees on the transparency issues. So this whole idea that we expose them should bring
[1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:08.160]  populist libertarians, constitutionals, liberals, socialists all together and say,
[1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:12.400]  you know, if we can't do this, what's left of representative government? There's nothing left.
[1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:14.960]  So it's a good unifier. I think it's a great issue.
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:20.000]  Bloomberg reports 9.7 trillion has disappeared in one form or another just out of the U.S.,
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:26.320]  another 10 trillion globally. And now Larry Summers is saying they want more money. They
[1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:31.600]  want more unlimited cash. That's what they're doing. They keep coming back. You know, and what's
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:36.960]  the argument you hear up here? You hear this argument, which I know there's some disagreement
[1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:42.800]  even in our circles, this whole idea of earmarks. They're dealing with these 1% of earmarks. If
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:47.200]  you vote against them all, you don't cut one penny of spending. And they're talking about that
[1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:51.920]  endlessly. They're holding up the bill in the Congress over this so-called issue. At the same
[1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:57.600]  time, this number that you mentioned, the 9.7 trillion dollars, we need to earmark every penny
[1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:03.600]  there. Stay there. Stay there, Congressman. Stay there. More than 700 chemicals have been found
[1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:07.760]  in our drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while
[1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:12.320]  taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when
[1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:17.760]  they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with
[1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:23.440]  both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron. And it inhibits
[1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:29.520]  the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts
[1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:34.480]  10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment
[1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:39.680]  facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you?
[1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:46.160]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:09.680]  Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force
[1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:16.400]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:20.880]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:26.560]  While Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:32.160]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:38.560]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right.
[1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:43.600]  It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for,
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:50.080]  the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:03.600]  The people strike back. Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:07.440]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:12.400]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:17.040]  most trusted sponsors. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:22.400]  when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes,
[1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:26.720]  and produces electricity for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:31.760]  in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:36.480]  spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:41.280]  suffer through painful power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:48.000]  powered generator from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.

[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:21.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:27.680]  Okay, Congressman, I'm going to take a hard break there for the satellites because it's syndicated.
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:33.040]  Sorry about interrupting you. You were getting into the 9.7 trillion that's disappeared to a
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:37.200]  black hole, not 700 billion, which they said was just a really big number they picked,
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:42.640]  and then you got cut off with a break. Go ahead. Yeah, I was talking about the need to monitor
[1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:47.840]  everything that we do in a transparency. And too often, people concentrate on a non-issue,
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:52.960]  which is 1% of the budget called earmarks. And even if you eliminate it and wouldn't eliminate
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:58.320]  one penny, the real earmarks need to be done, you know, like, say, tarp funds. We gave the
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:04.800]  Treasury $350 billion and then another $350 billion, and there are no instructions, no earmarks.
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:09.360]  The Congress needs to have more responsibility, more earmarks. Of course, all the spending should
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:15.360]  be voted down, but when they do spend, we ought to know where it's going. But the biggest, the
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:20.320]  largest amount, of course, is the Federal Reserve. They're totally on off-budget. They're like a
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:25.840]  government unto itself. They can create trillions. It's probably $8 or $9, $10 trillion that they've
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:30.640]  been involved in, and they have no legal responsibility to answer any of our questions.
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:35.680]  And that, of course, is what Bernie Sanders and I have been working on here in the Senate
[1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:40.800]  and me over in the House to try to get legislation passed. And I think you've indicated that it
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:45.920]  ought to be a very popular thing to bring all these factions together and support our position.
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:51.840]  I can't imagine any Americans saying, well, yeah, I create $4, $500 billion or a couple trillion,
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:56.160]  and you have no responsibility. I think it should bring everybody together on this issue.
[1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:57.600]  And was that HR 207?
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:10:58.960]  1207.
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:01.440]  Okay. HR 1207.
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:01.840]  Right.
[1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:03.440]  I didn't have the bill in front of me.
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:07.600]  And then I should have the Senate bill number, but somebody could find that rather easily because
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.200]  we want to help Sanders get support for his bill as well.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.960]  Absolutely. In fact, I'll Google that and give that out after you leave us.
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:22.480]  Continuing with the economy, this is clearly an entering depression level. The banks are doing
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:25.840]  what you said they would do. They're hoarding the money, buying up other good banks.
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:30.000]  CBS reported $250 billion of bailout money has gone to the Caimans alone.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.880]  The biggest names out there, Bernard Madoff is keeping a $60 million penthouse and mailing
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:40.640]  gold and diamonds out of the country to his family that's run to South America.
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:45.760]  He's the founder of the NASDAQ. It turns out all these other big banks are involved in similar
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:49.840]  Ponzi schemes. Shouldn't we be having criminal investigations of these people instead of the
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:54.560]  very same banksters now telling us we're going to have a new bank of the world that we pay carbon
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:55.520]  taxes to?
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:00.320]  Yeah, we should have minimal government, but even in a minimalist government, your government is
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:07.600]  supposed to deal with theft and physical harm and fraud, and that's what's going on, and that's
[1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:12.640]  what they ignore or protect. They're supposed to protect contracts, but they're interfering with
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:17.520]  contracts all the time and trying to tell people exactly what mortgage rates should be and interest
[1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:24.720]  rates should be and price fixing and all these things. But no, I think it's horrible what they're
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:29.600]  doing and they're not addressing the subject that they should, and they should be prosecuting
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:36.160]  these people. These people should be in prison. But if you go back to Enron, when that company
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:42.000]  went bankrupt, it was a major event, and they claimed up here in Washington that the reason was
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.080]  that we needed even more regulation, we needed more SEC agents, and we needed more IRS agents.
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:53.360]  At the same time, he was convicted of fraud under Texas fraud laws, and he went to prison,
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:59.120]  and that thing was cleaned up in the market, wiped out the value of the company because it had no
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:04.880]  value. But what was our response in Congress was to pass Sarbanes-Oxley more regulations,
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:10.160]  which have actually contributed to some of the weakness in the economy. You just can't
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:15.200]  regulate away the mistakes that are made when governments are too much involved with community
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:21.040]  reinvestment acts and easy money that the Federal Reserve creates. Regulations cannot solve that
[1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:26.640]  problem, but your point, the purpose of the federal government should be under these circumstances
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:31.600]  to prosecute fraud. We'll take the Securities and Exchange Commission testifying before Congress
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:37.600]  what almost a month ago, they declared presidential prerogative and executive authority, I guess,
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:42.880]  under national security to not talk about why for nine years they were given private investigations
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:48.640]  detailing Bernie Madoff's crimes, and they kept saying to the Congress people, well, he hasn't
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:54.960]  been convicted, he hasn't pled guilty, and they said it's not alleged, he's admitted to this.
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:02.560]  Yeah, and you know, as bad as the executive branch is, so much of that responsibility falls on the
[1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:09.440]  Congress too. I mean, we're so negligent to allow the executive branch to run rough shot over us,
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:14.400]  but if we had some people in the Congress that would have a little bit of courage,
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:21.440]  and they could deal with this and handle it, but no, if they spread national security interest,
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:26.960]  you know, what it has to do with torture and secret prisons and prison camps and, you know,
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:33.920]  all those kind of things, oh, national security, we can't interfere with that, so therefore the
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:42.240]  Congress has nothing. Specifically, sir, speaking of national security, Obama has said,
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:46.560]  Reuters headline, Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees under Bill of Rights
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:52.400]  Constitution or Geneva Convention. He's increasing the troops in Afghanistan. He's saying he's going
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:59.040]  to keep troops in definitely at least 50,000 in Iraq. Going back on that promise, he's declaring
[1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:04.720]  a lot of executive privilege that he criticized under Bush, and he's expanding the Northcom
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:10.800]  20,000 troops to patrol America. He's creating this quasi-governmentalusaservice.org. I mean,
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:15.520]  can you comment on those points of Obama? And many people are saying it looks like he may be
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:20.800]  worse than Bush on liberties. Yeah, and I don't hesitate to make that point, especially if I
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:25.520]  happen to get on a liberal station that might be sympathetic with some of my views, but they still
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:29.920]  like Obama, and they're still hopeful. In a few places, I keep my fingers crossed, and I say,
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:35.360]  I hope, you know, he does what he said he was going to do. But early on in Bush's administration,
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:40.960]  you know, he said we shouldn't be the policemen of the world, and we shouldn't be involved in
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:45.280]  the nation building like that bad guy, Clinton. But then he went and did it even more so. I think
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:50.240]  your concerns are justified, because even though Obama was the so-called peace candidate, and he
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:55.840]  was going to bring our troops home in that war in Iraq, I'm afraid there's evidence now that
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:01.520]  shows that he's going to, you know, pursue the same foreign policy, which was my argument during
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:07.680]  the campaign that no matter what happens, both major parties support the same foreign policy,
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:12.880]  the same monetary policy, the same welfare policy, and there's never really any change.
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:19.760]  In spite of that, I think it remains to be seen. Every once in a while, you'll see in the point,
[1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:25.280]  at least one or two appointments that Obama has made that you're hopeful that they will become
[1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:29.520]  more concerned about our civil liberties. But I don't think there's any reason for us to rejoice.
[1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:33.840]  Well, I mean, he's bringing in all the very Clinton people who are the ones that got rid of
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:38.960]  the Glass-Steagall Act and others, the literal engineers of what's happening now with derivatives,
[1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:44.960]  and then they're up there grandstanding as our saviors. Yeah, and they're pursuing all the
[1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:51.120]  spending and the secret tough stuff going on, whether it's with Treasury or with the reserve.
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:57.680]  And the markets, you know, in spite of how a lot of people think the markets don't know what's
[1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:02.960]  going on, the markets are pretty smart. So the fact that they're not responding in spite of all this
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:05.840]  stuff the government is doing, every time the government comes up with a new program,
[1:17:05.840 --> 1:17:11.680]  the markets even go down more. So the markets are saying that they're not very happy with the
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:16.480]  bailout, not going to solve the problem. And the free market people are actually right because
[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:22.160]  you need liquidation, you need the elimination of the malinvestment, you need to get housing prices
[1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:28.240]  down so poor people can buy them and get rid of these 19 million empty houses. No, you can't
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:34.320]  stimulate housing until these houses are bought. And so far, they haven't quite understood that.
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:38.160]  All right, Congressman, with the four or five minutes we've got left, I want to blitz through
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:42.480]  some quick questions for you. I know when you were on Glenn Beck, he says, I've been looking at
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:48.640]  these camps, is there anything to it? We have the Houston Chronicle admitting they built FEMA camps.
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:55.840]  We have the bill introduced to build more and then merge the police and local communities and
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:02.320]  with them. They have signed Pentagon directives, as you know, to use regular Army. In Canada,
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:06.000]  they're announcing they're going to use the military. The Army War College says the military
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:11.040]  is preparing to engage the American people. And I know you're informed because I've never talked
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:15.600]  to you about something that you weren't informed about. And so you did say on the show, well,
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:19.920]  the public's worried because Washington's out of control. But when John Warner Defense
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:25.760]  Authorization Act and some of the new executive orders that have come out, but also just Pentagon
[1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:30.080]  directives, I can pull them up, they're saying governors will be dual headed federal officers.
[1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:36.000]  And now they have Marines at checkpoints looking for drunk drivers, you know, in California.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.720]  I mean, all of this is going on, sir. So can you specifically speak to the danger of North
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:46.320]  Com taking over or is that on a problem? No, I think I think it definitely is a problem.
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:52.720]  And yet on the on the on a bright side, if we're if we're looking for one,
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:56.400]  because you know, we've had 20 states now introduce resolutions, they were sick of the
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:00.720]  theft and we might have to talk about state sovereignty again. So there's a healthy
[1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:07.920]  reaction to this. But yes, we should be concerned. But because I deal with these people, although I
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:12.560]  know there's a lot of evil out there, I also know the average member of Congress probably
[1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:17.680]  isn't a participant in a grand conspiracy. They'll come along and they say, well, all we're doing is
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:23.680]  states are inefficient and private sources don't work. We got to provide housing and the first
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:29.520]  housing is on a military base. That's all we're doing. And a lot of them will they'll buy into this
[1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:34.960]  and they'll accept it, even though others have other ideas on what's really going on. But the
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:41.600]  whole notion is so dangerous, even if it's all very well intended is so dangerous, because they want
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:46.720]  central economic planning, it doesn't work. So they need authority, they become authoritarian.
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:52.560]  And it's, it's like, you know, what they do when they want to mold personal behavior, they have to
[1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:57.520]  police Congress and you hit the nail, you hit the nail exactly on the head. They're rolling this
[1:19:57.520 --> 1:20:02.800]  out like, Oh, there'll be emergency medical centers at military bases and a brig for bad people. And
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:07.680]  the army's going to have to maintain order when the government engineered this economic crisis.
[1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:13.120]  Yeah, and a lot of people will buy into that. And then the too often in the past, what happens is
[1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:17.920]  it gets too far along and it's hard to reverse. But what we have to do is look on the bright side
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:22.000]  and say, well, we have to inform people to know what their rights are, know what the Constitution
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:28.160]  says, know what the states can do. And I'm delighted that a few states now are standing up. And they
[1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:33.680]  want to talk about nullification. You know, this is great stuff. And it's perfectly legal and it's
[1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:40.160]  nonviolent. It's constitutional. And if our numbers grow, we can do it nonviolently. And hope that we
[1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:44.800]  don't get to that point where all the guns are pointing with some Americans are pointing guns
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:50.080]  at other Americans. That would, to me, be the worst thing that could happen. Congressman,
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:55.920]  in closing, what are other solutions? I mean, obviously get behind the state sovereignty,
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:01.440]  the states created the feds, we can, you know, bring them to heel, have grand juries move for
[1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:06.080]  indictments of these criminal bankers for all their racketeering and Ponzi schemes are that
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:11.440]  solutions. What are some other solutions and barring those solutions? How bad do you think the
[1:21:11.440 --> 1:21:14.720]  government's going to wreck the world economy? How bad do you think it's going to get?
[1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:23.520]  Well, I think it's going to be very, very prolonged. I don't see any rebound markets may come back up
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:28.960]  and that sort of thing. But to rebound, I would expect it to last every bit as long as it happened
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:34.560]  in the thirties and the thirties actually ended up until after World War II. And finally, the debt
[1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:40.240]  was liquidated. Then they, after World War II, they actually cut spending by two thirds and they
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:46.640]  cut taxes by one third. And we went back to work again. So it's going to be a long, long time.
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:52.080]  But now I think we live in greater danger because people are more demanding. They believe they have
[1:21:52.080 --> 1:22:00.160]  a right to their neighbor's property. And that's why there's loble to be violence. But I think
[1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:06.160]  we all have to be prepared. I think we should prepare our families. And I think financially,
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:10.480]  ultimately, they're going to destroy the dollar. I don't see anything wrong with people
[1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:15.040]  believing in the Constitution and following what they thought should be legal tender and owning
[1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:20.160]  a few gold coins and a few silver coins and on how to defend themselves. That's what the founders
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:26.160]  talked about. But to me, the most important thing is that we invest in promoting the right ideas
[1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:30.640]  and promoting ideas of liberty and promoting the rule of law and promoting our Constitution,
[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:35.520]  because I've said so many times in the campaign that if we did that, I promised we'd solve rather
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:40.400]  quickly and non-violently. All right, you've got to go. I did have one question I forgot to ask.
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:44.880]  Iran, Israel is saying in their papers, they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:48.960]  Every strategist out there on the left and the right, you know, mainstream says this could
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:54.480]  cause World War III. It will definitely cause major economic problems. And Iran might actually
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:59.360]  launch real attacks. I mean, how serious of a situation is that?
[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:06.000]  It is. And if we believe Obama, you know, he did make an outreach, was including the Iranians in
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:11.360]  some talks. And hopefully that is helpful. But also might be as covered as say that, okay,
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:15.920]  they came in and they didn't do what we said. So therefore we did our very best. And now we'll
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:22.720]  have to use some other tactics and maybe, you know, acknowledge what Israel might do. I have no idea
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:26.400]  what's going to happen. I think the fact that we talked a whole lot about that in the last two years
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:32.720]  of the Bush administration helped have him back off from doing anything or Israel backing off.
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:39.040]  Right now, it's up for grabs. But I believe if that does happen, a lot of violence is on the
[1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:45.360]  ground. Look, there's more violence in Iraq now than there's been for a year. And also Afghanistan
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:53.280]  is exploding and we're bombing almost on a daily basis, a routine basis into Pakistan.
[1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:59.440]  And we're just looking to spread this war, which of course I consider the real threat to us all.
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:03.120]  Well, at the same time, you've been out there front and center. People now know the alternative
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:07.840]  of Liberty. Those can visit the Liberty Committee and get involved or just Google the name Ron Paul.
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:12.560]  In closing, fire out a few of the key websites people can visit to get behind your bill to
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:17.120]  audit the Federal Reserve. The best ones campaign for Liberty dot com and you can go from there
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:22.080]  and support us on that issue because the members of Congress and our senators need to know.
[1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:25.360]  Congressman, we'll talk to you coming up in a month or so. God bless you and say hi to the
[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:29.840]  family for me. Thank you very much. All right, fantastic. There was Congressman Ron Paul. I
[1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:35.120]  skipped the network break, not the station break station breaks coming up for everybody in about
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:43.360]  five minutes. I skipped that network break so that everybody would have a chance to hear more
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:47.840]  from Congressman Ron Paul. And he's just doing a great job. I mean, he's introduced bills that
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:51.680]  have a good chance of passing if we get behind them to audit the criminals of the Federal Reserve.
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:56.240]  He said the criminal bankers need to be indicted by state grand juries and arrested.
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:00.960]  He's introduced bills to abolish the Federal Reserve. It's up to like 70 something sponsors
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:05.760]  right now. He talked about 20 something states. It's more like 32 now introducing legislation,
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:10.160]  but he's always conservative. That's like a month old number. I mean, it was just absolutely
[1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:15.520]  amazing interview with Congress from Ron Paul. But I'll tell you where the biggest solution is
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:21.760]  and that is with you, the American people, look in the mirror. If you want the solution,
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:28.640]  then you need to simply look in the mirror and realize that we have to go out there and engage
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:34.000]  in the info war. We have to educate people one mind at a time, give them the red pill,
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:40.880]  wake them up in the matrix and the Obama deception comes out March 15th on DVD and at

[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:28.800]  canvas and map who supports Barack Obama and then try to intimidate you into going along with their

[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:51.920]  well. They think they're repudiating Bush. They don't know it's the same agenda on steroids.
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:27:00.000]  You need to reach out to them. You need to go to their meetings and say, oh, yeah,
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:04.880]  I'm against Bush. Oh, all the secret arrest and the wars. But what about Obama? Check out this film.
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:09.040]  Tell me what you think about it. And they're real cult like the leaders will try to kick you out.

[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:09.520]  They put so much hype behind this guy that that's actually one of the scales missing on the
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:16.720]  dragon's belly where we can really give it to him. So again, ladies and gentlemen, info wars dot

[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:48.400]  We are only talking about four and a half, five days away. Let me see that. Yeah, five days away
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:52.640]  since it's halfway into Sunday. Actually, it's about four and a half days away.
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:59.440]  We are so excited about this. This is so exciting. What's going on happening because
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:04.560]  you heard Ron Paul, he'll tell it like it is. He said, people are waking up everywhere. People
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:09.600]  are waking up in droves to the FEMA camps, to the New World Order, to the troops on the streets.
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:13.680]  The liberals are starting to get concerned and then, you know, they're hoping Obama.
[1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:16.880]  I mean, I'm talking a lot of Obamanoids and they're kind of coming out of their
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:22.320]  mind control from he's the Messiah. He'll fix everything. Oh, I love him. I know he's doing
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:27.680]  a lot of bad stuff, man. I just hope he's real. Because we're in trouble. See,
[1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:30.320]  see, they blow out the economy, tell you we're going into depression and say, oh,
[1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:34.480]  but this guy'll fix it right on time. And then he comes in and just gets worse and worse. I mean,
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:41.600]  since he's been in office, the stock market's dropped by 3,000 points and I'm not blaming Obama.
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:45.200]  He's a puppet. You know, in the end, they're going to destroy him one way or the other politically.
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:47.600]  They're going to blame everything on him. Just like them and everything on Bush.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:52.400]  Let's get past Obama to the bankers, to the New World Order. And that's what the film says in
[1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:56.080]  the first five minutes. But then we go, hey, but if you don't believe us, we're going to go through
[1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:01.200]  his lies and then we're going to go through his real agenda currently and what he's really done
[1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:08.640]  and then what his future plans are. This film was just finished a week ago. This film was finished
[1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:12.480]  a week ago. It is one of the most up to date things. I mean, you talk about, you know,
[1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:16.080]  if the film's done, it comes out a week and a half after you finish it. Boom.
[1:30:17.440 --> 1:30:21.520]  And we haven't been sleeping. You know, I said I was going to rush make this film, but I couldn't
[1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:27.200]  lower my quality. In fact, we shot up to a new level of quality and in the graphics and the 3D
[1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:33.040]  animations, it's just unbelievable. The Obama deception.net Obama deception.net info wars.com

[1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:09.440]  Let's go to the heart of the matter. Life change tea has had some commercials that are
[1:31:09.440 --> 1:31:14.640]  not appealing to those who live in denial. Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the
[1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:20.480]  world and that having a clog colon is good for you. That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:26.400]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air. And last but not least, fluoride in your water

[1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:12.640]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:19.280]  just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:24.880]  best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:30.000]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:37.280]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:43.280]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works

[1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:56.800]  You know, there are many here that think that life is but a joke, but you and I, we've been
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:03.120]  through that, and this is not our game. So let us stop talking foolishly now. The hour is getting
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:09.760]  late. Charles, Larry, Fred, Brian, Joe, and others, your calls are coming up.
[1:35:09.760 --> 1:35:31.120]  You think that life is but a joke, but you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:41.360]  fate. So let us stop talking foolishly now. The hour is getting late. You see the riders
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:46.560]  approaching? Oh, you got the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth for months here,
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:52.320]  ladies and gentlemen. That's all you got from all the other great patriots out there fighting
[1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:58.560]  the new world order. Do you a perfect job? No. Hell, I'm silly and ignorant sometimes,
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:06.880]  but I got guts, and guts is enough. What about you? One life to live, make the choice,
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:13.120]  join this historic battle against tyranny, and come in for the big win.
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:27.920]  Look at this news I've got here. Lawyers seek global forum to handle Nadov cases.
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:31.840]  Seek a global government, a global bank, and they will try their own people,
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:37.520]  and see he knows where all the bodies are buried. So that's why the Associated Press
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:42.720]  yesterday said he may not even get one day of prison time for stealing between 50 and
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:50.560]  100 billion dollars. Is that not open crime, open evil, outside in the cold distance?
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:02.800]  They're foot servants, too.
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:09.760]  They're foot servants, too. Well, I'm not in the cold distance.
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:17.440]  The wildcat. A wildcats, too. The enemy is approaching. Too right, he's one approacher.
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:23.120]  Now the wind begins to howl. Hey!
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:31.040]  All right, I'm going to spend five minutes with Jason Bermas for a quick retraction and then a
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:37.760]  beef up. Now, I made it clear on air yesterday that Mr. Moore, who wrote the
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:42.560]  Watchman novel, that I'm not a comic book reader, and so I just got the book Sunday
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:46.800]  scanned through it after I'd seen the film Saturday. The whole film was the Illuminati,
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:50.320]  the Pyramid Corporation, the staging terror attacks for your own good. It's a wonderful thing
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:55.280]  to bring in an age of love and peace and the new God man that will develop and travel the stars.
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:00.800]  And then Bermas said, oh yeah, he was also involved in that Sandman thing. So I mentioned
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:05.520]  that and then people emailed me and drove saying, no, he's not. Bermas, to clarify, there was a
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:10.000]  collaboration between the Sandman and another novel. That's why Alan Moore is always getting mad
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:16.080]  because they twist his stuff. But you did pull up some of the, and since then we've done research,
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:20.320]  the guy openly is a Mason. He openly says he's into the occult. He openly says he does all this.
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:25.280]  Regardless, you see the film, they staged terror attacks to bring in world peace. I mean,
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:29.120]  that's the whole point we're making about the Watchman. Then we're going to briefly talk about
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:33.040]  Bernie Madoff and then we're going to go to your phone calls for those patiently holding.
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:37.600]  Bermas? All right. So he revived the John Constantine character. They just had Keanu Reeves
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:42.080]  do a movie about that about five years ago. That's where I got confused because Hellblazer became a
[1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:47.920]  series. It was in the same vertigo line as Neil Gaiman's Sandman. But he also did From Hell and
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:52.720]  From Hell was all about Jack the Ripper doing ritualistic Mason killings. They made a movie about
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:58.000]  it. But people say that's exposing what they're doing. My whole point is, I watch that film in
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:06.400]  the RV driving to the Denver DNC. We watched that and The Naked Prey and a couple other films I'd
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:10.880]  had never had time to see. Well, that's a really good film. That's based in Africa, based on a
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:15.440]  real Blackfoot story with Native Americans chasing the guy. And then that's what one of my other
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:23.760]  favorite movies, Apocalypto, was made out of. But side issue here, the point is that in the film,
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:27.520]  the Pyramid Corporation runs the planet and stages terror attacks to bring the world together.
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:32.320]  That's the issue. And it's all Illuminati symbolism. That's the point we're making. So clearly From
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:37.840]  Hell could have a positive message. But the Watchman does not. It's a very wicked Illuminati.
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:41.440]  I mean, this is their philosophy. Well, he did V for Vendetta, too, but he's also a practicing
[1:39:41.440 --> 1:39:48.400]  magician. And he actually worships a Roman snake deity, I think it's pronounced Gaiklon,
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:53.600]  which he acknowledges to be a hoax. But he says magic is synonymous with art. And his understanding
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:58.080]  is that it's the use of words, images, and actions to affect people and the way they think.
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.800]  Yeah, that's what their real religion is, is numbers, symbols to manipulate our subconscious.
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:07.840]  Yeah. So he's into that openly. I mean, he's got a wife, a girlfriend, just see how the guy looks
[1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:13.680]  and dresses. You can tell right away that he's into this supernatural realm. So I would say
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:19.040]  people need to be very careful about Alan Moore worship. He also did a Spawn comic back in the
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:24.800]  day, which was all about the different levels of hell. So he's very into this kind of occultic
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:30.320]  culture. So again, people should be very wary of this. Well, regardless, I saw the movie and I've
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:35.360]  now scanned through the novel and it's the same. They staged terror attacks to bring in the one
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:40.240]  world government and killing millions of people is good. And at the end of the movie, the good
[1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:45.440]  guys have staged a terror attack and you learn that. And then they show a perfect, the dugout
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:50.960]  hole six months after 9 11 with the big American flags hanging. It's at ground zero. They literally
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:56.320]  rotoscoped ground zero and put the same flyers and same signs up and we'll never forget. And it
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:01.600]  shows the firemen and everything. And they say, we did this to you for your own good. I mean,
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:06.400]  this is a disgusting thing they've done. Yeah, they're just throwing in our face as they often do,
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:09.760]  Alex. We did it because we love you, Jason. Well, that's why we're going to get a World Bank
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:14.080]  for Bernie Madoff. We need to prosecute. We need to prosecute. This is not a one guy. Let's go
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.680]  ahead and tell folks. Yeah, you know, I reported on this last night. I actually wrote a little
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:21.760]  blog about it already over at the new little blog spot info warrior dot info wars.com. Yeah,
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:25.360]  give that out again. Is that linked on the main page? I don't know if it is, but it's info warrior
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:29.680]  dot info wars.com. It's a sub page of info wars. And basically what they're doing and
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:32.480]  everybody was always asking me, Alex, Well, why are they throwing this guy to the wolves? And I
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:36.160]  would always say, Well, number one, it's $50 billion in the grand scheme of things. These
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:40.000]  guys are now stealing and looting trillions in front of you. Some of the smaller banks are
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.120]  giving back the Tart money because they don't want to be swallowed up by this whole thing.
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:47.280]  All right. Now you have to prosecute Bernie Madoff in a public forum. So what they're
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:52.480]  saying they need to do is create this new world banking court. In other words, it's a new world
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:56.800]  court system. And then they will try their competition and basically that's what they've
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:00.880]  said is it's a new bank of the world that will set currency rates and interest rates worldwide.
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:05.680]  And then they will run around prosecuting the sub minions and and selling world government
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:10.880]  in the new regulatory system to stop the bankers. Exactly. And they will be consolidating power
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:15.120]  even further. And this is going to be a huge show trial to bring in this court system. And it's
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:19.520]  legitimacy, Alex. It's very frightening. That's right. Madoff's already apologizing and saying,
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:23.840]  Yes, we need the new bank of the world. I'm sorry. And he'll agree that he was bad and all,
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:27.680]  but you did this all by yourself. Meanwhile, he's involved with all the other big banks.
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:32.000]  They've declared nationals. These guys are bold, man. The very criminals that run it all
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:36.720]  are now posing saying they'll have a world court that will save us. Yeah. A world banking court.
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:40.720]  I mean, literally, it's going to be like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers at the head of
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:44.560]  this thing or controlling the puppets that are publicly at the head. And they're going to go
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:48.480]  loot all the pension funds and people that have hidden money offshore in their own small bank
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:51.600]  accounts in the Caymans and in Switzerland. That's already happening. They're going to go after
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:55.840]  anybody who doesn't play ball with this world banking system. Oh, yeah. Well, listen, tyranny
[1:42:55.840 --> 1:43:01.600]  is always about the ultra elite rich robbing the rich. And then they're going to have an army of the
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:06.800]  poor people like. Exactly. And we're going to be squeezed so hard. Again, Gordon Brown gets up in
[1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:11.760]  front of Congress, Alex, and he's like, we're going to have the biggest middle class of the world
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:15.920]  ever in the next 10 years, because all those third world people that are making our stuff now
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:20.080]  are going to become consumers. Meanwhile, what's really happening is all the middle classes being
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:24.400]  decimated and killed and the gap between the middle class. And now the middle class can't buy
[1:43:24.400 --> 1:43:28.320]  the African and Latin American and Asian goods and they're in freefall implosion. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:31.920]  Basically, they're widening. Oh, we've got aid for the third world. That's going in and buying
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:35.440]  off more of their politicians with our money. Yeah. And more of their infrastructure because
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:39.440]  they plan. I mean, people always gripe about, I'm sick of firing aid. I'm sick of helping.
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:43.520]  They're not helping those countries. They take our money and buy off the infrastructure and then
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:47.440]  give it to the private banks publicly. Yeah. It's another type of corporate welfare, really. It's
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:52.560]  a it's a type of. Well, this is economic warfare against the entire planet. Jason, you are live

[1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:50.800]  get you doing a day, but I'm still with you. I don't make too many tapes because you left
[1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:55.920]  the storm to kind of financially rank me. You've made tens of thousands of copies of my films.
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:01.520]  Yes. I'm asking people to get these tapes now is the time to do it. When I was passing the
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:09.120]  tapes out, it wasn't hot like it is right now. And one person, one person just with a few hundred
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:15.840]  tapes can change his parish. You know what I mean? It could change his neighborhood just with a little
[1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:22.320]  effort. It's wonderful to call in the radios. It's wonderful to complain. But it's a brilliant idea
[1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:27.840]  to fight with information. We've got to get outside the choir. Right. What for 10 years?
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:32.480]  You've handed out more than 6,000 of my films. I still got my right. It was, I tell you right,
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:39.280]  the thing. It was 7,412 tapes. And tell folks, now again, you planted the seeds. Now people
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:42.800]  will see it's true. But even when this wasn't the hottest issue and folks waking up the world
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:46.560]  government, you told me that police were buying you coffee and asking for more. Oh, yeah. Well,
[1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:50.160]  first they wanted to put me in jail. Remember, I do want to take my dog away from me. And
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:54.880]  oh, they would give me a hard time. But after a while, one time they gave me all the time.
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:59.600]  They brought me coffee. I've been over his house five or six times. His wife even ran some tapes
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:04.400]  off of me. And he was against me. He was really bitterly against me. How did he wake up? What was
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:08.800]  the process? Because you were out handing them out on street corners. You had a permit and they
[1:46:08.800 --> 1:46:14.160]  tried to... You know, just giving a little flair. Larry Nichols back then, you know. Yeah. And so
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:21.600]  he started picking on me then. And then I gave a tape to, I think it was his aunt. His aunt
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:27.200]  showed him a tape and he came and apologized to me. And then he said, he gave me some money for
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:34.240]  some more tapes. But he wanted five copies of a dark secret of Bohemian Grove. And I told him,
[1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:38.960]  so no money, no charge. And we just started being friends. I went over to his house to eat and
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:42.720]  met his wife and his kids. And she started running the tapes off of me for a while.
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:47.920]  And then you moved, right? Yes, then I moved, yes. But I mean, I see him every now and then.
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:56.000]  But I've been down to the courthouse. I'll give Willie Graves, Jack McClain's Vampire 2000.
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:03.280]  I've been... I'll tell you the truth. I couldn't... People just started just buying me coffee. They
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:09.360]  would leave me tapes in my mailbox, you know, extra discs. It just really made me feel good.
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:13.840]  It really did some... I really felt I made a difference. And I'm nobody and I made a difference,
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:18.960]  you know? And I told my story on air quite a few times about what the police did me. And
[1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:23.600]  a lot of them apologized for me. They didn't have nothing to do with it. But the truth makes people
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:30.800]  act different. The truth makes people become alive. And you could do that just by talking to people,
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:35.760]  giving them news articles, and a couple of tapes. And then tapes will go to other places.
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:40.640]  Well, when I talk to folks exactly like Pays It Forward, it just spreads, you know, virally.
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:45.520]  But in a good way, so many people I talk to in special forces or government who've seen a lot
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:49.920]  of this, they go, nothing made sense till I saw this. And then I checked out your claims and now
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:54.640]  everything makes sense. What they're being told doesn't make sense because they're being lied to.
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:48:01.040]  But they see this and then it all makes sense. Yes, I've got one book somebody sent me. And I
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:06.720]  don't know if you're mentioning it. It's about social security. And I give it to... Right now,
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:10.720]  I've got some people come back from the military. And I give everything they're passing around.
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:16.480]  And I'm telling the truth, a little bit of knowledge. People are hungry, Mr. Jones, for the
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:22.320]  truth. People are hungry. And I want to tell you something. People say, oh, you praise health.
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:29.760]  But I do praise you because you help me wake up. You help my whole parish wake up. Just put a few
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:35.360]  tapes. And I can't thank you enough, you know. I can't thank you. Listen, we're all together,
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:40.000]  man. If they win, we're going to be total slaves. Well, this year, something very bad is going to
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:43.920]  happen. I believe there's going to be a food shortage. I believe people need to get British
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.080]  Berkshire. I think they're going to stage terror attacks. I can just feel it, my God. And I just
[1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:53.200]  talked to Mr. every other day. I'm getting some new filters today. And please, people, get these
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:58.960]  tapes. And I promise you, don't argue with your family. Just give them the tapes. And they will
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:03.760]  wake up. You'll plant the seeds. And we could all be one. If we think the same way, we could all be
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:09.360]  one. I have lost so much faith in the American people for being so ignorant. I have quit one
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:14.480]  time because I was so sick of the American people being so cowardly. But what makes them
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:19.520]  cowardly, they don't know the truth and they get confused and they run from it. But these tapes
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:24.880]  put it all together. It's documented. I gave it to the lawyers and lawyers checked it out
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:30.480]  and said, man, I can't find no fault in it. It's all true. I gave it, I gave it to the
[1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:37.200]  fine and policemen. I sent one to a blank or a governor. Right now, Jango don't want to take
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:42.720]  the bailout money from, he's been on national news. Louisiana don't want to take the bailout
[1:49:42.720 --> 1:49:48.320]  money. And I hope to God, I had some part of that with these tapes. I went to the Capitol. I
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:54.640]  couldn't get in, but I gave them to all bodyguards and the governors and all that. I put them on
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:50:00.560]  cause. I've been run out of arrest with it. I've been run out of donut shops, but now I can go back
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:04.640]  in and hold my head up because if I go and sell them, I'm not even paying for coffee. Thank you
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:08.400]  for telling me the truth. Thank you for the tapes. Can you make one for my mother? I had police
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:13.680]  stop me. I thought I was getting tickets. You got any tapes on you, Charlie? I said, yeah,
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:19.120]  give me a name. I'll pass them on my house. I'll have you some tapes tomorrow. It woke up,
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:25.120]  a whole world woke up at me and I was nobody. I was just a guy to come out of prison. I was so
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:30.640]  mentally torn down and didn't know which way to go. I needed a reason to live. And I caught you
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:36.400]  by accident and I got your first tape, police 2000. And ever since then, my whole life changed,
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:42.240]  my life changed by trying to help out my country. No, that's the point. When you help people, you
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:46.800]  get blessed and you don't do it to get blessed. You get through your fear, you do it and it just
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:51.040]  gets better and better. And even when you're persecuted, it's a blessing. I don't know how to
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:55.600]  explain it. The Bible is true. Listen, God bless you, my friend, Charles, and it was good talking
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:51:00.720]  to you and take care of yourself. God bless you, sir. Say hi to your wife for me. Yeah,
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:06.160]  just an amazing story. I said I'd take calls. What to hold the next guest up because I want to
[1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:09.920]  go to all these people I said I would. Larry, Fred, Brian and Joel, I'm going to come back to each
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:13.360]  one of you when we get back. I'll let the guest on with the eight after. I'll keep taking your calls
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:17.680]  then. This is another guest because the border patrol has a tough job and we support them,
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:24.080]  but they harass citizens. It even happens here in Texas and they're using it as internal check
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:29.360]  points 100 miles in to just stop everybody. And that's wrong, folks. You can spot the illegal
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:33.760]  aliens. You know, you're blind. I mean, it's just everywhere that needs to be enforced at the business
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:38.880]  level and throw the bucket. These businesses, but the point is, is that he's standing up to what
[1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:44.800]  they're doing. And more people do this, it'll reform these internal checkpoints. I mean, take
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:49.360]  the banker bailout money and now the stimulus package. Illegal aliens are exempt when they get
[1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:54.000]  the bailout money from having to show documentation, but citizens have to. That's what we're talking
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:58.320]  about here. Meanwhile, they throw Ramos and Campion in prison for no reason.

[1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:06.240]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:11.840]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:17.280]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:22.320]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:27.440]  D1 in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:33.920]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:40.480]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:46.800]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:23.680]  Let's go to your phone calls. Larry in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:33.440]  Yeah, hey Alex? Yes, sir. Yeah, are you with me? Yeah, I sure got you on the line right now,
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:40.800]  bro. I'd love to talk to you. All right, man. I want to say this, man. I do not support the troops in Iraq.
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:47.680]  In fact, I wrote a little poem. I'm making a song out of it. It's called,
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:56.480]  If you are an American with a gun in Iraq, I hope you come back in a body sack. If you're an American
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:02.960]  with a gun in the Middle East, I hope you get devoured by the beast. If you're an American
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:11.120]  with a gun in Pakistan, I hope you die with your stand. Sir, sir, listen, I happen to have family
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:16.160]  over in Iraq and Afghanistan and they joined for reasons they believe were good. They bought the
[1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:21.440]  propaganda and it doesn't hurt the New World Order for the troops to get killed. I really don't want
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:26.640]  to sit here hoping that I hope Iraqis don't die. I hope the troops don't die. I hope the troops
[1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:31.040]  don't die in combat with the American people. I want to avert this and I understand you're angry
[1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:37.200]  and upset. There is over a million, 300,000 Iraqis dead, many of them children, but you know,
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:42.560]  you know, I don't hope people die that have had abortions. I just hope they wake up to what
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:46.320]  they've been part of and repent. I mean, I just, you know what? I appreciate your call and you can
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:49.840]  hate me if you want Larry, but I'm just not going to let that go any further. Okay. It's just not
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:56.160]  on this show. Okay. I hope that the troops don't die. Okay. Fred in Florida, Fred, you're on the
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:00.960]  air. Go ahead. Frank, but that don't matter. How are you doing? I was on hold for two hours yesterday
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:04.960]  after you produced it. So we all was next, but it's so great to talk to you. I'm an eight-year
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:09.520]  subscriber. I've been distributing your materials since 2000 with the beginning with America Destroyed
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:16.560]  by Design on VHS tape back then. Awesome. Over six, well over 6,000. I got a big Xerox. We've only
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:21.520]  had prisonplanet.tv though for five years, but I appreciate you being a subscriber. No, no, I've
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:26.800]  been distributing your stuff though. Awesome. Awesome. Starting with America Destroyed by Design.
[1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:33.040]  Awesome. I cry often concerning the events in 9-11 as I have lost three friends, two of whom
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:38.560]  were blown to smithereens by controlled demolition incorporated. And I know people who've lost over
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:44.400]  a dozen loved ones that faithful day. I just like to air a few grievances briefly in this
[1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:52.480]  async G-rated manner. I'm extremely peed off. I wish you'd put up a Fred Tobin banner linked to
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:58:00.560]  the book. Did 6 million really die? And talk about the persecution of Ernst Zundl. Question the
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:06.640]  hola hoax and see how quickly you'll get arrested when you enter Canada, England or Germany. Now,
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:11.360]  I notice you sometimes hang up quickly on articulate people who legitimately criticize you
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:15.760]  and then spend five or 10 or more minutes in the defensive tower raid after you've disconnected
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:22.560]  them. Seems you've found a lucrative career in the patriot business, making poor people run
[1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:27.120]  around chasing their tails, offering no real solutions. It's getting on the radio every day.
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:32.880]  Let's stop right there. Let's stop right there. We're moving to try to get the state to declare
[1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:38.080]  sovereignty. We are moving to have the bankers arrested and had a congressman on saying it 30
[1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:43.840]  minutes ago, 35 minutes ago to be technical. We are moving to have an audit of the private
[1:58:43.840 --> 1:58:49.120]  Federal Reserve. We are moving to have the American people say no to martial law. You know,
[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:56.000]  I have you on the show. We don't screen your call. You come on here and you sit here and you insult
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:01.520]  and you attack me and you say all these terrible things about me and you say that I'm giving those
[1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:09.760]  solutions. I make a film that has cost me probably $80,000 or more to make and I am going to release
[1:59:09.760 --> 1:59:14.320]  it for free on the internet, high quality at presentplanet.tv and you call in and you say I'm
[1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:19.040]  bad. You call in and you say I'm evil. You know, here's the issue. I don't like the things Israel
[1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:25.200]  does and I criticize Israel, but I also don't want to be associated with the type of scum
[1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:30.880]  that make it their lives to simply hate Jews and everybody else. Do you understand? I don't
[1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:34.800]  like what Israel's doing and I don't like you either. It's very, very simple and I hope you
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:39.040]  realize that. You could have had your say, sir, which had to spew lies, so find another show.

[1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:55.440]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:00.160]  and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:04.000]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line where you have your own bread. You'll never have to go
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:08.720]  to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply
[2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:12.800]  prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you. You know,

[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:12.640]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:21.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:36.720]  We are back live. Taking your phone calls. Let's talk to Brian in Canada, then Joe,
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:40.880]  Rod Dogg, Ronnie Warren, and others. Go ahead, Brian, you're on the air.
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:47.280]  About two months ago, I started watching your show on YouTube, and one of the first videos I
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:54.960]  saw was about this CIA agent confession about FEMA. So I started, I'd done something kind of stupid,
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:02:02.320]  and I started sending FEMA-like funny emails of rabbits attacking snakes and a rabbit attacking
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:08.800]  a goat and some beavers and butt-head things. And now, in Toronto, for some reason, we seem to have
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:18.160]  all these FEMA triple-decker trains. And on Thursday, the 5th of March, a black helicopter flew over
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:23.440]  my house in downtown West Toronto, three times circling my house. The third time it kind of locked
[2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:28.480]  its little gun on me, and it flew away. And I just stood there with my mouth open, and I was like...
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:33.360]  Well, let's understand. Northcom that rules Canada as well is flying red patterns
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:39.520]  with a look-through technology that looks right through your walls and scans for weapons
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:43.280]  and what you've got. And so they fly in grid patterns, everybody gets black helicopter visits,
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:49.200]  and the Feds admit they have these helicopters flying around, and they also have a high altitude
[2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:55.520]  blimps that are at over 95 to 100,000 feet. That's admitted, and so that's what's going on,
[2:02:55.520 --> 2:02:59.360]  but I appreciate your call. They can't get all of us, and the people are waking up.
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:01.840]  Let's talk to Joel in California. Joel, you're on the air.
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:08.960]  Hey, how you doing, Alex? Good, sir. Hey, I'm so happy to be able to talk to you. I've been a
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:15.680]  listen to you. I woke up by 2005, first video I found was you sneaking into the Bohemian Grove,
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:20.720]  and I said, this guy's got a huge set of, you know what, and I want to see more about and hear
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:27.600]  more from him. I can't believe the guys that call you and waste your time and talk about no
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:33.520]  solution. I think that you've got, like, all we cover solutions, we're the most effective, so
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:37.600]  that's why we get attacked, but most people aren't operatives that call in and do that.
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:42.480]  They think I have like some wonderful life, and all it does is bust my butt, and it's actually
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:48.000]  very hard life. And so it's just part of the sick society, and I'm not even really worried about it.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.800]  Let's just keep moving forward with solutions, and that is waking the people up.
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:58.720]  Yeah, you know, and I wish I could hang out with you and pick your brain, and I know you're always
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:04.800]  on the move and quick, but I live out here in Temecula, California, nice little suite, you know,
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:09.840]  everyone thinks they're a movie star, and no one wants to listen to anything that, you know,
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:14.720]  you have to say, or if I even mentioned 9-11 or Obama, you know, I get that same thing that
[2:04:14.720 --> 2:04:18.800]  a lot of people are getting, but you know, I've noticed, I remember just growing up, I'm only
[2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:24.080]  29, and I've always been in rock bands, and just, you know, playing baseball, living in the American,
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:30.400]  so somewhat dream, or whatever it used to be. But I remember, it used to be like amazing to see
[2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:34.640]  a military helicopter. You'd be like, well, wow, we live in between like March Air Force Base
[2:04:34.640 --> 2:04:38.560]  and Camp Pendleton, and you'd be like, oh, look, dad, see there, and you know, my dad was in the
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:45.680]  military, and it was like a rare thing. Now it's every day you have your Blackhawks or whatever
[2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:49.920]  you call them, I don't know what they're called, but they're like serious, the real Bill, like you
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:54.160]  think, you know, you think you're about to be attacked, you know, and you've got like fleets
[2:04:54.160 --> 2:05:01.280]  of them every day, all day, and you know, this is then a place where you just, you think it's a
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:06.880]  home sweet home, nothing's going down, but I mean, would you call that like just part of them trying
[2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:13.520]  to like, you know, wash our brains and make us get used to hearing that sound? I mean, I've had
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:18.640]  helicopters fly so low to our houses where we live in the manufacturing home, it feels like
[2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:24.880]  the guys landing on our three acres. Well, you know, call after call, talking about other
[2:05:24.880 --> 2:05:30.880]  militaries all over, does they admit they're acclimating us for military occupation of the
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:37.840]  United States? It is happening. It is high treason, and we've got to let the military know they're
[2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:44.640]  engaged in treason and remind them of their oath to protect and defend the Bill of Rights and
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:49.520]  Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. The Obama deception comes out this
[2:05:49.520 --> 2:05:54.800]  Sunday at 6 p.m. at prisonplana.tv. Start your engines, get ready to burn the desk,
[2:05:54.800 --> 2:05:58.800]  and get them out to everybody you know, and order the high quality DVD at infowars.com.
[2:06:01.200 --> 2:06:06.080]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents? Even
[2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:10.800]  fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[2:06:10.800 --> 2:06:16.000]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here. Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin pure soaps?
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:20.560]  They're all natural, and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning

[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:06.960]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:12.480]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:18.000]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:27.280]  the best interest of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement,
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:34.640]  a personality cultist who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:07:34.640 --> 2:07:41.840]  that's fascist. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:49.120]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:56.320]  Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:06.320]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines,
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:15.520]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:33.200]  We are live at prisonplanet.tv for the next hour and 52 minutes. It's left in the show today,
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:39.280]  simulcasting the radio show. We have Webster Tarpley joining us about 50 minutes from now
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:45.120]  to give us the latest on Obama's criminal activities. Then we're going to have Keith
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:52.000]  Bryan on from Ireland. Mainstream news is reporting that they were doing drills when the military men
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:56.080]  in Northern Ireland got shot, the British troops, as we predicted they would, and it's coming out
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:01.600]  that the guards stood down and didn't shoot at the people that were shooting. Over 75% of the
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:07.760]  past attacks in Northern Ireland and in England being connected and carried out by British Special
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:13.760]  Forces, SAS, as has been covered by mainstream British news, we are, and that's why they had to
[2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:17.680]  stop a lot of it four or five years ago because it did become public. It looks like they're back
[2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:22.240]  to their old tricks. It's almost completely confirmed, a classic MO on that front. For the
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:32.720]  next 20 minutes, we are joined by Terry Bressy, and Terry Bressy is an individual who lives
[2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:36.960]  somewhat near the border and they've now moved border checkpoints in some cases 100 miles away
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:41.680]  from the border. They call them constitution free zones and they're harassing citizens,
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:44.960]  and I would add here that we support the border patrol and they're constitutional duty. It's
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:48.160]  one of the few things the feds do that's constitutional. We support it and they've
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:53.840]  got a really tough job, but at the same time, they are harassing citizens. I get reports of this in
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:58.800]  Texas. They're asking everybody for their ID, but then when sheriffs and others arrest illegal
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:02.640]  aliens for crimes, the feds won't come pick them up. They won't go after the businesses. They do
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:11.760]  a few token things and, of course, it came out in the stimulus bill that the illegal aliens
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:15.680]  are allowed to get the stimulus money and they don't have to show that they're American citizens
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:21.680]  like citizens do. It's literally just a double standard. So, Terry Bressy, I want to thank you
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:26.400]  for joining us. Thank you for having me. Good to be here. Tell us a little bit about yourself,
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:31.680]  where you're located, and some of the plethora of YouTube videos that you've got. We're going
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:37.040]  to put a few of them up on screen without the audio showing what you go through and what happens
[2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:44.480]  at these checkpoints inside the United States. Sure. I live in Tucson, Arizona, which is about
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:50.720]  40 miles north of the international border with Mexico, and I frequent State Route 86,
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:55.120]  which is an east-west highway that takes me out to one of my remote worksites.
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:12:01.200]  My workout has to be a picnic national observatory, and we have a couple telescopes up there that
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:07.040]  I keep running and I observe on to look for asteroids and comets in the solar system.
[2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:12.800]  My work takes me along remote sections of the desert on a fairly regular basis,
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:16.560]  and this is where I have encountered quite a few checkpoints over the years.
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:23.840]  Break down what you're dealing with and the type of things you go through.
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:30.000]  Well, what first got me interested or first got me involved with this issue of checkpoints
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:38.240]  is, was an incident from 2002. I was traveling back to Tucson after working the day on the mountain,
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:44.240]  and I was stopped at a checkpoint that was being operated primarily by the tribal police,
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:50.080]  but there was also President of the Department of Homeland Security in the form of U.S. customs
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:55.680]  agents and border patrol agents who were working the front line with the tribal police, and when
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:13:00.640]  I pulled up to the checkpoint and was stopped, I asked the stopping officer what was the purpose
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:04.720]  of the checkpoint, and he told me that it was a sobriety checkpoint, and I'm thinking to myself,
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:09.360]  well, if it's a sobriety checkpoint and you don't need federal agents working on the
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:15.440]  front line with local law enforcement officers to check sobriety, because sobriety is a local
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:20.480]  issue. If it's a state issue, it's not a federal issue. So just like they're now using Marines
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:27.680]  in California at DWI checkpoints to condition the public. Yes, yes, exactly. What I found is
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:32.160]  a lot of times local jurisdictions and the federal government, they use
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:39.120]  checkpoints that have been allowed by the courts under very limited scope. They use
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:44.560]  those as a pretext to do far more expansive operations than they would be allowed to otherwise.
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:48.960]  By claiming that it's only a sobriety checkpoint or it's an immigration checkpoint,
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:52.560]  but in reality, they're doing these dragnet type of operations where they're looking for
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:14:01.520]  everything from felons to weapons, terrorists, narcotics, and other things. So it's really
[2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:08.320]  problematic in the way that law enforcement agencies have taken the inch that was given
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:14.560]  to them by the various courts and the American people in many regards, and they turned into
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:21.440]  a 100-mile constitution-free zone, if you will. Amazing. And again, we're putting some of those
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:26.560]  videos on screen. I mean, you explained to the Border Patrol, look, this is a federal function
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:32.000]  and sobriety checkpoint. We see the mainstream reports of their targeting citizens, how illegal
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:37.280]  aliens just drive right through, but they target people that are whether Hispanic, Black, white,
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:42.000]  doesn't matter, or clearly citizens. And this is happening in some cases over 100 miles in
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:46.240]  to the United States. And we also have living on the Canadian, Mexican, the Pacific, and the
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:49.600]  Atlantic Ocean, which they call the border, where the Border Patrol is setting these up
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:54.720]  everywhere, not just on the Mexican or Canadian border. It's happening all over Seattle now.
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:58.160]  They're doing it to people in Seattle and surrounding counties. They're doing it deep
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:03.600]  into other states, Wyoming and Utah and other places. I mean, clearly, this is the federal
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:07.440]  police force expanding, and you explain this to them in the videos, don't you?
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:16.240]  I certainly do. Well, actually, I take that back. Going back to my 2002 incident, like I said, it
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:25.280]  was a dragnet operation that was being primarily conducted by the tribal police. And so that
[2:15:25.280 --> 2:15:28.560]  operation was slightly different from what I've been experiencing over the past year.
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:33.600]  In that particular operation, when I challenged the scope of what they were doing, I was dragged
[2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:38.000]  out of my vehicle, arrested, and then dragged off the side of the road. I fought the Chargers
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:41.840]  in court. I beat the charges and had them dismissed with prejudice. And then I turned
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:47.920]  around and I filed a lawsuit. That lawsuit has been ongoing for the past five years,
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:51.200]  and it's currently in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where we're challenging
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:56.240]  the legitimacy of the checkpoint itself. The newer checkpoints that I've come across
[2:15:56.240 --> 2:16:03.680]  since January of 2008 have been conducted solely by the Department of Homeland Security
[2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:07.600]  via Customs and Border Protection agents with the United States Border Patrol.
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:14.400]  But the problem that we see here is, once again, it's very similar, and you can see it in articles
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:20.640]  where spokesperson for the U.S. Border Patrol has stated that they're using these immigration
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:27.840]  checkpoints to look for felons, weapons, not talking about guns here, narcotics,
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:34.640]  terrorists, and aliens. Even though the U.S. Supreme Court back in 1976
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:39.920]  be allowed immigration checkpoints inside the country, but only for permanent checkpoint
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:44.160]  installations and only near nexus points for border traffic. And what that means is
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:48.880]  where the primary traffic going to the checkpoint originated from the border.
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:55.040]  What they're doing now is, instead of conducting these checkpoints at permanent installations
[2:16:55.040 --> 2:16:59.600]  near nexus points, they're conducting them all over the place, along secondary roads,
[2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:04.640]  along roads that have no direct nexus to the border. And they're far exceeding the scope
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:09.920]  that the U.S. Supreme Court said. And what they stated was that very brief stops were allowed
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:15.200]  at these internal immigration checkpoints for the sole purpose of making immigration queries,
[2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:21.040]  and that any further detention or any further or any searching of a vehicle had to be premised
[2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:28.080]  upon probable cause or consent by the driver. But what the Border Patrol is actually doing
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:33.200]  is they're conducting temporary or tactical checkpoints all over the place. And they're
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:41.520]  admitting that they're looking for a whole host of other subjects besides just illegal aliens.
[2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:46.800]  And they are detaining individuals for a long period of time and searching vehicles
[2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:51.200]  absent consent or absent probable cause. And also, they don't like being photographed by you,
[2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:57.600]  but they're there photographing, videotaping you. Right, exactly. So from my first experience
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:04.640]  in 2002, I learned a lot. I learned that law enforcement agents will lie when you bring
[2:18:04.640 --> 2:18:10.640]  them into court, that they will destroy documentation and evidence and that they
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:15.440]  will misrepresent the nature of what they're doing. So in order to protect myself from future
[2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:22.560]  actions after 2002, I started carrying video cameras with me, recording devices, cell phones,
[2:18:22.560 --> 2:18:27.440]  so that I could, A, contact other people when I know that I was going to enter a checkpoint,
[2:18:27.440 --> 2:18:32.960]  so that other people know where I was and what to expect, and B, so that I could make a record
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:39.120]  of what actually happened so that there would be no doubt in a court of law as to what actually
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:46.480]  happened. And so since 2008, when the Board of Patrol set up this particular checkpoint along
[2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:54.320]  SR-86 that's been there 24-7 for the last year, I've documented over 70 checkpoint stops going
[2:18:54.320 --> 2:19:00.320]  through that particular checkpoint. And as you indicated, I have about 14 or 15 of those video
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:06.960]  encounters online. Well, you're doing a great job and there's video after video posted on your
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:14.320]  website, you have them up on YouTube. It's checkpointusa.com and they get very, very belligerent
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:18.240]  when you say, look, I'm a U.S. citizen, leave me alone. Why are you out there doing a DWI
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:23.120]  or a weapons check or a drug checkpoint? You're supposed to be checking for illegal aliens.
[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:26.160]  And then in every case, we find out they're not going after the illegal aliens, they're going
[2:19:26.160 --> 2:19:32.560]  after citizens. Well, what's interesting is I've done a lot of research into what's been going
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:40.000]  on and it hasn't just been limited to checkpoints. If you look on my website, the checkpointusa.org,
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:46.400]  you'll also find various documents from the... No, it's.org. They put comm on my sheet. I'm sorry.
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:53.360]  It's checkpointusa.org. Right, right. What you'll find is from 2007, there is a study that was done
[2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:58.720]  by the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security. And what he found was that
[2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:04.720]  on an annual basis, the Board of Patrol, through the... I think it's the Office of Detention and
[2:20:04.720 --> 2:20:14.240]  Removal, that they were about 33% of every illegal alien that's taken into custody on an annual basis.
[2:20:14.240 --> 2:20:20.080]  Those individuals are re-released back into the country while awaiting deportation orders
[2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:26.720]  from a federal court. And about 75% of those individuals that have been released be upscod.
[2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:32.400]  They run. And this has been an ongoing thing for years and years. It's well documented, well known
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:38.560]  by these federal agencies. Yet they take these guys into custody. They let them back into the
[2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:43.920]  country and then they run. And then they claim that they have to conduct more internal checkpoints
[2:20:43.920 --> 2:20:49.040]  in order to catch... Terry Bressy from checkpointusa.org. Stay there. We're going to come right back to
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:54.560]  you after this quick break and continue discussing the important work you're doing out there,
[2:20:54.560 --> 2:20:57.040]  defending the Fourth and Fifth Amendment. Stay with us as well as the 10th.
[2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:06.160]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's
[2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:11.600]  essential as we prepare for an uncertain future. In these troubled times, one of the most important
[2:21:11.600 --> 2:21:15.680]  things your family can have is good health. Some of the contributors to poor health are
[2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:21.760]  parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals. It's a documented fact. 80% of all Americans
[2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:27.520]  and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:33.200]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by

[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:10.240]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:16.880]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:21.360]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:25.840]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:31.120]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:37.440]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:22:37.440 --> 2:22:42.560]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who
[2:22:42.560 --> 2:22:49.840]  Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:48.560]  Terry Bressee from CheckpointUSA.org. Please continue, sir, with specifically people who
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:52.960]  haven't seen the videos yet at your site. I mean, the type of hell you go through just declaring
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:58.640]  your rights to the Border Patrol when you're nowhere near the border. Sure. Well, it could
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:04.240]  be a pretty intimidating experience as some of the checkpoint videos there show. These agents,
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:10.240]  from my perspective, are minimally trained to understand the proper scope of their authority
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:14.640]  and the rights of the individuals that they're actually stopping there. And they often
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:21.200]  at times try to exceed their scope of their authority by brow-beating or threatening
[2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:29.840]  individuals that they stop to either completely comply with them or face any number of actions
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:36.960]  taken against them. And the basis of how I respond when I come up to these checkpoints
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:42.160]  is that as an individual, as an American, I have a right to travel within my own country
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:47.600]  without being impeded or molested by federal agents unless they have a reason to believe
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:54.640]  that I either harm somebody else or that I damage property. Those are the basis. It's a
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:27:00.560]  hallmark of a free country to be able to travel freely without having to explain who you are,
[2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:07.520]  where you're going, why you're going there, or any of those other things. And these internal
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:14.480]  checkpoints are a direct challenge to the rights of individuals to travel freely within their own
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:24.560]  country. And so as I approach these checkpoints, the agents often time they'll, they start
[2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:31.040]  you, they want to know your citizenship, they want to see your documentation. And what I ask
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:36.880]  them is whether or not I'm being detained and whether or not I'm free to go. And oftentimes,
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:42.480]  as you watch the checkpoint videos, what you'll see is that I'll ask if I'm being detained,
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:46.080]  and the agent will say, no, you're not being detained. Well, if you understand what detained
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:52.320]  means, that means that you're engaged in a consensual interaction with a law enforcement officer,
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:59.120]  and either party can break off that interaction at their leisure. So if I'm not being detained,
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:04.240]  then that follows that I must be free to go. But when I seek that clarification and I ask them,
[2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:08.080]  am I free to go? They'll say no, you cannot leave until you answer our questions.
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:12.080]  So it's color of law. They want you to violate your fourth and fifth amendment, your tenth amendment,
[2:28:12.080 --> 2:28:16.720]  state's rights, ninth amendment being violated. And so they hold you in this color of law,
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:23.120]  no man's land or this purgatory. Right. Right. Exactly. And it becomes a waiting game,
[2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:26.960]  if you will. You know, I'm pretty sure I've done a lot of research on the law.
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:33.040]  I've written about it a lot. I've spoken about it a lot. And I'm pretty sure,
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:39.920]  with regards to what my rights are here. And so I'll just wait them out until they either get
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:45.600]  tired of messing with me or their supervisors. And this was quite interesting. Now, like I said,
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:52.480]  I've been to this checkpoint about 70 times now. And, you know, 75% of the time the agents that
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:59.280]  are on duty are smart enough to understand their limited scope and my rights. And they just waved
[2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:06.400]  me through. But 25% of the time you get an agent who doesn't like the fact that someone isn't,
[2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:19.120]  you know, basically kissing their feet. So they try to jack up the incidents by making it much
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:25.200]  more difficult for the person that they're stopping. So they'll claim oftentimes that they
[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:31.680]  have the power and the authority to indefinitely detain anybody until that person proves to the
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:37.920]  agent's satisfaction that they are a United States citizen. Well, if you understand your
[2:29:37.920 --> 2:29:43.760]  basic rights and the Constitution at all, you realize that that is completely bogus. Now,
[2:29:43.760 --> 2:29:47.440]  the courts have recognized that Border Patrol agents have the authority at the border when
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:51.760]  someone is trying to come into the country. But they have the authority to indefinitely detain
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:55.440]  them. But the bigger issue, the feds aren't doing anything to stop the illegals. They'd rest a few
[2:29:55.440 --> 2:30:00.640]  thousand in businesses a year of the tens of millions for token PR. They'd do loopholes for
[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:04.400]  the illegal aliens. It's clear they're targeting the citizens. I mean, if there was really a huge
[2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:08.960]  federal program, which is actually one of the three things the feds can actually do to really
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:14.560]  expel the illegal aliens or go after them, then they were doing this and we saw results. Then in
[2:30:14.560 --> 2:30:21.040]  court, still you could shoot it down. But clearly this is a fishing expedition to expand unconstitutional
[2:30:21.040 --> 2:30:25.520]  authority across the United States in areas of more than two thirds of the nation. I want to
[2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:29.280]  come back and briefly finish up with you, then go ahead and get our next guest online as well,
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:32.720]  sir. But I want to talk more about how folks can check out what you're doing and duplicate what
[2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:39.280]  you're doing at CheckpointUSA.org with our guest, Terry Bressie. I'm Alex Jones,

[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:12.560]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us
[2:32:12.560 --> 2:32:18.320]  would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:23.840]  best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in
[2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:28.880]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:32:28.880 --> 2:32:35.600]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:43.760]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works
[2:32:43.760 --> 2:32:50.960]  for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[2:32:58.080 --> 2:33:05.200]  The people strike back. Companies continue to lay off thousands of people. Unemployment is the
[2:33:05.200 --> 2:33:11.360]  highest it's been in over 30 years. Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[2:33:11.360 --> 2:33:16.640]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and

[2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:22.560]  You know I can't talk about what's going on behind the scenes right now here but I'll tell you this
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:26.800]  ladies and gentlemen they do not want the Obama deception to come out. I'm gonna tell you right
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:32.720]  now look for launch in the next 12 hours because let me tell you this stuff's real.
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:41.200]  The threats, the intimidation, the things we go through here they confirm everything we know
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:49.680]  about the enemy. It doesn't matter you're only alive once ladies and gentlemen the enemy knows
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:54.560]  the sleeping giant that is liberating and freedom is rising. They know you have power
[2:34:54.560 --> 2:34:57.680]  and that's why they're trying to block us every way they have.
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:04.000]  So I will tell everybody right now the Obama deception is going to drop. It's probably dropping
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:10.480]  today. Get ready at prisonplanet.tv. I'm being forced to do this because we may not have a chance
[2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:16.480]  if we wait and I'm showing my hand to the enemies listening right now. Launch the operation. Launch
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:19.920]  it. Launch it at all sites. Just go ahead and launch it. Launch it right now. I just made that
[2:35:19.920 --> 2:35:24.240]  decision. Launch the operation right now. I only have two or three versions of it up there for
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:29.520]  everybody. I wish the public knew how real this was.
[2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:38.400]  Terry Bressy, you're on the air.
[2:35:43.760 --> 2:35:50.800]  Yes. What I can recommend to other folks is that A, folks have to know what their rights are.
[2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:56.400]  B, they have to be willing to assert them. And C, you have to be willing to defend them.
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:02.640]  And in today's climate, I think people realize now that one of the most effective ways that you
[2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:06.800]  can defend your rights when you're asserting them in front of a law enforcement officer
[2:36:06.800 --> 2:36:12.240]  is to record your interactions. So if you're not doing anything wrong and you're being intimidated
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:19.840]  or coerced by a law enforcement officer at a random stop, either walking down the street or
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:24.560]  driving a vehicle down the road, the best thing that you can do to protect your rights is to
[2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:30.800]  record your interaction and be willing and able to make that recording available to the public
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:40.400]  at large. It's amazing how powerful basic tools that are available to any consumer in the marketplace
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:46.000]  today can be used to help you defend your rights and what you think is important in today's day
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:52.720]  and age. And this is the technique that I use when I encounter suspicious checkpoints. I know
[2:36:52.720 --> 2:36:57.840]  my rights, I assert them and I defend them by making a recording of those checkpoint stops
[2:36:57.840 --> 2:37:01.920]  and then posting them online. So people can see for themselves exactly what's happening,
[2:37:02.560 --> 2:37:08.160]  who's doing it and why they claim they're doing it. That's right. And dead men, dead men till no
[2:37:08.160 --> 2:37:12.320]  tales. So it's always important to get your information out, then you're somewhat protected.
[2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:17.680]  You've done this quite a few times. How many times have you been stopped by these people
[2:37:17.680 --> 2:37:21.760]  at their warrantless checkpoints and presented the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:27.600]  of Independence? How many times roughly? Well, I've been stopped at this checkpoint about 70
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:34.000]  times from last year. And this has been going on for six years? Well, this particular checkpoint
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:39.120]  has been in place for just over a year. You said since 2002 though you've been going through this.
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:45.200]  Well, 2002 was my first experience. In 2005, I had a couple more. They were just doing them
[2:37:45.200 --> 2:37:50.320]  temporarily, like every once in a while they would pop up. But in 2008, January 2008,
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:55.760]  they changed how they were conducting them. Instead of doing them at random times in random places,
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:38:01.600]  they set up along one specific location on the highway and they left it open 24-7. So it's been
[2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:08.640]  open since January, early January 2008. And it's been ongoing all that time. So in the past,
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:13.200]  I had missed a fair amount because they weren't being done on any kind of a steady basis.
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:18.720]  But now they're being done constantly. And so every time I travel that road,
[2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:21.200]  it's guaranteed that I'll have to go through this particular checkpoint.
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:28.400]  Just incredible, my friend. Absolutely amazing. Well, as this continues to develop,
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:32.640]  we'll continue to check in with you at checkpointUSA.org. And I want to thank Terry
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:38.640]  Bresley for coming on with us today. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. Okay.
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:50.160]  It's hard to continue on here on the air right now. And
[2:38:53.760 --> 2:38:58.080]  just so sick of the New World Order. I'm sick of all their crap. But we know who they are. We
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:04.080]  know what they are. We know what has to be done. I just wish people valued how serious and how
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:08.160]  real this information is. I know a lot of you do, but sometimes I think I don't value it because,
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:11.040]  you know, I live it. I breathe it. I'm in this fight constantly.
[2:39:15.920 --> 2:39:21.200]  And for other people, it's like some social thing or it's like fun. It's fun to fight and defeat
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:26.800]  evil, but it's not fun working this hard. It's not fun looking at these horrors all day.
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:31.920]  Okay. It's not fun knowing your right and just seeing the evil continue and grow and just get
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:37.760]  worse and all the people it hurts and just all of it. Just, I mean, to have Bernie made off,
[2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:42.320]  out stealing and all the rest of them stealing and that the banks openly looting everything and
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:46.000]  setting up world government and trumpeting it and every major newspaper saying how great it is
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:50.480]  and still have people telling me the New World Order doesn't exist because they were following
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:40:00.480]  the pre-program brainwashing.
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:13.520]  And I got a bunch of trailers coming out for the Obama deception, some promos,
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:16.720]  some sneak peeks and things that were supposed to start coming out in the next two days.
[2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:20.640]  You know, for the film to have its full effect, it needs to do that. But
[2:40:24.560 --> 2:40:25.760]  you know, the establishment,
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:32.160]  the FBI has a lot of dirty tricks and they under their Patriot Act,
[2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:37.200]  where they're sneaking peek things, they can tell you under federal law that
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:41.280]  you're not even supposed to tell people what's going on.
[2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:48.000]  That's what this country has turned into is a Soviet dirt pit.
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:52.320]  They talk about the blacklist for the communists. That's nothing compared to what
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:55.920]  Patriots go through. There are congressional hearings
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:03.120]  where they show architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth next to al-Qaeda training videos and say
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:07.840]  the web has to be shut down and they're having big Pentagon cyber security takeovers of the
[2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:13.440]  entire web and the former head of Homeland Security cyber security has resigned saying it's a total
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:18.880]  takeover. They admit Northcom and the Pentagon and everything else is for the American people.
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:27.520]  Tommy Chung tried to put out a film, aka Tommy Chung, about how they set him up and what they
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:33.520]  did to him and they raided the film distribution center when the DVDs came in and they confiscated
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:39.760]  him. That blew up in their face. That blew up in their face and the film went on showtime and
[2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:46.400]  international television. And Fortune favors the bold, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:56.160]  But I am sick and tired of the New World Order. I told you that when I took on Obama,
[2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:01.040]  this was serious, that I was going up against their biggest, baddest gladiator and all of the
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:06.080]  throngs of soulless minions he's got and those that do have souls but are deceived.
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:14.800]  And the threats my wife gets, the threats I get is nothing compared to the snake itself
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:21.280]  snooping around and trying to shut down what we are doing here.
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:33.520]  They know the Obama deception is the truth. They know that we understand their agenda. We know how
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:39.440]  to shatter the left-right paradigm. We know how to beat these people. Our information is going
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:45.760]  super total nova right now and I'm going to tell the enemy you picked the wrong side with the New
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:49.280]  World Order and we're going to take this country back and the tyrants and the treasonous, lecherous
[2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:54.480]  people will be brought to justice through courts of law. Know that just like Hitler's Germany,
[2:42:54.480 --> 2:42:57.920]  this tyranny will fall probably before it ever gets launched to the level that Hitler was able
[2:42:57.920 --> 2:43:02.320]  to carry out. The globalists just do their killing in third-world nations with our troops.
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:22.160]  The Obama deception, ladies and gentlemen, you need to see it. You need to have it.
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:26.080]  You need to get it out to everyone and you need to remember that the enemy is scared of it.
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:33.040]  That Obama has an enemy's list and you can better believe I'm on it.
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:40.000]  And most of all, everybody needs to pray for what we do here. Pray for this ministry. It is
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:45.120]  a ministry of truth to the people of the world, a lighthouse in these stormy times.
[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:50.560]  Another way to get the word out is why I have this gentleman on for about 10 minutes,
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:44:01.120]  Ches Cain. We were made aware of separately from Ches Cain about my ham radio operators and others
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:07.920]  are the best AM made right here in the U.S. that where the proper antenna goes out three miles strong
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:14.640]  and is FCC legal. It's all civil anyway. It's FCC civil. It follows the regulations.
[2:44:14.640 --> 2:44:17.920]  And if you put up signs in a dense area, you can reach tens of thousands in rural areas,
[2:44:17.920 --> 2:44:22.080]  hundreds. And you just put up signs for the AM. You plug it into the Internet. You stream my show,
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:35.120]  other shows, and my show isn't here. And you get the information out.
[2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.360]  You get the information out. And someday when there's not even an Internet of their successful,
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:46.480]  you can tape the shows, play them back. You can get on the area yourself. That's what you do.
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:49.680]  You run 24 hours a day, get an audience to do your own hour show every day or whatever you want.
[2:44:51.520 --> 2:44:56.960]  And it's a powerful tool. Now, when you call up Ches Cain, because I know if I'm able to talk
[2:44:56.960 --> 2:44:59.760]  to him, we'll try to give you all the technicals. Look, it isn't that hard. You just get the basic
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:08.720]  equipment, hook it up, plug it into the Internet, get going. So I would call Ches Cain and I would
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:14.160]  get this system very inexpensive. I happen to know they're selling it basically at near cost,
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:16.720]  which I think is a mistake for me. You'd be able to fund your own operation.
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:22.800]  TruthAM.com, truthAM.com, because we then approached the makers of it and they said,
[2:45:22.800 --> 2:45:25.600]  look, we're too busy. We're engineers. We've made scores of products.
[2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:32.960]  And then we went out and found folks that were subsellers who did want to get them and sell them.
[2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:37.840]  So that's why there's a little banner on Info Wars, but this is not a paid interview right
[2:45:37.840 --> 2:45:42.560]  now. I have them on because I believe in it. Ches Cain, good to have you on with us, sir.
[2:45:42.560 --> 2:45:46.000]  In the dark days of the Republic, this transmitter is what people need, isn't it?
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:51.280]  It sure is. Thanks for having me on, Alex. I actually grew up across the other side of
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:55.120]  the lake from you over there in Dallas. Like Ray Hubbard, huh?
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:45:59.760]  Yeah, just right there by Brian Adams High School. So I know about this. In those cars
[2:45:59.760 --> 2:46:05.760]  you had about an hour ago, it's discouraging. They are, that's below the low and that's what
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:09.360]  keeps me pulling through this stuff because there's a lot of good people that are in this
[2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:15.040]  trying to make this work. That Red Beckman interview you had a while back, it got me to get his book,
[2:46:15.040 --> 2:46:18.800]  The Walls in Our Minds, and it tells the difference between politicians and statesmen.
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:23.200]  And I decided, you know, I want to be a statesman and that's why I did this. So
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:30.480]  the inspiration from that in your Waco video, most people probably haven't seen that one,
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:37.280]  but it does show what one man can do. And it taught me that I was involved in the neoconside.
[2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:42.720]  I was going to school at DeVry when that happened. And I finally woke up to it and I said, if they
[2:46:42.720 --> 2:46:48.320]  can do Waco, anything's possible. Oklahoma City is the easiest one. So let me just tell you what
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:52.320]  this radio station has done for me in this area. I'm in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 150,000 people.
[2:46:53.280 --> 2:46:58.240]  Just last weekend I played Pat Shannon's Oklahoma City documentary and I also played
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:04.160]  one from Chris Emery with a 20-minute clip of yours. And I had maximum listenership. I had
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:10.480]  calls. I had emails. I want this video. Give me this information. That is waking people up.
[2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:14.720]  And I get it on the air. I figured that out. This is what one transmitter's doing,
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:18.480]  but you've also learned how to then have somebody at the edge pick it up with an antenna
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:22.800]  and put it back out. Yeah, we like one spot. We link two of them together and it shoots right
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:26.960]  up a main street. And I'm putting a video up today that people can actually see me in the car
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:30.800]  demonstrating that just so they can see that. Okay. Now, now if you just hook it up and don't
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:35.760]  do it right, it might go half a mile. But if you hook it up right or a little energy into it,
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:41.040]  three miles is what I'm told. Well, you're going to get a solid daytime one-mile coverage if you
[2:47:41.040 --> 2:47:47.600]  do it on average. But if you really sit down and do it right and maybe get some help, yes,
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:51.520]  three miles. I have a guy in Omaha that can pick up our Omaha transmitter three and a half miles
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:58.720]  away. He recorded it and emailed me the recording back. So that was verified. And it's a FCC
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:04.800]  certified unit. That means the FCC looked at the unit. The FCC said, yes, this unit,
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:09.440]  when set at the popular level, will not cause interference. And their statement basically
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:14.320]  is if you use one of these units, no one's going to bother you as long as we just don't want to
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:19.280]  know that you're there. As long as you don't create a havoc, getting people space for the darn
[2:48:19.280 --> 2:48:24.800]  thing, nobody's going to bother you. So that's what you do with it. Well, these are such micro
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:29.920]  units, too, that it's maybe one out of a billion. And then it's FCC approved. There's no problem.
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:35.520]  FMs, you go up with 100 watts or something and go out 20, 30 miles. Folks keep their mouth shut
[2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:41.520]  about that. Nothing really happens. But the point is, this is FCC approved for general use,
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:45.760]  and you just find a clean, open spot on the dial. So there's not interference, the widest spot you
[2:48:45.760 --> 2:48:52.000]  can. And then you just put up a little paper signs all around the listening area, and it explodes.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:57.440]  Well, here's the neatest thing about it. Since I've put this up, remember how a while back,
[2:48:57.440 --> 2:49:00.720]  you know, the people that were involved in the Ron Paul group, they lost steam and they kind
[2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:06.720]  of dispersed. Well, this has kind of kept everybody together. And now we've seen eugenics right in
[2:49:06.720 --> 2:49:12.960]  our face here in South Dakota. So we've used this system to show people what's going on up here.
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:17.520]  And now we're writing in the newspapers, people are getting involved, even one of the state
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:22.320]  representatives who voted the wrong way. She's now coming out and say department of it's like a
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:27.760]  it's like a match. One little match can burn down the entire forest. Well, what did Thomas
[2:49:27.760 --> 2:49:34.160]  Jefferson say? These are good fires. One person can set bushfires in the minds of men that will
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:40.800]  sweep the globe. And so these are powerful incendiaries in the info war. People need to call
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:48.000]  you and get them need to go to the website trutham.com just truth AM like AM radio trutham.com
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:54.800]  or call 800-579-0580 after the interview. And just and we need hams and people that are it
[2:49:54.800 --> 2:49:58.880]  isn't hard to hook up folks. But you know, somebody like me who has problem programming a VCR,
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:02.800]  I might have a problem. The point is get it set it up, get it done, especially people that have
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:08.080]  a little bit of skill, get the unit. Now don't wait. There's only one guy there selling on me
[2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:11.040]  selling them basically at cost because I know what these things cost. We looked at selling them
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:22.560]  ourselves 800-579-0580 800-579-0580 and get the things up this week. Don't wait folks. Go ahead.
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:27.920]  One quick point. We've got 25 of them ready to go. What happens? The typical thing people
[2:50:27.920 --> 2:50:34.720]  start evaluating these other transmitters. I did that for two years. All the kids are going to spend
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:39.760]  time after time trying to make it work. These work. They're ready to go.
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:45.600]  Yeah, that's how you found the company that we separately found because we were, you know,
[2:50:45.600 --> 2:50:50.560]  snooping around trying to find a good AM that was legal to give people. And all you do is plug it
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:54.240]  into the internet folks or plug it into whatever you want and blast it out. And then you've got
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:59.600]  an audience because you're playing Genesis or whatever. And then you start getting or audio
[2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:04.800]  files or preachers you like or whatever it is you want to put out. And then you've got an audience
[2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:08.880]  there in just a few weeks when you put signs up of hundreds of not thousands and then boom,
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:14.880]  you're hitting them. People want the truth. When they find out what's on that AM dial,
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:20.640]  it's incredible. Go ahead. Well, the quality of these is such a high level. It's such a small
[2:51:20.640 --> 2:51:26.400]  box. But when you actually put it on the air, you're quite astonished yourself just how well
[2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:32.160]  it sounds. And you kind of, it just sends a shiver of your spine. Doing that is, you know,
[2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:36.000]  the question. Don't ask yourself. Folks are already calling you right now when you have 25
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:43.120]  transmitters. Look, I want thousands of these to go out. We'll keep in touch. All right. Yeah,
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:46.160]  we'll talk to you again in the near future. I'm going to let you get to those phone calls.
[2:51:46.160 --> 2:51:51.120]  Thank you so much for joining us, Jess. Good luck to you. Bye-bye. All right, ladies and gentlemen.

[2:52:51.520 --> 2:53:07.520]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:53:07.520 --> 2:53:13.040]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:53:13.600 --> 2:53:19.680]  just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[2:53:19.680 --> 2:53:25.280]  best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in
[2:53:25.280 --> 2:53:30.400]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:37.680]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:43.360]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:51.440]  works for the lies he is told and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at info

[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:17.200]  I hurt myself today
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:37.680]  to see if I still feel. I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real. The needle pairs
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:54.240]  the hole, the old familiar stain. Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:56:15.520]  What have I become? My sweetest friend, everyone I know goes away in the air.
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:36.800]  And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you proud.
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:43.040]  Go ahead and get a webster terribly on John up in Minnesota. Then popping in for about
[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:45.680]  10 minutes with him. At the end of the interview, we're going to go to Ireland.
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:49.760]  It's just all right here. Even mainstream news basically admitting it's an inside job
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:54.320]  when I'm killing the military and police over in Ireland right now.
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:03.360]  It is insane. We had Ron Paul on today, an amazing interview. So many key stories. We can
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:06.960]  write about that and get the word out. What we do is we have Ron Paul on. He covers all these
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:10.640]  issues, all the Ron Paul supporters. Then check out the things he covers here. A lot of things
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:16.000]  he doesn't get asked by the mainstream media and it's in shock waves. That's our job is to
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:20.480]  set bushfires, the minds of men and women everywhere. That's why I had trutham.com on.
[2:57:21.920 --> 2:57:25.680]  You know, I got all these sponsors too and I usually do two, three hours a show and forget
[2:57:25.680 --> 2:57:30.320]  about them and then cram them all in here at the end. But it is sponsors that we have a whole
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:38.560]  other hour coming up though that make this show possible. One of them is pmemory.net and it's
[2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:44.080]  a great system. It's just the classical systems that really work to increase your memory.
[2:57:45.200 --> 2:57:48.480]  You spend all this time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:53.440]  can you actually recall? Test yourself right now. Try to recall the show aired one week ago.
[2:57:55.600 --> 2:58:01.120]  How about two weeks ago? And if you cannot recall it, then what's the point?
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:10.560]  Okay. School of phenomenal memory, pmemory.net. And you know, I focus all day researching documents
[2:58:10.560 --> 2:58:18.880]  information and it made my memory even better over the years. Proving results from the lesson,
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:22.960]  guaranteed no gimmicks or magic pills, pure science and real training that makes sense,
[2:58:22.960 --> 2:58:27.280]  memorize what you read, what you really need, such as daily tasks, new languages and even
[2:58:27.280 --> 2:58:31.840]  entire books. Dramatically improve natural memory, attention and thinking speed. The school of
[2:58:31.840 --> 2:58:41.200]  phenomenal memory, www.theletterpmemory, pmemory.net. Also another fine sponsor. And what do I say
[2:58:41.200 --> 2:58:46.240]  about this company? A cola blue, a cola blue dot com. Great atmospheric water generator,
[2:58:46.240 --> 2:58:50.480]  seven and a half gallons a day out of the air inside your house or out on the porch, whatever
[2:58:50.480 --> 2:58:56.640]  it grabs, it puts it through seven different filters. And then among the filters is UV,
[2:58:56.640 --> 2:59:02.000]  charcoal, reverse osmosis, other filters, no chemicals, pollutants or toxins, neutral pH,
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:05.600]  your own source of clean drinking water, hook it up to a little solar panel, other great system,
[2:59:05.600 --> 2:59:11.200]  a cola blue dot com, E-C-O-L-O blue dot com, a cola blue dot com, big banners up in info wars

[2:59:20.960 --> 2:59:26.000]  dot com. And those are some of the sponsors that make this transmission possible. So we're very
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:37.120]  thankful to them. We will be right back ladies and gentlemen with hour number four as we go straight

[2:59:55.600 --> 3:00:00.320]  and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water is the key.

[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:09.440]  Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:14.240]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you. You know efoodsdirect.com

[3:01:13.920 --> 3:01:23.280]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen in defense of the Republic you have found at the tip of the
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:30.880]  spear in the info war. We're here money through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. by the grace of God.
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:37.120]  We have told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but that truth.
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:45.600]  The Obama deception I am very very tempted to go ahead and release it and not wait till Sunday
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:55.680]  because time is short. The dirty tricks going on against us are legion and that tells me that we
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:02:02.480]  are very close to victory. I smell victory. Webster Tarpley he wrote an article about
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:08.160]  Obamaville, more and more tent cities sprouting up. He is now announcing that they will take the
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:12.480]  core of these millions of volunteers and have them march around door to door. Canvassing support
[3:02:12.480 --> 3:02:17.280]  for Obama and his agenda literally pushing for an open world government run foreign by the
[3:02:17.280 --> 3:02:21.760]  central banks, a new special court they run where they will try people like Bernie Madoff,
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:27.040]  the new private banking court. It's all happening. Right now I'm sure you've noticed I keep saying
[3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:31.520]  this every day, every week but now it's becoming more and more insane by the minute. We have so
[3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:36.400]  many people waking up right now, so many people listening. It's the majority of those we're able
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:40.640]  to reach. The question is how do we reach people? The listeners have to get your books and my films
[3:02:40.640 --> 3:02:50.640]  and materials out to folks but to go directly over the target and all the flak is also extremely
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:58.560]  daunting. Webster Tarpley it's good to have you here with us. Hi Alex, how are you? I am just
[3:02:58.560 --> 3:03:04.080]  blown away by how real all of this is. Just all of the corruption manifesting, the control
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:08.560]  of depression, all of it. Give us the latest on your analysis of what the globalists are doing
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:14.960]  and what Obama is up to. Well I think there are a number of things that are changing rapidly. The
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:22.480]  first is this question of the Obama bills and I say Obama bills very deliberately. Back in the 1890s
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:28.000]  in this country we had a very severe depression which occurred when President Grover Cleveland,
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:34.560]  remember him a Democrat, capitulated to J.P. Morgan and the British and basically turned the
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:40.560]  control of the U.S. public debt over to London and their man Morgan in Wall Street. That is really
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:46.880]  the basis of the Federal Reserve comes out of those events in 1895. That pitched the entire U.S.
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:52.000]  economy into a terrible depression and there were bread lines for people who were lucky and those
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:58.880]  were called Cleveland cafes, the Cleveland Cafe in the 1890s. In the 1930s I think more people
[3:03:58.880 --> 3:04:05.360]  remember there were these shantytowns that were known as Hoover bills in honor of Herbert Hoover,
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:11.280]  reactionary Republican who refused to do anything about the depression, kept talking about the laws
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:15.840]  of the free market and how you had to wait and prosperity was just around the corner and be a
[3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:21.520]  rugged individualist. That was his slogan in 1932 when he lost the election. So those were Herbert
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:25.760]  Hoover, Hoover bills and now we have these shantytowns and I don't know what else you're going to
[3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:30.560]  call them except Obama bills because that's what they are and they're filling up with people who
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:39.120]  are homeless and we can see just the beginnings of some coverage. NBC News had a story last night
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:44.080]  in their nightly news about about these shantytowns. They don't call them Obama bills of course.
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:49.040]  The BBC has done it, local California, Michigan, Florida news is doing it. What's happening is
[3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:53.760]  these are the working poor who lost their little house, who've lost their job, who can't get credit
[3:04:53.760 --> 3:05:01.360]  to even get into a small apartment and these are clean cut nice looking families now living
[3:05:01.360 --> 3:05:05.840]  out of the backs of vans and SUVs and the government saying these are getting too big.
[3:05:05.840 --> 3:05:09.280]  We need to put you in a government center so they're announcing they're going to use the
[3:05:09.280 --> 3:05:14.960]  military bases with Obama medical care at them and a movie on Friday nights. The camps are now
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:21.440]  being introduced. Well, I recommend for this stopping foreclosures and the way you stop foreclosures
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:28.480]  is to stop foreclosures with a federal law. Foreclosure must be a federal crime, no foreclosures.
[3:05:28.480 --> 3:05:32.400]  We've got a banking sector that has run wild for 20 years and the deregulation.
[3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:37.360]  Yeah, Bloomberg reported the banks have gotten 9.7 trillion it's unaccounted for and that would
[3:05:37.360 --> 3:05:44.080]  pay for 90 plus percent of all mortgages. It would be a pittance of that with the people
[3:05:44.080 --> 3:05:48.720]  that can prove that they can't pay their mortgages. It is socialism. They keep saying that we've got
[3:05:48.720 --> 3:05:53.360]  socialism but we really don't have that. We have banker looting fascism and if I have a choice
[3:05:53.360 --> 3:05:57.760]  between banker looting fascism and socialism, I'll take socialism. That's not what we're getting.
[3:06:01.520 --> 3:06:05.920]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:10.720]  energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH
[3:06:10.720 --> 3:06:16.880]  level of 9 or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals
[3:06:16.880 --> 3:06:22.800]  and elements. This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness. Using plasma pH
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:28.160]  drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and
[3:06:28.160 --> 3:06:33.360]  regaining your health and energy. With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:39.360]  you drink up to the pH of 10. Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste
[3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:44.560]  and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[3:06:44.560 --> 3:06:50.320]  cannot survive in an alkaline environment. Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now

[3:07:01.840 --> 3:07:07.680]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:07:07.680 --> 3:07:12.240]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:18.640]  just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that
[3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:23.760]  Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging,
[3:07:23.760 --> 3:07:28.800]  he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:35.120]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:41.360]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:07:41.360 --> 3:07:47.680]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:06.800]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food. But Alex and I have decided that there are some
[3:08:06.800 --> 3:08:11.360]  of you that we really don't want to have food. If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[3:08:11.360 --> 3:08:17.360]  don't call e-foods direct. If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead of 650
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:22.560]  climatologists who know the earth is cooling, don't call e-foods direct. If you think growing food
[3:08:22.560 --> 3:08:26.960]  for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food. If you think waiting for a cop to show up
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:31.680]  after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call e-foods direct.
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:36.400]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food. If you think the warnings
[3:08:36.400 --> 3:08:40.720]  on the Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call e-foods direct. For the rest of you,

[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:28.160]  Webster Tarpley is our guest coming up in about 30 minutes. Tarpley will be on with us at the
[3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:33.760]  same time because he's very educated on all these subjects. Even the mainstream news is admitting
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:41.520]  just like the shooting a week ago of the cricket team over in Pakistan. It was on surveillance
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:46.240]  cameras. Witnesses saw it. The police just stood there. The shooters walked right past them with
[3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:53.280]  their guns. They were allowed to do that. Mainstream news. Scores of headlines. We posted them up on
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:59.440]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and an article Steve Watson wrote inside job in cricket shooting
[3:09:59.440 --> 3:10:07.520]  goes viral. And so now people are aware of that. Also, with the thing in Northern Ireland, we said,
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:12.000]  let's see if there was a drill going on at that time. And let's see if the security forces didn't
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:17.040]  shoot back and stood down. It's now come out today. It's in major British papers and Irish papers
[3:10:17.040 --> 3:10:21.440]  and European papers. We're going to go over that. Webster digressing. We'll go back to the
[3:10:21.440 --> 3:10:26.560]  Obama bills just a little foresight of what's coming up later. What does this sound like to
[3:10:26.560 --> 3:10:29.840]  you yet again with them shooting two members of the British military and now shooting a police
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:35.680]  officer last night right when Ireland's starting to get more of a sovereignty? Well, I'm not very
[3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:40.080]  familiar with the details of all this because I've been paying attention to economics. But
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:46.800]  what we do know is that the British government of Gordon Brown has tremendous totalitarian
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:54.160]  ambitions. Gordon Brown is really the guy who started this whole policy of bailouts giving
[3:10:54.160 --> 3:10:59.520]  hundreds of billions of dollars or hundreds of billions of pounds to bankrupt banks in an attempt
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:04.800]  to prop up this castle of derivatives. He's the one who started that, right? That was Northern
[3:11:04.800 --> 3:11:11.520]  Rock going bankrupt during the second half of 2007, which was then the recipient of hundreds
[3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:16.960]  of billions of pounds at the end of 2007 and then nationalized in effect by the British
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:22.480]  government in the beginning of 2008. So that's really the model. And they just did that again
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:28.000]  this past week. They nationalized Lloyd's Bank, which is one of the big clearing banks, as they
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:33.120]  call them, one of the four or five banks in Britain that have offices all around, you know,
[3:11:33.120 --> 3:11:41.200]  retail bankers. So Lloyd's Bank is now nationalized and you can see that Gordon Brown is making
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:46.560]  policy. Gordon Brown was here in Washington last week. He addressed a joint session of the Congress
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:51.920]  and he's a big supporter of free trade. Oh, he's telling about the free market and the free trade
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:58.400]  and how great that is. And of course, Obama is embarrassed by Gordon Brown because it's clear
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:04.080]  that Obama is basically following orders from Gordon Brown. So you may have heard some of the
[3:12:04.080 --> 3:12:11.040]  right wing talk show hosts make a big deal about how Gordon Brown was snubbed by Obama. And I think
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:16.560]  this is essentially baseless. This was a little bit of a dog and pony show, right? That they kind
[3:12:16.560 --> 3:12:22.080]  of did a charade to make it look like Obama was not working directly for Gordon Brown. But I think
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:29.760]  he is. Gordon Brown also wants $500 billion for the International Monetary Fund. Now,
[3:12:30.400 --> 3:12:35.200]  if you want to have the New World Order, that's it. Whatever the New World Order is going to be,
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:39.520]  it's going to be centered in the International Monetary Fund. Well, they've said that they're
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:43.520]  making their own court for made-off and others that the bankers will run because they're the
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:49.200]  experts. It'll be a new bank of the world that you pay your carbon taxes to. That's now all over
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:55.280]  the news. I mean, more and more every day. I mean, it's here. They've called the Wall Street Journal
[3:12:55.280 --> 3:12:59.600]  for a North American Union to save us out of the crisis. So you're absolutely right.
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:05.440]  Yeah, the International Monetary Fund is what's going to cap this entire thing. It'll be the apex
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:12.400]  of the entire edifice. And right now they want more money for bankrupt speculators in Eastern
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:18.320]  Europe and so forth. I think it's also important to look at the evolution of the derivatives. Now,
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:22.400]  my view of the crisis, of course, is that it's totally out of control, that nobody controls
[3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:28.320]  this crisis because it's bringing down all of their institutions one after another. Last week,
[3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:36.320]  we had the big AIG story, right? That AIG had lost $62 billion in one quarter. And of course,
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:41.760]  that's all derivatives. This is a very important example because it refutes the story that you
[3:13:41.760 --> 3:13:47.120]  hear from Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Hannity, and all the rest of these clowns, that the crisis was
[3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:53.280]  created by poor people getting subprime mortgages. Well, that was publicly the cover story to get
[3:13:53.280 --> 3:13:58.880]  the bailout, but the bill said it was for derivatives now in the multi-trillions and growing
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:03.200]  just in the United States, not the count worldwide. So it's on record that it is the bankers'
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:07.920]  derivatives. But yes, they want to blame it on the American people so we feel like we have indebtedness
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:13.680]  to go along with this. Right. And AIG has now taken, they've gotten $160 billion already. They're
[3:14:13.680 --> 3:14:19.040]  going to get another $30 billion immediately. Another $200 billion on top of that, just for AIG.
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:23.440]  Now, this is an insurance company. The interesting thing that came up in the hearings here last
[3:14:23.440 --> 3:14:30.880]  week in the Dodd-Shellby Senate banking committee and also the Wyden committee, the Senate budget
[3:14:30.880 --> 3:14:36.720]  committee, who got that money? It turns out that the money given to AIG was then passed along to
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:43.920]  European banks, European derivatives merchants, foreign bankers got that money, and of course,
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:49.040]  Goldman Sachs. Now, the fact that Goldman Sachs got all that money through AIG opens up
[3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:54.160]  Hanky-Panky Paulson, Henry Paulson, the former secretary of the Treasury under Borsch, of course,
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:15:01.200]  whose entire wealth was wrapped up in options and other instruments and benefits that he had from
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:06.240]  Goldman Sachs, which is what he worked for. Now, the big thing is the derivative scandal,
[3:15:06.240 --> 3:15:10.960]  I think, is about to explode. Today in the Washington Post, we have an article by a guy
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:16.400]  called Smick, where he says, the derivatives problem is a black hole. The reason that Geithner
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:21.680]  can't come forward with any programs is because it's going to take trillions, at least two to
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:28.000]  three trillion. Everybody in the Obama administration is afraid to come forward and say, we want
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:33.440]  two trillion or three trillion. By the way, that's what Larry Summers is coming out and saying from
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:37.280]  the White House, he's saying we need trillions more. That's in the news today.
[3:15:37.280 --> 3:15:41.120]  Absolutely. Well, that's very interesting. I think that the dam is breaking on this question.
[3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:46.640]  See, for the average person, the big issue is, what caused the depression? Why is there a depression?
[3:15:46.640 --> 3:15:51.760]  Why should there be a depression? What has changed? Well, the big difference is we have 1.5
[3:15:51.760 --> 3:15:57.200]  quadrillion of derivatives. The leverage on that used to be positive, which meant super profits
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:01.120]  at the apex of the pyramid. Yeah, they built Ponzi schemes, and now they've imploded,
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:04.800]  and if they can get us a sign on, they'll take over. But if they don't, it'll come out. They
[3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:09.120]  wreck the economy. They all go to prison. I had Ron Paul calling for their indictments of these
[3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:14.000]  bank heads. Earlier in the show, you're absolutely right. Well, it's going to take something more,
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:18.080]  and this is what I recommend. When it comes to derivatives, there's only one policy.
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:24.320]  Wipe them out, destroy them, shred them, delete them, burn them, make them into wallpaper.
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:29.360]  Freeze them. Freeze them is the best. Well, I think you've got to get them out of the
[3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:33.840]  universe, and that's the problem with this guy. Because he realizes that derivatives are a black
[3:16:33.840 --> 3:16:39.040]  hole, but you can't... And they won't even ban... They won't even have a top economist on the last
[3:16:39.040 --> 3:16:44.720]  two weeks. They won't even ban naked short selling. Well, that may be coming. But anyway,
[3:16:44.720 --> 3:16:49.920]  that doesn't stop us. Our demand has to be, and this is really a matter of economic science.
[3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:54.160]  If you want to get out of the depression, there's only one way to do it, and it's got to be done
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:17:00.960]  by government because nobody else can do it. Ban derivatives. Derivatives were illegal. From 1936
[3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:06.880]  and the New Deal until 1982, when Reagan came in under the influence of Milton Friedman and the
[3:17:06.880 --> 3:17:13.840]  rest of these people, derivatives were illegal. And from 1982 until 1993, they were a very,
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:19.040]  very dubious legality. Nobody was willing to buy them because there was still this idea that they
[3:17:19.040 --> 3:17:24.720]  might be illegal. But then they used AIG to triple A, certify them as an insurance company,
[3:17:24.720 --> 3:17:30.640]  and so they labeled literal buckets of crap as gold. Right, and this was done in 1993. It's
[3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:36.640]  Wendy Graham, the wife of Phil Graham. She came in and said, I'm going to make a safe haven for
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:43.760]  derivatives. She was backed up by Bob Rubin of Goldman Sachs by Summers, the same guy that we
[3:17:43.760 --> 3:17:49.120]  have today. Arrest them all. They're also by a green span, of course. And then Phil Graham,
[3:17:49.120 --> 3:17:53.920]  Phil Graham of Texas, came in at the end of the 90s with a law that was signed by Clinton,
[3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:58.880]  guaranteeing that derivatives were hunky-dory. And that's basically how... Even under the laws
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:03.840]  they changed, they violated federal laws, international laws, tens of thousands of times.
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:08.480]  That's on record. They didn't even follow their own scam rules. And that's why we should have
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:12.720]  state grand juries move for their indictments. Well, again, you can put all these people in
[3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:18.480]  jail, but you've got to get rid of 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives. The U.S. part is about a quadrillion.
[3:18:18.480 --> 3:18:23.440]  The Webster, we have to put them in jail. We have to put them in jail because they're going to
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:27.760]  expand us into an even bigger Ponzi scheme of world government, foreign by the bankers,
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:32.880]  if we don't identify them as the crooks. I'm all for it, but you've got to destroy the derivative.
[3:18:32.880 --> 3:18:38.320]  The re-regulation of markets is what you need, and that means wipe out derivatives. In other words,
[3:18:38.320 --> 3:18:43.120]  not just re-regulate, looking forward, but re-regulate, looking backward, and declare that
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:47.920]  all of this stuff goes into the shredder. It gets deleted. You press the delete button,
[3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:52.320]  and 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives... Because there's no way, as you and other economists
[3:18:52.320 --> 3:18:56.880]  and historians approve it, no way to fix this. It's a black hole that will consume everything.
[3:18:56.880 --> 3:19:00.480]  We did the banker bailout bill. We did all this, and look, it only gets worse. The stock market
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:06.240]  is still plunging. This is why they say, how come Obama doesn't come forward with a solution for
[3:19:06.240 --> 3:19:11.680]  the banks? Well, there is no solution for the banks unless you destroy derivatives. That's the
[3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:16.720]  whole thing hinges on derivatives, and this has become more and more obvious to people. How come
[3:19:16.720 --> 3:19:23.360]  Paulson had to revamp the tarp from the first tarp to what it then became? How come Geithner
[3:19:23.360 --> 3:19:28.640]  can't give you any details? Why are they waiting week after week, day after day? City Bank is now
[3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:33.200]  hovering at about a dollar a share. There's a little bit of a pop today, but I don't even think
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:39.200]  it'll last the day. AIG is 38 cents a share. This is all derivatives. There's an article today in
[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:45.280]  McClatchy. Very interesting that if you take the five top banks, Citibank, JP Morgan, Hong Kong,
[3:19:45.280 --> 3:19:52.880]  Shanghai, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, they have more than enough derivatives losses to wipe
[3:19:52.880 --> 3:19:58.880]  out their entire capital base, meaning those are all zombie banks. Now, it's quite obvious.
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:05.200]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under this crazy Sheila Bear, they have to seize those
[3:20:05.200 --> 3:20:09.680]  banks. Banks are seized in the United States basically every Friday now, but mostly they're
[3:20:09.680 --> 3:20:16.960]  little banks in out-of-the-way places. This time around, the big money-setter banks, the big five,
[3:20:16.960 --> 3:20:22.560]  have got to be seized and put through Chapter 11 bankruptcy and in the process wipe out the
[3:20:22.560 --> 3:20:29.280]  derivatives. Those five banks represent 95% of the entire derivatives bubble on the U.S. side,
[3:20:29.280 --> 3:20:34.480]  so that would be a way to begin. And then once we arrest their directors, we can bring them into
[3:20:34.480 --> 3:20:38.800]  court and find out the full extent of the Ponzi schemes and then arrest all the rest of them.
[3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:43.840]  Absolutely. There's no way around it. We can wake up next week and arrest all these people,
[3:20:43.840 --> 3:20:47.280]  and the newer loader can end, folks, but the churches are telling you it's impossible, it's
[3:20:47.280 --> 3:20:51.280]  of God, it's going to happen. That is mind control. You have to believe we can beat them because we
[3:20:51.280 --> 3:20:59.440]  don't have any other hope but to have these people through due process arrested, seized immediately,
[3:20:59.440 --> 3:21:07.040]  seized the criminals. In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of
[3:21:07.040 --> 3:21:12.640]  the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think
[3:21:12.640 --> 3:21:18.480]  all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:23.200]  for the best interests of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:28.000]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:35.200]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:42.400]  that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[3:21:42.400 --> 3:21:49.680]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the

[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:08.480]  Resources and I'd like to share some thoughts with you. In today's economy with the government
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:13.760]  spending on wild, the banking system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street and continuous
[3:22:13.760 --> 3:22:18.400]  freefall, we both know that it's critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs

[3:22:28.560 --> 3:22:33.200]  of exchange for centuries, and they've never been more important in our country's history.

[3:24:03.600 --> 3:24:08.320]  government has been initiated with the recent bailout. International bankers and power brokers
[3:24:08.320 --> 3:24:13.600]  have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour.
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:18.080]  But we've only seen the beginning. Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before
[3:24:18.080 --> 3:24:23.200]  seen in modern times. Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:27.680]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:32.000]  Phase one is a one-world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:36.160]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.

[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:28.000]  I got a message to the government like every day.
[3:25:30.800 --> 3:25:35.840]  They're telling me about Osama over there. Listen to the suckers.
[3:25:40.320 --> 3:25:42.000]  God, we've got criminals in control.
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:50.960]  I see a message from the government like every day. I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:56.240]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever. Picture me buying this scam. I said never.
[3:25:56.240 --> 3:26:00.080]  You in tune to a hard truth. Soldiers spitting. I stay committed. Give up.
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:03.200]  That's how I lose commission. It's all upon a fighting devil state.
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:06.640]  Mind control and all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:09.440]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:12.000]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and rapists.
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:16.960]  Another push season, need another war for profit. All in secret so the public never fit to stop.
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:21.440]  Let's go back to Webster Tarpley. Webster, you're going over the economy. I agree with you about
[3:26:21.440 --> 3:26:26.560]  what's happening. Please continue. It's good to see Obama's approval rating
[3:26:26.560 --> 3:26:31.440]  dropping between 15 and 20 points. His first couple hundred days trying to ram everything
[3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:36.400]  through looks like things are going well. We're still in dire situation exposing him.
[3:26:36.400 --> 3:26:38.800]  People have got to intensify their operation to expose it.
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:44.640]  Yes, and I think it's wonderful that you're taking the lead with the Obama deception.
[3:26:44.640 --> 3:26:51.680]  It goes right to the heart of Obama. With Bush, of course, you were dealing with a pretty open
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:56.800]  reactionary, right? He would go around and say things like bring it on and water dead or alive
[3:26:56.800 --> 3:27:01.840]  and so forth. Obama's a completely different proposition. And as you point out, it's deception,
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:07.600]  dissembling, deception, duping people. The guy is slippery, slimy, he's evasive.
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:12.240]  So the question of deception, I think, is really critical. And it sounds to me like
[3:27:12.240 --> 3:27:17.600]  you've assembled a number of voices in the Obama deception. Well, you haven't seen it yet,
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:22.640]  but you're the number one voice in the film. Gerald Salente, George Humphrey,
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:30.720]  Harris 1, Professor Griff, myself, but it's really Obama showing him say one thing and then
[3:27:30.720 --> 3:27:35.680]  a year later doing the opposite, saying he's shutting down camps when he actually was expanding it.
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:41.840]  I mean, it's going to be devastating to him. We knew that today Obama wants to bust
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:46.240]  the teachers union. He just came out with a big thing for merit pay. It's the equivalent of
[3:27:46.240 --> 3:27:50.880]  peace work, right? If you ever worked in a factory with peace work, you know how difficult that is.
[3:27:50.880 --> 3:27:54.960]  Obama wants to have the equivalent of peace work for teachers. It's a way to bust
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:59.760]  the American Federation of Teachers. Poor Dupes, they supported him. He's going to stab them in
[3:27:59.760 --> 3:28:04.720]  the back. Obama says he wants to help people who are going to get foreclosed on. His answer to that
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:09.760]  is to increase payments to these predators like Mozilla, right? The Mozilla types that country
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:14.320]  want. The predatory lenders are going to get the money and maybe somebody might get helped,
[3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:20.000]  but that's not the main idea. The main idea is to prop up those guys. So it's all deception with
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:26.480]  Obama. And the main thing, of course, is he's owned by Goldman Sachs, Soros, David Rockefeller,
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:33.200]  trilateral commission. The foreign policy is a more sophisticated version of imperialism that
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:38.240]  depends on playing other countries, one against the other. Right now they're trying to play Russia
[3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:44.720]  against Iran. They're trying to get Russia to become the leading edge of a U.S. assault on Iran,
[3:28:44.720 --> 3:28:49.040]  really, with the idea that what's going to come out of that is conflict between Iran and Russia
[3:28:49.040 --> 3:28:53.280]  with the U.S. holding back and... Well, expanding on that, George Soros at the Davis Forum three
[3:28:53.280 --> 3:28:57.840]  weeks ago, you might have seen the video, admits they're lowering oil prices as a weapon against
[3:28:57.840 --> 3:29:05.680]  Russia, Venezuela, the Middle East, to accelerate the world depression. Yes, I'm sure that he would
[3:29:05.680 --> 3:29:11.840]  say that. I think the collapse of oil prices has got a number of things going on. Some of that
[3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:17.280]  is hedge funds approaching bankruptcy. They go into a liquidation mode and dump their speculative
[3:29:17.280 --> 3:29:21.680]  positions. The other thing, of course, is that demand is shrinking as the depression hits, but
[3:29:21.680 --> 3:29:28.160]  certainly they're trying to turn that against Russia. So that goes on. Also with Sudan, look,
[3:29:28.160 --> 3:29:34.240]  the biggest country in Africa, right now you've got this awful woman, Susan Rice, at the United
[3:29:34.240 --> 3:29:39.680]  Nations. Africa, they're moving U.S. forces into Africa right now, and they've got a black face to
[3:29:39.680 --> 3:29:46.080]  do it. Yeah, and Sudan is this huge country. I've actually been there, and you fly from
[3:29:46.080 --> 3:29:50.640]  northern Sudan to southern Sudan. You're going for hours and hours and hours. It's huge,
[3:29:50.640 --> 3:29:55.840]  and it's the key to Africa in many ways. They're sending China about six, seven, eight percent
[3:29:55.840 --> 3:30:01.840]  of Chinese oil, and the goal now is to... They've declared the president an outlaw, right? They've
[3:30:01.840 --> 3:30:07.280]  got Bashir. They want to make him into a... Yeah, we now have the UN, and they made it the
[3:30:07.280 --> 3:30:10.720]  liberal cause to let them do this. We're not saying the guy's perfect. The point is,
[3:30:10.720 --> 3:30:15.760]  they've made... He's the first sitting president that the UN has indicted.
[3:30:16.560 --> 3:30:22.720]  And that they have a proposal for a no-fly zone over Sudan, which would simply mean that the U.S.
[3:30:22.720 --> 3:30:28.640]  Air Force would then try to shoot down all flights over Sudan. Now, that's a wonderful thing. Let's
[3:30:28.640 --> 3:30:33.840]  bring war to another continent. Let's have Africa inflamed in addition to the Middle
[3:30:33.840 --> 3:30:38.720]  East inflation. And the vector point is Sudan for the North Common invasion. U.S. forces
[3:30:38.720 --> 3:30:44.880]  massing all over the continent of Africa with smiling Obama leading the way. Stay there,
[3:30:44.880 --> 3:30:50.400]  Webster Tarble will come back and continue with the real agenda and the Obama deception at infowars.com.

[3:32:07.920 --> 3:32:14.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:19.600]  just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is
[3:32:19.600 --> 3:32:24.720]  working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged
[3:32:24.720 --> 3:32:29.520]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:32:29.520 --> 3:32:36.800]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:32:36.800 --> 3:32:41.680]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:32:41.680 --> 3:32:48.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:33:05.280 --> 3:33:09.520]  with so many different methods of consumption. How do you choose a simple yet effective way
[3:33:09.520 --> 3:33:15.360]  to get your daily intake? The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the answer.

[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:39.680]  I will tell everybody out there listening that we may launch the Obama deception early today or
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:49.760]  tomorrow. It is true vital to wait at prisonplanet.tv. I was out of the studio during the break.
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:57.120]  John, we have our next guest on from We Are Change Ireland, Keith Bryan. We're going to go to him in a
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:11.040]  moment. Webster Tarpley. Again, I want to get back to how to defeat these people. They are now
[3:35:11.040 --> 3:35:16.080]  announcing what they had currently and previously said they were going to do. Use the Obamanoids.
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:25.280]  I have the quotes here out of mainstream news. Canvas and find out the exact quote is chilling.
[3:35:25.280 --> 3:35:32.080]  Who supports Obama and who doesn't on a door-by-door basis and pressure people? Exactly what you said
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:36.800]  with these multi-million man gun force. Now he's openly admitting and the army's admitting a
[3:35:36.800 --> 3:35:41.040]  million person civilian military force that after the military takes over country including the U.S.
[3:35:41.040 --> 3:35:48.400]  they're the bureaucracy. I mean it's all happening so how do we defeat this? Well as I write in my
[3:35:48.400 --> 3:35:53.920]  latest book which is Surviving the Catechalism just published by Progressive Press last week
[3:35:53.920 --> 3:35:58.400]  actually. First copies of Surviving the Catechalism now going out. The main thing is political
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:04.880]  organizing. The thing with Obama is an illusion and it's an illusion which is very fragile.
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:09.520]  And I think you can see already the signs that Obama is beginning to get bogged down.
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:16.800]  As long as he was running for office he could make promises 360 degrees. He promised everything
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:21.040]  in the opposite of everything. Once you're in office you've got to come down and make certain
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:27.600]  decisions even though those are hidden. There's a tremendous propaganda effort to hide the fact
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:34.480]  that the essence of Obama is ten trillion dollars to the banks with an unlimited blank check.
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:41.120]  If you looked at his state of the union address he basically said we will do anything for the
[3:36:41.120 --> 3:36:46.720]  banks. He doesn't say we will do anything for the homeless or for the auto industry or for anybody
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:52.560]  else. Only the banks. The more that this can be understood I think the quicker the illusion of
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:59.120]  Obama will collapse. In other words he can crater very easily because it's all based on hysteria.
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:03.840]  You can already see that in the financier community there are some people who now think
[3:37:03.840 --> 3:37:10.400]  more that he's an incompetent, that he's not an effective crisis manager. You have among the
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:15.520]  swooning, drooling liberals at the New York Times, people like Maureen Dowd, they're beginning to
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:20.160]  think that he's maybe not the messiah that they thought. He might even be a false messiah.
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:25.200]  Well they're already preparing to blame. They're already preparing to blame everything on him
[3:37:25.200 --> 3:37:30.080]  when he's just a puppet minion. Here's the quote here. It says his new organization,
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:36.640]  organizing for America, will be going door to door to map out and identify support, to map out.
[3:37:37.840 --> 3:37:41.040]  I mean his goons are hitting the street and they're trying to sell
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:46.480]  his financial system and what he's pushing. Well don't open the door, right? Don't let them get
[3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:53.360]  there. No, no, no, open the door and give them an Obama deception. Yes, if you have one. Sure,
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:38:00.000]  that's great. Counter-organize them. That's better. Should we go to Obama meetings? I mean we have
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:04.240]  USAService.org with a map of every meeting in every town and city. Shouldn't we go there
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:08.480]  and lovingly explain to them? You think you're repudiating Bush? This is Bush on steroids?
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:15.680]  I suppose you can. I also urge people to look at the big picture, right? You can always call
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:22.480]  into these big sort of wall-speak controlled talk radios. You can have a tremendous impact. Again,
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:27.360]  I recommend political organizing. A lot of people are looking at apocalyptic scenarios,
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:31.440]  right? That it's going to come to some kind of civil strife. I don't think we're there yet. I think
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:37.920]  it's time to try politics. Well, I see the globalist are hyping that. Well, you've got to have your
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:42.080]  own program to get out of the depression. I have one, right? Wipe out derivatives,
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:47.840]  fees to Fed, issue zero credit production, credit for production, have emergency federal
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:52.560]  relief and set up a new world monetary system. Four points, you get out of the depression.
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:58.720]  That's the big prize. The gold ring in this whole situation is, who does know how to get
[3:38:58.720 --> 3:39:04.560]  out of the depression? Geithner, Volcker, Somers, Obama obviously don't. Neither did Bush and
[3:39:04.560 --> 3:39:10.240]  Paulson. And it's got to be this method of wipe out the derivatives, fees the central bank, start
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:14.560]  making that a national bank. Okay, let's stop there. Let's stop there. Let's stop there. They're
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:19.040]  already doing a counterfeit of what you just said. They're claiming the Federal Reserve is federal,
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:24.080]  not private and saying they are going to nationalize the banks. When in truth, it is the private
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:28.640]  bankrupt banks coming in to take over with government power. So how do you educate folks
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:34.160]  that we're not seeing a nationalization right now? We're seeing a privatized looting taking place.
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:38.480]  Around this issue of derivatives, in other words, the derivatives are the heart of the
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:43.360]  five big money center banks that we mentioned before. If you wipe out derivatives, you've
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:47.840]  essentially wiped out those five banks because they are really zombie banks, right? They've
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:53.680]  always been zombie banks. They don't lend for plant and equipment. When GM Ford and Chrysler
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:58.640]  were about to go bankrupt last December, the zombie banks did not come forward. We just had
[3:39:58.640 --> 3:40:05.360]  Circuit City collapse. 35,000 jobs, 600 stores. Where were the zombie banks? The zombie banks
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:09.840]  don't lend. They're getting money from the tarp. They're getting money on the Federal Reserve
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:16.080]  bailout, which is 10 times bigger, and they're not lending. So these banks have got to be wiped out.
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:21.440]  The Federal Reserve has got to be seized, nationalized, and then you begin issuing your
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:27.520]  0% credit for production only, not for financial services, not for speculation.
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:31.440]  A lot of economists say that it shouldn't be a classical tariff either. It should just be
[3:40:31.440 --> 3:40:34.480]  a tax incentive when industry moves to the United States.
[3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:40.000]  Well, I've talked about this in the following terms. If you've got a, if you've got counter-racial on
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:44.400]  the victim, you've got to rip counter-racial off the victim, put a stake through his heart.
[3:40:44.400 --> 3:40:49.520]  But now you've got a victim who's basically about dead. You've got to administer a transfusion,
[3:40:49.520 --> 3:40:55.520]  that's your Federal 0% credit, plus oxygen and a defibrillator. And that's your, that's your
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:41:02.240]  program of large-scale infrastructure, 100 nuclear reactors, coast-to-coast, maglev railways,
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:07.920]  commuter rail, all this, and your three science drivers, your space program, your biomedical and
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:12.720]  your high-energy physics. And that starts both sides. It's true. It's not enough just to offer
[3:41:12.720 --> 3:41:17.600]  lending. You've got to, you've got to generate demand for borrowing, because you're in a panic.
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:21.680]  You're inhabiting the negative curvature of the inside of a collapse vehicle.
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:25.680]  But, Webster, they've already brought us, I'm going to get our next guest briefly here,
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:28.480]  having back on the next few days for a more detailed report, this is very important,
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:34.640]  that we're already so deep into it, some are saying it could be irreverable. And so after
[3:41:34.640 --> 3:41:38.400]  our next guest leaves us, I want to briefly talk about if they allow total implosion,
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:42.880]  and how would you change your plan after that point with your perspective? But Webster,
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:46.800]  we know the British have been caught over and over again, more than 75% of the terror attacks
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:51.200]  in Northern Ireland, Ireland and England, being staged by British Special Air Services, MI5 and
[3:41:51.200 --> 3:41:57.920]  MI6. They're now kicking this off again. And I said yesterday, I said, in fact, at the start of the
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:03.200]  show before I'd seen the latest article, I said, will there be a drill around these two British
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:07.600]  soldiers being killed? A drill of the exact same thing happening. We already know that the security
[3:42:07.600 --> 3:42:12.880]  services military stood down even as they saw them shooting and didn't fire back. That is now
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:17.120]  mainstream news. This is the Belfast Telegraph, soldiers shot dead in Northern Ireland terror
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:22.160]  attack. The attack happened just 36 hours from Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Ord,
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:27.920]  confirmed that undercover soldiers have been called in to carry out surveillance operations
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:31.840]  on dissidents and amid warnings that the threat against his officers and military personnel
[3:42:31.840 --> 3:42:36.720]  was at its highest for almost a decade that they were doing drills. Here's another one,
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:43.760]  this is out of the Metro.co.uk, I guess this is one of the Metro. Guards stood by as soldiers
[3:42:43.760 --> 3:42:47.840]  murdered, armed security guards employed to protect the army barracks stood by as government killed
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:54.400]  soldiers. Two soldiers were shot dead in the shooting at the barracks in Atrium, Northern Ireland,
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:57.600]  but armed security guards employed a protective military base and an open fire on the terrorist,
[3:42:57.600 --> 3:43:02.800]  even while they stood over the injured men and fired further shots, the Times has reported.
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:10.560]  I want to bring up right now, we are Change Ireland that has just done absolutely fabulous
[3:43:10.560 --> 3:43:15.520]  a job, Keith Bryan, or Byrne, tell me how I pronounce that Keith, I always get it wrong,
[3:43:16.160 --> 3:43:20.160]  to tell us what's happening. He alerted us, well I called him this morning and he alerted
[3:43:20.160 --> 3:43:24.400]  my producer that there were these other articles confirming our suspicions. So Keith, good to
[3:43:24.400 --> 3:43:29.360]  have you on from We Are Change Ireland. Alex, it's a pleasure to be back on. I think last time
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:33.920]  round we were all upbeat about our victory against the European Constitution known as the
[3:43:33.920 --> 3:43:38.480]  Lisbon Tree, but this time round it seems like things are a little different. So it's great
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:44.080]  to be on and hello to Webster Tarpley too. Hi there. Okay, you're there in Ireland,
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:50.560]  give us the breakdown on what's happening. Well, I think there's a lot of ambiguity going on.
[3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:55.440]  People aren't quite sure what happened or what is meant to happen out of this.
[3:43:55.440 --> 3:44:00.240]  As we know that there were six people shot there on Saturday night, two of them were pronounced
[3:44:00.240 --> 3:44:05.600]  dead and they were two soldiers of British Army. There were two other soldiers hit with bullets
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:10.160]  and there were two other civilians which were just delivering pizzas to the barracks.
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:16.960]  I actually did some investigation earlier the way you were saying when I was speaking to Rob
[3:44:16.960 --> 3:44:22.480]  and I came across some interesting things. The actual people who provide security on these
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:28.480]  bases is called NISGS which is the Northern Ireland Security Guard Services and they are
[3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:36.000]  normally armed with weapons and they also patrol their bases. It was confirmed from an army source
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  in the actual Australian news that it is a regular procedure to fire back upon an enemy who's attacking.
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:51.600]  That is a regular procedure. These did not fire back, they stood down and as you just said
[3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:57.920]  they actually, when the shooters came over to let's say unload again another time,
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:03.920]  they actually stood back and they let that happen. The same thing happened last week in
[3:45:03.920 --> 3:45:08.880]  Pakistan with the attack on the cricket team, perfect propaganda to outrage cricket fans,
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:13.200]  tens of millions worldwide. It's almost as big as soccer in many areas, don't know in the U.S.
[3:45:14.240 --> 3:45:20.400]  And the same thing there, mainstream news is saying was it an inside job because the government
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:26.000]  there's police right there and then the shooters shoot, calmly take their time, walk right by
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:31.360]  the police, nothing's done, this stinks to high heaven. Webster, I mean it's the same MO every
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:35.920]  time. Why do, why does the establishment, we're not sure with these new cases, others have been
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:40.160]  confirmed, but why do they like to stage these shootings as a pretext to bring in more troops?
[3:45:41.840 --> 3:45:47.600]  Britain under the labor governments of Tony Blair and now Gordon Brown, Britain has gone
[3:45:47.600 --> 3:45:54.480]  on much further down the road to a police state than the U.S. even. Part of it is that the
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:45:59.920]  parties are controlled top down by these, the parliamentary whip system. The other thing is
[3:45:59.920 --> 3:46:04.160]  that you don't, you haven't had mass movements, you haven't had the kind of thing that you've
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:09.520]  seen in the U.S. And you don't have independent communications by and large, right? The large
[3:46:09.520 --> 3:46:15.680]  amount of television and radio broadcasting is controlled by the BBC. There is some commercial
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:22.160]  opposition, competition to that, but it doesn't amount to the kind of thing that you have in
[3:46:22.160 --> 3:46:27.920]  the U.S. of all ideological types. So I would say Gordon Brown, having started with this thing
[3:46:27.920 --> 3:46:33.520]  about bank bailouts, bank nationalizations, hundreds of billions and trillions of pounds now
[3:46:33.520 --> 3:46:38.160]  committed to the derivatives bailout and wanting to be the leader of this, right? Because that's
[3:46:38.160 --> 3:46:43.680]  what he is right now. Gordon Brown is the world leader in the bailout brigade. I think they're
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:48.880]  tightening the screws and they're looking for pretext for more and more police state controls
[3:46:48.880 --> 3:46:53.200]  inside. That's right. Peaceably, the people of Ireland are moving to kick British forces out
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:58.000]  and get true sovereignty. And this violence is the best friend of the establishment. It's turned
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:03.120]  out most IRA was commanded by British intelligence and they would threaten their underlings with
[3:47:03.120 --> 3:47:08.560]  death if they wouldn't go out and commit shootings and bombings. Going back to We Are Change Ireland,
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:12.160]  Keith Bryant, Keith, continue with other intel you've got from Ireland.
[3:47:12.160 --> 3:47:16.560]  Well, basically, I was just scouring the newspapers. I was just, you know,
[3:47:16.560 --> 3:47:21.760]  randomly googling what the MOs would be. And that's how it came across this stand-down or these
[3:47:21.760 --> 3:47:26.080]  guards standing by. And the minute I saw that, I went, that does not sound right. I mean,
[3:47:27.200 --> 3:47:32.880]  their guards, they're part of the security forces there. They would at least retaliate somehow,
[3:47:32.880 --> 3:47:37.680]  which they never did. And they stood down. I want to see that they stood down the second time after
[3:47:37.680 --> 3:47:44.080]  the bullets were fired. Well, when the actual attackers came in for another round of shooting,
[3:47:44.080 --> 3:47:47.680]  that they actually still stood there. And when I saw that, that was very suspicious. And not only
[3:47:47.680 --> 3:47:54.240]  that, we have one gentleman called Patrick Mercer. He's a former Infantry Regiment Commanding Officer
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:48:00.400]  and he is now chairman of the Commons Counterterrorism Subcommittee. And he went on to say, we have to
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:07.280]  question the efficacy of the Guard Force if it is not armed guards stood by as British soldiers
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:10.960]  are shot at an ordinary armed base, prepared to fire back on the enemy.
[3:48:10.960 --> 3:48:16.320]  And let's expand on that. They then came over and stood over them and raked them with fire again.
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:22.320]  Yeah, well, and this guy goes on to say, well, how are we meant to be a deterrent in the future
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:26.720]  if the terrorists know that we're not going to be shot? And when you look at it, I mean,
[3:48:26.720 --> 3:48:30.720]  I'm sure that the people who were attacking the base knew that they were going to receive some
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:36.080]  sort of fireback or some sort of retaliation, but there was none. Now, why would that's a key
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:39.920]  point? Why would they waddle up after shooting them in the distance and then stand over them
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:44.480]  and shoot them again, right up at the gate of the base, not thinking they'd be fired upon,
[3:48:44.480 --> 3:48:51.680]  knowing there was armed forces in there? Yeah, not just that. They also were waiting there, Alex.
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:57.440]  So that, I mean, I'm actually reading the Army reports here and I don't know who the person
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:49:02.320]  is. It's coming from the Australian and various other new sources, but they're scrutinizing the
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:05.760]  situation. They're saying, well, why was there no armed guards coming outside the base to
[3:49:05.760 --> 3:49:10.800]  collect the pizzas? That's a normal protocol for people with weapons to come outside in case
[3:49:10.800 --> 3:49:15.360]  there was an actual attack. And there was none of that. And the security didn't do anything.
[3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:20.320]  And so you have these individuals who just go up at random by chance, catch these people
[3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:26.560]  collecting pizzas outside from dominoes, and they get sprayed with bullets. And one article goes on
[3:49:26.560 --> 3:49:33.360]  to say around 60 to 70 rounds were fired. So that's a substantial amount of ammunition being used
[3:49:33.360 --> 3:49:39.440]  against these six individuals, which thank God, like no more than two are killed. Yeah, that's
[3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:48.240]  two and a third banana clips, sprayed into them. Just amazing. Well, is there a We Are Change website
[3:49:48.240 --> 3:49:51.760]  you want to plug? I know you guys put out a film as well and have really been making the news over
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:56.960]  there confronting politicians. Any sites that you want to plug? Yeah, there's several sites now,
[3:49:56.960 --> 3:50:07.440]  Alex. There's wiseupjournal.com. Anthony runs that one. Wiseupjournal.com. Yeah, there's We
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:13.840]  Are Change Ireland.org. There's also another website called WeThePeople.ie. So there's a
[3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:18.560]  few other websites there and there's links to others. And it's quite interesting what's going
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:23.920]  on recently. And it's reminiscent to what we once knew in the past, and it's kind of being
[3:50:23.920 --> 3:50:31.040]  brought into the present now. And I feel, Alex, if this goes on, basically, there will be British
[3:50:31.040 --> 3:50:34.960]  troops back on the streets up there because they're not going to stand by while British soldiers
[3:50:34.960 --> 3:50:39.520]  are being fired upon. And you know... And now they killed a police officer last night, too.
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:46.160]  Yeah, basically, what happened there was somebody threw a stone or a brick
[3:50:46.160 --> 3:50:52.880]  through some person's window. Maybe that was a tactic to draw the police in. But one police
[3:50:52.880 --> 3:50:58.560]  officer who has 22 years of experience in the police force up there, who must have seen quite a
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:03.840]  lot, he arrived up on the scene. And basically, when the car came to a standstill, somebody
[3:51:03.840 --> 3:51:09.280]  come up from the rear window and just unloaded into the car. And I think he was shot in the head
[3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:13.920]  and he died instantly. Well, it's on record. The British do most of this. They've been caught
[3:51:13.920 --> 3:51:17.600]  red-handed. We'll talk to you in the next few days as this develops. Thanks for your great
[3:51:17.600 --> 3:51:23.120]  information. And we are Change Ireland. Alex, take care of yourself and bye to Webster. Bye-bye.
[3:51:23.120 --> 3:51:26.640]  Take care. Webster, we're going to come back in a final five-minute segment and talk about
[3:51:26.640 --> 3:51:32.000]  if the depression continues to unfold, if we're not able to turn them around. What do we do then?
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:37.200]  I know you're saying work to change it now, but how would we extricate ourselves from the crisis
[3:51:37.200 --> 3:51:41.120]  if it's allowed to continue to deteriorate over the next six months to a year, which is clear.
[3:51:41.120 --> 3:51:45.040]  They're not going to change course. We're going to force them later, too. But you can see the
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:49.280]  energy of the people versus the establishment and you can see the trajectory and it's clear it's
[3:51:49.280 --> 3:51:52.720]  going to stop. It's going to take more time to stop this juggernaut of destruction, financial
[3:51:52.720 --> 3:51:56.560]  destruction from rolling forward. Also, will they hit Iran? They're beating the war drums
[3:51:56.560 --> 3:52:00.880]  for that yet again. I'm Alex Jones. This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:06.080]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you? Most people think of hot

[3:53:02.240 --> 3:53:07.680]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:53:07.680 --> 3:53:13.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:53:13.200 --> 3:53:18.640]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:53:18.640 --> 3:53:23.280]  the best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged
[3:53:23.280 --> 3:53:28.080]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:53:28.080 --> 3:53:35.280]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:53:35.280 --> 3:53:41.840]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:53:41.840 --> 3:53:49.680]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of
[3:53:49.680 --> 3:53:56.960]  the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in Super High Quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:29.280]  in-depth information about him himself and his agenda. Those are also available at infowars.com.
[3:55:30.240 --> 3:55:34.400]  Webster, as we launch the film coming up in the next few days, I want to have you back on next
[3:55:34.400 --> 3:55:38.480]  week to break it all down. If you've had a chance to see it, we'll give you a prison planet.TV
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:42.560]  membership. You don't have to wait to have the DVD shipped to you and you can go up there and watch
[3:55:42.560 --> 3:55:46.160]  it in super high quality and give me your review of it. I think you're going to be extremely pleased
[3:55:46.160 --> 3:55:50.480]  with it. We just get better and better at making these films. And Obama has given us plenty of
[3:55:50.480 --> 3:55:55.360]  material to make it. We've got a Fourth Circuit agenda right now. This republic is going to make
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:56:02.320]  it. But that final question, we're growing opposition. What they're doing is very unpopular.
[3:56:02.320 --> 3:56:05.200]  He's going to run out of gas the next couple hundred days, but they're going to do a lot of
[3:56:05.200 --> 3:56:08.880]  damage in the meantime. And I don't think they're going to be implementing your plan any time soon.
[3:56:08.880 --> 3:56:11.680]  So what do we do down the road when things are 10 times worse?
[3:56:11.680 --> 3:56:18.320]  Well, you don't get out of the depression unless you make these changes. There is no automatic
[3:56:18.320 --> 3:56:22.640]  exit from the depression. There is no business cycle that's going to lift you out of the
[3:56:22.640 --> 3:56:27.440]  depression. And I'm also afraid there is no free market solution to the depression. If you call
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:34.400]  for the free market under these circumstances, basically making everything much worse. Think
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:39.440]  of food stamps. There are three million people in Texas who are living thanks to food stamps. And
[3:56:39.440 --> 3:56:44.000]  if you say free market, take that away. Well, that's going to be the end of a lot of them. So
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:50.160]  I think the question is how long will it take for people to throw off the chains of ideology and
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:56:56.800]  all the illusions and all the claptrap of the past 40 years? One thing is there's a sign of a mass
[3:56:56.800 --> 3:57:02.160]  movement against derivatives. And that is the produce the note. It's a mass movement against
[3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:06.880]  derivatives and against foreclosures. It's people who are facing foreclosure. They're going to be
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:12.240]  thrown out on the street and they say, wait a minute, you've got to produce the piece of paper
[3:57:12.240 --> 3:57:17.440]  that I signed. Produce the note. Produce the note. Show me the piece of paper. And they'll say, oh,
[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:22.960]  no, that's been securitized and sent to London, Missouri, Tokyo. We don't have that piece of
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:30.320]  paper anymore. Well, then you can't foreclose. And any kind of an honest local judge who's
[3:57:30.320 --> 3:57:34.560]  got to get reelected will say, all right, if you don't produce the note, then the person can't
[3:57:34.560 --> 3:57:39.840]  get it. People have already been using that for five years to get out of many of these phony
[3:57:39.840 --> 3:57:46.160]  mortgages because it all is fraud. It was sold and turned in to derivatives. And I agree with
[3:57:46.160 --> 3:57:50.640]  you, Webster, we're between a rock and a hard place here. And I don't think all the school of
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:56.480]  the depression, right? The depression is a very cruel kind of educational process, but it is a
[3:57:56.480 --> 3:58:02.320]  school of life. And it teaches, I think fundamentally, class consciousness that bankers are one thing
[3:58:02.320 --> 3:58:10.720]  and you are something else. And any approach to the depression that doesn't say there are 500,000
[3:58:10.720 --> 3:58:16.320]  bankers and financier oligarchs in this country who have been the beneficiaries of the system,
[3:58:16.320 --> 3:58:20.400]  and their interests have got to be sacrificed because they're antithetical
[3:58:20.400 --> 3:58:25.360]  to the survival of humanity as a whole. So we can't have foreclosures. We can't have
[3:58:25.360 --> 3:58:30.800]  derivatives. There are all kinds of things to do to stop speculation. But then you've got to get the
[3:58:30.800 --> 3:58:35.840]  thing going in terms of federal lending, zero percent federal lending for production, and you've
[3:58:35.840 --> 3:58:40.720]  got to have your infrastructure programs and your science drivers. The problem is in closing,
[3:58:40.720 --> 3:58:45.600]  the feds are owned by offshore banks, so any money would always be gobbled by them. Webster,
[3:58:45.600 --> 3:58:49.520]  we'll talk to you again in the near future. Capital controls, capital controls and exchange
[3:58:49.520 --> 3:58:53.760]  controls. We're out of time. Webster, thank you so much for spending time with us. Congratulations
[3:58:53.760 --> 3:59:00.640]  on the new firm, Alex. Thank you, sir. You'll see it soon. All right, Webster Tarpoli's leaving us.
[3:59:00.640 --> 3:59:05.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I'm able to in the future, I'll tell you the type of dirty tricks
[3:59:05.200 --> 3:59:09.600]  that are going on. I can't get into that right now on air, but know this, the Obama deception will
[3:59:09.600 --> 3:59:15.520]  go out. God's will come hell or high water, as they say. And it could be out today, it could be
[3:59:15.520 --> 3:59:18.480]  out tomorrow, or if I'm able, I may wait until Sunday because I really want to put out some more
[3:59:18.480 --> 3:59:23.040]  of the trailers and build the excitement because that's what will have a bigger effect. Just know
[3:59:23.040 --> 3:59:27.120]  this, we are fighting and we need your prayers here, ladies and gentlemen, because we are going
[3:59:27.120 --> 3:59:31.520]  toe-to-toe up against the New World Order. I had Ron Paul on, a bunch of other powerful guests

[3:59:55.280 --> 3:59:59.600]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and
[3:59:59.600 --> 4:00:04.240]  water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread. You'll never
[4:00:04.240 --> 4:00:09.040]  have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[4:00:09.040 --> 4:00:13.440]  simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you. You know
