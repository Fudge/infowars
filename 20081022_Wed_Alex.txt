[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:24.840]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Wednesday the 22nd day
[00:24.840 --> 00:30.120]  of October 2008 we're going to be live here for the next four hours coming up later in the
[00:30.120 --> 00:35.560]  broadcast we're scheduled to have Willie Nelson on with us then Naomi Wolfe dealing with martial law
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.120]  in the United States and her book the end of America and then Lindsay Williams he said what two
[00:41.120 --> 00:46.360]  months ago on this radio show three months ago told Dr. Stan Monteef fellow Genesis talk show
[00:46.360 --> 00:51.800]  host behind the scenes three months ago even a month before he went public at oil prices we're
[00:51.800 --> 00:58.880]  going to drop down to about $55 a barrel in the next four to five months and it turns out he was
[00:58.880 --> 01:05.720]  right about that so amazing information from him but the top story today is we have Joe Biden
[01:05.720 --> 01:11.840]  Colin Powell the another former Secretary of State Marilyn Albright and many others the German
[01:11.840 --> 01:17.600]  president of the French president the British prime minister all coming out and saying there's
[01:17.600 --> 01:23.520]  going to be a terror attack in the near future now Albright saying it's going to be a terror attack
[01:23.520 --> 01:30.480]  Biden's talking about some type of challenge coming up in late January Powell saying on the
[01:30.480 --> 01:35.960]  21st 22nd 23rd they're even naming dates but they won't say what the crisis is some saying it's
[01:35.960 --> 01:41.320]  some are saying it's economic but foreign world leaders are saying it's going to be terrorist
[01:41.320 --> 01:46.760]  this is a big deal we have these individuals talking like this so I wanted to play a clip of
[01:46.760 --> 01:54.320]  Madeleine Albright on national television from CNN here it is what did you want to ask you what
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.840]  you thought of what Joe Biden said yesterday in terms of this idea that now senator obama if he
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.560]  becomes president will be tested by an international crisis within the first six months John McCain
[02:04.560 --> 02:10.120]  certainly picked up on that let's listen to what he said yesterday that senator obama is elected
[02:10.120 --> 02:17.920]  senator Biden said we will have an international crisis to test america's new president we don't
[02:17.920 --> 02:24.280]  want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis and
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.440]  americans are already fighting in two wars oh no sitting there with senator McCain thought about
[02:29.440 --> 02:34.000]  this Thomas what did you think about what I think it is it's just a statement of fact frankly and
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.760]  in my book I talk about the fact that there are a lot of big issues out there but that also
[02:39.760 --> 02:50.600]  something unexpected you always have to be prepared for that all right folks so there you
[02:50.600 --> 02:57.360]  have it I want to specifically go over Colin Powell's statements on meet the press Colin Powell
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.600]  warns of coming crisis we don't even know about right now story about Steve Watson and info wars
[03:02.600 --> 03:08.040]  net Colin Powell's made a bizarre comments that echo the recent declaration by democratic VP candidate
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.800]  Joe Biden that there will be an international crisis early in the Barack Obama's presidency that
[03:12.800 --> 03:19.160]  will test the new president by forcing him to make unpopular decisions what will those be
[03:19.160 --> 03:24.520]  speaking on meet the press a few days ago Powell officially endorsed Obama and also made the
[03:24.520 --> 03:31.240]  following cryptic statement and I quote the problems will always be there and there's going to be a
[03:31.240 --> 03:38.000]  crisis which will come along on the 21st 22nd of January I mean he's being so specific which
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.360]  would this even naming dates let me finish the quote the problems will always be there and there's
[03:43.360 --> 03:48.880]  going to be a crisis which will come along on the 21st 22nd of January that we don't even know
[03:48.880 --> 03:54.320]  about right now you don't know about it Powell but you're listing the dates so I think that the
[03:54.320 --> 04:00.400]  president has to start to do is to start using the power of the Oval Office and the power of his
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.040]  personality to convince the American people and convince the world that America is solid that
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.960]  America is going to move forward we are going to fix our problems we're going to meet our overseas
[04:10.960 --> 04:18.080]  obligations now that's into the clip up on info wars.net in this article in 235 two minutes 35
[04:18.080 --> 04:23.920]  seconds into it if you want to go watch that and later we're going to be playing that on air now
[04:23.920 --> 04:30.560]  now that suggests that it's going to be an economic crisis most the others are implying that it's
[04:30.560 --> 04:39.120]  going to be a military slash terrorist crisis so we'll see what happens one commenter in the story
[04:39.120 --> 04:45.720]  said Powell is saying the US will default on its debts on the 21st 22nd I agree with the person
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.200]  posting that is what it sounds like the problems will always be there and then he went on to say
[04:50.200 --> 04:57.680]  it'll be the 21st or 22nd of January so we'll come back and cover it to this vital question when
[04:57.680 --> 05:05.360]  we get back hi gasoline prices got you down is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to

[07:10.280 --> 07:15.400]  mainstream of events that contains the means to survive without outside support a place where you
[07:15.400 --> 07:22.520]  find shelter protection food water medicine and warmth you prepared for yourself it is defensible
[07:22.520 --> 07:27.920]  and is put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers will be Ragnar Benson also
[07:27.920 --> 07:34.960]  said why retreat this is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer if they
[07:34.960 --> 07:40.800]  could that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they are now they would
[07:40.800 --> 07:45.600]  also have to admit that they will need a retreat something completely impossible for the average

[08:08.400 --> 08:17.520]  alright ladies and gentlemen we've got Naomi Wolfe coming up in about 55 minutes from now she's
[08:17.520 --> 08:23.280]  written the best-selling book the end of America and she now sounds just like this talk show host
[08:23.840 --> 08:28.320]  very prominent in the progressive liberal community she's coming out talking about the plans for
[08:28.320 --> 08:33.200]  martial law in the United States and don't think that if John McCain or Barack Obama get elected
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.160]  this will stop they are literally controlled by the military industrial complex and she's going to be
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.840]  on talking about that today in fact she's valiantly explaining that we're under basically military
[08:43.840 --> 08:50.400]  control by the big offshore banks and so that's coming up in about an hour and then Lindsey
[08:50.400 --> 08:56.800]  Williams who worked as an executive in some of the largest oil companies in the US on their boards
[08:56.800 --> 09:04.800]  he told us three months ago the banks were going to lower the price of fuel of oil down to $60
[09:04.800 --> 09:09.600]  people laughed at him but he was right it happened what's behind that he'll be joining us in the
[09:09.600 --> 09:15.840]  fourth hour today but but without further ado for the rest of the hour I am extremely honored to be
[09:15.840 --> 09:24.560]  joined by my favorite country and western singer and one of my favorite movie stars as well but
[09:24.560 --> 09:30.320]  really who he is is my favorite humanitarian a person who is so down to earth and so decent
[09:30.320 --> 09:36.640]  involved in so many great causes that I share and that many others share Willie Nelson and
[09:36.640 --> 09:42.640]  Willie Nelson joins us from Texas Willie thank you for coming on today my pleasure good to be here
[09:42.640 --> 09:49.040]  I'm a little bit late I was uh I apologize for that but uh it's good to be with you how you
[09:49.040 --> 09:57.120]  doing Willie don't worry I only had three heart attacks I got hung up a little bit you know how
[09:57.120 --> 10:01.600]  that goes sir are you kidding I'm not one tenth as busy as you and I'm constantly forgetting
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.080]  interviews or getting the time zone wrong where you this is our fourth interview and you've always
[10:06.080 --> 10:13.440]  made it and that's just amazing Willie there is so much to talk about so much going on that is
[10:14.160 --> 10:21.680]  developing I mean I've got a big list of questions here that I want to go over with you but just
[10:21.680 --> 10:30.640]  out of the gauge how are you doing oh I'm doing good you know I'm I've got some some ideas and
[10:30.640 --> 10:39.280]  plans that I think maybe you and your listeners could help me with too so as we move along today
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.880]  I'd like to talk about some of that well I want to get into the bailout and I want to talk about
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.680]  the election and the wars and how we're still in Iraq and I want to talk about how farm aid
[10:49.680 --> 10:56.480]  went bigger than ever this year with Neil Young and others but let's go ahead now and talk about
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.840]  some of the things and some of the solutions that you've been coming up with let's talk
[11:01.840 --> 11:07.600]  about that first today Willie yeah well okay let's start out with the seven hundred billion dollars
[11:07.600 --> 11:15.520]  that you know we gave somebody I'm not sure who it was but whoever has it I would like and I have
[11:15.520 --> 11:23.200]  written a letter as president farm aid to whoever controls that money that we would like to have
[11:23.200 --> 11:31.680]  one billion dollars of that 700 and that would leave 699 for whatever they had planned but one
[11:31.680 --> 11:39.600]  billion dollars is I think all we'll need to turn the economy around if we start out taking care of
[11:39.600 --> 11:47.120]  our family farmers we could put 10 million farmers back on the land making a living out there raising
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.600]  food and fuel now that we can you know raise soybeans ethanol whatever they can grow out
[11:53.600 --> 12:00.880]  there we can use for both food and fuel and that one billion dollars I think would go a long way
[12:00.880 --> 12:09.440]  about changing our negative attitudes that we have and the confidence in ourselves and in our
[12:09.440 --> 12:16.480]  country right now I think if we invested stopped all the foreclosure period and then invested
[12:16.480 --> 12:22.480]  that one billion dollars back with our family farmers I think that we would begin to turn it
[12:22.480 --> 12:29.920]  around well Willie I mean you know of what you speak here you have been studying the family farm
[12:29.920 --> 12:34.080]  and and fighting for the family farm not just in the United States but worldwide
[12:34.080 --> 12:40.640]  for I know more than three decades and and you are uniquely uh suited to speak on this because
[12:40.640 --> 12:46.080]  you were born on a small family farm with a blacksmith shop with your grandfather and
[12:46.080 --> 12:53.520]  grandmother and family in north central Texas during the depression and in some of your songs
[12:53.520 --> 12:58.480]  and and a lot of your writings you've documented the fact that the big central banks are not our
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.320]  friends and that we have to get back to local community true sustainability and you have really
[13:04.320 --> 13:09.440]  put your money where your mouth is your time where your mouth is and and just done so much
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.560]  raising hundreds of millions of dollars through farm aid and and and other things you're doing
[13:14.560 --> 13:21.760]  for the family farm and and so can you speak from your unique perspective growing up you know living
[13:21.760 --> 13:27.040]  this life before you became the you know world renowned country music singer
[13:28.880 --> 13:36.160]  well thank you and also I believe that you know we could talk you know the rest of our lives about
[13:36.160 --> 13:42.720]  how we've got here because I think we know and we can put names and faces and places on most of
[13:42.720 --> 13:50.320]  the reasons but I think if we just say okay here we are let's go forward and then start thinking
[13:50.320 --> 13:56.640]  positive about everything uh and that's the first step in turning it around well I'll tell you what's
[13:56.640 --> 14:02.560]  positive I talked to multiple members of congress they got thousand to one phone calls against the
[14:02.560 --> 14:09.680]  banker takeover bill which is really five trillion dollars uh and so the good news is the American
[14:09.680 --> 14:16.560]  people are not buying in to the banker propaganda and so they may now be ready to hear some real
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.320]  solutions uh with that one billion dollars uh literal seed money to get the family farm it's
[14:22.320 --> 14:27.520]  nearing extinction jump started uh what are some of the ideas uh that you have willy to do that
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.400]  well first of all we put 10 million we stopped the foreclosures uh on the farms and also the
[14:34.400 --> 14:42.640]  houses because uh what has happened it's been a domino effect back when uh we had about eight or
[14:42.640 --> 14:50.240]  ten million family farmers uh on the land uh we were pretty good off economically because
[14:50.240 --> 14:56.800]  the agriculture is the bottom rung on the economic ladder and uh so everybody was doing fine that was
[14:56.800 --> 15:02.560]  back at the end of the war and then it was decided those eight million family farmers out there most
[15:02.560 --> 15:09.040]  of them democrats were just a little bit too much to handle politically so they decided uh and up
[15:09.040 --> 15:15.760]  until then they were offering all our raw producers in this country a 100 percent parity which is that
[15:15.760 --> 15:23.520]  they would pay for the cost and production of the whatever the producers had whether it was a farm
[15:23.520 --> 15:29.920]  a steel coal whatever it was they would pay 100 percent or parity and that was during the war
[15:29.920 --> 15:37.360]  when the war was over they stopped that process and decided okay we'll drop that to a 60 or 70
[15:38.240 --> 15:43.760]  percent sliding scale that way they took two million farmers off the land immediate
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.720]  well there's no doubt that the policies in the last 50 years have completely
[15:49.280 --> 15:54.960]  debased and decimated the family farm and ranch you know my family on my dad's side uh from uh
[15:54.960 --> 16:00.400]  north uh east texas my mother's side from right here in austin and in surrounding areas out in
[16:00.400 --> 16:06.960]  fredericksburg i mean i have lived in it as well not the extent you have and just seen the destruction
[16:07.520 --> 16:14.080]  of the family farms and the rise of big agribusiness which is now cramming all this gmo food down our
[16:14.080 --> 16:19.600]  throats and nafta and gat hasn't just destroyed the family farm and ranch here in the us it's also
[16:19.600 --> 16:26.480]  hurt mexico so uh we know these policies are bad and we know they're predatory uh and we know that
[16:26.480 --> 16:31.280]  you and many others have have come up with solutions and people go to willy nelson dot com
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.360]  you have put a lot of different documents research articles uh up there explaining this to people and
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.560]  showing folks the history so i want to challenge folks to go to willy nelson uh dot com and check
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.040]  out that material and you also have a lot of information up on the peace institute uh on a
[16:47.040 --> 16:52.720]  host of issues uh tying into this getting local control uh building back up our communities can
[16:52.720 --> 16:56.800]  you imagine willy if they gave the five trillion and they've already doled out over two trillion of
[16:56.800 --> 17:03.280]  that uh two foreign banks and then they're cutting off the currency the liquidity to the to main
[17:03.280 --> 17:08.160]  street and the family farm by design i have their documents they want everything to foreclose and
[17:08.160 --> 17:14.080]  implode and they can come back with all the money they've amassed and consolidate so uh i i mean i'm
[17:14.080 --> 17:18.480]  trying to be positive here but i mean to stop what's happening we've got to educate the public about
[17:18.480 --> 17:25.440]  who the real enemy is here who the real fox in the henhouse is that's right and uh and it's like
[17:25.440 --> 17:31.040]  obama said he said uh you know uh let's put out the fire now we'll figure out who started it later
[17:31.040 --> 17:37.280]  and uh that's pretty much what we have to do we have to stop the fire or have to stop the bleeding
[17:37.280 --> 17:42.400]  and uh i still think the best way to do that is from the ground up go back to our family farmer
[17:42.400 --> 17:47.760]  he's the one that uh started taking care of us in the beginning so let's let him do it again
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.480]  well i want to talk about biodiesel because i've really studied the issue a lot of my family works
[17:52.480 --> 17:58.400]  as petroleum geologist and farmers and also in refinery so i'm somewhat educated on it
[17:58.400 --> 18:04.240]  and i know that uh it was speculation and dollar devaluation that drove up oil they tried to blame
[18:04.240 --> 18:09.360]  it on on on some of the farmers you know having crossed the crop turned into ethanol which i'm
[18:09.360 --> 18:15.200]  for to a certain extent but they also tried to tie that into biodiesel those are two separate things
[18:15.200 --> 18:20.560]  i mean biodiesel uh which you're an expert in so i'd like you to speak to it that's using waste
[18:20.560 --> 18:24.960]  products that just basically get burned or thrown in the landfill or dumped down the drink can you
[18:24.960 --> 18:33.120]  explain the difference between the two well the the key words here are local sustainable
[18:33.120 --> 18:41.360]  agriculture if you raise it over here and you consume it next door then you save all the
[18:41.360 --> 18:48.400]  money that it costs for bringing in all your food all the fuel it costs to bring it in uh if you
[18:48.400 --> 18:55.280]  look at your breakfast in the morning most everything on that plate came from 1500 miles away
[18:55.280 --> 19:02.560]  so if you started it out with local sustainable
[19:06.320 --> 19:10.880]  we may have lost willy cell phone willy are you there no i'm still here i just sounded like

[23:59.600 --> 24:06.720]  but we will and go to the man himself willy nelson i'm just so glad in my little life that i've
[24:06.720 --> 24:12.400]  crossed paths with willy nelson and get to share a little bit of his precious time he is a just a
[24:12.400 --> 24:16.800]  precious person we have a lot of celebrities on the show people know that i don't get all all uh
[24:17.920 --> 24:21.760]  all sappy here but but he really is a great humanitarian and we're honored to have him
[24:21.760 --> 24:26.560]  willy nelson dot com is the website okay willy when we got cut off by the ice cream music
[24:28.240 --> 24:33.760]  earlier actually russian tech knows what it is uh we were getting into the difference between
[24:33.760 --> 24:40.560]  biodiesel and ethanol but at the end of the day you've you've grown corn for fuel saves farmers
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.160]  i'm all for it you know i think it was the greedy oil companies trying to demonize that
[24:44.160 --> 24:49.600]  because they want a monopoly but but but explain us the difference willy well i think mainly the
[24:49.600 --> 24:56.560]  difference is local sustainable if you keep it local uh then you keep the foreign market out of
[24:56.560 --> 25:02.800]  it and there's not trillions of dollars going back and forth and and and the farmer losing control
[25:02.800 --> 25:09.360]  and the consumer losing all the benefits of having it there local sustainable organic food is the
[25:09.360 --> 25:14.240]  future and it's just one you want to start you know is that's just where we go on that's where
[25:14.240 --> 25:20.560]  we're going to our economy is forcing us to go back to the basics which we go back to growing
[25:20.560 --> 25:28.240]  our food period uh try to have some clean water around period and it's down to survival again
[25:28.240 --> 25:36.160]  and i think a lot of people are facing that right now well willy i mean you're absolutely right
[25:36.160 --> 25:40.480]  it's down to survival because they're the big monsanto and two other companies are buying up all
[25:40.480 --> 25:45.520]  the heirloom seeds their terminator genetics is spreading into all the other major seed crops
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.480]  they've infected uh almost a hundred percent of the mexican corn varieties that go back over 10
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.320]  thousand years i mean we have to uh get back into heirloom seeds and start having our own gardens i
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.680]  know i have one wherever i live i mean we're meant as humans to be out there in the mud and dirt and
[26:01.680 --> 26:08.320]  children love it i mean i and we are seeing a reawakening an explosion of of of community farms
[26:08.320 --> 26:14.080]  small uh gardens and i think a lot of that's thanks to you and others spread the word well and
[26:14.080 --> 26:20.800]  there's so many young people out there that know what we're talking about who are already growing
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.680]  things in places that uh their parents or grandparents never thought would grow they
[26:25.680 --> 26:31.840]  grow on roofs of apartment buildings in new york city and and philadelphia they grow in vacant
[26:31.840 --> 26:39.360]  lots they have found places to grow food uh because they saw the necessity of it and it was uh you
[26:39.360 --> 26:45.200]  know the necessity is the mother of invention if it's really needed badly enough somebody will
[26:45.200 --> 26:51.600]  come up with a way to do it and local organic sustainable food is uh is where we're going
[26:51.600 --> 26:58.080]  well absolutely and then we have the revolution of solar the revolution of wind these are real
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.680]  local solutions and we have these atmospheric water generators that give you the cleanest
[27:03.680 --> 27:08.080]  water out there and willie i just now got into this and i discovered that you've been in this
[27:08.080 --> 27:13.280]  for years tell us about uh the atmospheric water generator that you've uh lent your name to i mean
[27:13.280 --> 27:19.200]  you talk about getting off the grid this is incredible well amazingly enough i found out
[27:19.200 --> 27:25.600]  just a little while ago that the inventor of this water machine uh is over here in marbles
[27:25.600 --> 27:34.240]  stalls uh and he invented it in 1984 so and i only found out about it a couple years ago and uh
[27:34.240 --> 27:40.800]  when i found out about it it was a company in canada and california which uh it's an amazing
[27:40.800 --> 27:47.600]  machine because you plug it in it looks like a office water machine without the top without the
[27:47.600 --> 27:53.600]  jug of water on the top and you plug it in today and tomorrow this time you got six
[27:54.400 --> 28:00.720]  gallons of pure fresh drinking water that came right out of the air i don't have the the website
[28:00.720 --> 28:06.160]  in front of me but i know the machine's called the willie nelson water from air machine people can

[28:22.320 --> 28:29.200]  that is the key that is real sustainability it sure is and now when you you know throw up a
[28:29.200 --> 28:33.760]  house out there somewhere you don't have to dig a well all you need is one of the some electricity
[28:33.760 --> 28:38.640]  a generator or whatever you plug in one of these machines and they've got them all sizes where you
[28:38.640 --> 28:46.640]  can make the gallons a day or you can make 2,500 gallons a day 5,000 gallons a day to have them
[28:46.640 --> 28:54.560]  up to i think 18,000 gallons but this is the water uh the 18,000 gallon one i think is not

[32:44.720 --> 32:50.480]  joins us talk about what the military industrial complex is up to and the positive solution
[32:50.480 --> 32:55.280]  to expose that so people understand the agenda so they can't carry it out and the good news is
[32:55.280 --> 32:59.520]  and all the polls and the troops i've talked to on the street they are with us against this corrupt
[32:59.520 --> 33:06.560]  world banking system and so that is the good news willy nelson there are so many other things
[33:07.120 --> 33:13.760]  going on in this country that need to be addressed but during the break we were talking about
[33:13.760 --> 33:19.520]  more positive solutions what are other positive things that you and folks you're working with
[33:19.520 --> 33:28.800]  are trying to do to make the world a better place well i think probably most of the things we do
[33:28.800 --> 33:34.960]  and you do we just do subconsciously because that's the way we think whatever we do at the
[33:34.960 --> 33:39.120]  moment anything that we can do to promote peace we should do it we should talk about
[33:39.120 --> 33:46.880]  uh how peace is more prosperous to us than war war only benefits one or two percent
[33:47.440 --> 33:54.800]  uh but peace you know it we are the biggest i guess uh bullet bomb maker in the world arms
[33:54.800 --> 34:00.240]  dealing is what we do best i guess produce half the weapons in the world young yeah so uh
[34:01.280 --> 34:06.160]  you know there's a lot of people who think we start wars and then sell bullets and bombs to both
[34:06.160 --> 34:13.040]  sides and uh i can see how uh a guy with an evil intent would think that way
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.960]  absolutely but i mean the war is unpopular over 75 percent of the american people wanted to end
[34:20.960 --> 34:27.760]  we're almost six years into it uh and i looks like barack obama is going to win i i certainly hope
[34:27.760 --> 34:35.760]  that he ends it as he said he will do but um he also said he was going to end the wiretapping but
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.400]  then voted for it so um i'm not holding my breath but i i i guess like you said we can just keep
[34:42.400 --> 34:48.240]  pushing for it and hope it happens yeah that's the only thing we can do is just to uh get that
[34:48.240 --> 34:54.320]  good positive picture in in our minds i think you uh it you know as simple as it sounds just
[34:54.320 --> 34:58.560]  like the golf swing you got to visualize it in the that's what we have to do
[34:58.560 --> 35:07.440]  willy we have this event coming up sunday and it's special for a lot of reasons uh and because a lot
[35:07.440 --> 35:11.120]  of people around the world in the country can't be there we're going to be streaming it thanks to
[35:11.120 --> 35:17.040]  you uh doing that free over the internet it'll be linked up at info wars dot com and truth news

[35:41.520 --> 35:50.480]  and uh uh in my opinion he's in my opinion he's uh one of the the best music promoters uh managers
[35:50.480 --> 35:56.560]  of uh bars places where people come for entertainment uh you know that i've been around and i've been
[35:56.560 --> 36:02.960]  around a lot of good promoters and uh i like the way you can depend on what he says uh we went from
[36:02.960 --> 36:12.560]  castle creek to uh several different other places that music hall and backyard uh i think uh whatever
[36:12.560 --> 36:19.040]  tim wants to do i'm all for it you know well that's going to be an amazing event with willy
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.080]  nelson jesse ventura alex jones and i know jimmy vaughn's coming uh just a whole bunch of other
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.040]  great people are going to be there willy yeah i hear johnny knock will might show up and uh
[36:30.400 --> 36:36.080]  you know he is the piece of work and uh i don't know if you've ever met him or not but you should
[36:37.360 --> 36:45.520]  no i haven't met him but i um look forward to meeting him uh at the event um some of the other
[36:45.520 --> 36:52.560]  issues dealing with solutions let's get into farm aid how long have you been doing farm aid and and
[36:52.560 --> 36:58.240]  what are some of the things that uh farm aid is focusing in on uh what you guys focus in on this
[36:58.240 --> 37:04.160]  year well it's still a local sustainable agriculture uh you know the first farm aid was
[37:04.160 --> 37:16.160]  i think 1984 and uh it came about i was in chicago or st louis maybe and uh it was the state fair
[37:16.960 --> 37:23.120]  and me and big big jim thomas the governor had sort of a ritual every year when i'd come play
[37:23.120 --> 37:30.480]  the state fair we'd have a bowl of chili and a beer on the bus and uh we were talking about how
[37:30.480 --> 37:38.480]  how bad the uh farmer was was getting it and uh how he used to do pretty good but now the farmers
[37:38.480 --> 37:45.520]  are we're losing them at an alarming rate and we decided that we would do the first farm aid so
[37:46.080 --> 37:53.200]  um hats off to big jim for helping us do that i think 21 days later champagne illinois when we
[37:53.200 --> 38:01.360]  had the first farm aid willy i know you don't like talking about yourself but but people that know
[38:01.360 --> 38:06.800]  you know what a kind general real person i've talked a lot of celebrities who've met you and
[38:06.800 --> 38:11.760]  know you or friends with you over the years and they say willy nelson is the most down to earth
[38:11.760 --> 38:17.040]  real person that you'll find fame and fortune and being a global icon there aren't many and you're
[38:17.040 --> 38:23.760]  one of them uh not just of music but just of culture period changes a lot of people um
[38:24.560 --> 38:29.760]  and i mean you have so many people who i wouldn't even call fans they just really appreciate who
[38:29.760 --> 38:36.640]  you are and love who you are i mean talk about yourself a little bit growing up and and uh
[38:36.640 --> 38:42.160]  your metamorphosis uh i mean were you always the centered always uh this calm you know you're
[38:42.160 --> 38:48.400]  somebody who uh you know wrote a whole bunch of the famous patsy client songs and songs that
[38:48.400 --> 38:53.680]  elvis and everybody else sung and and would sell them for 25 you know 50 dollars uh you know you've
[38:53.680 --> 38:58.880]  been a radio talk show host dj you didn't get uh though you had all those huge account all those
[38:58.880 --> 39:05.920]  huge accomplishments the real fame until the 70s uh and then it's just built from there i mean was
[39:05.920 --> 39:12.160]  it the fact that uh fame came later in life uh that helped you stay centered and not have it go to
[39:12.160 --> 39:18.480]  your head uh i mean that's a lot there i threw out but i'm for folks out there trying to understand
[39:18.480 --> 39:24.480]  you know the person willy nelson and so many people that you know have you as a role model uh
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.280]  you know how did you grow uh what's the core of willy nelson and what advice would you give people
[39:29.280 --> 39:36.240]  about philosophy of life well first of all come from abatex is a little farm in ranch town and i
[39:36.240 --> 39:42.880]  found out real early that farming was hard ranting was a little easier so that was one of the first
[39:42.880 --> 39:49.600]  lessons that i learned and uh also learned by hanging out with the farmers and ranchers and
[39:49.600 --> 39:56.960]  local folks there at habit that uh a town survived by taking care of itself and the farmers were the
[39:56.960 --> 40:03.840]  ones who sustained us they grew our cotton and corn and i learned a lot from the guys who you know
[40:03.840 --> 40:12.000]  who grew things and uh throughout the years i think i can say that i owe a lot uh to habit and the
[40:12.000 --> 40:20.240]  education that i got just growing up there but continuing through your life i mean what was it
[40:20.240 --> 40:26.880]  like uh seeing song after song you wrote being number one hits and you know the fact that you
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.680]  just uh i mean that's true that you sold what won a patsy clines biggest hits for 50 bucks or was
[40:31.680 --> 40:38.400]  it a hundred now uh actually what i when i start out writing poems when i was five or six years old
[40:38.400 --> 40:45.280]  and then i learned to play guitar uh my grandparents raised me and i learned and and we learned
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.520]  me and my sister learned the music real early uh i would learn a lot from her but i would play the
[40:51.520 --> 40:58.320]  guitar and write songs and uh and then i got up i was working on the farm i was making
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.800]  very little money out at bayland hay picking cotton uh and saturdays i'd go down and shine
[41:04.800 --> 41:13.840]  shoes at the barbershop and uh also had my guitar there so i'd sing a song so i started out playing
[41:13.840 --> 41:22.000]  so music has always been you know a big part of what i did and uh i still is didn't your grandmother
[41:22.000 --> 41:31.840]  order uh a uh you know self-taught catalog or or or book on guitar playing uh through the mail
[41:31.840 --> 41:38.080]  and and and and that basically you were somewhat self-taught pretty much uh i learned a few chords
[41:38.080 --> 41:45.280]  and uh by playing with uh uh sister bobby i would sit on the piano stool next to her and she would
[41:45.280 --> 41:53.200]  play as she read the music and i would learn the chords that way uh i do know that uh you know i was
[41:53.200 --> 42:00.480]  making a couple of dollars a day picking cotton and one night i went out with uh the recheck band
[42:00.480 --> 42:09.440]  and i made eight dollars playing the guitar so that was my first big success story now is it
[42:09.440 --> 42:18.400]  true that you you got on the radio when you were uh 13 years old yeah k hbr hillsborough uh me and
[42:18.400 --> 42:25.520]  my sister and her husband time and uh my football coach who played uh long we had a radio show up
[42:25.520 --> 42:33.840]  there on saturday that's amazing willy um so i mean i think it's safe to say you've probably
[42:33.840 --> 42:44.480]  lived one of already in so much more ahead of you a full life but yeah i think you could
[42:44.480 --> 42:49.200]  easily say that you know there's that song uh that johnny cash and others have sung i've been
[42:49.200 --> 42:56.560]  everywhere man uh do you think you've you've probably been more places than johnny cash well i don't
[42:56.560 --> 43:02.880]  know about that but i you know we that's what we do we travel and we've been to most places
[43:02.880 --> 43:13.360]  once and uh a lot of them several times what's your favorite venue to play do you have one
[43:13.360 --> 43:22.960]  on it yeah i do there is a place in morrison colorado uh red rock amplitude uh it's an incredible
[43:22.960 --> 43:31.680]  place to play uh and then naturally after that uh then places around austin uh through the years
[43:31.680 --> 43:38.320]  that i love mainly because of the crowds but it's been used as far as venues are concerned the
[43:38.320 --> 43:44.320]  red rock amplitude i think is the best one welly when did you move to austin
[43:48.400 --> 43:59.040]  i had been coming here for years uh playing music and uh my sister had moved here and i
[43:59.040 --> 44:07.600]  had planned on this was uh this is way back there from the think of it when uh uh we were going to
[44:07.600 --> 44:14.000]  get an apartment in houston or buy a condo or something and then i drove up to austin to visit
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.760]  with my sister and that's when i decided that this was really the place where i wanted to be
[44:20.800 --> 44:28.480]  but the year had to be what 75 i guess well i tell you and willy nelson and austin sure
[44:28.480 --> 44:36.240]  went together well didn't they all it was yeah uh you know the university is here at daryl royal
[44:36.240 --> 44:43.040]  is here uh you know joji male come up a lot and we were just had a a lot of fun uh just
[44:43.040 --> 44:50.160]  listening to the music and going to football games uh those were great times back in austin in those
[44:50.160 --> 44:57.360]  days amazing um my grandparents of course lived in austin we've come down here and visit from
[44:57.360 --> 45:02.000]  dalis when i was a little kid we and then i moved here in high school and i remember always telling
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  my parents i want to live in austin i want to live in austin it's a it's a lot i'm not bashing
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.000]  dalis it's just austin is such a great place boy it sure has grown hadn't it willy uh yeah it has
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.640]  out here where i live uh it's amazing how it's it's built up out here well look at the backyard i
[45:18.640 --> 45:23.200]  mean that you should overlook the hills and now there's a big shopping mall around it right that's
[45:23.200 --> 45:30.000]  right i guess that's one of the reasons that they're having to move well it's a historic final uh final
[45:30.000 --> 45:37.520]  event at the backyard i'm i'm told tim is uh sad about that but i guess all good things as my
[45:37.520 --> 45:43.760]  grandma used to say unfortunately come to an end but there'll be a new one him is a soldier you know
[45:43.760 --> 45:49.040]  in uh you know he likes to uh you know what good is a soldier without a good war so tim likes to get
[45:49.040 --> 45:55.040]  out there and mix it up with the folks i guarantee you he'll he'll come out uh on top on this one
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.000]  he'll have him another spot over there that's just as good absolutely in fact uh bigger and
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.600]  just as pretty there in the hills willy i want to get into some serious issues the last 15 minutes
[46:05.600 --> 46:10.080]  or so that we've got left with you but right now i mean i know you don't like talking about yourself
[46:10.080 --> 46:14.800]  but people want to hear from you and they want to hear about you um you are prolific i mean you're
[46:14.800 --> 46:21.280]  just into all sorts of businesses and charities and events and and and causes and are just so
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.280]  accessible for somebody of your you know highest uh you know caliber uh in the culture uh you've
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.000]  written quite a few books and you wrote the towel of willy with a great guy uh who i've gotten to
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.880]  know separately uh through some movies i've been in with him uh that's turk pipkin and then he wrote
[46:36.880 --> 46:40.800]  the towel of willy with you about your philosophy that we were just getting into earlier that really
[46:40.800 --> 46:46.240]  gets into that but you've got a new book out you've done a uh fiction book tell tell us about
[46:46.240 --> 46:51.680]  a tale of luck or a tale out of luck well honestly there's a writer his name is mike
[46:51.680 --> 46:59.520]  blake lee he's a great guy from texas and writes a lot of uh uh good western lore and a real cowboy
[46:59.520 --> 47:08.800]  and knows the lingo uh when they asked me to write this book called tales out of luck and you know
[47:08.800 --> 47:17.440]  they had uh in mind uh the book and then a movie and et cetera and uh i know my qualification so i
[47:17.440 --> 47:24.160]  was glad mike blake lee was here i gave him some ideas and we talked and he went away and wrote the
[47:24.160 --> 47:30.000]  book and so we had to give him all the credit well it's been getting great reviews tell folks
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.880]  about the basic storyline for people that might want to read it well basically you know it's
[47:34.880 --> 47:40.400]  pretty much like a real life it's about a guy who has a bunch of horses and uh
[47:41.040 --> 47:46.080]  it's you know there's uh i think the difference is that when you know the stories there's
[47:46.080 --> 47:54.480]  some few indians involved and a few thieves and crooks and uh so it's a well written story and
[47:55.840 --> 48:00.080]  even just the way it starts out once you get into the first chapter you know
[48:00.080 --> 48:08.320]  well the uh shifting gears into some really serious issues we're dealing with
[48:08.880 --> 48:12.640]  and because last time you you were bringing it up on your own and then i kind of glazed over
[48:12.640 --> 48:17.040]  and moved on to the next question you've seen my film terror storm you've seen my film in game for
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.280]  bluebird a blueprint for global enslavement dealing with the belterberg group and the the
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.680]  global elite uh and and of course over the years you told me you'd seen some of my tv shows and
[48:25.680 --> 48:32.240]  heard the radio show overall you know positively waking up and getting communities involved and
[48:32.240 --> 48:38.480]  decentralizing if we can be local and and have local control that will short circuit
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.320]  these internationalists but a big part of the solution is identifying them uh
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.440]  you mean watching in game or or you know seeing these global elites meeting in secret and setting
[48:47.440 --> 48:52.560]  world policy what was your take on those two films and of course on government sponsored terrorism
[48:52.560 --> 49:00.320]  itself well i thought it was very important work that you did and uh uh that needed to
[49:00.320 --> 49:06.080]  be out there people need to know what happened uh and i think all of the things that uh that
[49:06.080 --> 49:09.840]  that i've read that you've done and that i listened to hear you talking about are things
[49:09.840 --> 49:17.280]  that people need to know so uh that you know that's why i'm glad to be uh on your program
[49:17.280 --> 49:23.360]  so we can both talk about things that together i think we can come up with more ideas and throw
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.720]  them out there and let the people give us some feedback and let's talk about farmers let's talk
[49:28.720 --> 49:36.320]  about local or sustainable agriculture and i think we can turn it around just by talking and not
[49:36.320 --> 49:43.840]  having some solutions from the old joke if there is no solution then there is no problem well uh
[49:43.840 --> 49:47.520]  we're going to break here in a moment and come back with two final little segments for 10 minutes
[49:47.520 --> 49:53.280]  uh with willy nelson but i'm going to talk to willy about uh why he took the plunge for 9 11

[53:32.960 --> 53:37.520]  willy nelson is our guest bottom line willy i've talked to a lot of people that have known
[53:37.520 --> 53:42.720]  you for decades here in austin people that worked with you you know ask him what makes willy nelson
[53:42.720 --> 53:48.800]  tick because people i admire i you know i want to emulate him i want to know who they are i want
[53:48.800 --> 53:54.960]  to understand them so i can be a better person because i don't claim to be as calm or nicer
[53:54.960 --> 53:58.960]  you know is is is freewheeling people go after me do bad things to me i tend to
[53:58.960 --> 54:02.880]  i try to control myself but i tend to want to you know go after him or whatever and i noticed
[54:02.880 --> 54:09.120]  that in your philosophy that you found hey it's just better to you know you know be loving be nice
[54:09.120 --> 54:15.760]  i mean bottom line what that philosophy has really held you in good stead and i kind of asked the
[54:15.760 --> 54:20.160]  question earlier but you didn't fully answer it i mean have you always been this way or did this
[54:20.160 --> 54:30.800]  develop willy no it's kind of like my grandmother said a hard head makes a sore ass i went through
[54:32.080 --> 54:37.840]  i went through some times where you know i felt like that i knew better than everybody and it
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.840]  took a while for me to realize that i was smart as i thought i was you know that i mean that old
[54:43.840 --> 54:48.080]  cliche is true the older i get the more i know i don't know anything that's right
[54:51.760 --> 54:56.240]  willy 9 11 truth i mean you had to know when you went on this show it started speaking out
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.640]  saying that you believe they blew the towers up and it was an inside job that that you were
[55:00.640 --> 55:05.120]  going to get heat and talking to people that know you they say that when you know something serious
[55:05.120 --> 55:09.920]  and it affects the community and it's important to expose it that that that that you know that
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.800]  it's your job basically to to shake things up and to put yourself on the line i mean did you
[55:14.800 --> 55:19.200]  think about it before you went public for 9 11 truth or or did you just know that it was an
[55:19.200 --> 55:26.160]  inside job and do it well it just was too obvious uh that that it was the inside i think i've seen
[55:26.160 --> 55:33.520]  things implode before i'm going uh so uh i couldn't see any reason to act like that didn't happen
[55:33.520 --> 55:41.440]  because it did happen and that's what i think happened and uh i should i worry about what
[55:41.440 --> 55:48.240]  somebody else thinks about what i think well there's so many declassified government documents
[55:48.240 --> 55:52.000]  that are public where criminal elements of our government other governments have staged other
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.960]  terror attacks before i think that's the strongest evidence right there is that it's admitted
[55:56.960 --> 56:00.640]  gulf of tonkin and so many other events were staged i mean that's the first question we
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.720]  should ask whenever something happens that allows the good old boys the establishment to take more
[56:04.720 --> 56:11.840]  freedom yeah and you have to admit that there are people in the world who will do anything
[56:13.120 --> 56:20.960]  period you know william the past i hated those people and as soon as i turned loose and stopped
[56:20.960 --> 56:25.200]  hating on a few years ago and really want to i want to stop them i want to resist them i'm
[56:25.200 --> 56:29.600]  going to fight them but i don't hate them i really feel sorry for them and realize they're really
[56:29.600 --> 56:34.800]  screwed up bad people uh that that that that took a weight off me i mean is that kind of the
[56:34.800 --> 56:42.800]  philosophy you discovered well yeah it goes back to the law of karma uh there is a cause and effect
[56:42.800 --> 56:52.320]  and uh whatever you do you'll get back uh whether it's a good bad uh whatever so you sort of uh
[56:52.320 --> 56:58.640]  plan your own future that way one daughter one action time and i've seen it happen so many times

[1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:19.520]  and you were trying to say something as we went to break willy oh i uh probably wasn't important
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:26.400]  i think that's another secret willy you don't uh you don't take yourself too seriously but uh
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:31.040]  but you know you you are a pretty serious person when it comes down to the bottom line and and
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:35.840]  and in closing we were talking during the break about a solution what if my millions of listeners
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:40.080]  who aren't just millions of listeners but the best most active people out there guest after
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:46.960]  guest have said that what if we sicked them in a good way on a solution to contact congress the
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:51.600]  media and say look don't give the trillions of dollars to the private offshore banks
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:57.520]  who've cut off liquidity not just a billion what have we said take a hundred billion of that
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:02.800]  with the plan that willy nelson and experts he's worked with have devised uh and and and gave that
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:07.680]  to the farmers to try to resuscitate uh them willy talk about that solution talk about your
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:13.360]  peace institute and and and how people can get involved well you know first of all you know i
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:17.920]  was asking for a billion but i think a hundred billion is better i like your math math better
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:24.560]  than mine and i guarantee you it's needed and it would go to the right cause uh as far as peace
[1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:31.520]  research institute that's uh a website that i set up a little while back with a couple of great
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:38.480]  folks who take care of it for me and i wrote a song called peaceful solution and uh sort of gave it
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:44.320]  to everybody to write their own versions of it and there's been i guess maybe 200 different versions
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:53.040]  of that song recorded video now so uh there are a whole lot of people who realize that we you know
[1:01:53.040 --> 1:02:01.280]  it's very will be peace on earth that's uh that's been the promise and i think anybody who believes
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:09.200]  uh and uh anything positive has to think that way it goes what a peaceful solution a peace
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:14.480]  revolution let's take america back it is that right or am i butchering that there is the

[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:32.400]  breaking down the whole police state build up that we've seen in army brigades not just one
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.880]  they list others just a new ones being activated under north com and finally when she talked about
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:43.360]  it we've been talking about it a long time it did get a lot of international and national attention

[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:59.760]  kindly have been supporting our talking again i'm just delighted oh it's great to have you here
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:06.080]  and especially for close to two hours out of the gates you're awakening to the 10 steps of fascism
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:13.520]  and maybe briefly go over a few of those and then with horror the open end of posse common
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:20.480]  taught us the military warfare drills admitting that it's for domestic operations civil unrest
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.640]  they've been gearing up for this for quite a long time and you've certainly been raising the alarm
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:33.440]  bells so please go over that Naomi wolf sure thank you um wow it's a lot let's see where do i
[1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:40.640]  begin you're you're quite uh right to you know to mention our last conversation uh it was about
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  the last book i brought out which did in fact for people who aren't familiar with the argument
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:49.600]  that probably most are um because it won't be such new news to your community as it is to you know
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:54.960]  many other people it i was uh arguing that there are these 10 sort of classic steps that you always
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:01.360]  see um when a would be dictator is seeking to close down an open society to crush a democracy
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:07.680]  or to crush a democracy movement and that we're seeing those in america so um and then my my
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:12.240]  my new book that sequel to that is called give me liberty um and it's sort of what we do about it
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:16.480]  it's action steps we can take and calling on the founder's vision for what we're supposed to do in
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:24.400]  a time of crisis like this but um step eight nine and ten are really accelerating uh you know i said
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:29.840]  last fall and i've been saying for months and it's not that i'm so smart it's that this blueprint is
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:34.720]  so very predictive i've been saying since last fall as you may remember you know we're gonna be
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:38.880]  within six months we're gonna be seeing mass arrests and we had those in march i said you're
[1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:44.000]  gonna start seeing journalists being arrested and journalists were swept up in preemptive brutal
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:50.720]  arrests at the rnc and st paul and i said you're gonna see steps making it easier for the step
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:56.800]  ten for the leader to declare martial law and by the way we did even see amy goodman arrested
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:01.920]  i had reporters there richard reeves and george butler who reported for us and they were there
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:06.320]  and they said no one would touch the police in most the cases no one would even dump over a trash can
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:10.640]  they would just scoop everyone up they would taser people rubber bullet them they would spray
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:15.840]  things on them and take them to jail and then charge them under state statutes of terrorism
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:20.560]  yeah it's i mean it's unbelievable i mean i i maybe should address that before i get to the
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:26.240]  first brigade you know there's footage that we've got um they've made a movie at the end of america
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:31.680]  and it was just released yesterday free online thanks largely to your advice by the way alex
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:37.040]  and um we've got footage that is so chilling you know very few americans have seen what actually
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:42.080]  happened in this military st paul where millions of dollars of homeland security money was pumped
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:47.680]  as it is across the country now pumped into local police forces agents training police
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:54.080]  agents infiltrating um and other reporters like michael angelo senior really a very respected
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:14:58.160]  reporter here in new york said that you know he was stopped by people who had no identification
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:02.640]  at all people in like dark blue jumpsuit who you couldn't tell are they police are they black water
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:08.800]  are they mercenary are they americans are they you know not americans um but anyway uh they were
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:13.520]  there's a terrifying footage of just as you say alex people sitting quietly in the sun
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:19.600]  not doing anything being surrounded by these you know heavily armed militarized police
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:24.400]  and then being told you're all under arrest and then just as you say and by the way this footage
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:29.280]  only survived because this young person buried it in the ground so he could come back after
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:34.160]  his arrest and retrieve it whereas the the most scary thing as a reporter i heard is that no
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:39.360]  other footage really survived that's any you know that's that good because um the police were
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:44.000]  exposing people's uh film or i'm sorry they don't do that anymore um you know ruining people's
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:50.240]  documentation equipment um yeah they had to be they had demagnetizers out oh my god see you're
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:55.360]  always six steps ahead of me alex no i'm not but but i'm a magnetizer but but i mean Naomi the
[1:15:55.360 --> 1:16:00.720]  bottom line here is well it's what they use in film production um but with the new video tapes
[1:16:00.720 --> 1:16:07.600]  or disc it's uh it's got a handle and it goes me and then it just shoots the the the waves
[1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:14.160]  through it and then and then erase it and then also happened at the RNC uh in 2004 in new york
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.240]  to a bunch of reporters or they would just never give the cameras or video tapes or memory sticks
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:22.800]  back but but since you mentioned it about two months ago blackwater was photographed in LA
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:32.160]  in san diego uh in raids on on medical marijuana facilities and then two weeks ago i saw multiple
[1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:38.800]  articles of blackwater aiding local law enforcement infugitive hunts just google blackwater age
[1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:44.320]  sheriff's department infugitive hunts so oh my god so now we see it happening not just in new
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:50.960]  orleans uh but but but now all over the country it's i just wanted to back you up there thank you i
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:56.800]  mean well that's certainly terrifying and i have to wrap my brain around that um but so you're right
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:03.440]  about the militarized RNC but that isn't enough apparently because um what the what happened
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:09.680]  on october 1st is essentially a coup has taken place uh you know in practice even though uh
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:14.560]  rove is very brilliant and having it be kind of a coup by inches like it's a stealth coup but it could
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:19.520]  i i say without retort you know rhetorical flourish that a coup has taken place alex because
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:24.640]  the first brigade of the third infantry division which is three to five thousand soldiers was
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:32.960]  redeployed from iraq to somewhere in united states and this is um you know a violation of 200 years
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:40.240]  of laws from the insurrection act of 1807 to the posse comitatus act of um 1879 that have protected
[1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:46.880]  us as americans from soldiers being deployed to do civilian policing and the army times report the
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:52.880]  initial report said they are here their mission is crowd control and these are the people who were
[1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:57.840]  responsible for crowd control in beluga you know they're armed with tasers and rubber bullets
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:03.120]  they had quotes from people who were tasered in exercises it seems like an odd kind of quote
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:08.560]  and they also said we hope we don't have to shoot americans that was a cryptic quote but but but
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:13.600]  they owe me the key was who way where do i find that you're you're ahead of me where where was
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:18.720]  that reported that was originally in there and they took it out army times yes but listen my god at
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:23.680]  the bottom of the article and they took that off too but we have printed copies they listed the other
[1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:32.960]  units already here that they're aiding and we ran into those groups in my uh in 98 99 2000 in texas
[1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:38.000]  and they would come up and tell us turn your cameras off so this is just one public brigade
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:46.080]  we're hearing about there's a much larger contingent oh god well okay so when citizens so i just need

[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:59.040]  police state to the takeover police state three total enslavement now we got secret documents
[1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:04.480]  documents because the fbi at a checkpoint where the regular army was illegally searching vehicles
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:10.080]  they gave us the classified documents with the cover story for local media stapled to the top
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:16.480]  we posted them up on info wars dot com the headline was written by ed homen for info wars dot com
[1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:22.720]  and in in thanksgiving of 1998 was it's marshal law and it's a three on the rector scale
[1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:28.160]  we're explaining how it was over time creeping how under the name of bomb disposal that's what
[1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:33.840]  the media is told but on the subsheets this is in police state to the takeover you go see the
[1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:39.680]  documents there with phone numbers it said we are in warrants service law enforcement the regular
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:45.440]  army will aid you for anything not just bomb disposal their front is bomb disposal and now
[1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:50.720]  you notice the commander of the brigade countered Naomi wolfe i wanted to tell that story right now
[1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:56.240]  he countered her and said oh we're just bomb disposal they also say the jaws of life oh the
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:25:02.400]  armies here just to help get you out of a wrecked car so see that's the pr front Naomi wolfe tell us
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:08.560]  how he tried to counter you well it wasn't my memory that they said bomb disposal although i
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:16.400]  have to say i was so shocked that the you know that the head of that brigade took the trouble to
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:21.280]  rebut you know my ordinary citizens questions about who are these people and why are they deployed
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:26.720]  that i was taken aback but you can go to the today show transcript and see my memory is that he said
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:32.240]  oh we're here to help communities affected by weapons of mass destruction which raises plenty
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.280]  of questions itself you know but again i've been reaching out to to friends at the new york times
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:41.520]  in the philadelphia choir maybe this doesn't shock you as much as it shocks me but i am in shock
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:46.720]  saying where is your reporting on this and they said there's nothing on the wire services um you
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:51.200]  know the new times said the off the record or on background that they're investigating but they obviously
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:55.360]  haven't reported anything yet so i'm in a position where citizens are coming to me saying Naomi where
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:26:00.400]  is the first brigade what's their mission and uh you know i can't tell them where they are and i
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:06.320]  know that the latest spin the latest pr releases i just blogged about this yesterday on buzz flash
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:13.280]  you know from the military are are lying to the american people about the law the last pr out of
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:20.400]  colorado um by i i guess north com said oh you know they're you know conspiracy theorists
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:26.000]  are overreacting there are laws against deploying military units on the street but that's not truly
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.800]  anymore with the signing statement that bush uh issued um countering congress's limitations
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:39.280]  on his excesses in the defense authorization act of 2007 there there aren't any laws anymore
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:44.160]  against deploying these people and i mean interview i'm sorry go ahead it shows their deceptiveness
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:50.160]  their press release in the army time says we're there for crowd control for civil disturbances
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:54.560]  non-lethal weapons they're announcing the microwave guns on tv the head of the air force
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:59.600]  and the associated press the civilian head uh the secretary said last year we need to use
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:05.600]  these weapons on americans first uh because then that will internationally allow us to use this
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:12.160]  against foreign armies we can't under treaty but if we use it in police actions here why the american
[1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:16.400]  people is getting picked so there they are saying we're going to be domestically operating and then
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:21.840]  they double think and sainte omie wolf's making this up when they themselves are admitting it
[1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:28.720]  so this is the just incredible level of deception go ahead well now i've got to say to you alex
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:34.080]  honestly i should really like you know it just like meditator something before i talk to you
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:38.800]  because it's so like i'll piece things together and then you'll give me sources that i haven't
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:44.720]  seen and i have to just like take my thinking to another level and alex any sources that are
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:50.960]  you know to kind of journalistically grounded that you want to send me so that i can blog about
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:55.120]  this so i can raise people's awareness because we do sort of reach different audiences um i would
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:01.040]  be very honored if you would do so well let me just do this on air uh john call paul watson
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:04.880]  because i could do this myself but i can't talk on the air and get you all these i'm going to
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:08.400]  bring paul and we've got an hour and a half coming up it's plenty of time call paul watson
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:14.640]  and uh big big and i'm not bragging in fact this is scary to be in this position we discovered this
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:19.600]  just bumping into urban warfare drills in 96 in texas i knew nothing about it when i witnessed
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:24.880]  troops training to confiscate guns and put americans and fema camps on video admitting it's for america
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:29.920]  and then up through 2000 and then i quit traveling because i'd already proven it it's only accelerated
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:37.280]  since then but i went all over the country maryland california uh uh uh alabama north carolina i mean
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:42.800]  we have video of all this uh and their own documents and marines coming up with guns and
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:46.960]  saying turn your video cameras off working with local police running checkpoints i'll get paul
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:53.920]  watson on and then he on air uh we'll give you the headlines and because this is good to do on
[1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:59.040]  air to show listeners the integration of the information because i have to say because i'm
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:03.040]  going to be the judge advocate generals and others who are against us as well i talk about this
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:08.880]  three or four days a week for 12 years and so that's why uh and i've been screaming
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:12.480]  bloody murder and finally you've got a bigger voice than i do because you're so respected
[1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:16.880]  and you know your uh so we'll uh talk about when we get back and talk about your new film
[1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:24.080]  we're on the march keep going the empires on the run uh i'll just all want all this on
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:28.960]  air total transparency for the audience john yep i'm calling watson right now okay i want

[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:48.400]  again for those in the audience watching there's no time to play games we're multitasking
[1:30:48.400 --> 1:30:53.200]  brainstorming here on air did you get paul watch him he said he can't make he's just stepping out
[1:30:53.200 --> 1:30:58.320]  right now he has to go to dinner oh okay drag him in here now drag him in here on air i know it's
[1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:03.280]  six o'clock at night over there but drag him in his girlfriend ian can wait she's a sweetheart but
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:10.240]  he's in he's in england are you calling Watson back or calling back is he there we'll just tell
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:15.360]  him i want to talk to him for a second i'm sure he's going to julio's his favorite italian place
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:20.720]  that he goes out once i like to have his girlfriend paul watch you're saying i want to tell you a
[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:28.080]  couple of other things um if i may go ahead you're saying well first i want to tell you i met someone
[1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:32.640]  who came up to me after one of my events but the trouble i'm having with this as a journalist
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:36.560]  is that many many people are coming up to me and disclosing really important things but they're not
[1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:42.240]  letting me use their names so i can't follow up now i mean we have everything we have all of it
[1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:46.960]  we know the exact attack pattern because we've gone to the grassroots like Watson knows i'll
[1:31:46.960 --> 1:31:51.120]  twist his arm into a long time on air did did you get him i got him right now let me talk to him
[1:31:51.120 --> 1:32:01.040]  right now go ahead hey Watson hey paul i don't know why he's complaining in the background hey hey
[1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:09.760]  Watson that's two seconds hey Watson haha this is classic this is real radio folks this is like
[1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:16.880]  reality radio Watson hello do you know you've been on air complaining in the background
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:23.520]  here's the deal i could ask the the the forum guys to do it but this can't wait because Naomi
[1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:28.560]  Wolf's so influential what was the headline last year with the secretary of the air force saying
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:32.880]  they want to use non the the microwave guns on the american people first what was that headline
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:40.400]  i don't recall that one alex i recall the futurist study in britain where they said they
[1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:44.880]  may have to use those weapons all right well since i got you here we're going to do two
[1:32:44.880 --> 1:33:00.240]  minutes on air right now here we go stay there Watson i tell you it's hilarious
[1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:05.280]  Watson is always the best at googling things he may even be better than i am but he's leaving
[1:33:05.280 --> 1:33:08.320]  to go to dinner so i'm going to let him go i knew it i heard him and his girlfriend in the
[1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:13.040]  background complaining on air that's funny for the folks listening on the web and i
[1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:18.960]  were getting into serious issues we got Naomi Wolf here and i'm babbling the point is i need the
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:24.960]  listeners at the prison planet forum to create a section right now and find me all the articles
[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:32.080]  find the sub clip out of police state to the takeover with the army documents i know that link
[1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:36.880]  was dead on m4's with the documents find those post them all right now so before she leaves
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:41.760]  at the end of the show i can email those to her because time is of the essence but bringing
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:46.080]  paul Watson up paul you brought up another key point that british ministry of defense plan
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:49.680]  where they admitted the military is going to have to be used against the people of england and the
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:55.280]  united states uh... but uh... i guess you did do the research a few months ago actually doing
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:33:58.800]  you did send me that so i appreciate you doing that Watson
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:02.160]  now i just want to jump in and say that i did um...
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:05.920]  site in give me liberty an article in the new yorker
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:11.600]  where uh... experts on new a new generation of technologies and police forces were talking
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:15.760]  about crowd control technologies that involve microwave guns as well as
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:19.760]  you know teachers which have killed three hundred people and rubber bullets which are so lethal
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:23.760]  that uh... you know they've stopped using them in the uk because they've killed so many irish
[1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:28.160]  people and something that was particularly disturbing to me about the first reports of army
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:32.000]  times that they've sent back tracked on is that they were saying they're here to quote unquote
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.640]  subdue unruly individuals so just to you know be sure that i've said to you alex what i want to
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:41.840]  say why am i so scared as someone who studied closing societies is that again and again around
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:46.800]  the world uh... the leader will deploy soldiers to harass
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:51.360]  or arrest voters and opposition leaders during an election yeah this is classic
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:54.160]  tyranny since we have paul let me just say bye to him in the mail me i'm gonna
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:57.760]  give you the floor no no no no no what you got you're gonna have the floor in just a moment
[1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:00.720]  you just were shocked to hear all that stuff so i want to make sure you get it
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:04.080]  because what you cover actually is able to break through the mainstream media
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:08.240]  uh... paul i guess if you're not aware don't remember that article i'm surprised you don't
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:11.840]  i'll just find out if it's about one headline alex which is
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:16.720]  from cnn the link that but the headline still works at air force chief test
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:19.960]  weapons on testy u.s. mob
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:22.800]  in from september two thousand and six
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:26.240]  they say the headline again that's not the exact one
[1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:30.560]  yeah the the the the the ap is the key but but say it again what's in
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:36.560]  it yet it's an ap story which is carried by cnn air force chief test weapons on
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:38.640]  testy u.s. mob
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:42.720]  the one i don't know well okay yeah that was it okay see watson did that
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:46.960]  complaining and mumbling but he did a great job watson that's why i need my
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:48.240]  magic man
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:52.480]  you found it good good job red coat uh... by the way
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:55.520]  log about this right away after a check by the way paul
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:58.240]  by the way paul uh... you know the british government is now announced they
[1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:01.920]  want to use the army and police quote during economic collapses so
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:04.240]  you have the same thing going on there
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.720]  well listen to this alex there was a channel four news segment last night
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:13.440]  with the top general from port and down an army general
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:17.920]  who said that um let me get the exact quote here
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:23.200]  he said that quote we have to upgrade enhance review renew our activities in
[1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:28.000]  recent times because of increased civilian resilience
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.720]  that's the top general of the port and down by a weapons facility in england
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:36.560]  he said that on channel four news last night and the british ministry of
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:40.320]  defense ten-year battle plan they call it what their prospectus
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:43.760]  uh... this is the classified version almost two hundred pages admitted the
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:47.600]  military's job is for the elite to suppress the populations who are
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:48.560]  going to be
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:51.840]  uh... uh... basically i turned into poppers
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:55.200]  in a neo feudal state what's in what's the name of that british ministry of
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:57.840]  defense report i forget it
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:36:59.120]  uh...
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:02.240]  it doesn't bring to mind at the moment one and guardian first broke it but they
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:04.080]  had a hyperlink to it
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:07.600]  here in the one and god i want our researchers
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:10.640]  to post everything on this all of it now
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:13.640]  at prison plan as we work for team paul watch and thank you
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:14.760]  thank you
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:17.600]  uh... paul are you going to huleos d
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:21.280]  now i don't live in that area anymore for the rest of them were you going more
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:23.840]  part of all paul
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:26.640]  it's called what
[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:29.160]  people can join him there and he'd say hi to eon for me
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:30.520]  all right there goes what's in
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:32.040]  amount of control manly wolf
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:34.960]  you have the floor go through the steps your new book the new video
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:38.280]  and the point you're making i have i have done a classic alex jones go ahead
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:39.840]  sure thing well
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:42.520]  you know i'm grateful to you and uh...
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:44.520]  it is i guess what i do want to say is
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:47.880]  we're in a time where this kind of brainstorming among citizens
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:50.280]  not just us that you know all of
[1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:51.320]  you know all of
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.640]  my readers all of your listeners and readers and viewers
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:56.320]  uh... we all have
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:00.080]  uh... access to information that we need to educate one another about and use
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:01.920]  our critical intelligence about it and
[1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:05.960]  and find solutions among ourselves because clearly we can no longer trust
[1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:08.000]  uh... many of our
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.200]  state-supported or corporate-supported institutions to do it for us so this is
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:14.320]  exactly what people should be doing across the country uh...
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:16.480]  each other information checking it out
[1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:18.480]  and planning for action
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:21.780]  very quickly uh... the ten steps well
[1:38:21.780 --> 1:38:25.240]  invoked terrifying internal and external threat often a real one
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:29.160]  create a prison system outside the rule of law where torture takes place
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:32.280]  develop a paramilitary force not answerable to the people
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:35.480]  create a surveillance apparatus and ordinary citizens
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:37.760]  start to infiltrate harassed in groups
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:40.440]  uh... start to target key individuals
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:43.280]  start arbitrarily detain and release citizens
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:46.280]  you start to create legislation we're seeing it more and more you mentioned
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:48.200]  the uh... rnc eight
[1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:49.640]  uh... legislation that
[1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:50.880]  uh... it
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:54.920]  uh... criminalized feature expand the definition of terrorist or
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:57.760]  trader or spy so that ordinary citizens
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:00.480]  uh... who are engaged in content to get criminalized
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:03.880]  you start to see restrictions the press like the rest of the journalist we
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:04.800]  spoke about
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:08.200]  uh... and finally worked up and which is the birth of rock rule of law
[1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:09.960]  and make it easier to declare
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:13.440]  martial law and put him in order to make sure that i tell you
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:15.200]  but but the hopeful news
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:18.400]  uh... it's that i did simply last spoke alex
[1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:19.680]  uh... study
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:23.840]  times and places where citizens effectively fought back against
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:26.080]  encroaching darkness of this kind
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:28.000]  and um... so i learned
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.240]  what always work
[1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:33.720]  uh... i offer uh... citizens and give me liberty which is the sequel to the end
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:35.160]  of america which is just out
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:35.800]  now
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:39.720]  uh... exactly those lessons from other times and places where citizens did
[1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:41.240]  fight back as real
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:42.800]  patriots revolutionaries
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:45.880]  but i also go to the founding generation
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:49.520]  ordinary people uh... from all walks of life who
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:52.920]  were captivated by the vision of liberty we were supposed to inherit
[1:39:52.920 --> 1:39:53.920]  and i i
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:57.240]  go back to the seven core principles were supposed to hold on to you
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:59.320]  as americans in a time of crisis
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:01.920]  like this in a time where we're being bombarded with
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:04.680]  what i call fake patriotism to accept
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:06.400]  what i call fake democracy
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:10.600]  uh... sham of a democracy and finally i give citizens at the end of giving me
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:13.800]  liberty fifty five action that they can take
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:17.080]  in building this new army a transpartisan army
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:19.400]  uh... patriot revolutionaries uh...
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:20.600]  taking back the power
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:24.360]  that we should be having well i love that term transpartisan
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:28.360]  yeah it's important no longer being well okay now go back to
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:29.880]  posse common taught us
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:31.680]  the point you're trying to make earlier
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:35.240]  when i kind of went off the rabbit trail of ferreting documentation
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:38.280]  for you and then later i i did find the a p article
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:40.520]  and uh... it's exactly as we said
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:44.920]  and i'm i'm so glad that in the meantime to before before i go back to it
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:49.280]  why i think i i feel stupid asking you this because i'm in the mainstream media
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:50.040]  but
[1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:52.160]  why
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:55.880]  any mainstream news outlets covering the deployment of first brigade
[1:40:55.880 --> 1:40:58.440]  the field you just filed a freedom of
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:40:59.960]  of information request
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:01.760]  demanding to know
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:04.720]  where they are and what they're here for
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:08.720]  uh... i'm i'm just gobsmacked that there's no independent reporting and the
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:09.880]  one thing i was wondering is
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:13.280]  do you think it's classified i mean our journalist in a position
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:16.960]  that they're not reporting on it because it's considered classic yet
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:21.440]  what's your view yes and we we have the political classified documents fell in
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:22.960]  our hands
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:26.560]  because an fb i agent on the day before thanksgiving
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:28.080]  in uh...
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:30.960]  just south of temple on i thirty five
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:34.240]  the army came up and told mike hanson my camera guy was driving back from
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:35.360]  visiting family
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:39.120]  to turn his camera off and might refuse to the fb i showed up an hour later
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:42.520]  and gave him classified documents by accident
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:47.600]  and then uh... there is no no they had they had and they had gotten mike's number
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.240]  that they asked for it he gave it they called a few hours later ever he left
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:54.120]  his cell phone demanding it back in fact
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:55.560]  get me mike hanson
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:58.880]  uh... i'm gonna uh... later in the next hour we'll get my car i mean there's
[1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:01.560]  video all this now it's on video
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:04.200]  the fb i pulling out giving it to him that they could
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:05.640]  completely screwed up
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:08.680]  because i don't like how does this go to why journalists are covering the
[1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:10.480]  deployment of the first brigade
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:13.120]  because uh... their editors
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:16.520]  i mean it came out that bush is spent billions a year in fake news reporters
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:19.080]  and operation mockingbird
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:21.280]  but again in intelligence
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:25.160]  and i don't even know this i'm not uh... i'm just for the audience and i know
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:26.680]  most of them know the point is
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:29.040]  in intelligence you can always
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:32.200]  here the official propaganda from the mountaintop but then you go on the
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:33.480]  ground and
[1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:34.760]  and and assess it
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:35.800]  and observe it
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:38.880]  and i mean i remember in nineteen ninety nine going to urban warrior this is
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:40.120]  bipartisan this is
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.800]  this is a military industrial complex
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:43.640]  c o g continue government
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:45.280]  and they're the marines
[1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:48.920]  training with role players over two hundred of them with foreign troops
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:52.000]  screaming i'm an american please know not the camp and and the marines
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.320]  were allowing me to video tape
[1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:56.760]  well well first off let me explain this
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:43:00.360]  and they had journalist tours to the part of the city and a university was
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:04.520]  shut down for the urban warfare drills practicing taking over american city
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:06.120]  and for journalists
[1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:07.240]  they would say
[1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:10.640]  this is for bosnia this is for uh... massadonia
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:15.160]  but then but then i sent people in local activists as they knew who i was the
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:16.600]  marines would let me get in there
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:20.600]  and i said an activist posing as citizens who wanted to
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:23.600]  and for them they would show marines doing interrogations
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:27.160]  where you from i'm from san francisco where'd you get the weapons
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:28.480]  and and
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:30.920]  and so then i would watch this on video by the way
[1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:33.720]  and so we send infiltrators in
[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:37.840]  and i had this uh... former marine corps captain who was in private uh... it was
[1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:39.440]  their p r guys steve jones
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:43.000]  following me he's on video running up saying get out of here jones
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:46.240]  uh... you know trying to block me when i'm at the fence videoing but little did
[1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:48.560]  he know i had people inside
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:53.000]  uh... you the cordon off area they had two thousand marines foreign troops
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:57.480]  tanks helicopters it was so shocking with the coronado landing
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:43:58.920]  amphibious attack ship
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:01.600]  with the amphibious craft landing in oakland
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:03.080]  that i put it out
[1:44:03.080 --> 1:44:07.120]  and people couldn't believe it they thought i had hired tanks helicopters
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:09.080]  and armies
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:12.520]  i've got a hand at you alex you are very resourceful that's it
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:13.840]  that's extraordinary i mean
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:17.480]  i could see just to be kind of measured
[1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:18.800]  because
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:22.040]  really a time to put a couple triple think everything
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:23.520]  but not hold up back but
[1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:25.440]  i could see illegitimate
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:28.520]  government with legitimate interest in its citizens well-being
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:29.560]  doing
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:31.920]  and you know a mock evacuation
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:36.320]  scenario uh... you know uh... out of good intentions
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:41.120]  i'm what i'm hearing more and more about the deployment and why now after two
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:42.280]  hundred years then
[1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:46.080]  you know i i just posted a piece on but that's the people can read where
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:49.920]  i i quote members of military circles and police forces the national guard
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:51.280]  thing hey wait a minute
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:53.360]  you know why do we need these
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:56.760]  soldiers since you know the national guard can do that and you know we've
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:44:59.600]  got police forces who can do that we've got emergency
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:02.320]  people trained in evacuation who can do that
[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:07.640]  you know many people are raising you in crime they only yet but i don't go ahead
[1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:10.400]  and and the left the left and i want to say is what
[1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:12.800]  children particularly
[1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:17.240]  is i have this wonderful heroic patriotic american
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:21.800]  uh... major from the air force uh... david anton who the hero who might
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:22.760]  interviewed in
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:26.480]  give me liberty he stood up to the bush administration and people families on
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:27.640]  the watchlist now
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:30.000]  uh... but he said i said to him
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:31.200]  because i'm a civilian
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:32.560]  i said so
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:35.000]  uh... major in tune if
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.880]  you know first he explained to me that these warriors
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:40.680]  uh... you know answer to congress they don't have to people they answer to the
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:41.560]  president
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:45.040]  and i think that the president said arrest the citizens what happened if they
[1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:46.240]  have to do it
[1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:49.560]  and i think what the president said arrest congress what happened he said
[1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:50.640]  they have to do it
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:53.120]  and i think we'll see your members of the military
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:54.400]  uh... you know
[1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:57.600]  uh... don't obey these orders what happens
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:00.840]  and he said well they get arrested because these orders the horror is the
[1:46:00.840 --> 1:46:02.560]  orders are not illegal
[1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:05.920]  uh... soldiers are allowed to just obey illegal or they're now legal what they
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:09.800]  are immoral yeah but those signing statements have been thrown out
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:13.680]  on its face and there's no fewer precept or nixon saying
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:16.920]  you know it's not illegal when the president does it the congress is co
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:18.120]  equal
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:21.160]  and just because linkin arrested a few members of congress
[1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:24.160]  that was later thrown out of court but that was done retroactively
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:26.400]  and and and newspaper editor so
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:29.960]  uh... congress is co equal just like pdd fifty one
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:33.120]  the homeland security committee this year wanted to see it
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:36.240]  and the executive said no you can't but the cover she says
[1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:39.480]  the bush is basically dictator so on its face
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:41.320]  that is a fraud and
[1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:43.480]  with unfortunately the media spinning
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:46.200]  what you're saying as you're saying towards bush will do this
[1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:47.440]  by the election
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:50.840]  and what i get from what you're saying is no this apparatus has been set up
[1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:52.800]  and the office of the presidency
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:57.520]  uh... has built this around itself whether it's barack obama or or whether
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:46:58.800]  it's john mccain
[1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:01.640]  this threat continues can you speak to that
[1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:03.400]  sure and you know let me
[1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:06.720]  dress how can i put this
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:09.800]  it's really important for us to understand
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:12.000]  think differently we're not in in
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.720]  you know constitutional republic time now we're in
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:17.360]  police state time in the sense that
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:19.920]  it doesn't have to happen
[1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:23.200]  at a certain time frame for it to be a dangerous precedent
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:27.000]  i mean that's what and i'm not being a radical extremist in saying that this
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.600]  is how the founders wanted us to think
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:30.800]  they wanted us to be
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:33.360]  just as freaked out
[1:47:33.360 --> 1:47:37.920]  uh... you know that the president have irrigated a private army to himself
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:41.840]  whether or not he does anything with that private army before the election
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:42.880]  after the election
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:47.120]  they want us to freak out that that has taken place because it up and
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:50.840]  this delicate system of checks and balances and this this absolutely
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:53.800]  delicate fabric of freedom that we have in america
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:55.400]  or that we're supposed to have
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:57.400]  in which you know we do not
[1:47:57.400 --> 1:48:01.200]  soldiers you know on our streets in our home terrifying us because you can have
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:02.280]  all the
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.000]  the institutions of civil society intact you can have a judiciary can have
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:07.440]  newspapers you can have
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:12.000]  uh... you know a parliamentary or a or a uh... congress but if you've got
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:13.120]  soldiers
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:16.120]  you know look at italy in nineteen twenty look at germany thirty thirty one
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:17.000]  thirty two
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.320]  they were still a parliamentary democracy
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:21.160]  but the brown shirts of the black shirts
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:24.880]  we're deployed you know to beat up this editor in the long order you know
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:28.040]  uh... intimidate these voters in prugina or to line the halls of the
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:28.920]  right dog
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:32.640]  you know in germany that's right it was it's their menacing the intimidation
[1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:35.200]  it's their menacing and intimidating the congress
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:37.120]  may only uh... did you know that
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:39.600]  members of congress on the day of the bailout
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:41.240]  were threatened that friday
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:44.280]  with physical martial law if they did not pass
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:45.760]  the bailout plan
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:49.000]  will speak to me more about that because um...
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.920]  i'm having a very interesting experience i'm glad to be speaking to you
[1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:52.560]  about it
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:56.200]  john pull up on the congressman we had him on air to
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:00.600]  that that i know i've been following this and actually i mentioned it alex
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:03.160]  in an a radio interview uh... that
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:05.480]  was put on youtube that went very very viral
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:07.600]  in which i was saying look at the first brigade
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:11.760]  and look at what brad Sherman had said in c-span about you know individual
[1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:13.520]  members of the house being threatened with
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:15.840]  quote-unquote martial law in america if
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:19.040]  the bailout so that i mean there you have it though that this is
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:20.280]  the menacing
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:22.520]  the out of control criminal executive
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:25.840]  looting everything taking trillions not seven hundred billion
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:29.200]  in offshore corporations and banks i mean this is it it's here where
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:31.000]  we're under martial law now
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.480]  out alex alex
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:34.880]  before we
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:35.560]  i mean that
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:36.800]  uh... in the sense of
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:39.520]  uh... how can i put that one to be a little bit
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:41.400]  i want to be a little bit uh...
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:43.060]  how can i put it
[1:49:43.060 --> 1:49:46.760]  more circumscribed measured because i don't want people to conclude that it's
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:47.360]  over
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:50.880]  i want people to conclude that no no no they've they've turned it on and they're
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:52.640]  trying to implement it
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:53.840]  incrementally
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:57.680]  with hey the army's here to help people get out of the rest of cars back again
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:49:59.880]  that's all of the army's here to help
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:01.720]  get us out of the breakdown car
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:05.080]  it's the stealth coup it's a stealth coup but do we have a second source for the
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:09.040]  brad Sherman assertion has he confirmed it yes and i know i i i had brad
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:12.320]  Sherman on and i talked to the members of congress who will not come on the show
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:15.080]  and they said that no they were told martial law is going to be declared if
[1:50:15.080 --> 1:50:17.760]  you don't do this
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:19.800]  i mean i had brad Sherman on the show
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:24.320]  and uh... and he by the way is a lawyer specialist on all this
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:27.320]  stay there and i mean well if we're going to continue to talk about this
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:29.460]  in fact i was going to skip this break right now
[1:50:29.460 --> 1:50:30.240]  are you sick of
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:31.400]  john let's just skip it
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:33.600]  that way for the internet audience i can cover this
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:35.440]  uh... if you google
[1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:40.200]  what i googled uh... was air force test weapons on unruly crowds
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:42.080]  and then the a p
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:46.080]  has been pulled it was up for about a year it's suddenly gone
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:48.340]  it's been pulled by lexus nexus
[1:50:48.340 --> 1:50:51.680]  uh... can get it for you but uh...
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:53.760]  a bunch of other websites saved it
[1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:57.640]  air force chief reposes testing pain guns on really americans
[1:50:57.640 --> 1:51:00.000]  and it goes on uh...
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:03.560]  to uh... say that the secretary of the air force michael wane
[1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:06.120]  uh... said we're up for re-election we
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:09.000]  we doubt that this proposal to test only the weapons of american citizens
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.400]  before deploying them abroad
[1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:14.000]  what would have any votes specifically wane told associate press
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.680]  if we're not willing to use it here to consider fellow citizens
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:18.240]  then we should not be willing to use it
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:20.680]  in a wartime situation because if it hits somebody
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:22.000]  the non-lethal weapon
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:23.720]  and they claim that it injured them
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:26.320]  in a way that was not intended i think that
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:28.760]  i would be vilified in the world press
[1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:32.400]  uh... that would certainly and then he goes on to say so usually american people
[1:51:32.400 --> 1:51:36.400]  and then wire magazine last week or actually ten days ago reported
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:38.120]  in the headline that the
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:42.560]  pain microwave guns do cause death uh... that's in the headline
[1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:44.040]  uh... so just
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:48.280]  just google microwave guns death and in fact let's just do that together
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:51.640]  right now let's just google microwave guns death
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:53.320]  okay microwave
[1:51:53.320 --> 1:51:55.160]  micro
[1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:57.440]  wave
[1:51:57.440 --> 1:51:58.800]  gun
[1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:01.400]  death
[1:52:01.400 --> 1:52:04.040]  and uh... how can you how can you
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:07.000]  bear the strain of absorbing
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.880]  the stream of information
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:12.360]  i'm having a hard time
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:15.000]  wrapping my brain around the top of the first three days
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:18.080]  well i mean we're in a war situation here
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:19.800]  and uh...
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:22.680]  and so we just got to be cool and get the info out
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:26.040]  uh... but i mean just like you're doing you're doing a great job okay i'm not
[1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:27.800]  going with the right headline here
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.520]  let me try uh...
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:35.640]  uh... armies non-lethal weapon death let me see army
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:37.400]  non
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:38.520]  lethal
[1:52:38.520 --> 1:52:41.120]  no no no crowd control death
[1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:42.280]  the new yorker
[1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:42.960]  piece
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:45.320]  but i think if you really definitely talked about
[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:46.440]  the microwave
[1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:47.600]  uh... guns
[1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:50.960]  what they do they raise that if i remember correctly basically microwave
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:54.200]  people i mean they raise the body temperature
[1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:55.600]  excruciating
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:53:00.440]  degree from a long-distance
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:03.920]  i'm just going to try and i'm gonna try death and then wired
[1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:07.440]  magazine
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:09.640]  and again we're just on the internet right now so we're kind of
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:11.880]  just cool in our hills are doing some research
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:13.280]  that's driving me crazy
[1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:15.720]  somebody posted in the uh...
[1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:17.920]  in the uh... prison-planet forum
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:20.560]  and and and then i can just copy it all and email it to you know me
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:23.120]  but no i mean
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:26.560]  but but the big point i didn't make earlier was that i go back to my hotel at
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:28.680]  night for these four days watching marines
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:29.800]  in ninety nine
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:30.840]  and they would announce
[1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:33.840]  the marines are not doing this for in the u.s. they're doing this for in
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:36.080]  macedonia and other missions
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:37.720]  and then i would be there
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:40.600]  knowing they would tell the press that in the end
[1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:43.680]  letting citizens actually see it was for the i mean i don't video now
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:46.200]  right now i will look of course i'll look
[1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:47.440]  but the trouble
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:50.760]  that i i have an easier time
[1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:53.520]  presenting argument that is
[1:53:53.520 --> 1:53:58.160]  taken seriously when i can use uh... print sources it's hard for me to
[1:53:58.160 --> 1:54:02.720]  convey videotape footage in a way that is
[1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:04.440]  uh... taken seriously by
[1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:06.040]  uh... for more mainstream
[1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:09.560]  debate well you're i will i will take a look at your free to use uh... any of
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:13.120]  the clips from police state two thousand police state to the takeover police
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:14.480]  state three total enslavement
[1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:16.360]  this is back when i was the up
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:31.360]  we're back live on the show again
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:34.120]  it's the old frog in the pot analogy
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:36.960]  we're on the three in the record scale of marcia law
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:40.960]  back in ninety eight were about a six and a half right now
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:47.600]  may be a seven of the announces on these brigades
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:50.800]  but uh... also in road to turn the interviewer
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:53.040]  marine court captain
[1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:56.680]  who saw an army checkpoint i thirty five and two thousand and got mad
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:59.280]  we contacted me show me all the documents
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:03.080]  they had secret programs in the late eighties with marines dressing up in
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:04.360]  police uniforms
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:06.080]  in norfolk virginia
[1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:09.240]  uh... doing uh... gun raids and drug raids
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:10.760]  uh... so
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:13.440]  they've been covertly doing this for a long time now i mean
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:16.360]  so it's a and it goes back to rex eighty four but please continue with all
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:18.360]  your great research as we continue to
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:20.400]  collate more information here on there
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:24.680]  you know what i wanted to say from my point of view is that
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:27.440]  you know when when we say we're at seven
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:28.880]  in terms of marcia law
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:30.440]  i think the thing
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:32.960]  that i want to think about is that
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:35.760]  part of what gets us to seven is
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:37.760]  say the deployment of troops or
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:38.760]  uh... passage of
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:40.320]  of laws
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:42.840]  defense authorization act two thousand seven and five
[1:55:42.840 --> 1:55:45.680]  but part of what gets up to seven and eight
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:48.880]  and beyond it people's complacency in the
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:50.680]  face of it
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:53.720]  to me the psychological piece of how we received it
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:55.000]  very very important
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.840]  uh... and this is again why i went back to the founders of the founding
[1:55:57.840 --> 1:55:58.800]  generation
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:02.600]  we really have to you know what i learned from the research i didn't give me
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:04.280]  liberty is that
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:05.600]  you can't
[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:06.920]  reclaim liberty
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:10.360]  without a psychological shift in ordinary people first
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:14.280]  uh... that as what i learned that america it's supposed to be
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:18.120]  not uh... landmass and not a system of government primarily
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:21.680]  first psychological state in which there's an inner sense of freedom an
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:23.400]  inner commitment to freedom
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:25.360]  and a personal conviction
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:28.120]  to be outraged and not stand for it
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:29.880]  when tyranny and oppression
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:31.160]  razor head and
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:33.360]  you know i did find that we were we are being
[1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:36.480]  brainwashed now not just the last eight years which have been dramatic but the
[1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:37.720]  last thirty years
[1:56:37.720 --> 1:56:39.200]  in a messaging
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:42.200]  about what you know what i could take pictures and where for instance
[1:56:42.200 --> 1:56:45.440]  you know we're taught that life-liberating a pursuit of happiness
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:47.960]  which is interpreted as kind of just relax and shop
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:51.280]  you know the meaning of the declaration of independence but in fact alex
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:53.600]  the second paragraph were never taught
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:54.320]  which is
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:57.880]  you know that the declaration of independence is actually a personal
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:01.160]  uh... commitment demanded of each and every american to
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:03.480]  stand up against tyranny and oppression
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:06.560]  wherever it raises head but also to confront
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:08.120]  and bring down the government
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:12.360]  if it engages in uh... repression and tyranny against the people in a war
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:15.720]  against the people uh... we're committed to be in revolutionaries as
[1:57:15.720 --> 1:57:16.720]  americans
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:17.480]  uh...
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:20.840]  there's that there's that there's just like thirty-year messaging
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:23.640]  you know it's it's so much deeper than just a deployment it's been like this
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:28.000]  messaging to get us to go to sleep get us to forget our rights i found out that
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:28.600]  you know
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:29.880]  civic education is it
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:31.480]  disappearing from half of
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:32.720]  u.s high school
[1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:35.480]  uh... you know kids are going going to college now
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:38.480]  not knowing what a republic is supposed to look like you know what
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:40.600]  you're not know what their liberties are let alone
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:42.120]  recognize that being threatened
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:44.800]  uh... you know we're being told that patriotism
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:47.960]  is about never criticizing the government or supporting any military
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:48.960]  intervention
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:51.160]  where they discovered that the great
[1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:53.640]  americans the great patriots held a mirror up
[1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:56.280]  to america that that's what we're supposed to do so
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:58:00.560]  i really want to check the first shift for us is to be outraged when we hear
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:03.020]  about the deployment to be outraged when we
[1:58:03.020 --> 1:58:06.120]  uh... people are going to take on this
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:11.120]  yet you stay there stay there will be right back in one minute

[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:44.480]  arrest congress
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:46.920]  that's not true
[2:00:46.920 --> 2:00:51.080]  you know nixon again said well when the president breaks the law, it's not breaking the law
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:54.440]  well you saw what happened there
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:55.880]  very very serious
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:00:59.440]  i want to take calls coming up in this hour for Naomi wolf, i want to talk about her new book
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:00.760]  and solutions
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:03.120]  that her book gets into and also the new video
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:06.280]  covering all this, she's a very influential lady and very intelligent and we're really glad
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:08.240]  that she has the courage to get into all this and
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:10.720]  we're gonna send her more of this information
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:13.960]  uh... but here it is uh... potential for death
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:16.960]  and uh... Naomi, what do you think of them apples?
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:18.480]  potential for death, i mean
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:20.760]  you know terrifying and and yet
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:22.580]  not surprising
[2:01:22.580 --> 2:01:24.160]  because once
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:26.000]  you see
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.560]  footage, which is one so concerned about the election
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:33.400]  of you know a handful of angry voters who've just been purged from the rolls
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:38.240]  you know speaking up and being tainted to death, accidentally or in defense or
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:40.520]  you know being quote-unquote subdued by
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:45.040]  you know the lethal and non-lethal technologies which the initial army times
[2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:47.080]  report said that the first brigade had
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:49.760]  and they now have mass tasers, they now have mass tasers
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:53.240]  what? you're telling me they have mass tasers? yeah, it's a big taser they roll out that shoots a
[2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:54.760]  bunch of cords out
[2:01:54.760 --> 2:01:56.080]  and shocks them
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:02:01.280]  Alex, really, i can't, you know, it's like just when i think i've reached
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:06.120]  you know, i understand where we are, you bring up new information that takes it one step further
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:11.760]  alright, so, you know, all we need is some repeating footage on CNN or Fox News of
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:13.720]  you know five Americans
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:15.760]  you know, in the street, brutally
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:20.320]  wounded or worse from these technologies, and then you can still have, as i've learned,
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:23.800]  you know, all the trappings of civil society intact, but people just go quiet, you know,
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:25.000]  understandably, i mean
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.920]  you know, if there's military
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:31.600]  standing outside the polling booth, you're a lot less inclined to argue
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:32.960]  vociferously with
[2:02:32.960 --> 2:02:37.280]  you know, the registrar, if you and all your neighbors have been purged from the roll
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:40.480]  well, i think barack obama is going to come into office and then i think the
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:43.080]  left's going to be completely co-opted
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:45.200]  they don't have to go into him saying he wouldn't
[2:02:45.200 --> 2:02:48.320]  go for wiretapping, or he'd end the war and flip-flopping
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:52.960]  i mean, the wall street money's on him, this is giving him left cover
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:53.960]  the left
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:57.480]  the main line left is suddenly going to love FEMA camps and master rest and
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:01.680]  oh god, i don't think so, the main line left will be the ones to know
[2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:04.440]  right in the front lines, i mean, they'll be targeted
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:07.440]  but not if it's barack obama, not if it's...
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:10.840]  so let me just say for your audience, because people have rightly said
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:14.280]  when will alex jones persuade Naomi wolff that there is
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:17.000]  you know, that she needs to be on the left-right paradigm, and i have to say
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  you all are making a lot of headway with me
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:20.560]  because while
[2:03:20.560 --> 2:03:21.680]  i still
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:24.480]  believe that an obama presidency at least will
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:26.200]  staunch the immediate
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:29.600]  decline into a police state, i've also been saying in public again and again
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:33.880]  that it, you know, it is going to be business as usual in the sense that
[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:38.600]  unless there's an enraged bipartisan, transpartisan citizens movement to
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:39.600]  restore
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:42.160]  liberty and the constitution, here's why
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:43.320]  barack obama
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:44.960]  with these rights is going to be
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:48.600]  these powers are going to be tempted to use them just as the founders knew any
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:50.200]  leader will
[2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:53.440]  and the trillions of dollars to be made in surveillance and security
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:54.560]  technologies
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:58.480]  by vested interests who benefit from a police state
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:01.800]  you know, have the same pressures on him that they would on any other candidate
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:03.960]  so it is going to be up to us as citizens
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:06.680]  to hold any leader to the fire, we're not
[2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:09.800]  you know, i'm not, i would rather have a constitutional
[2:04:09.800 --> 2:04:12.520]  anyone than an unconstitutional democrat in office
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:14.120]  Naomi wolff
[2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:17.800]  our guest for the next fifteen minutes, your phone calls at eight hundred

[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:36.600]  you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:40.080]  showers than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:43.600]  inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin
[2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:47.760]  the kdf dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is

[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:03.400]  whichever comes first, hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[2:05:03.400 --> 2:05:07.120]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria

[2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:33.040]  with the recent bailout
[2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:37.040]  international bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:40.560]  to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:44.360]  but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis will be on a scale
[2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:46.280]  never before seen in modern times
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:50.080]  shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:53.840]  the insiders have discovered that they must control two things to cease total
[2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:54.440]  power
[2:06:54.440 --> 2:06:58.880]  phase one is a one-world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept
[2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:03.000]  phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies

[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:35.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:38.440]  alright let me make this statement
[2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:41.640]  this is key in
[2:07:41.640 --> 2:07:45.440]  psychological warfare in the info wars that the
[2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:48.520]  military industrial complex owned by the private banks
[2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:52.120]  are launching and almost
[2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:55.800]  all the information about the cover is in their own white papers their own admissions
[2:07:55.800 --> 2:07:59.240]  at the international level
[2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:00.600]  just like at Waco
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:03.600]  when they were ramming the Bradley fighting vehicles into the building and
[2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:06.480]  machine gunning everyone as they try to run out the back all on the FLIR footage
[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:10.360]  and this came out congressional testimony Delta Force was there shooting
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:14.160]  the men women and children
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:16.920]  they were announcing this is not an assault this is not an assault while
[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:18.680]  they were doing it
[2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:22.520]  so even as you see the economy implode even as you see if we're not
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:25.840]  ever unable to stop it martial law and troops on the streets
[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:29.920]  they will continue to deny it's martial law
[2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:33.160]  they will continue to deny it's a problem they will continue to
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:36.920]  laugh at anyone that even brings it up if you read the Army Times and they say
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:37.400]  they're gonna
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:41.680]  engage the American people with non-lethal weapons and aid the police if
[2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:45.360]  for civil unrest you and then you say that and then they say to Naomi Wolf
[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:49.080]  we never said that counting on people not reading the Army Times
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:52.760]  so this is part of a psychology they're going to deny it
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:56.360]  and deny it and deny it and deny it it's like for a year before the US invaded
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:08:57.000]  Panama
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:00.920]  they had helicopters and troops and doing drills and touch and goes and
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:04.600]  inserting special forces and pulling them out and Panama kept saying you're
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:06.320]  gonna invade you're gonna invade you're gonna invade
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:09.560]  and they said you're crazy you're nuts it's a conspiracy theory
[2:09:09.560 --> 2:09:13.160]  and they later made a history channel things showing the psychological warfare
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:16.560]  it's the same thing here but they're acclimating the police the military
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:20.400]  the local governments at these urban warfare drills with the army the
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:22.200]  Marines and others all over the country
[2:09:22.200 --> 2:09:25.440]  they practice taking over the city council
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:29.640]  the city hall the county commissioners the state capitals
[2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:33.160]  they practice arresting the lawmakers
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:36.600]  guys in suits walking out of city halls with their hands behind their head this
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:38.240]  is all Pavlovian
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:42.800]  psychological operant conditioning of the public
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:47.360]  and it's all right in your face and Naomi Wolf is absolutely right
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:50.480]  we have to scream bloody murder say no
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:53.800]  have the facts make an issue about this because they wanna
[2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:58.000]  it's the way you domesticate a wild animal you open up a pen
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  put some grain in there leave it open for months let the wild horses wild pigs
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:03.200]  whatever it is you want to capture
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:08.280]  wild cows bovine come in and then finally after a few months that you just one
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:08.720]  day
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:12.520]  nowadays they have a timer on the gate and it just closes
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:15.880]  but in the old days a person would just walk up and close the gate on them and then
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:18.920]  keep feeding them for a few months showing them you're friendly
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:22.640]  and then start taking the babies from the pigs the babies from the horses
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:26.400]  that you know those are the first you tame then the other horses see that the
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:29.480]  babies being taken care of then they think you're part of their troop or
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:30.400]  their clutch
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:33.600]  it's the same way that you know ducks or geese imprint
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:36.720]  so they're imprinting us right now
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:40.720]  that all of this is okay and good it's like when I told when the
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:43.600]  the Delta Force it's just like they take over third world countries
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:48.320]  they came into south Texas town San Antonio they went and bribed the mayors
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:48.640]  and
[2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:52.880]  the fire chiefs and but the finally the police chief of San Antonio they
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:55.720]  brought in about two hundred thousand dollars in a big cash bucket and said
[2:10:55.720 --> 2:10:58.240]  we just want you to be friends with the army
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:10:59.520]  and he said well
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:02.000]  what is this is just be friends with us
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:05.280]  and he said i was in army intelligence is illegal get out of here
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:07.520]  and he was in the news i wouldn't interviewed much in police state two
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:08.680]  thousand
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:11.800]  and so what we discovered is just like they paid off the iraqi constabulary
[2:11:11.800 --> 2:11:13.400]  that's the real surge
[2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:16.400]  uh... with these you know sixty something billion hundred dollar bills were
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:17.240]  flown in
[2:11:17.240 --> 2:11:20.560]  they've also corrupted the troops a private gets thirty thousand
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:24.520]  uh... a standard rated sergeant it's about a hundred grand
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:28.000]  uh... and folks i've even got family that i know i brought it up to me they
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:29.760]  get real mad won't talk about it
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:31.920]  they've been bought off they've been compromised
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:35.640]  the uh... series roam it is pretty accurate in in that
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:38.760]  he takes this season takes a centurion for just one part of roam
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:41.680]  and and says i need you to carry out corruptions for me
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:44.580]  and corruption is once you get somebody on the take
[2:11:44.580 --> 2:11:46.760]  now they're corrupted along with you
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:47.680]  and so
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:50.280]  they have these emergency management centers they built in every county in
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:51.480]  city and state
[2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:52.680]  that are federal
[2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:55.200]  and and and they have c a officers in those now
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:11:57.560]  and they have c a liaisons in the city
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:00.080]  and so that in most counties and cities they've run
[2:12:00.080 --> 2:12:03.320]  thousands of former fb agents to be sheriffs and police chiefs
[2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:04.760]  they're everywhere now
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:07.360]  and see that's what militaries do throughout history
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:10.260]  they take over societies with ceasar
[2:12:10.260 --> 2:12:13.800]  uh... you know two thousand forty something years ago in roam
[2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:15.920]  it's two thousand and fifty one now
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:17.680]  uh... crossing the rubicon
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:21.120]  they build up this army they bring it into roam they bring it into washington
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:24.040]  and that's what this brigade's for it's to menace the government
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:26.880]  and menace the rest of military hard felons for the military
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:29.280]  illegal alien felons aggravated felons
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:32.960]  we told you about that ten years before was in the news now it's in the news
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:34.200]  this is real
[2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:35.360]  this is happening
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:39.060]  and it's about the looting this is about the international crime syndicate the
[2:12:39.060 --> 2:12:41.320]  brokerage firms the select group of banks
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:44.000]  creating a vertical immigration of the economy
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.920]  cutting off liquidity to cause a depression then they'll have the only
[2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:48.560]  liquidity to buy it all up
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:52.520]  and they know you're gonna riot and crimes and go up and you're gonna bag
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:54.960]  for the u.s. military to be used
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:57.800]  so you're seeing military we're gonna help you at car wrecks we're gonna be
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:12:59.560]  other aiding firemen and police
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:01.040]  they're just introducing it
[2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:04.360]  not just the public but the military as well now that's my little four-minute
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:05.680]  comment now we will
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:07.080]  you've got the floor
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:10.640]  to comment on this but this is historical this happens ninety nine
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:12.360]  percent of the time in countries
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:14.640]  empires never last more than two hundred years
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:16.360]  it's happening here now
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:18.760]  and uh... let the cops go ahead and be part of it
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:22.040]  they're gonna have their pension funds taken to the other dollar devalued
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:25.040]  you know the good news about this is these things always end up falling
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:27.560]  nail me wolf
[2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:29.720]  uh... you know once again you're adding
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:32.280]  uh... dimensions to
[2:13:32.280 --> 2:13:36.640]  uh... that i wasn't aware of i mean i didn't know that millions of dollars
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:40.040]  are being pumped into as i believe i mentioned police
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:43.480]  department across the country in order to get the militarization
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:46.720]  that we thought at the rnc
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:50.760]  i did know that i mean one really important thing i learned uh... for my
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:52.840]  research and give me liberty is that
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:55.040]  something that always always works in
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:57.800]  bringing down a tyrant is mass protest
[2:13:57.800 --> 2:14:00.880]  uh... but they're not the kind of that process they're legal in united states
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:02.760]  now the kind of mass protest that
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:06.120]  brought down the the berlin wall or that restored people from the philippines
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:10.320]  that liberated baltica state or you know restored democracy in pakistan
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:14.040]  uh... are illegal and now that we have a heavily armed police they're they're
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:15.800]  very dangerous as well
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:18.800]  uh... you would you're not allowed to step in the street
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:21.400]  uh... for legal protest in the west because of the thirty years of over
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:23.000]  permitization
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:26.640]  so i teach people and give me liberty how to stage a real protest and how to
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:29.320]  dress safely to protect yourself
[2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:31.440]  you know most of these technologies obviously
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:33.200]  some of them
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:36.520]  that i don't want you to cry but now i mean i go back to the fear precept i go
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:40.080]  back to the you know oh yeah so let's talk about psychological programming
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:42.880]  i hate that it sounds so
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:46.920]  extreme to think that it could be possible however i have to pay i have
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:48.480]  some evidence
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:49.560]  you're right
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:53.200]  but there's a very chilling footage from the rnc that people can see in the
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:57.160]  end of america movie uh... which i mentioned where you see any good men
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:14:58.720]  or other protesters being
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:01.080]  but not any good men being beaten she's been rounded up
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:03.760]  but other people are being beaten and this heavily armed
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:05.480]  cop could be caught could be
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:06.480]  federal agent
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:11.760]  if yelling you're violating my constitutional rights as he's beating
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:13.280]  this unarmed civilian
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:16.320]  and that the writer and me if you look at that thing
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:17.360]  something
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:21.680]  very directive is going on there that psychological warfare
[2:15:21.680 --> 2:15:25.200]  exactly whenever we have people attack us at the dnc
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:28.960]  and break our bullhorns and things they would say i have rights as they pull
[2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:32.800]  out a knife and cut the cord it's on video i have rights to ordinary so if
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:37.280]  this is clearly organized and you know i'm experiencing something
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:39.640]  which is quite fascinating online this
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:43.400]  this uh... uh... this viral video that calling for people to
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:45.600]  to sign up with the citizens
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:47.840]  peaceful army to restore liberty
[2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:51.920]  uh... that the the viral net of it got stopped by
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:56.120]  one poster again and again and again and again like relentlessly day and night
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:15:57.240]  day and night saying
[2:15:57.240 --> 2:16:01.000]  she's a plant uh... if you go to her website and find out they're gonna round
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:01.720]  you up
[2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:05.120]  she's you know uh... that that account for relations member
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:07.120]  you know passing me at this
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:09.520]  uh... self-agent you know
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:12.960]  uh... for the very people i'm criticizing and it had the effect of
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:15.240]  making people go oh well wait a minute will
[2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:17.880]  you know maybe i won't pass it around to my nearest interest
[2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:22.120]  uh... no exactly uh... on the relentless we have we have the army field
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:24.680]  manual the uh... that was put on wiki leaks
[2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:27.360]  about six months ago in the army confirmed it was real
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:29.360]  about how the army in latin america
[2:16:29.360 --> 2:16:31.560]  would do the same thing if somebody was getting
[2:16:31.560 --> 2:16:34.200]  really successful they would come out and say they're an agent
[2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:37.760]  now now you really have a see the government and they admit north com is
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:40.000]  involved quote fighting an info war
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:41.600]  sent com
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:44.740]  with bloggers countering us they'll even have their handle
[2:16:44.740 --> 2:16:47.680]  and you'll go back to their myspace and they're in uniform and they'll have the
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:50.040]  side ops uh... patch on their side
[2:16:50.040 --> 2:16:53.960]  they're not even they're not even hiding it but but but what they do is they
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:57.440]  assess your weaknesses in your credentials which are weaknesses but to
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:16:58.400]  them they are
[2:16:58.400 --> 2:17:00.840]  and they say well she's a road scholar they're all new order
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:04.000]  caesarean did you know did set that up to set up for all government
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:07.360]  and then uh... i mean i don't know if we've discussed he left me out of it
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:10.600]  you know you know i don't know what regardless you judge a tree by its
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:11.640]  fruits
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:15.520]  regardless it isn't even about the only will for alex jones this is happening
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:18.840]  so what are we going to do about it and they always use fear
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:22.040]  and say they'll get you they'll round you up no no
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:26.080]  we need to not go quietly the night not have a chilling effect stand up and say
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:27.880]  no exactly
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:29.320]  that's the only way
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:32.360]  historically uh... are you a member of the council on farm relations
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:34.040]  no i'm not
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:37.600]  well i mean regardless the cfr or when it was two thousand members set up by
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:39.920]  british intelligence in nineteen twenty two
[2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:43.680]  uh... was clearly a shadow government and still is but now they've expanded to
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:45.260]  close to five thousand
[2:17:45.260 --> 2:17:48.440]  and they have inner boards of it that are on the no and part of the military
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:49.840]  industrial complex
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:51.880]  uh... invisible empire system
[2:17:51.880 --> 2:17:55.640]  but they also try to co-opt up i mean i have to know
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:17:59.920]  i'm not gonna say that i happen to know about angelina joe lee and brad pit
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:02.200]  i have to know their entire new world order
[2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:05.680]  and i have to know that they're uh... that she's being co-opted in the name of
[2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:07.240]  helping african children
[2:18:07.240 --> 2:18:09.560]  so just because she's a member of the cfr
[2:18:09.560 --> 2:18:12.920]  doesn't mean angelina joe lee is new world or no some of the films
[2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:15.120]  they're trying to suck her in the point is
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:18.000]  is that is that we can't become a bunch of mccarthy aides
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.160]  talking about the activists the point is
[2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:22.040]  north com has announced this
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:23.240]  this is happening
[2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:27.160]  and why do people in our movement always police us
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:30.480]  instead of looking away at what's happening in most of time their operatives
[2:18:30.480 --> 2:18:32.860]  and they explain the army field manual
[2:18:32.860 --> 2:18:34.320]  how to go out and
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:37.280]  and and and claim that the real activist or agents
[2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:39.440]  that's so fast they'll have to take a look at that
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:43.120]  uh... well in the meantime i think we need to create some positive strategy for
[2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:44.600]  what
[2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:47.800]  do i mean one of the things i really want to people do is
[2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:50.880]  and again you've been very instrumental in helping me get past
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:54.640]  uh... being stuck in this left-right paradigm is that we really need to build
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:58.120]  the transport of the army of citizens what i'm urging people to do it
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:00.880]  you know in a closing society when individuals
[2:19:00.880 --> 2:19:03.760]  they know according to their own circumstances it's very powerful to
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:06.320]  send them a message people around you to like
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:08.920]  when officers at the rnc refused to arrest you
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:11.080]  iraq that for for peace
[2:19:11.080 --> 2:19:12.840]  that's the way to say no uh...
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:15.760]  talking about impeachment by part of the impeachment prosecution of the
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:19.040]  president is a way to say no we can talk about that when you like
[2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:22.080]  well i don't know if you're ready now yes sure for the internet audience i'm
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:25.000]  going to skip this break everybody else be right back with your phone calls
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:30.480]  on the other side now me wolf is our guest
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:33.360]  they only i know we're all over the map it's because i have such passion like
[2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:34.160]  you do
[2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:38.160]  on this subject and i know what to say and i know they've been creeping up
[2:19:38.160 --> 2:19:39.460]  setting it up
[2:19:39.460 --> 2:19:41.920]  i've been studying it probably nobody else
[2:19:41.920 --> 2:19:45.080]  for a little and it just it's up so sad for my children my wife
[2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:48.400]  my family for for everybody else because i know
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:50.000]  how real it is and
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:53.560]  and and and and i've seen the video the police saying
[2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:56.920]  as they're beating you i have rights i have rights it's so
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:20:00.720]  sick and it's so and they're destroying their own future you know they're
[2:20:00.720 --> 2:20:02.840]  compartmentalized
[2:20:02.840 --> 2:20:06.280]  and most of her post-traumatic stress disorder trips are completely mentally
[2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:07.160]  ill
[2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:11.200]  uh... you know from i mean they they put in three four five tours on purpose
[2:20:11.200 --> 2:20:12.560]  to fry their brains
[2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:14.280]  all my god i never thought of that
[2:20:14.280 --> 2:20:18.960]  now we will we've got government documents on that as well show that oh my god
[2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:21.080]  yeah you know this is uh...
[2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:24.920]  this is what is your wife i mean what you know what are your plans practically
[2:20:24.920 --> 2:20:25.560]  you know
[2:20:25.560 --> 2:20:28.920]  we're just going to go down with america i mean we're gonna stay here and just
[2:20:28.920 --> 2:20:31.760]  like i guess mustada or something and uh...
[2:20:31.760 --> 2:20:35.160]  i mean i think we can stop it if we're bold if we have courage
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:37.760]  if we speak out if we say no
[2:20:37.760 --> 2:20:41.640]  i mean what's most encouraging is i had a couple members of congress on and i saw
[2:20:41.640 --> 2:20:44.800]  others as i think i saw feinstein say nine thousand one calls with the other
[2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:46.920]  congressman said about a thousand to one
[2:20:46.920 --> 2:20:49.640]  phone calls against the banker takeover bill
[2:20:49.640 --> 2:20:50.820]  yet but did it help
[2:20:50.820 --> 2:20:53.720]  well will they threaten martial law so no it didn't but the point is
[2:20:53.720 --> 2:20:54.600]  is that
[2:20:54.600 --> 2:20:57.960]  no dictatorship can make it with ninety plus percent against him
[2:20:57.960 --> 2:21:01.080]  and and and and and so that's why they need
[2:21:01.080 --> 2:21:02.640]  a new president
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:05.960]  uh... because it's a new front and people think it's changed to take a north
[2:21:05.960 --> 2:21:07.840]  com runs everything
[2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:11.720]  they're in total control it was really set up in ninety three not in two thousand
[2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:12.200]  two
[2:21:12.200 --> 2:21:15.480]  and uh... their speeches cfr put out
[2:21:15.480 --> 2:21:16.560]  in ninety three but
[2:21:16.560 --> 2:21:18.280]  instead of me preaching i want to hear
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:21.680]  uh... your solutions and and i also want to uh...
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:25.440]  take uh... phone calls but uh... okay but you know well we're in between to have
[2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:28.200]  a minute to ask you a question where we're going to go ahead
[2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:31.360]  but i think i thought that before but you know i've been to a band that can't
[2:21:31.360 --> 2:21:32.640]  want foreign relations
[2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:35.560]  and i've you know there are a lot of color and i know all these words go and
[2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:37.280]  i've never
[2:21:37.280 --> 2:21:41.080]  but never have anyone crossed my path with any hint of these
[2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:42.360]  you know other
[2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:45.320]  other agenda i mean i guess what i said to you last time is that
[2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:46.160]  anne lee
[2:21:46.160 --> 2:21:50.960]  doesn't need to plan if you know well overtly in the sense of
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:54.200]  you know by definition of the colors are in various positions of influence in
[2:21:54.200 --> 2:21:56.160]  it but there's no nobody ever
[2:21:56.160 --> 2:21:59.440]  it's about an agenda the kind you describe well i'm aware of well well
[2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:00.480]  here's the deal
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:03.320]  uh... not ever my son everybody that becomes a road scholars it's so
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:05.480]  expanded you know is on the inner circle but
[2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:11.640]  she's will road city wanted an invisible british empire
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:12.640]  groups
[2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:14.160]  and uh...
[2:22:14.160 --> 2:22:17.240]  you know you got like bowl clinton with cord wire over and with the c.i. section
[2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:18.440]  chief in london
[2:22:18.440 --> 2:22:20.360]  and and i mean all of that so
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:22.760]  so it's not these things certainly
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:25.160]  uh... go on but i judge a tree
[2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:28.060]  but its fruits and and and the key here is now me
[2:22:28.060 --> 2:22:30.640]  i want to prepare my audience for victory
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:34.480]  you know right uh... i mean they're so shock if i get movie stars on a rock and
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:39.520]  role people or, you know, foreign presidents, I mean, we have to be ready that we're telling
[2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:43.240]  the truth, that we're going to have allies, that people on the inside, people who've been
[2:22:43.240 --> 2:22:48.200]  part of the establishment, are going to wake up and join us, and we have to understand
[2:22:48.200 --> 2:22:51.880]  that, you know, as we have some victories, people go, it's impossible, we couldn't be
[2:22:51.880 --> 2:22:56.200]  having a victory, they must be agents, and that's not what's happening, is that-
[2:22:56.200 --> 2:23:03.320]  So much of this system is based on people in newspapers, in media, in the elite, you
[2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:07.640]  know, mid-level elite, thinking it's a good system and not seeing the big picture, and
[2:23:07.640 --> 2:23:12.640]  as we pull the veil aside, we better be ready to have a bunch of allies, we better be ready
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:15.840]  to have victories and not have this loser attitude.
[2:23:15.840 --> 2:23:21.440]  I hear what you're saying, and I think that's very positive, can I ask, because your voice
[2:23:21.440 --> 2:23:27.640]  is very influential, if it's appropriate for you to ever vouch for me, you know, in terms
[2:23:27.640 --> 2:23:28.640]  of these-
[2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:32.560]  Well Naomi, I mean, I say judge a tree by its fruits, and all your suggestions are great
[2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:36.520]  and the information you put out is very accurate, and they don't like what you're doing right
[2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:42.040]  now, and they're trying to counter it, so certainly, clearly, you're against this,
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:43.320]  and so it doesn't matter.
[2:23:43.320 --> 2:23:47.280]  The information stands on its face, and I mean, I do vouch that your information is
[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:52.400]  accurate, and you seem like a very nice, intelligent person who means well, and you talk about
[2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:57.240]  shattering the left-right paradigm, not just on the show, but I've seen you do it elsewhere,
[2:23:57.240 --> 2:23:59.920]  and that's what they don't want, they don't want people coming together.
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:04.040]  Up, here we go, back live.
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:07.920]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[2:24:07.920 --> 2:24:08.920]  The bankman.
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:13.920]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[2:24:13.920 --> 2:24:19.000]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:25.640]  He ain't my friend, and I'll ride again, and I'll ride again.
[2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:37.160]  Naomi Wolfe is our guest, and I want to go to some phone calls, but Naomi, plug where
[2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:41.880]  people get the new book, where they get the new video, specifically, I mean, I don't think
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:45.520]  they get it on Amazon in places, but specifically, how do they go to the sites?
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:46.520]  Sure.
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:51.840]  Well, the new book is called Give Me Liberty, and you can get it in bookstores or on Amazon,
[2:24:51.840 --> 2:24:58.120]  or on my website, and there's a new movie of the end of America, and our distribution
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:02.680]  strategy is very much influenced by Alec Jones basically saying, let the people have the
[2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:07.480]  information, and let them have it in a way that works for them, no matter what.
[2:25:07.480 --> 2:25:12.320]  So a lot of people have moved to Heaven and Earth to do an internet release yesterday,
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:17.480]  so you can go to endofamericamovie.com and just download it for free, or order the DVD
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:22.760]  if you like, and people can do screenings, which we're urging them to do for their fellow
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:25.400]  citizens, for their neighbors and friends, to alert them.
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:30.960]  It's very vivid footage, a lot of archival footage, interviews with journalists, and
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:34.760]  politicians have come forward, and ordinary Americans whose lives have been ruined by
[2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:39.440]  these 10 steps, and who've stood up and fought back, and then their action steps.
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:44.920]  And at myamericaproject.org, we're building, it's not completed yet, but we're in the
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:50.760]  process of building a site where citizens, we want to build a trans-partisan movement
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:57.520]  of many millions of Americans to be a kind of an army for the Constitution, an army for
[2:25:57.520 --> 2:26:03.560]  the restoration of the rule of law, and we're in a war, as Alec says, there are shades of
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:07.400]  difference in our understanding of the war, but clearly, and give me liberty, we're in
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:11.000]  a war, it's a war against citizens, we have to recognize that we're in a war, we're in
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:15.400]  the front lines, and the war is being kind of waged in a very stealthy way, and it's
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:17.080]  time for us to fight back.
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:21.640]  So at the end, just give me liberty, these 55 action steps, whether it's, here's how
[2:26:21.640 --> 2:26:26.080]  you write the op-ed, here's how you become the media, here's how you do radio, it's
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:29.840]  not just Alex Jones and Naomi Wolfe, it should be everyone who's concerned about these issues,
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:32.720]  raising their voices, creating media, documenting.
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:40.040]  Well, Naomi, that's the key, that's what tells me you're for real, and that your heart is
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:45.640]  in the right place with people asking that, is because you're saying to individuals, go
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:50.400]  out with the info, take action, and then the info you're putting out is accurate, and so
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:56.720]  instead of arguing about whether Naomi Wolfe or Alex Jones are good men or women, folks,
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:03.160]  we have a predatory elite, criminally consolidating and vertically integrating the world economy
[2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:09.480]  under tyrannical globalism, and we have to stand up, and we have to fight back, and we
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:14.400]  have to say no now, and I say to the military and the police and the bureaucrats and all
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:20.380]  of you, you're in there, you're tightly sequestered, kind of mob, gang mentality, little peer
[2:27:20.380 --> 2:27:25.000]  pressure cultures, we have no future if you don't break out of that, and I assure you
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:28.800]  things are going to lead in this country, and the globalist plan this to be very violent
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:31.840]  and very bloody, it's not going to go well for you, and the globalists are going to
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:37.080]  come in posing as the saviors later with the velvet glove fist after you've been discredited
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:42.800]  and a lot of you go into prison, so I see an even larger setup in all of that, and so
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:47.200]  I'm warning you, you better do a gut check, an intellectual check, and stand up for the
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:50.920]  Bill of Rights, the Constitution, if you can't see that what the executive's doing and what
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:56.120]  the Congress is doing is tyrannical on its face, now then you better look again, Naomi
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:27:57.640]  again, give out those websites.
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:04.720]  Sure thing, it's endofamericamovie.com, and it's myamericaproject.org, and again we're
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:14.520]  building those 55 steps, so you can also reach me at NaomiWolf.com, and yeah, and I'm going
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:19.000]  to various cities as well, and we're signing people up there to pass legislation to restore
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.360]  the Constitution, the rule of law, to organize people into democracy commando teams where
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:29.360]  you can take power back and be as powerful as vested interests with your representatives.
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:33.560]  We're calling for a national referendum, for instance, to give power back to the people
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:38.560]  and break the stranglehold of special interests over Congress, you know, against 55 action
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:42.560]  steps, you can start your own political movement, you can, you know, we teach you how to fundraise,
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:44.560]  we teach you how to start an on-profit.
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:48.960]  And regardless, the ideas she's putting out or have been proven in work, just take it
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:52.920]  and do your own model, folks, instead of rationalizing, I don't know if I like her, I don't know
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:57.000]  if I agree with her, I don't know if I like Alex, fine, take what you want and leave
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:01.440]  the rest, just get up off your butts and move against this tyranny now instead of in the
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:06.840]  peanut gallery, you know, playing secret agent all day, get out there, expose the tyranny,
[2:29:06.840 --> 2:29:09.680]  expose the unconstitutional garbage, we're going to come right back and I promise we're
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:12.360]  going to write to your calls, we're going to skip this break too for the Internet audience
[2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:20.960]  right now, stay with us.
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:26.680]  Naomi, another thing I can do, and we did this at DNC, we had several hundred cameras
[2:29:26.680 --> 2:29:32.880]  there and I believe that's why they didn't stage as much as at the RNC, and now it's
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:36.960]  happened in Canada and other places where we catch the police posing as anarchists and
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:41.800]  we have people spread out who never stay in the crowd so that when the cop runs up in
[2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:51.040]  the anarchist outfit and tumps over a trash can or knocks out some windows, our people
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:56.080]  have successfully followed them and then caught them going into police areas and coming back
[2:29:56.080 --> 2:30:00.800]  out, playing clothes, dressed and it's made mainstream news in Canada, the US, Italy,
[2:30:00.800 --> 2:30:05.480]  Germany and England as well as Russia, all governments do this, these provocateurs and
[2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:10.040]  that's what's going to devastate them is us and everybody can choose their combat role
[2:30:10.040 --> 2:30:15.160]  in the Info War, A, we're peaceful, A, the enemy tries to infiltrate even mainline peace
[2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:18.520]  groups and says let's go kill cops and it always turns out that's a cop and it comes
[2:30:18.520 --> 2:30:23.120]  out in the news, anybody that does that as a fed or a provocateur, never allow anything
[2:30:23.120 --> 2:30:27.840]  violent, understand that the big foundations, the left and the right foundations are funding
[2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:34.000]  the anarchist, not all of them but the main groups to do that and the other key is again,
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:39.040]  don't wait, do a one page newsletter and print up 100 copies every week and put it on 100
[2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:43.320]  doors, I mean that will bring down the tyranny, get my film in game, make copies of it, get
[2:30:43.320 --> 2:30:47.880]  it out to people, spread the word about films like Terror Storm, the history government sponsored
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:53.000]  terror or Naomi Wolff's film, have parties, have people over show it because don't imagine
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:57.640]  you've got to fix it all yourself, it's every person moving with purpose, once you really
[2:30:57.640 --> 2:31:01.760]  take action, it's like Willie Nelson said first hour, it's almost the subconscious
[2:31:01.760 --> 2:31:07.320]  will just kick in, with that rightness of purpose and we don't want a cookie cutter,
[2:31:07.320 --> 2:31:12.280]  we don't want a single head, we don't want Alex Jones and Amy Wolff to be the leader,
[2:31:12.280 --> 2:31:16.520]  we need lots, thousands of leaders with tens of thousands of millions of other sub leaders
[2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:21.720]  coordinating with different things, not a cookie cutter, hitting them at every angle,
[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:25.320]  welcome to cops when you see them on the street, going up to police, I do it every time I
[2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:29.400]  have time, I say, hey guys, been trained for urban warfare, you know, know about this stuff,
[2:31:29.400 --> 2:31:32.880]  you know that happens in history, it's going to destroy your future, your dollars aren't
[2:31:32.880 --> 2:31:38.000]  buying as much, they're going to take your pensions and you know, I mean the point is,
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:43.520]  is that it's really starting to work and so I want people to understand, be positive,
[2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:50.800]  move forward, take action and I think the covert operations, you can call it investigative
[2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:55.000]  reporting, I wouldn't call it spying when you do it or they'll try to set you up for
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:59.680]  that, that's now been happening, but as an investigative reporter of the First Amendment,
[2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:02.800]  surveilling corrupt judges, these people are all so evil, you just follow them, you'll
[2:32:02.800 --> 2:32:06.040]  catch them cheating on their wife, you'll catch them buying drugs, you'll catch them,
[2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:09.840]  I mean most of them, these are criminals running government now in most areas, I mean if they
[2:32:09.840 --> 2:32:14.160]  go along with this they're crooks, you'll catch the Homeland Security Director's pedophiles,
[2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:18.840]  that's a pedophile guild up there, especially in the Republicans, follow them, bust them,
[2:32:18.840 --> 2:32:24.800]  I mean we got to get, all of you are agents of liberty, literally sabotaging the enemy
[2:32:24.800 --> 2:32:30.360]  operation, start seeing yourself, targets of opportunity, don't dress up in camo, dress
[2:32:30.360 --> 2:32:35.400]  up in a nice business outfit, that's your real urban camo, you are there in the police
[2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:39.600]  department, in the military, in government, spying on the enemy operations, giving us
[2:32:39.600 --> 2:32:44.360]  the data, we are going to win, we have friends all over the place, our numbers are growing,
[2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:52.200]  our numbers are dwindling, here we go back live.
[2:32:52.200 --> 2:33:01.800]  I swear on the eternal altar of liberty, resistance for eternity against tyrants, thugs, control
[2:33:01.800 --> 2:33:09.080]  freaks, scum, liars, I commit myself to truth and justice, all those things they told you
[2:33:09.080 --> 2:33:19.360]  were sappy, because if you don't have liberty, you have nothing, our economy can fully implode,
[2:33:19.360 --> 2:33:26.640]  but if we have liberty, it'll come back, the enemy tells us that the terrorists attacked,
[2:33:26.640 --> 2:33:30.400]  because they hate our freedom and it's true, military industrial complex carried out the
[2:33:30.400 --> 2:33:35.640]  9-11 attacks and many others, because they hate your liberty, they've committed a million
[2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:41.320]  crimes, they've got to go for broke, because they've done so many legal things that if
[2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:46.240]  they don't bring in total tyranny, they know that free people can get control of the government
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:50.520]  again and bring them to justice, Naomi Wolfe, I want you to comment on the points I just
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:54.000]  made with your own unique perspective, and then we're going to go to the phone calls.
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:34:04.040]  Well I love the shift in energy from analyzing the threat, here it comes, here the 10 steps,
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:08.400]  which certainly makes us feel afraid, especially I am a mother of two beautiful children, feel
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:12.880]  afraid when I think about that, and sometimes feel powerless or overwhelmed, and then shifting
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:19.280]  into the message of, well, we do have power, there are millions of us, our numbers are
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:24.680]  growing, people are waking up, here's what you can do, you can go talk to military, talk
[2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:29.680]  to police officers, educate your neighbors, we were saying before the break, write those
[2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:33.840]  op-eds, we teach people and give them liberty, here's how you frame the debate, here's how
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:40.360]  you leak to a reporter, here's how you document government abuses, so much that we can do,
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:44.840]  and I love Willie Nelson's point, because artists have a lot of wisdom at a time like
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:49.600]  this, the subconscious is powerful, and so if we shift from a fierce state of, oh my
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:54.800]  god, here they come, to a kind of state of joy in finding one another and creative problem
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:58.960]  solving, and again, drawing on that wisdom, the founding generation men have to have,
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:03.960]  this group of absolutely ordinary people, farmers and artisans and working men and women,
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:08.200]  washer women and enslaved African Americans, not just the well-known founders, all of whom
[2:35:08.200 --> 2:35:13.680]  took extraordinary risks, and broke up the power of the biggest empire of the day, right,
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:17.240]  that's what they did, we've got to do that again, but my study of history absolutely
[2:35:17.240 --> 2:35:23.000]  shows that when millions of people make that psychological shift, it is overwhelming for
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:27.720]  the would-be tyrants, they can strike and strike and strike, but they're facing a hydra,
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:32.880]  you know, when the people really are energized and knowledgeable and standing up for one another
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:34.680]  and standing up for the conservation.
[2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:39.080]  That's right, the enemy is a hydra, we have to have a hydra-like approach, with, you know,
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:41.280]  they got a thousand heads, we got a million heads.
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:44.720]  Except we have 300 million, we can be a hydra for liberty.
[2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:49.520]  Absolutely, we've got to do it, wow, Naomi Wolfe, you know, I haven't read the new book,
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:53.840]  I did purchase the original book when I was going to have you on, you sent me one, it's
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:58.600]  an easy read, but well done, you know, the end of America, I have the new one, just two
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:03.600]  weeks ago Rick Linkletter's been out of the country making a movie about, I think it's
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:04.600]  H.G.
[2:36:04.600 --> 2:36:08.080]  Wells, the point is he's been in England for a year, he was back about six months ago
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:12.440]  for a birthday party and I was out of his house, out of his ranch, but it came in the
[2:36:12.440 --> 2:36:17.360]  mail, your book, the end of America, a little nice note from him, and of course Rick's a
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:21.680]  patriot knows 9-11's an inside job, but the point is, is that your book and your material
[2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:26.080]  is really getting out to people because he bought that book in England and then mailed
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:30.720]  it to me, I think he's in the Isle of Man finishing up the movie, it's H.G.
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:31.720]  Something, is it H.G.
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:32.720]  Wells or H.G.
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:36.200]  Wells, I don't remember how to pull the article up, but the point is, is that your book is
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:40.800]  really getting out there, Jared in Florida, you're on the air with Naomi Wolfe and Chris
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:46.160]  Richard, Tweedle Dee, and then Summer, go ahead Jared, you're on the air.
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:48.160]  Hey, what's going on Alex?
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:49.160]  Good.
[2:36:49.160 --> 2:36:53.480]  Hey, I'm a prison planet subscriber, I've been listening to you for about six months,
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:57.000]  and before I start listening to you, I used to hate my country, you know, we do all this
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:00.200]  crappy stuff, but I mean, you totally turned it around.
[2:37:00.200 --> 2:37:05.080]  Now you know it's a criminal military-industrial complex that has subdued us through high-tech
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:09.560]  propaganda, now their propaganda isn't working, so they're moving in with physical control,
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:14.320]  see, and then we don't get the guilt of the wars and the evil because we don't deserve
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:17.880]  all that guilt, I mean, we deserve the fact that we were slovenly and let this happen,
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:22.600]  but we, I mean, people need to see the evil, so they have a choice to really sign on to
[2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:23.600]  it or not.
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:28.840]  Exactly, I mean, I've never been fully blind to it, my parent always knew about, you know,
[2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:34.720]  the Iran stuff in 1950, I mean, I've never been too blind to it, but it's like your
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:39.760]  videos have definitely made it like definitive, I can actually tell people, hey, this is mainstream
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:43.880]  news, don't you guys see this, and I burned all your DVDs, I sent it out, it's great
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:44.880]  man.
[2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:48.240]  But one thing I'd like to ask you, I remember a couple months ago you were covering about
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:37:52.640]  how hard it is to transfer your wealth to other countries, do you think when the crap
[2:37:52.640 --> 2:37:55.880]  hits the fan, it's gonna be hard just to get out of the country, I mean, I'm a dual
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:37:59.680]  citizen with New Zealand, and if it really happens, I mean, I plan on getting out of
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:00.680]  here.
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:06.800]  Here's the deal, that's what the watch list now over a million people is, which you
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:10.160]  can never get off of, and the news acts like it's just idiots up there, and that's why
[2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:12.880]  it's that way, it's always, oh, we don't know how to run things, but it's all their
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:15.000]  political enemies.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:21.560]  Yes, the New World Order, the OECD, the International Bank of Settlements, that's about internationally
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:26.000]  having the same rules, the same computer databases, the same systems, which they use the war on
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.280]  terror to integrate as they're covered, to where now if you want to go fishing 12 miles
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:36.240]  off the coast, they're trying to make you have a passport down in Port Aransas or Galveston
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:42.640]  to go fishing, they now have a North American ID card for people to travel, they're now
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:45.880]  admitting that face scanning cameras have been up for 10 years or tracking everybody
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:53.480]  everywhere we go, they're scanning our license plates everywhere we go, Pentagon Design,
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:57.360]  I saw it in Pentagon documents 10 years ago, now it's mainstream news, yeah, you're tracked
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:02.000]  everywhere you go, and that's how they get the face recognition, not just from getting
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  your digital photo of the driver's license facility, it's really federalized, not with
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:08.520]  real ID, it was done in 93 with executive order, it was international ID, we have a
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:16.000]  World ID as of 2000 under World Treaty, they're just not telling us about real ID in 2008,
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:20.560]  there's so many facets to all this and I want to get to other calls, but we already have
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:25.560]  a World ID that's over most nations, they're mopping up the few final rogue nations, and
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:30.920]  then the real work of eugenics against free humanity can begin, the one child policy worldwide,
[2:39:30.920 --> 2:39:35.400]  the population reduction, the true horrors are to come, this is just the clamping down
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:42.920]  the last bastions of freedom and liberty right now, but there is resistance to it, so yes,
[2:39:42.920 --> 2:39:50.840]  here's what happened, they, the elite changed the bankruptcy rules, so small people have
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:55.360]  trouble declaring bankruptcy, the elites had tax incentives to move their money offshore
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:40:00.160]  and then two years ago, changed it where it's hard now if you stayed behind to get out,
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:04.480]  and that's why there was a huge exodus right up to two years ago, as everybody left to
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:11.160]  Dubai and to Switzerland and to Rome and to, you know, to Spain, and then something bad
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:15.920]  is going to happen in Israel, of the ten richest guys there, nine of them have fully left Israel
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:20.440]  for London and Switzerland, and so the elite are all evacuating, most of the elites I know
[2:40:20.440 --> 2:40:25.560]  in Austin have evacuated to the Cook Islands or New Zealand or Australia, so there is a
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:31.160]  massive, I can't get into details, but I know these people and they have said that we're
[2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:34.680]  evacuating because of martial law, and I've been telling you that for several years, Naomi
[2:40:34.680 --> 2:40:36.680]  Wolfe comments.
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:45.120]  Well, you know, I'm Jewish and so, you know, I think there's this very deep reaction in
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:51.720]  people with my ancestry because my dad's family was largely wiped out by the Holocaust, sensitivity
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:56.040]  to travel restrictions because for, you know, for people of my ethnicity, there's this giant
[2:40:56.040 --> 2:41:01.120]  divide between people who got out before the border hardened, you know, during the national
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:07.680]  socialist regime and those who waited a little too long, so I watch with concern when I travel,
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:12.400]  you know, I watch with concern the growth of the watch list, which Alex rightly noted
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:18.440]  is going, you know, 20,000 names a month because in closing societies, the watch lists always
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:24.640]  eventually connect to job losses and travel restrictions or worse, and I'm also noticing
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:28.480]  with concern the hardening of the borders, there's a fence being built along the southern
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:35.880]  border and also a more and more kind of Homeland Security type monitoring to Canada, and I'm
[2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:41.600]  very concerned that I keep reading reports that there's legislation being floated that
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:46.400]  would lead you to have to apply to Homeland Security or apply to the federal government
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:53.240]  to travel overseas because in a closing society, one thing they always do is close borders
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:54.240]  so that, you know...
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:57.800]  And by the way, the fence is going to be used to keep us in, not people out.
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:00.800]  They're just going to legalize everybody in the North American continent.
[2:42:00.800 --> 2:42:04.520]  That's been stated in the Council on Fire and Relations documents by Robert Pasteur
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:10.560]  and others, so that's what they do, and they set the precedence of violating due process
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:14.920]  and whole families' rights with the illegal aliens, and I'm against them having their
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:18.960]  rights violated by the way, folks, it should all be done due process, and then that sets
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:25.600]  the precedent for the citizens as Oliver North proposed with poindexter, Admiral Poindexter
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:31.320]  in the 80s, this was declassified, they would use the front of rounding up illegal immigrants
[2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:35.960]  first to sell the public on mass arrest, and the Houston Chronicle two years ago reported
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:41.840]  that indeed the FEMA camps are for illegals and citizens, so see, that's being used as
[2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:45.240]  a smoke screen even with law enforcement to think, well, it's to get rid of the illegal
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:47.640]  aliens, but that's not really what it's for.
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:52.520]  Just like in Nazi Germany, they first used it on unpopular minorities first.
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:58.760]  Exactly, so you anticipated, anticipated, my next point, this awareness of the need
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:04.880]  to stand up and call a halt, the tactic is always the closing society to go after people
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:09.960]  who are seen as marginal or unpopular or the wrong race, you know, Muslims or Jews
[2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:15.560]  or, you know, anarchists or communists, you know, in the National Socialist Era, and certainly
[2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:21.720]  the mass arrests this spring of illegal aliens or illegal immigrants is very distressing
[2:43:21.720 --> 2:43:27.760]  to me because if Americans were in good patriotic work in order recognizing their rights, we
[2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:33.200]  would be screaming as loudly that undocumented workers without papers were having agents
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:39.120]  of the state break in, drag them away from their children, you know, locked down, processed
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:43.880]  without due process, mass processing, fairgrounds in the Midwest with blacked out windows.
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:49.520]  Which FEMA called a drill, and we had people inside that, they were drilling during that
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:52.080]  for the American people.
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:53.080]  That was a test.
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:54.080]  What evidence do you have?
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:43:55.080]  I mean, what evidence do you have?
[2:43:55.080 --> 2:43:58.200]  I had sources inside of it in the town and inside of it.
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:43:59.200]  That's all I can say.
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:00.200]  Why can't we get these people to go on the record?
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:01.760]  Well, let me stop you.
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:06.880]  I had a pastor on two and a half years ago, butch Paul had him on first year on the network,
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:09.360]  who was in Ohio, then we had another preacher on.
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:12.160]  He faxed me all these documents, he said, you're allowed to post them.
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:16.840]  He said, no, don't black out the fax phone number, it's just a little mini-mart.
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:21.680]  Well, the 13,000 preachers that have been hired by Homeland Security to teach at FEMA,
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:25.520]  to teach their flocks, to turn their guns in, to go to FEMA camps, to take the force
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:26.520]  inoculations.
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:27.520]  Have you heard about that?
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:28.520]  No.
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:29.520]  John, cue it up.
[2:44:29.520 --> 2:44:30.520]  She won't believe it.
[2:44:30.520 --> 2:44:33.080]  Remember the piece that was carried on the news, the national news?
[2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:35.880]  Find one of them where their preachers called for martial law.
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:41.240]  And then a year after that happened, it was in some national and local news, but by then
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:43.000]  it was 26,000 preachers.
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  They doubled the number.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:47.600]  They called clergy response teams, which is something Hitler did.
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:50.000]  Now, now, yeah, but it's secret.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:55.840]  Now one week after he came on my show and we posted the documents, the FBI went to the
[2:44:55.840 --> 2:45:02.000]  mini-mart, demanded and interrogated them and asked them who was in here that day, who
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  sent these faxes.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:07.120]  It was over a hundred pages and they said it's the local pastor as a church of about
[2:45:07.120 --> 2:45:08.120]  400 people.
[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:13.280]  He also volunteered for people who were sick and dying at the hospital.
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:17.680]  And when he came into his job at the hospital, FEMA was there with the FBI and the guy was
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:22.440]  scared and they said, you can be arrested under national security.
[2:45:22.440 --> 2:45:27.440]  You no longer are welcome in any government facility or hospital and we're watching you.
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:28.440]  It's ready.
[2:45:28.440 --> 2:45:31.280]  And then he was basically put on a no fly list.
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:35.200]  So and it turns out the other preacher, then we didn't even put out documents.
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:40.800]  They visited him because they have these guys all under NSA surveillance with keyword computers.
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:44.880]  So the minute they do an interview on their home phone, they're under surveillance.
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:48.560]  The NSA computer records it, an agent comes in and sees they're talking.
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:51.880]  And then now that was before it came out.
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:52.880]  Here it is.
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:45:55.640]  You found the local one out of Louisiana.
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:58.720]  Here they are introducing it through Katrina, but this is nationwide.
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:00.440]  This came out one year after we broke it.
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:03.360]  The secret FEMA documents are on infowars.com.
[2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:04.360]  Here it is.
[2:46:04.360 --> 2:46:10.520]  Will ever become a reality in America, some fear any nuclear, biological or chemical attack
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:13.960]  on U.S. territory might trigger just that.
[2:46:13.960 --> 2:46:18.000]  And as KCLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:21.160]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:24.480]  From my cold dead hands.
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:30.480]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:32.440]  to protect our freedoms.
[2:46:32.440 --> 2:46:37.480]  That gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:39.480]  Katrina in New Orleans.
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:41.400]  U.S. troops also arrived.
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:46.920]  Something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:48.520]  Kamatotis Act.
[2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:53.840]  That forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil.
[2:46:53.840 --> 2:46:58.280]  If martial law weren't acted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:03.040]  public fears and quelling dissent would be critical, and that's exactly what the clergy
[2:47:03.040 --> 2:47:06.800]  response team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:10.360]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:14.040]  with and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:18.720]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus
[2:47:18.720 --> 2:47:20.360]  the wishes of the public.
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:25.040]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're
[2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:27.480]  helping to diffuse that situation.
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:31.640]  Under the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:38.840]  down or obey the law is the Bible itself, specifically Romans, Romans 13.
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:42.520]  Because the government's established all the law, you know, and that's what we believe
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:43.520]  in the Christian faith.
[2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:45.280]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:50.200]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:54.800]  how long they expect a suspension of their rights might last.
[2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:57.120]  Jeff Carroll, KSLA News 12, reporting.
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:48:02.280]  Naomi being a historian and knowing about World War II, Hitler's favorite line was
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:04.600]  Romans 13.
[2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:05.600]  So go ahead and comment.
[2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:06.600]  We'll go to some more calls.
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:14.000]  I mean, this is a tough conversation because you're bringing the information that is so
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  truly shocking.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  It's a thousand times worse Naomi, it's so bad I can't even explain it all.
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  All right.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:24.440]  CIA runs every major city, FEMA camps are built, most police chiefs are bought off and
[2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:25.440]  paid for.
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:27.360]  It's total mafia takeover.
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:30.520]  Well, let me just take it step by step.
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:36.120]  I did want to say when I expressed kind of unease at how many people are telling me a
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:40.440]  data that needs to be followed up on, but are reluctant to give me their names.
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:46.640]  The most recent one was in California, a gentleman came up to me and said, I was hired to do
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:52.000]  IT work at one of these camps, it's near Bakersfield, I've seen it with my own eyes, and I've seen
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:59.760]  with my own eyes, he said the train, train cars with shackles on the floor and they're
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:01.760]  painted white and I've witnessed this.
[2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:05.880]  By the way, I've seen them, I've seen them, but go ahead.
[2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:13.760]  So I said, because I'm a reporter, I can't just circulate unattributed comments, a rumor,
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:17.600]  I said, will you go on the record or can I get another source to back you up?
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:23.560]  And he said that he's a dual citizen or he's an immigrant and he is scared to come forward.
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:29.960]  But he's a very credible, he seemed like a very sincere, concerned citizen and my gut
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:35.360]  intuition was that he wasn't, he was telling me about something that genuinely had disturbed
[2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:36.360]  and upset him.
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:39.320]  And he said they're massive, what he saw was massive.
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:43.200]  So obviously this is not reassuring to me.
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:48.520]  Well we have the 2002 purchase order for three one million man camps, I mean we have the
[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:51.880]  federal, they even put bids out, I mean it's not.
[2:49:51.880 --> 2:49:56.480]  Okay, I mean I'll look at, you know, of course I'll examine these documents, I think you've
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:50:00.680]  got to, you've got to be patient with me, Alex, because you know, the way I'm trained,
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:06.840]  I like look at the documents, source the documents, try to fit into the bigger picture, test it.
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:14.040]  Look into the civilian inmate labor camp program conducted from 1986 secretly until 1997 when
[2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:15.760]  it was declassified.
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:22.760]  Civilian inmate labor camp program, a secret archipelago of army run camps and they already
[2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:30.040]  have Americans in them, we'll explain behind the scenes right now.
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:36.000]  Okay, what they did is, they had army bases never in the public knowledge that would then
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:40.280]  take federal prisoners to be overseen by the army.
[2:50:40.280 --> 2:50:48.600]  There were 12 camps, Atterbury, Aniston, others, and then they expanded those to 24 when it
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:53.880]  was declassified in 97, and so, and now they take regular prisoners but that's setting
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:50:59.280]  the precedent and they admit it's a laboratory to train the military in the control of work
[2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:00.280]  brigades.
[2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:06.600]  Good God, we've seen those before, I hear you, so I've got to tell you, Alex, is that
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:11.440]  another citizen came up to me in San Francisco and he said, and he gave me his card and he
[2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:15.360]  said he can't go on the record yet because he's on parole but he said he's been, he was
[2:51:15.360 --> 2:51:19.360]  a federal prisoner and he said there are work camps and there are work brigades and
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:24.600]  that he was in them and he said he had been a democratic fundraiser and then the FBI came
[2:51:24.600 --> 2:51:30.320]  and he was arrested, the people are being arrested with family members.
[2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:32.440]  We have the work camps, the work camps are there.
[2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:38.560]  Okay, so this of course is a shock to me because I'm just living in the rest of the landscape
[2:51:38.560 --> 2:51:42.320]  with the rest of the landscape information stream and look at two things, they tried
[2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:47.840]  to pass a law in 2003 in Oregon, Senator Menace almost got it passed, no pun intended, and
[2:51:47.840 --> 2:51:54.120]  they almost passed a law four years ago in Rhode Island, it was in the Providence Journal
[2:51:54.120 --> 2:51:59.080]  and in NBC, it said if you criticize the government you will be arrested and you'll be given
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:04.360]  life in prison and a work brigade, both bills said work brigades, you can pull those up.
[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:10.600]  Good Lord, but I don't understand why so many public servants are going along with, I mean
[2:52:10.600 --> 2:52:17.120]  this is like multiple, multiple sources, I mean multiple, multiple levels of people conveying
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:18.120]  caring water.
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:21.960]  You know about the Princeton and Stanford research where they noticed that if an authority
[2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:26.800]  figure told graduate psychology students to kill someone with an electric shock and they
[2:52:26.800 --> 2:52:29.400]  believed it was real, 90 plus percent committed the murder?
[2:52:29.400 --> 2:52:32.520]  Absolutely, it's a bar to experiment, I believe you're referring to it.
[2:52:32.520 --> 2:52:33.520]  Yeah, well there's several, yes.
[2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:34.520]  I believe it was Princeton.
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:40.400]  So I am familiar with that, but why would so many congresspeople be supportive of this
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:41.640]  kind of legislation?
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:44.880]  Because they know, they know how real it is, they all know, I talked to congressmen on
[2:52:44.880 --> 2:52:47.760]  air and privately and they go absolutely right, Alex you're absolutely right.
[2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:51.560]  I had, they know, so why would they want to collude with it?
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:53.560]  They're scared.
[2:52:53.560 --> 2:52:57.600]  They understand how serious this is, they understand that the U.S. military and the
[2:52:57.600 --> 2:53:02.720]  global elites are hardcore and they decided to join with it.
[2:53:02.720 --> 2:53:05.880]  They decided to, you know, that a new age is upon us and they're going to join with
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:06.880]  Sauron basically.
[2:53:06.880 --> 2:53:13.520]  Well then what realistically, you know, in spite of our brave words as a few minutes
[2:53:13.520 --> 2:53:19.880]  ago, Naomi, you don't have the 11th point in your book and that's called, they try to
[2:53:19.880 --> 2:53:26.640]  take the guns and if 1% of 150 million gun owners fights back, that's 1,500,000 armed
[2:53:26.640 --> 2:53:34.760]  resistors against this tyranny and we're going to come back right now.
[2:53:34.760 --> 2:53:40.320]  We got Lindsay Williams with his oil being cut in half, a prediction coming true, joining
[2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:41.320]  us in about 10 minutes.
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:43.840]  I want to hold Naomi five over in the next hour if she can do it, if not she'll be gone
[2:53:43.840 --> 2:53:44.840]  in five.
[2:53:44.840 --> 2:53:51.080]  I just brought up to her the second amendment, the last line of defense.
[2:53:51.080 --> 2:53:55.480]  As a person breaking the left-right paradigm, Naomi, I know a lot of quote liberals that
[2:53:55.480 --> 2:53:59.480]  have been out the last two years, now understanding why we need the second amendment, I'm not
[2:53:59.480 --> 2:54:03.840]  calling for violence but if you're being taken in cattle cars to a FEMA facility, what do
[2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:04.840]  you do?
[2:54:04.840 --> 2:54:10.840]  Yeah, I have to say, you know, part of my education by many wonderful patriots I've
[2:54:10.840 --> 2:54:14.880]  met on this journey on the left and the right and beyond the left-right paradigm is that
[2:54:14.880 --> 2:54:17.400]  they've challenged my assumptions about the second amendment.
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:21.760]  I certainly was raised in a demographic that always thought that gun control was the most
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:26.080]  important way to keep people safe and now I think, it's not that I'm advocating violence
[2:54:26.080 --> 2:54:30.280]  ever, of course I'm not, this should be a peaceful revolution using the rule of law
[2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:36.840]  but I do understand, you know, that in a closing society as many people have noted, the regime
[2:54:36.840 --> 2:54:42.160]  will take away citizens' guns and I do understand now that there are times in history when we
[2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:46.000]  have worse problems than gun violence, you know, from gangs and so on, that a police
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:47.480]  state is a greater problem.
[2:54:47.480 --> 2:54:50.960]  I mean, is there a time for us to defend ourselves?
[2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:55.640]  Well, you're putting me in a very challenging position.
[2:54:55.640 --> 2:55:01.680]  I mean, we have to defend ourselves in every lawful and appropriate way we can with violence
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:03.320]  being the absolute...
[2:55:03.320 --> 2:55:08.160]  But if Adolf Hitler was our president, he would be lawful in the organic law to resist
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:13.160]  him as the general staff did but again, it's not a president here, it's the complex around
[2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:14.160]  him.
[2:55:14.160 --> 2:55:19.800]  Naomi, let me be clear, the enemy, the programmers, want us to fight back physically so they have
[2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:21.920]  a pretext to engage us.
[2:55:21.920 --> 2:55:27.720]  I do not believe in offensive military asymmetrical strikes against them but if they're rounding
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:32.480]  people up and taking them to FEMA camps, it is not a right, it is a duty in the Declaration
[2:55:32.480 --> 2:55:36.360]  of Independence to resist 110%.
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:40.040]  And I believe the American people, if we don't turn things around peacefully, we may do that.
[2:55:40.040 --> 2:55:41.040]  We have a chance.
[2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:47.920]  It is going to go to the next ballot box, which is the cartridge box, and it's going
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:48.920]  to be hell.
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:54.680]  Yeah, well, you know, let's first talk about peaceful revolution, the rule of law, because
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:59.840]  I think there are many women listening and many mothers like me who are sort of thinking
[2:55:59.840 --> 2:56:00.840]  God forbid.
[2:56:00.840 --> 2:56:05.480]  Let's do everything in our power to keep that from being the outcome, because of course
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:06.480]  you're right.
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:09.040]  When there's a coup, what happens next is, you know, battles in the streets in Civil
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:10.040]  War.
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:12.120]  I mean, it's just historically what happens.
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:16.120]  But you know, God forbid, and there's a lot of opportunity for us to use the rule of
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:17.120]  law.
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:19.920]  Let me talk about one action step I'm calling on people to do.
[2:56:19.920 --> 2:56:25.600]  There has been a coup, as I've argued, and so there should be immediate bipartisan impeachment
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:30.800]  proceedings and then the filing for prosecution and arrest of George Bush and other high officials
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:35.680]  who have committed, in my reading, treason, because they're making war against the American
[2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:40.560]  people, which in the Constitution, defines treason, making war in the United States.
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:44.560]  So there is a wonderful prosecutor, and I'm sure you've talked about her, Charlotte, a
[2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:49.920]  big apartment, a woman running for attorney general in Vermont, Charlotte Dennett, and
[2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:56.080]  she has promised to prosecute and arrest George Bush and other high officials who've committed
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:56:57.080]  high crimes.
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:04.000]  Yeah, well, that is the key, that is the key is to declare them criminals and illegitimate.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:08.200]  I'm just saying Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, a lot of us aren't going to run into pits and be
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:10.200]  shot in the back of the head.
[2:57:10.200 --> 2:57:11.680]  Nobody's taken my children.
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:12.680]  It's not happening.
[2:57:12.680 --> 2:57:16.520]  I'm not looking for a fight, but I'm asking the American people, if they try to take you
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:20.200]  to camps, resist them in the name of the Republic.
[2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:25.040]  Well, and I'm asking the American people to rise up and use the rule of law first because
[2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:27.280]  history shows that the real threat...
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:28.760]  But should we go to death camps?
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:31.080]  Should we go to death camps?
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:33.640]  Should we go ahead and give in and go to death camps, if they tell us this?
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:35.640]  Well, of course we shouldn't go to death camps.
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:41.160]  I mean, when, you know, there's a lot of models for, you know, even my people who are so kind
[2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:47.040]  of, you know, nonviolent by instinct, you know, there was resistance in the Warsaw ghetto.
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:52.280]  You know, obviously self-defense is an important American value.
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:57.080]  As Alexander Sheltzenica said, the machine would have ground to a halt of every night
[2:57:57.080 --> 2:58:00.720]  when the secret police came out to pick up citizens to take them to the gulags, they
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:05.920]  would have been met with daggers and hammers and hatchets in the doorways.
[2:58:05.920 --> 2:58:10.480]  We'll be right back with Naomi Wolfe's Five Final Minutes.
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:12.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:15.280]  I'm going to keep talking to her.
[2:58:15.280 --> 2:58:16.280]  Visit GCN.
[2:58:16.280 --> 2:58:19.080]  Naomi, you've got to leave us now or...
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:20.080]  I do.
[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:22.440]  I do, a car is coming for me in a couple of minutes.
[2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:23.440]  You can leave right now.
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:27.320]  It's interesting, this is definitely a gender divide because as a single mom, I don't have
[2:58:27.320 --> 2:58:29.080]  a firearm and I don't know how to use it.
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:30.720]  But where'd you grow up?
[2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:31.720]  In San Francisco.
[2:58:31.720 --> 2:58:36.200]  Well, I mean, the women around here, I mean, these are intellectual, powerful women.
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:40.080]  A true feminist, I am woman, hear me roar, they are locked and loaded and they're going
[2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:42.280]  to blow the new order straight to hell.
[2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:43.880]  You know, as I say, I'm definitely evolving.
[2:58:43.880 --> 2:58:46.240]  I think it's not a bad idea to know how to use that.
[2:58:46.240 --> 2:58:50.680]  Let me tell you, that's the true feminist, is that warrior female, gorgeous, strong,
[2:58:50.680 --> 2:58:55.120]  her babies aren't going to a FEMA camp, they're not getting shot up and I guarantee you, our
[2:58:55.120 --> 2:58:57.080]  women are going to resist as well.
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:58:59.240]  One way or the other, the new order is coming down.
[2:58:59.240 --> 2:59:05.280]  Okay, well, you know, I'll read anything you want me to and I should say goodbye to you
[2:59:05.280 --> 2:59:07.280]  because the car is waiting in the...
[2:59:07.280 --> 2:59:08.280]  We're going to let you go.
[2:59:08.280 --> 2:59:11.360]  Naomi, I appreciate you coming on and I want to, you know what, I don't want to wait three
[2:59:11.360 --> 2:59:12.760]  or four months to have you back up.
[2:59:12.760 --> 2:59:14.760]  Let's have you up on the eve of the election.
[2:59:14.760 --> 2:59:20.000]  I would love that and can I have Kelly get my new book to you, certainly, and get...
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:22.680]  I would love to make sure that the movie gets into your head.
[2:59:22.680 --> 2:59:26.240]  Well, this has been an amazing two-hour brainstorm and thank you for spending time with us.
[2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:28.320]  Thank you, I'm so grateful for your educating me, Alex.
[2:59:28.320 --> 2:59:30.600]  No, no, no, you've educated us a lot as well.
[2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:31.600]  Naomi Wolf, thank you.
[2:59:31.600 --> 2:59:32.600]  All right, thank you.
[2:59:32.600 --> 2:59:41.160]  All right, Naomi Wolf had it go, she had a car picking her up with some TV program.
[2:59:41.160 --> 2:59:47.480]  I'll jam in a few final phone calls right now and we'll keep taking them too with Lindsey
[2:59:47.480 --> 2:59:48.480]  Williams coming up.
[2:59:48.480 --> 2:59:52.760]  We've got some hardcore subjects there with her.
[2:59:52.760 --> 2:59:57.480]  You know, we're sold in the military, the police ruling us with weapons, but we can't
[2:59:57.480 --> 2:59:58.480]  defend ourselves.
[2:59:58.480 --> 2:59:59.480]  Oh, it's bad.
[2:59:59.480 --> 3:00:00.480]  Oh, it's...
[3:00:00.480 --> 3:00:01.480]  Oh, it's...
[3:00:01.480 --> 3:00:04.400]  Oh, guns.
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:07.640]  You better fear guns in the hands of evil.
[3:00:07.640 --> 3:00:12.600]  And we reach out to the former sheriff, the current Austin police chief.
[3:00:12.600 --> 3:00:17.000]  We have them here, we're trying to deprogram the police, but I'm not going any FEMA camp.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:20.840]  You're not taking my children, you understand?
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:23.680]  Stop engaging in evil, back off.
[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:27.360]  You work for criminals, period.
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:31.160]  Chris and Florida, Richard, Tweedledee, Summer and others, go ahead, Chris.
[3:00:31.160 --> 3:00:32.680]  Hello, Alex.
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:37.160]  I basically just recently woke up, you know, probably six months ago.
[3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:38.560]  I've become a sponge.
[3:00:38.560 --> 3:00:43.640]  I've found out basically that they've been creating tyranny and, you know, they passed
[3:00:43.640 --> 3:00:50.320]  Patriot Act 1-2 and all this stuff, but my question was, I mean, I personally am not going
[3:00:50.320 --> 3:00:51.320]  to any camp.
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:56.360]  I mean, if it comes down to it, you know, I love America.
[3:00:56.360 --> 3:01:00.640]  I'm definitely a, you know, patriot, ardent at heart, but...
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:04.680]  Let me just say this, and if it goes to that, don't wait for them in your house, folks.
[3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:08.800]  If they've done things to make you stand up, you go out and find them on your terms.
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:09.800]  Absolutely.
[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:12.960]  And if anybody kills me, I want to be avenged.
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:14.840]  And I want to avenge all the other patriots.
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:15.840]  I want that on record.
[3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:16.840]  Go ahead.
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:19.840]  My question was, what was going on in the big cities?
[3:01:19.840 --> 3:01:26.760]  Because I heard you talking about crowd control and the waffle gun and the stuff about St.
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:32.680]  Louis, and then you said some kind of like a link or something as far as what was on
[3:01:32.680 --> 3:01:33.680]  the map.
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:37.760]  But where the Wired Magazine reports, and it's got a military report admitting that
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:39.760]  the microwave gun will actually kill people.
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:40.760]  Right.
[3:01:40.760 --> 3:01:43.760]  I mean, it's shooting you with high-powered microwaves, I mean, and it says it'll kill
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:44.760]  them.
[3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:46.720]  It says death right here.
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:50.440]  Army orders, pain ray trucks, new report shows potential for death.
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:52.000]  Now, they're telling you they're ordering them now.
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:53.920]  They're pre-deployed in every city.
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:01:56.600]  Helicopters would knock out gas for the knockout whole cities.
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:01:58.280]  That'll kill about 10% of the public.
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:04.240]  They're a study show, and by the way, cops, they're going to kill your wives and children
[3:02:04.240 --> 3:02:05.240]  too.
[3:02:05.240 --> 3:02:06.240]  Go ahead and laugh.
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:07.240]  Go ahead and find out.
[3:02:07.240 --> 3:02:10.600]  Go ahead and find out what your masters will do when they nerve gas or use opiate gases
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:11.600]  on you.
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:13.560]  Do you have a link?
[3:02:13.560 --> 3:02:15.040]  I just gave you the headline, man.
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:18.560]  I mean, Army orders, pain ray trucks, the whole link.
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:23.040]  Okay, HTTP, call us, forward slash, forward slash, blog dot wire dot com, forward slash
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:28.320]  defense, forward slash 2008, forward slash 10, forward slash army dash ordering dash
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:30.320]  p dot html.
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:32.840]  All right.
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:33.840]  Thank you.
[3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:34.840]  Thank you so much.
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:35.840]  I appreciate your calling.
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:37.840]  Anything else?
[3:02:37.840 --> 3:02:39.120]  Richard in Texas, you're on the air.
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:40.120]  Go ahead.
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:43.080]  Well, Alex, I think I first started watching you when you wore a white shirt and a tie
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:44.080]  on cable access.
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:47.920]  And I also want to say hats off to my painter.
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:54.760]  I'm a commercial realtor and a degree professional and four years ago, I was still pretty ignorant.
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:59.000]  But he really helped me out a lot with your tapes, your videos and everything.
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:02.360]  Two things real quickly, folks can do a lot.
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:04.080]  They can email articles.
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:05.080]  They can talk to people.
[3:03:05.080 --> 3:03:11.160]  You don't know how many times I've held impromptu classes that ever meant to hold at different
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:12.400]  functions and meetings.
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:15.200]  And folks are hungry for this information.
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:20.040]  The other type are scared to death, the eyes glaze over, my philosophy is let them go.
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:23.720]  But the other thing I've started to witness, I haven't seen this in a long, long time,
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:24.720]  if ever.
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:26.840]  I do hang out at one of the local gun stores.
[3:03:26.840 --> 3:03:31.000]  I'm an avid target shooter and collector and it's not the one downtown.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:32.400]  It's one of the more remote ones.
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:36.600]  A lot of law enforcement comes through there and they all say the same thing.
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:37.920]  They're getting ready.
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:42.240]  But the thing I've seen, I have never seen before in the last year is I've seen mom
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:50.960]  and pop, grandma and granddad buying AR-15s, AK-47s, all semi-autos, high-cap 9mm.
[3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:55.320]  And I would dare say that those guns are out selling deer rifles this time of year.
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:03:59.080]  And we watched a grandmother come in and buy an assault shotgun and I said, what are you
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:00.080]  getting that for?
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:01.080]  And she says, they're coming.
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:03.440]  And she says, I just need to be ready.
[3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:07.320]  I mean, folks are actually starting to wake up and see this stuff coming.
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:09.960]  They don't always know what to do and they need the education.
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:13.240]  Stay there, I'm going to let you finish on the other side then Lindsay Williams and other
[3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:15.680]  calls and I'll get to you, folks.
[3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:21.880]  Yeah, all I know is I may not make it through this, but a lot of you are and we're going
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:22.880]  to kick their butt.
[3:04:22.880 --> 3:04:23.880]  We're going to win.
[3:04:23.880 --> 3:04:24.880]  We'll be right back.
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:35.040]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:04:35.040 --> 3:04:36.520]  against this country.
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:39.360]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:04:39.360 --> 3:04:40.360]  Who is the enemy?
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:41.360]  bin Laden.
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:42.360]  This is his M.O.
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:43.360]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:04:43.360 --> 3:04:46.120]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:50.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:53.160]  networks inside the United States.
[3:04:53.160 --> 3:04:57.640]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:04:57.640 --> 3:04:59.800]  in and on the U.S.
[3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:03.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:05:03.560 --> 3:05:08.920]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:05:08.920 --> 3:05:12.960]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[3:05:12.960 --> 3:05:15.160]  much more, fabled enemies.
[3:05:15.160 --> 3:05:20.080]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of
[3:05:20.080 --> 3:05:22.400]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:27.880]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:05:27.880 --> 3:05:35.480]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently and
[3:05:35.480 --> 3:05:38.760]  she was talking about the Great Depression and we were talking about the gas prices,
[3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:43.400]  the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in these really kind of perilous times.
[3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:45.480]  No one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[3:05:45.480 --> 3:05:48.920]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days, folks who lived in
[3:05:48.920 --> 3:05:52.600]  the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can
[3:05:52.600 --> 3:05:53.600]  their food.
[3:05:53.600 --> 3:05:56.800]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they
[3:05:56.800 --> 3:06:00.080]  didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how and they didn't have the chickens
[3:06:00.080 --> 3:06:01.080]  and the livestock.
[3:06:01.080 --> 3:06:02.360]  So it was a lot different for them.
[3:06:02.360 --> 3:06:04.240]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[3:06:04.240 --> 3:06:08.200]  We're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage.
[3:06:08.200 --> 3:06:09.520]  Now what can you do to prepare?
[3:06:09.520 --> 3:06:10.520]  Do what I did.
[3:06:10.520 --> 3:06:14.720]  Sell some toys off in the garage, go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company,
[3:06:14.720 --> 3:06:18.160]  get some food and put it away and be safe, put a little security in your life.
[3:06:18.160 --> 3:06:19.160]  You deserve security.

[3:07:29.480 --> 3:07:35.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:37.400]  a war on for your mind.
[3:07:37.400 --> 3:07:45.480]  We're going to go to Lindsay Williams in just a moment whose prediction has been proving
[3:07:45.480 --> 3:07:52.640]  right in the media of oil prices being halved or more that have gone down from $148, $149
[3:07:52.640 --> 3:08:00.680]  at their highest, and even Crescent 150 in futures, down to about $65 a barrel.
[3:08:00.680 --> 3:08:06.800]  He was an executive on the board as their pastor, as their chaplain, was at Atlantic
[3:08:06.800 --> 3:08:07.800]  Richfield.
[3:08:07.800 --> 3:08:08.800]  We'll be talking to him in just a few minutes.
[3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:09.800]  He's waiting in the wings.
[3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:11.520]  I wanted to finish up with Richard.
[3:08:11.520 --> 3:08:15.520]  Yes, Richard, the general public is buying guns, buying ammo.
[3:08:15.520 --> 3:08:17.120]  They know about the New World Order.
[3:08:17.120 --> 3:08:19.600]  A lot of police and military I talked to know what's going on.
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:22.000]  Ron Paul got more contributions than anybody else from the military.
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:26.760]  So we bash them all day, but they know what's going on and the bad ones getting the spotlight
[3:08:26.760 --> 3:08:28.240]  with the tasers and the rest of it.
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:32.400]  But specifically, you said, Grandma's, Grandpa's buying shotguns.
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:33.600]  You said they're getting ready.
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:36.760]  What are they getting ready for, saying they're coming?
[3:08:36.760 --> 3:08:41.200]  And were the cops saying they're getting ready for us when you talk to them at Reds
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:45.360]  or wherever it is, or were they saying that they're getting ready for the New World Order
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:46.360]  to fight it?
[3:08:46.360 --> 3:08:47.360]  No.
[3:08:47.360 --> 3:08:49.400]  The cops know that something's going down.
[3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:53.960]  Most of these guys are not way up high in the intelligence areas.
[3:08:53.960 --> 3:08:58.000]  I do know from a federal law enforcement friend of mine who said, don't ever get your concealed
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  handgun carry permit when the, you know what hits the fan, you'll be the first to go because
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:04.920]  they'll know who you are.
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:08.840]  And something I saw over at Academy, and by the way, these folks that are buying these
[3:09:08.840 --> 3:09:12.680]  guns, in part an expression, they're not Joe Sixpacks.
[3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:14.720]  These are a lot of these are educated people.
[3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:15.720]  I was over at Academy.
[3:09:15.720 --> 3:09:17.640]  I do a lot of hiking at the Big Bend country.
[3:09:17.640 --> 3:09:22.280]  I was picking up odds and ends and there's a really nice attractive gal in there.
[3:09:22.280 --> 3:09:26.760]  She's very articulate in her speech and she's stockpiling huge amounts of ammo on a shopping
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:27.760]  card.
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:30.680]  And I laughed and I said, what in the world are you getting ready for?
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:33.040]  And she says, our government's going to get taken over.
[3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:36.080]  She's half of this is to save and the other half is to shoot.
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:40.720]  Yeah, I was just amazed and she could barely push the shopping cart to like five foot three
[3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:43.280]  and she could barely push the cart out through the register.
[3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:47.400]  Yeah, I'm starting to see this, oh, we're seeing it in San Antonio.
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:53.480]  We're seeing it in Houston, but do you see the trap?
[3:09:53.480 --> 3:09:56.120]  They plan to sick the military and cops on us.
[3:09:56.120 --> 3:10:02.080]  We are going to we are going to annihilate them, which I'm not, but you can't help it.
[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:03.080]  They come for you.
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:07.400]  And then they're going to bring an eye for and I've had Colonel Roberts on everybody.
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:09.480]  This is an official West Point now.
[3:10:09.480 --> 3:10:13.840]  We see Wolf Wolfson, a nice lady, but she doesn't have all the years of understanding.
[3:10:13.840 --> 3:10:15.920]  I mean, we have West Point documents.
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:18.600]  We have it stated, we have the deal they signed years ago.
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:23.520]  We use Canadian and Mexican troops here and I mean, and I mean, and then they're going
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:24.520]  to bring them in.
[3:10:24.520 --> 3:10:28.720]  I mean, folks, it's going to be well, that's why that's why they don't control the borders.
[3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:32.960]  They leave them wide open on purpose, you know, and they pay lip service to it.
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:35.000]  And this is what they, this is what they intend to do.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:39.960]  I used to work in the oil patch and the ones that used to come across 20 years ago were
[3:10:39.960 --> 3:10:45.400]  polite, they're apologetic and they tiptoed the ones that come through now.
[3:10:45.400 --> 3:10:47.120]  They pillage and burn and don't care.
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:48.280]  It's a whole different way.
[3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:52.640]  And by the way, we mean real towns on fire, rocket attacks, burning buildings, newspapers
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:57.840]  burn out, Mexican flags flying over courthouses from California to Texas.
[3:10:57.840 --> 3:11:01.680]  More dangerous than anywhere in the world now, statistically, State Department admits
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:05.640]  it is just, it is wild, wild West on the border right now.
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:06.640]  Oh yeah.
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:10.640]  And they come through these, through these different ranches and they, they'll ransack
[3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:14.360]  the mud logger trailers, they'll ransack anything they can find.
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:19.080]  They tear things apart, they leave their, their trash and they just flat, don't care.
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:22.440]  We're not getting the best of the crop over here, we're getting the worst.
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:23.440]  Yeah.
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:28.200]  I talked to a lot of folks and I hate to use this crude term, but it's done to desecrate
[3:11:28.200 --> 3:11:32.440]  the gringo that go into the homes, the ranch houses, and they do what's called an upper
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:38.240]  decker and they defecate in the top of the toilet in the water cistern.
[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:42.040]  That way it totally pollutes and ruins the toilet and you don't know what's causing it.
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:43.640]  I mean, it's, it's just unbelievable.
[3:11:43.640 --> 3:11:45.760]  Well, God help us.
[3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:49.360]  I, I, I hate to see it come down to an armed conflict.
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:53.520]  I suspect that there'll be those folks who will choke and freeze.
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:56.880]  I think there's going to be other people who will turn and run and then I think there's
[3:11:56.880 --> 3:12:00.840]  going to be those who are going to stand their ground and fight either appropriately or inappropriately
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:04.560]  because they weren't careful about what they did and how they did it.
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:07.360]  And I think that's, that's going to be the biggest problem.
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:12.120]  And I think they're correct when they said there are at least three million dedicated
[3:12:12.120 --> 3:12:15.720]  gun owners in this country who are crack shots and they mean business.
[3:12:15.720 --> 3:12:16.720]  Well, it's a lot more than that.
[3:12:16.720 --> 3:12:21.760]  I mean, there's 150 million gun owners if 1% decides to fight it's 1.5 million combatants.
[3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:22.760]  It's unstoppable.
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:23.760]  Okay.
[3:12:23.760 --> 3:12:27.000]  I mean, the guys that know what to do, know how to do it, know how to move.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  I don't care if they're 50 or 60 years old and they're old Vietnam vet.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:34.520]  I mean, you know, the number one rule is don't let them come to you.
[3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:38.520]  If you decide that, that, that, you know, the run around grabbing everybody putting us
[3:12:38.520 --> 3:12:41.800]  in slave camps, you go, you, you go find them.
[3:12:41.800 --> 3:12:42.960]  You do it on your terms.
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:44.600]  And let me tell you, it's, it's over.
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:45.600]  Nothing.
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:46.600]  Nothing they can do.
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:50.040]  Look like the little guys in the black pajamas did in the early part of Vietnam before war
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:55.400]  before the North Vietnamese regulars took over, you know, and they didn't have a whole
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:12:57.400]  lot to work with.
[3:12:57.400 --> 3:13:00.520]  But look at what Hezbollah was able to do against Israel.
[3:13:00.520 --> 3:13:01.520]  Right.
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:02.520]  In a checker formation.
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:04.520]  It just depends on how dedicated you are.
[3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:05.520]  And I think that's what happened.
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:06.840]  Those guys said, we're not going home.
[3:13:06.840 --> 3:13:07.960]  We either live or we die.
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:08.960]  We're staying here and fighting.
[3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:13.480]  And it's the rural areas that we're going to have to look to the small towns where the
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:17.480]  kids are still being brought up with values where they still have a sense of right and
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:20.480]  wrong, where they, they believe the constitution is a good thing.
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:22.960]  They don't even teach the constitution high schools anymore.
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:25.000]  I mean, they pay lip service to them.
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:27.080]  They, well, it's a document and they head on down the road.
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:28.080]  It's a forbidden subject.
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:29.080]  Well, it's simple.
[3:13:29.080 --> 3:13:33.160]  I don't care if Barack Obama or whoever's coming into office in the left, and for a
[3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:38.240]  big surprise with him, oh yeah, tells you it's the law to turn in all your guns or tells
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:39.800]  you you got to go to a work camp.
[3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:40.800]  That's criminal.
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:42.040]  That's an illegal law.
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:43.040]  It's tearing it.
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:47.600]  And I'm telling the military and police, you get orders to go around up American citizens.
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:52.800]  You better say no, because then once you cross that line, you are now a domestic terrorist.
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:53.800]  That's right.
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:54.960]  I don't care what you call us all day.
[3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:56.520]  I don't, I'm not macho.
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:00.920]  I don't get a thrill about having a, you know, going out and fighting.
[3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:03.760]  I mean, I'm not a tough guy, but I've seen enough to know.
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:07.240]  And I know how, that I don't want any part of it, but I'm telling you, I'm not going
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:08.440]  to go into a FEMA camp.
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:10.720]  Get it through your head.
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:14.440]  I never thought in all my life I'd have to worry about this stuff at this stage of my
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:15.440]  life.
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:16.440]  I'm 57 years old.
[3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:20.520]  And of all the things I thought I'd have to look forward to in my life, this was not
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:22.960]  on the list.
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:23.960]  Absolutely not on the list.
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:28.440]  And if I could find a way to make a living, other than through real estate, to attack
[3:14:28.440 --> 3:14:30.480]  this full time, I'd go do it.
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:34.440]  As it is, I spend three hours a day, seven days a week on this stuff.
[3:14:34.440 --> 3:14:37.840]  And you kiss a lot of toads to get a princess of information.
[3:14:37.840 --> 3:14:38.840]  Let me tell you.
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:39.840]  I'm not sure.
[3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:40.840]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:43.640]  We're going to get to Summer, Scott, Chris, Dan, and others, but I want to bring up our
[3:14:43.640 --> 3:14:51.160]  big guest, just a very important person, just spot on with his predictions year after year.
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:57.160]  That's why three, four months ago, Dr. Stan Monteev privately said, well, I have a source,
[3:14:57.160 --> 3:14:59.920]  but I can't say who they are.
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:03.880]  Oil prices are going to be cut in half or more down to about $60 a barrel.
[3:15:03.880 --> 3:15:05.660]  This person has never been wrong.
[3:15:05.660 --> 3:15:09.320]  And then when it went public, he went public on Monteev's show, and then here, it was Lindsey
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:10.480]  Williams.
[3:15:10.480 --> 3:15:17.880]  And then what Lindsey said two months ago, when wind fuel was at $135, $140 a barrel,
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:18.880]  he went up to $150.
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:21.720]  He said it's going to be $65 a barrel in the next four or five months.
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:22.720]  I said, well, put a date on it.
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:25.280]  He says next three to six months.
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:27.800]  And he said they're going to discover a big oil field in Indonesia.
[3:15:27.800 --> 3:15:28.800]  They did.
[3:15:28.800 --> 3:15:29.800]  They're going to find some stuff in Russia.
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:32.280]  I've internationally seen some of that confirmed.
[3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:35.560]  Lindsey Williams, an oil company executive, called up that he worked with.
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:39.280]  He was on the board as their chaplain, called him up and said, we're going to kill you
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:41.440]  if you don't shut up.
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:43.520]  And he said, well, what am I allowed to say?
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:45.880]  And he knew at this level, they're not joking.
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:48.960]  And he said, well, you know, just tell them this.
[3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:51.360]  And then Lindsey came on and told us, and that was right.
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:53.360]  Lindsey Williams, great to have you on.
[3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:58.880]  Alex, it is so nice to know one or more of the elite and to be able to say all of these
[3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:01.400]  things, not because Lindsey Williams knows it's the...
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:02.760]  I'm just like you are.
[3:16:02.760 --> 3:16:05.440]  I put my bridges on every morning like you do.
[3:16:05.440 --> 3:16:10.480]  The elite called me and, of course, when I was threatened, I decided to make friends
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:11.480]  with him.
[3:16:11.480 --> 3:16:12.720]  He became polite.
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:14.200]  I asked him some questions.
[3:16:14.200 --> 3:16:18.240]  And Alex, I had the privilege of being on with you on July the 28th.
[3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:20.200]  I'll look back on my date book here.
[3:16:20.200 --> 3:16:25.840]  Who would have ever guessed on July the 28th that it would have gone from $140 approximately
[3:16:25.840 --> 3:16:31.240]  a barrel of oil to just a few moments ago before we went on the air crude oil was $67
[3:16:31.240 --> 3:16:34.160]  and 36 cents less than one half.
[3:16:34.160 --> 3:16:37.560]  Dubai is now in big, big, big trouble.
[3:16:37.560 --> 3:16:40.560]  Everything he said about the Arab world has taken place.
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:44.000]  Let me just briefly go down the predictions that this might...
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:45.880]  Not a prediction, really, because...
[3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:46.880]  Now, let's be clear.
[3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:50.760]  They were threatening you because you were exposing that they basically have unlimited
[3:16:50.760 --> 3:16:51.760]  oil.
[3:16:51.760 --> 3:16:52.760]  They're all...
[3:16:52.760 --> 3:16:53.760]  They found huge reserves.
[3:16:53.760 --> 3:16:54.760]  You worked there.
[3:16:54.760 --> 3:16:55.760]  That was all on record and confirmed.
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:16:57.320]  Again, folks, this is...
[3:16:57.320 --> 3:16:58.320]  This is gospel.
[3:16:58.320 --> 3:16:59.400]  This is documented.
[3:16:59.400 --> 3:17:00.400]  They were sick.
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:04.320]  Every video is number one on Google for months on end, tens of millions of views a week.
[3:17:04.320 --> 3:17:06.680]  They called up and said, shut up.
[3:17:06.680 --> 3:17:07.680]  But then they told you more.
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:08.680]  Go ahead.
[3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:10.920]  Yeah, for three years' time I lived with these people.
[3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:14.560]  I had the privilege of doing what very few people in the face of the earth ever have
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:16.200]  an opportunity to do.
[3:17:16.200 --> 3:17:21.120]  And that is, instead of just hearing about them and reading someone else's book, Alex,
[3:17:21.120 --> 3:17:26.240]  I had the privilege, by God's grace and providence, to actually live with the elite of the world
[3:17:26.240 --> 3:17:29.560]  on the trans-elastic oil pipeline for three years' time.
[3:17:29.560 --> 3:17:33.800]  Then I wrote my book, Energy and On Crisis, and for the past 35 years, I have known that
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:37.440]  there was a line out there, and that if I crossed it, I'd be in trouble.
[3:17:37.440 --> 3:17:40.120]  And twice in 35 years, they've contacted me.
[3:17:40.120 --> 3:17:44.520]  The first time was back in 1984, and they said, you've got to quit saying certain things,
[3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:45.520]  and I did.
[3:17:45.520 --> 3:17:51.560]  And then, the middle of June of this year, 2008, they contacted me again and said, Jacqueline,
[3:17:51.560 --> 3:17:55.400]  you cannot say certain things anymore, and if you do, we're going to have to do this,
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:17:56.400]  that, and the other.
[3:17:56.400 --> 3:18:00.760]  Well, after we finally came to an agreement, I said to the gentleman, how you been doing?
[3:18:00.760 --> 3:18:01.760]  How's your family?
[3:18:01.760 --> 3:18:02.760]  How are you getting along?
[3:18:02.760 --> 3:18:03.760]  Where have you been living?
[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:08.200]  I haven't seen the man for 25 years, but he knows everything that goes on behind closed
[3:18:08.200 --> 3:18:12.880]  doors, and he became friendly, and for the next 45 minutes, he told me the following.
[3:18:12.880 --> 3:18:15.960]  Let me just enumerate them for the listening audience.
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:19.640]  Oil will go, crude oil will go to $50 a barrel.
[3:18:19.640 --> 3:18:20.640]  That was his first thing.
[3:18:20.640 --> 3:18:21.640]  He said, it will happen.
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:23.840]  I would have never guessed that.
[3:18:23.840 --> 3:18:29.720]  I was talking about $200 of barrel oil, and he said it's going to $50 a barrel.
[3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:34.360]  I'm still sitting here startled, secondly, he said the Arab world is going into a state
[3:18:34.360 --> 3:18:35.360]  of bankruptcy.
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:41.920]  Dubai right now has had to stop the building of the largest world-class skyscraper in the
[3:18:41.920 --> 3:18:46.040]  city of Dubai because they don't have the finances to complete it, and unless they
[3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:53.160]  can find somebody to help underwrite it, the world-class city of Dubai is in trouble.
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:56.680]  The other thing he said, there's going to be a financial collapse in the United States
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:18:57.680]  of America.
[3:18:57.680 --> 3:19:00.920]  It's going to be so great that it will take years to recover.
[3:19:00.920 --> 3:19:06.200]  Ben Alex, I remembered one thing that I didn't mention on your show back on July the 28th.
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:12.520]  When we had finished our conversation, this man advised me to prepare, and he said I would
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:15.240]  suggest you go to the mission field and leave America.
[3:19:15.240 --> 3:19:16.240]  Stay there.
[3:19:16.240 --> 3:19:17.240]  Stay there.
[3:19:17.240 --> 3:19:18.240]  I want to hear this huge development.
[3:19:18.240 --> 3:19:19.240]  Let me get back.
[3:19:19.240 --> 3:19:23.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, no one was saying oil was going to $50 a barrel, but Lindsay Williams
[3:19:23.080 --> 3:19:27.400]  – no one – and he never came up with wild things in the past, and then he was proven
[3:19:27.400 --> 3:19:28.400]  right.
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:29.400]  It's incredible.
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:30.400]  Stay with us.
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:34.920]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what
[3:19:34.920 --> 3:19:39.080]  can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:40.720]  your dinner table?
[3:19:40.720 --> 3:19:42.160]  Garden in a can.
[3:19:42.160 --> 3:19:46.280]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:48.240]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[3:19:48.240 --> 3:19:50.880]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:55.920]  There are 16 large hermetically-sealed non-hybrid open-pollinated packets of seeds, along with
[3:19:55.920 --> 3:20:00.760]  detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[3:20:00.760 --> 3:20:01.760]  Garden in a can.
[3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:05.680]  It's that simple, fresh, healthy, easy.
[3:20:05.680 --> 3:20:11.640]  Only $69.95 for over a half-acre of safe fresh vegetables, ready when you are.

[3:20:28.840 --> 3:20:33.040]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:20:33.040 --> 3:20:35.520]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:40.600]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[3:20:40.600 --> 3:20:43.640]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:20:43.640 --> 3:20:47.240]  Is this a flaw for your enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[3:20:47.240 --> 3:20:51.840]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:20:51.840 --> 3:20:55.600]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[3:20:55.600 --> 3:20:56.880]  from Jekyll Island.
[3:20:56.880 --> 3:21:01.000]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  power.
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:05.880]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:21:05.880 --> 3:21:07.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:12.120]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:20.080]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[3:21:24.880 --> 3:21:25.880]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:21:25.880 --> 3:21:26.880]  May I have everyone's attention, please?
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:27.880]  I've come with a message of information.
[3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:28.880]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:21:28.880 --> 3:21:29.880]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:30.880]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:30.880 --> 3:21:31.880]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:32.880]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:33.880]  and the U.S. Senate.
[3:21:33.880 --> 3:21:34.880]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:21:34.880 --> 3:21:35.880]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:36.880]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[3:21:36.880 --> 3:21:47.880]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:52.640]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[3:21:52.640 --> 3:21:54.640]  to grow at our own door.
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:22:00.120]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:22:00.120 --> 3:22:03.120]  An inside job?
[3:22:03.120 --> 3:22:04.120]  How dare you?
[3:22:04.120 --> 3:22:10.560]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:13.560]  Oh, hell, it's breaking news on 6th Avenue.
[3:22:13.560 --> 3:22:17.760]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[3:22:17.760 --> 3:22:18.760]  anniversary of 9-11.
[3:22:18.760 --> 3:22:19.760]  Truth Risen.

[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:29.840]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:31.680]  What does humidity mean to you?
[3:22:31.680 --> 3:22:36.040]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:39.400]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[3:22:39.400 --> 3:22:42.400]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.

[3:23:45.360 --> 3:23:47.200]  Pastor Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[3:23:47.200 --> 3:23:51.040]  We always talked about the giant Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, how they were hidden.
[3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:55.120]  It's even come out mainstream news decades after he talked about it, more than what's
[3:23:55.120 --> 3:24:00.600]  in Saudi Arabia.
[3:24:00.600 --> 3:24:04.120]  His video became number one, just an hour presentation he gave, number one on Google
[3:24:04.120 --> 3:24:06.360]  Video for month after month.
[3:24:06.360 --> 3:24:11.240]  It was in the top five every day, routinely number one, millions a day watching it.
[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:14.840]  People all over the street, I was hearing them talk about it in cafes and I was hearing
[3:24:14.840 --> 3:24:20.360]  buzz on the street like Loose Changer, you know, other big viral videos.
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:24.080]  And so this oil executive he'd worked with called up and said, look, you know, shut
[3:24:24.080 --> 3:24:25.600]  up or it's over.
[3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:30.280]  And then Lindsey was smart and, you know, knew him and had worked on their board for
[3:24:30.280 --> 3:24:33.800]  years, said, well, well, what can I talk about?
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:38.240]  And Lindsey finished up with the point you'd forgotten to cover here with us.
[3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:42.600]  Alex, it's not Lindsey Williams saying these things.
[3:24:42.600 --> 3:24:47.040]  The elite who might happen to have me rub shoulders with for three years' time on the
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:51.960]  Transylastic Oil Pipeline, when I wrote my book, Energy Non Crisis, 35 years ago, some
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:56.800]  of these people still stay in touch with me, just strictly out of courtesy of the work
[3:24:56.800 --> 3:25:00.920]  that I did for them as Kaplan on the Transylastic Oil Pipeline.
[3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:06.200]  And as a result of that, the things that I've been saying for 35 years, every single one
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:11.480]  of them, without exception, have come to play, not because Lindsey Williams knew this, Alex.
[3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:16.680]  I just have to stress to your listening audience, everything that happens in government, everything
[3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:21.280]  that takes place in the financial world, what happens with crude oil, Saudi Arabia, all
[3:25:21.280 --> 3:25:24.640]  the Arabs, every bit of this is planned in advance.
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:30.680]  Everything that you say on your program, Alex, has been planned by somebody in the elite
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:32.320]  behind closed doors.
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:37.640]  And folks, I've got to say, it is such a privilege to be on Alex Jones' show and to be even
[3:25:37.640 --> 3:25:39.400]  being invited to be here.
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:44.760]  I consider it to be an honor, and I must say to you, please, you listen to Alex Jones
[3:25:44.760 --> 3:25:48.880]  every single day, don't you miss one of his programs?
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:50.960]  You've got to hear what he's telling you.
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:55.600]  If sometimes this day and time, things are happening so fast that unless you catch it
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:25:58.560]  in the past 24 hours' time, you're in trouble.
[3:25:58.560 --> 3:26:05.000]  So let me say again, what you hear me say, the predictions that I am making today did
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:06.800]  not come from Lindsey Williams.
[3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:12.440]  Some dream are not sleeping good because I ate them in hamburgers before I went to bed.
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:18.800]  This came from the elite themselves who called me, threatened me, and said, Lindsey, this
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:20.920]  is what's going to happen out of politeness.
[3:26:20.920 --> 3:26:25.760]  We're telling you these things, $50 a barrel, crude oil, all right, I'm going to make the
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:28.600]  prediction now exactly as this man did.
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:33.880]  You write it down, take it to the bank, can you imagine someone who got in on the futures
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:39.480]  market oil when it was $140 a barrel and had been willing to take the word of the elite
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:41.320]  that called me on the phone?
[3:26:41.320 --> 3:26:44.040]  No, no, people laughed at you, they didn't believe you.
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:48.680]  They didn't go cash in, they could have just made unbelievable fortunes.
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:26:52.600]  Now we went to break and you were going over the predictions, the things he told you were
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:56.520]  going to happen, and there was one point he was telling you, get out of the country, finish
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:26:57.520]  up with that.
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:01.800]  Yeah, I happened to remember that after I was on your program last time, Alex, and you'd
[3:27:01.800 --> 3:27:06.560]  asked me all the things he had said, and of course, over about a 45-minute conversation
[3:27:06.560 --> 3:27:07.840]  with the gentleman.
[3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:12.240]  One thing I remembered when we came down to the end of the conversation and I said, now,
[3:27:12.240 --> 3:27:18.080]  my intentions really are for myself, I've been in Memphis for now for 50 years, pasted
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:23.640]  a church for 12 years in Hollywood, Florida, I was chaplain on the friends' last oil pipeline,
[3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:26.280]  and I said, you know, my heart is in the ministry.
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:31.280]  And I think my wife and I and family have been talking about going back into the ministry
[3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:32.840]  and going to the mission field.
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:36.280]  Well, usually that means a foreign mission field somewhere and he asked me where and
[3:27:36.280 --> 3:27:41.640]  I mentioned to him, and this I thought off after I was on your last program, he said,
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:46.880]  I would advise you to prepare and he said, I think it would be a great idea to leave
[3:27:46.880 --> 3:27:48.920]  America and go to the mission field.
[3:27:48.920 --> 3:27:54.520]  And I remembered that after I was on your last program, Alex, he was advising me to
[3:27:54.520 --> 3:27:58.480]  get ready for the inevitable because he knew what was going to take place.
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:06.200]  Now, to be clear, they are imploding the price of oil to bankrupt the Arabs and to
[3:28:06.200 --> 3:28:12.240]  bankrupt the whole world while the big central banks are energized with cash and liquidity.
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:13.840]  They're not in trouble.
[3:28:13.840 --> 3:28:19.040]  They can then go buy up the entire world economy when it collapses and build that new world
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:24.400]  order banking system and that trilateral world system they've now announced.
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:26.400]  That is exactly right.
[3:28:26.400 --> 3:28:30.280]  Alex, you could not have put it in any better words.
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:37.000]  What you just said is what I surmise from what this man told me and looking over it,
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:38.600]  that's exactly what they intend to do.
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:40.120]  They'll own all the banks in America.
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:43.320]  They'll own all the airlines.
[3:28:43.320 --> 3:28:47.440]  They will own basically most of the houses in the United States of America because of
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:50.480]  collapse of the real estate market.
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:54.680]  And by the time they get through the elite are basically going to own everything.
[3:28:54.680 --> 3:28:57.720]  The person, the people will be slaves in their hands.
[3:28:57.720 --> 3:29:01.160]  They've said you aren't going to be and neither will I.
[3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:02.160]  But they'll try.
[3:29:02.160 --> 3:29:04.280]  This is exactly what their intention is.
[3:29:04.280 --> 3:29:05.280]  Unbelievable, Lindsay.
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:10.160]  Let's come back and talk more about specifically what he said because months ago you laid that
[3:29:10.160 --> 3:29:15.440]  out, what they're planning to set up, how they're planning to bankrupt the world.
[3:29:15.440 --> 3:29:16.440]  This is it.
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:17.440]  The birth of the new world order.
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:19.920]  Lindsay William, Inside Info, stay with us.
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:21.200]  We're on the march.
[3:29:21.200 --> 3:29:30.200]  The Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:30:29.880 --> 3:30:35.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:30:35.120 --> 3:30:36.600]  against this country.
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:38.800]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:40.320]  But who is the enemy?
[3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:41.320]  Bin Laden.
[3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:42.320]  This is his MO.
[3:30:42.320 --> 3:30:43.320]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:30:43.320 --> 3:30:46.160]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:30:46.160 --> 3:30:50.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:30:50.600 --> 3:30:53.200]  networks inside the United States.
[3:30:53.200 --> 3:30:57.640]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:30:57.640 --> 3:30:59.840]  in and on the U.S.
[3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:03.520]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:03.520 --> 3:31:08.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:13.120]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much,
[3:31:13.120 --> 3:31:14.120]  much more.
[3:31:14.120 --> 3:31:15.120]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:32:28.560 --> 3:32:56.800]  for you.
[3:32:56.800 --> 3:33:06.600]  I cannot stress enough how important it is to get original, on-the-scene intelligence.
[3:33:06.600 --> 3:33:19.760]  Just in June of this year, I was 30, 40 yards at the Chantilly Marriott 5-star hotel in Virginia
[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:25.560]  with Rothschild's Rockefeller, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, World Leaders,
[3:33:25.560 --> 3:33:31.720]  Federal Reserve Chairman, all of them in there.
[3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:36.160]  And I was bullhorning and Richard N. Haas, head of the CFR came out and looks could kill,
[3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:40.480]  I'd have been lying on the floor.
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:44.560]  And we shut him down and Jim Tucker, who's learned how to go, check in a few days before,
[3:33:44.560 --> 3:33:48.200]  talk to the bar, talk to the staff and say, you're going to hear a lot of evil discussed
[3:33:48.200 --> 3:33:54.000]  and I'll even threaten with your job if you speak or give me any paperwork or documentation.
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  But you're going to hear this evil, I know you're going to refuse now, but you're going
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:34:00.360]  to hear this evil and you're going to want to give me information.
[3:34:00.360 --> 3:34:04.560]  And they always say no way and then they hear world government and slave the public bankrupt
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:07.120]  everyone and they always give us the documents.
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:13.920]  Well, what came out from his sources and Estilon's sources in 2006, two and a half years ago,
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:18.080]  that they were going to implode the world market starting with a subprime, create a
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:23.280]  world-wide depression and then inflate the currency so you'd have hyper-stagflation.
[3:34:23.280 --> 3:34:28.160]  Both depression and devaluation of the currency together, the worst economic depression you
[3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:29.160]  can have.
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:34.240]  The worst, it's like a royal flush, it's very rare, it's orchestrated, it's the worst
[3:34:34.240 --> 3:34:36.320]  thing you can have.
[3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:38.360]  The best for the elites.
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:42.680]  And see, I made a film, we wrote articles, it all happened because they really run things
[3:34:42.680 --> 3:34:47.600]  and if you can have the nerve to go face their black ops, go face their people, face the
[3:34:47.600 --> 3:34:53.120]  death threats, face people calling my wife up and saying, hi is Alex there?
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:54.120]  No, he's not.
[3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:55.120]  Can I leave a number?
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:00.400]  Well, yes, this is his girlfriend, well that's impossible, this is his wife, oh my God, I've
[3:35:00.400 --> 3:35:03.640]  got his baby, oh my God, click.
[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:07.960]  The next call we're going to get your kids, stuff like that.
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:11.120]  I'm not tooting my horn but we need your prayers and support so does Lindsey, I mean
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:13.320]  he gets death-threaded, I get death-threaded.
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:17.960]  We go bullhorn the world leaders, I mean we're there fighting them for you.
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:20.720]  We always ask this for you to wake up and stand up.
[3:35:20.720 --> 3:35:25.680]  We should all pray for Lindsey and I tell you, I'm greedy for them, I mean I covet them,
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:27.560]  I need your prayers, I know it's real.
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:33.600]  I know God and the devil are real and I know this stuff's happening and you know, we're
[3:35:33.600 --> 3:35:36.440]  into something big and deep and whether you like it or not, you're all part of it whether
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:37.440]  you live in denial.
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:43.960]  Pastor Williams, continue with the basic breakdown of what we're facing.
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:48.880]  Alex, there positively is and I must stress this to the audience because you have such
[3:35:48.880 --> 3:35:52.680]  a knowledgeable audience, they listen to you every day, they know the issues and if you
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:56.720]  don't listen to Alex every day, you better get on to listening to him every day.
[3:35:56.720 --> 3:36:01.760]  There positively is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:05.760]  Folks, I wish I could come right into your living room and sit down with you and prove
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:06.760]  it to you.
[3:36:06.760 --> 3:36:12.040]  35 years of living this story since I was shocked into reality when I lived with these
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:13.600]  people for three years.
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:15.560]  Alex, everything you're saying is right.
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:19.800]  There is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:20.960]  Folks, believe it.
[3:36:20.960 --> 3:36:21.960]  Take it to heart.
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:25.600]  Now, I'm going to give you a few of the statements that this man made to me on that phone that
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:26.600]  day.
[3:36:26.600 --> 3:36:29.080]  He knows everything that goes on behind closed doors.
[3:36:29.080 --> 3:36:31.080]  Please, take it to heart.
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:38.040]  Number one, America will see a financial collapse and I said to him, are you talking about a
[3:36:38.040 --> 3:36:39.040]  depression?
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:40.040]  He would not.
[3:36:40.040 --> 3:36:41.040]  Let me use that word.
[3:36:41.040 --> 3:36:43.240]  He said it is going to be a financial collapse.
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:49.200]  If you notice that they still aren't admitting that we are in a recession, what a joke.
[3:36:49.200 --> 3:36:51.320]  So this man basically did the same thing.
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:55.600]  He said a financial collapse, he wouldn't use the word, but he said it is going to take
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:36:57.000]  years to come out of it.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:01.440]  His second statement, America will be kept dependent on foreign oil.
[3:37:01.440 --> 3:37:04.480]  I don't care who gets in as president.
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:07.160]  You will not see the North Slope of Alaska opened up.
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:11.360]  You're not going to see that big oil field in Montana and North Dakota opened.
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:16.160]  We are going to be kept dependent on foreign oil and our money going out of this country.
[3:37:16.160 --> 3:37:20.840]  The next statement, the standard currency of the world is crude oil, not the American
[3:37:20.840 --> 3:37:21.840]  dollar.
[3:37:21.840 --> 3:37:24.160]  They could care less about the American dollar anymore.
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:29.880]  And notice that the euro is giving problem and just the other day Iceland declared bankruptcy.
[3:37:29.880 --> 3:37:33.160]  And now, as of two days ago, Switzerland is in trouble.
[3:37:33.160 --> 3:37:34.160]  Would you believe this?
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:36.600]  I just heard it for the first time yesterday.
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:42.040]  It has actually come out that the one country in the world that is known as a banking haven
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:47.880]  for everybody, Switzerland now, could possibly be the next country in the world to declare
[3:37:47.880 --> 3:37:49.240]  bankruptcy.
[3:37:49.240 --> 3:37:51.360]  Take these statements to heart.
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:53.840]  It is not a conspiracy.
[3:37:53.840 --> 3:37:59.760]  It is an agenda on a group of elite people, they know exactly what they're doing.
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:05.080]  And just because of this man calling me out of respect, well, it was not out of respect
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:10.800]  that he called me, he called me out of threat, but then finally out of respect of what happened
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:14.480]  on the Transylactic Oil Pipeline, you see, Chaplin, I'll be glad to tell you these things
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:15.480]  that he did.
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:20.160]  And Alex, everything you've been predicting is coming to pass, but who, back on July the
[3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:26.240]  28th, would have ever, ever in the boggiest imagination would have guessed that crude
[3:38:26.240 --> 3:38:28.480]  oil would be $50 a barrel.
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:29.480]  And here we are.
[3:38:29.480 --> 3:38:30.840]  We're right at it.
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:33.000]  And what's going to happen to the economy?
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:35.840]  All of these things are taking place, Alex.
[3:38:35.840 --> 3:38:42.400]  Now, Lindsay, that's why I was saying, think back to that 45-minute conversation, and then
[3:38:42.400 --> 3:38:48.240]  later you did think back to about getting out of the country.
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:51.840]  I mean, did you ask why I get out of the country, or did he say anything else?
[3:38:51.840 --> 3:38:54.520]  Every word is key.
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:39:01.080]  Well, the reason he suggested that I do this is merely because he'd like me out of his
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:04.640]  country, and it would be so much better if I didn't appear on Alex Jones' show anymore
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:07.480]  and Dr. Stan Monteith, some of the others.
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:10.320]  And I'm just about through with doing all of this also.
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:15.880]  But he said, yeah, he said, I think it'd be a very good idea, both for you and for us,
[3:39:15.880 --> 3:39:18.440]  for us not to have to have conflict in the future.
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:21.960]  So he said, yeah, it'd be a great idea for you to leave the country and go to the mission
[3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:22.960]  field.
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:26.840]  I think he had more to that, and the more I thought it through and more I'm seeing,
[3:39:26.840 --> 3:39:31.520]  but I'm seeing today of what's taking place financially, and what you said, I mean, when
[3:39:31.520 --> 3:39:37.560]  you began the program today about what the military and the police are preparing for,
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:42.160]  I think it would be great for people to make preparation, get out of the city, do something
[3:39:42.160 --> 3:39:47.280]  about protecting yourself, because that statement that he made to me about, yeah, I think it
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:53.240]  would be a great idea for you, Chaplain, to go to the mission field, to basically get
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:55.720]  out of America, get out of our hair.
[3:39:55.720 --> 3:39:59.880]  And I think he really thought, hey, this would be a pretty good idea to protect you
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:00.880]  by.
[3:40:00.880 --> 3:40:06.840]  What a nice guy, he's threatening to go after you, kill you if you don't, but then allowing
[3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:09.880]  you to still go out and give this message, specifically.
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:15.040]  Well, you understand the mindset of these people, and of course the only way I haven't
[3:40:15.040 --> 3:40:17.000]  knew it is because I lived with them.
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:20.280]  These people have a mindset that is quite different than what the average American
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:22.480]  haven't figured out to be.
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:25.000]  These people tell you everything they're going to do in advance.
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:28.600]  If you know how to listen to the buzzwords and know what they're saying.
[3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:32.440]  Secondly, these people have a code of ethics.
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:37.000]  Now I know that sounds strange to say this, but they do.
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:41.320]  They must tell certain things according to the God that they serve.
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:44.760]  Now understand that that's quite a different God than what you and I know, Alex.
[3:40:44.760 --> 3:40:49.880]  We know the true and living God who created all of heaven and earth and is honest and
[3:40:49.880 --> 3:40:50.880]  decent.
[3:40:50.880 --> 3:40:51.880]  They have a God too.
[3:40:51.880 --> 3:40:55.680]  The God is the God of this world, the Bible called him the prince of power of this air,
[3:40:55.680 --> 3:41:01.320]  but he is a God, and when that prince of the power of the air offered Christ all of the
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:07.160]  kingdoms of the world that day, Christ didn't turn around and say, hey, they already belong
[3:41:07.160 --> 3:41:08.160]  to me.
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:09.160]  You can't give them to me.
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:10.160]  No, he didn't.
[3:41:10.160 --> 3:41:11.160]  He didn't say that.
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:16.000]  He said, no, you can't tempt me this way, and he used the word of God against him.
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:21.160]  You see, that prince of the power of the air, the God of these people, the God of this world,
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:28.920]  has a moral code, their own code of ethics, and therefore Christ would not accept the
[3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:29.920]  kingdom of the world.
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:32.040]  He knew someday he was going to get them anyway.
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:35.840]  So understand the mindset of these people, and that's the reason I've written some of
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:40.720]  the books I've written, my latest book, Two Seducinations, or you've got to know it.
[3:41:40.720 --> 3:41:41.720]  Let me read you.
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:44.160]  There's one right here out of Two Seducinations.
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:47.800]  It was by Thomas Jefferson, one of the signers of the Constitution.
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:52.320]  He said, if the American people ever allow the banks to control the issuance of that
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:58.600]  currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:04.800]  up around them will deprive the people of all of their property until that children
[3:42:04.800 --> 3:42:08.600]  will wake up homeless from the continent their fathers occupied.
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:14.640]  Oh, my goodness, those founding fathers saw this, knew what could take place, and Alex
[3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:18.800]  today, we are living in a time that I never thought actually in my life, I'm not going
[3:42:18.800 --> 3:42:19.800]  to have to do that.
[3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:23.800]  Now, Lindsay, I want to plug the new video and the materials you have before they're
[3:42:23.800 --> 3:42:24.800]  not even available.
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:25.800]  I know soon they won't be.
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:30.000]  Some people can call and get those, or go online and get those materials.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:33.080]  But I also want to take some phone calls that will be all over the map, but it'll be important.
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:35.840]  You can come in at all, very knowledgeable here in just a moment.
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:40.400]  But bottom line, go back to what he said, the reason they were going to implode oil
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:43.280]  prices and why they were doing this.
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:46.480]  Okay, the reason for this is to break the Arab world.
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:47.480]  Oh, and I'm sorry.
[3:42:47.480 --> 3:42:48.480]  I got interrupted again.
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:49.480]  I got interrupted again.
[3:42:49.480 --> 3:42:54.520]  You also brought up they were going to start some type of war or an escalation of conflict
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:42:55.520]  with Russia.
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:42:57.240]  And that sounded crazy three months ago.
[3:42:57.240 --> 3:43:00.600]  You told Monty four months ago, and you'd already been doing interviews for a month
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:01.600]  before I got shot.
[3:43:01.600 --> 3:43:06.120]  So it's been about four and a half, what, four months since you went public?
[3:43:06.120 --> 3:43:10.400]  Yes, the first part of July.
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:14.760]  And then a month and a half after you did all this, they sneak attack Russia in Georgia
[3:43:14.760 --> 3:43:15.760]  through Georgia.
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:16.760]  But so go ahead.
[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:21.320]  He said that there was going to be a major oil field that they would announce the discovery
[3:43:21.320 --> 3:43:23.000]  off north of Russia.
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:25.280]  That meant that Russia was going to be a great power.
[3:43:25.280 --> 3:43:28.640]  We'll have another cold war out there.
[3:43:28.640 --> 3:43:36.120]  And he went on to indicate or implement that there will be a conflict again with Russia.
[3:43:36.120 --> 3:43:39.600]  We're beginning to see it already exactly like he said.
[3:43:39.600 --> 3:43:41.480]  It's amazing, Alex.
[3:43:41.480 --> 3:43:45.520]  These people do plan every bit of this in advance, and it's so amazing when you hear
[3:43:45.520 --> 3:43:49.200]  one of them talk and then turn around and actually watch it.
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:53.840]  You sit here, literally stunned by watching these people do exactly what they said they
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:43:54.840]  were going to do.
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:44:00.640]  They have the power to control Washington, the president, the Congress, the currency.
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:03.400]  They have the power to control crude oil prices.
[3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:06.480]  And everybody but us, and the only thing on the face of this earth, they're scared to
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:07.480]  death off.
[3:44:07.480 --> 3:44:10.400]  So to get back into the Arabs, I erupted with the Russian part.
[3:44:10.400 --> 3:44:11.400]  It's just so accurate.
[3:44:11.400 --> 3:44:12.400]  Go ahead.
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:15.520]  Say it again, Alex.
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:18.920]  I was just throwing in the Russian part because you also said he told you that, and that came
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:20.480]  true out of the blue sky.
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:23.600]  So this is really credible in my analysis.
[3:44:23.600 --> 3:44:29.440]  The Russian part, the Dubai part, bringing down the Arabs.
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:30.440]  Finish up with that.
[3:44:30.440 --> 3:44:31.440]  Yeah.
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:36.600]  And the Arabs are having their summit conference weeks in advance this week because they say
[3:44:36.600 --> 3:44:42.160]  that they cannot stand the price of oil going down from $140 a barrel to where it is right
[3:44:42.160 --> 3:44:43.160]  now, $67.
[3:44:43.160 --> 3:44:44.160]  It's going to $50.
[3:44:44.160 --> 3:44:48.320]  If they think it's bad now, they haven't seen anything yet, it is going to bankrupt
[3:44:48.320 --> 3:44:49.320]  the Arab world.
[3:44:49.320 --> 3:44:50.320]  He said this.
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:53.760]  He said, Iran is just worrying of something terrible.
[3:44:53.760 --> 3:44:55.520]  He said, we have to do something about Iran.
[3:44:55.520 --> 3:44:57.960]  I said, what are you going to do, war or what else?
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:44:59.600]  He indicated they didn't want war.
[3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:04.120]  He said, what we want is to bankrupt them and take it to $50 a barrel.
[3:45:04.120 --> 3:45:06.760]  They basically did that.
[3:45:06.760 --> 3:45:07.760]  Amazing.
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:10.280]  Let's take some phone calls.
[3:45:10.280 --> 3:45:14.120]  Summer in Indiana, thanks for holding your on the air.
[3:45:14.120 --> 3:45:15.120]  Hello.
[3:45:15.120 --> 3:45:16.120]  Hi.
[3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:17.120]  Hi, Alex.
[3:45:17.120 --> 3:45:20.520]  I just want to say thank you for waking me up.
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:23.480]  It's been about two months that I've been listening to you.
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:30.120]  I've been able to get some gold and silver and stock up food and weapons.
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:37.800]  My question is, I'm trying to convince my father that this is really happening and it's
[3:45:37.800 --> 3:45:40.480]  severe as we say it is.
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:41.480]  He doesn't believe.
[3:45:41.480 --> 3:45:47.280]  I convinced him to actually listen to your show today, so he may be listening to us right
[3:45:47.280 --> 3:45:48.280]  now.
[3:45:48.280 --> 3:45:56.040]  If you could just touch on why Obama is not going to save us, because he thinks, yes,
[3:45:56.040 --> 3:46:02.320]  there is corruption, yes, the elites are bad and the oil companies are bad, but he thinks
[3:46:02.320 --> 3:46:03.920]  Obama is going to save us.
[3:46:03.920 --> 3:46:04.920]  Okay.
[3:46:04.920 --> 3:46:07.000]  I'm going to let you go so we can answer that question and get Lindsay to answer it
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  and take more calls.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:09.680]  Great question.
[3:46:09.680 --> 3:46:12.200]  Because Barack Obama and John McCain are puppets.
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:16.600]  The real leaders at the oil company's international bank level, they make all the decisions in
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:21.560]  the Western world and increasingly worldwide, and we know their agenda from their own documents,
[3:46:21.560 --> 3:46:27.440]  our moles, our witnesses like Lindsay Williams and others, and we know their programs.
[3:46:27.440 --> 3:46:32.400]  So we know regardless of who gets into office, this program continues and presidents are
[3:46:32.400 --> 3:46:35.680]  only cut out window dressing to divert the public.
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:36.680]  Lindsay Williams.
[3:46:36.680 --> 3:46:40.760]  Yes, you're exactly right, and it matters not which one gets in.
[3:46:40.760 --> 3:46:45.960]  They won't, John McCain, now, they're not God, let me say that up front.
[3:46:45.960 --> 3:46:50.120]  They are not God and therefore they can always get what they want, and it looks as though
[3:46:50.120 --> 3:46:55.320]  McCain is a back runner right now, but either one that gets in, they're going to do exactly
[3:46:55.320 --> 3:46:59.080]  what they want, and especially, of course, they won't open up the Baltimore oil field.
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:01.680]  That's been made known by both Obama and McCain.
[3:47:01.680 --> 3:47:02.680]  All right.
[3:47:02.680 --> 3:47:04.400]  Let's take another call.
[3:47:04.400 --> 3:47:07.480]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[3:47:07.480 --> 3:47:11.040]  Yes, so many things to cover.
[3:47:11.040 --> 3:47:16.160]  I'd like to point out one course of action that's worked for me, a success story that
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:17.160]  was not risky.
[3:47:17.160 --> 3:47:22.600]  I had to go into court, I had to agree to or plea bargain to pay traffic tickets, and
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:29.000]  I used only two laws to not pay them, and they discharged my obligations when I went
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:34.800]  to pay with lawful money, which is defined under Title 12, Title of U.S. Code, Section
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:35.800]  152.
[3:47:35.800 --> 3:47:39.520]  Lawful money shall be construed to mean gold and silver coin of the United States.
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:44.360]  Yeah, that actually worked in IRS case and got 12 people off big indictments what a year
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:46.400]  ago in Las Vegas.
[3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:52.440]  No, I was ready to pay every time I went through six or seven hearings to show cause why I
[3:47:52.440 --> 3:47:56.880]  should not be held in contempt for not paying these fines I was ready to pay with Federal
[3:47:56.880 --> 3:47:57.880]  Reserve notes.
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:02.720]  I used Title 12, Section 152, then I also used the Uniform Commercial Code, which is
[3:48:02.720 --> 3:48:10.440]  in every state statute, if anyone wants to look up Section 3-603 that says that once
[3:48:10.440 --> 3:48:17.600]  the creditor, the person who was owed money, declined the tender, refuses the tender of
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:23.200]  the presentation of the lawful money in person, then they have discharged your obligation,
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:27.440]  and at the final hearing they put on a huge show with the county clerk, the city clerk,
[3:48:27.440 --> 3:48:28.440]  the city and state attorney.
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:33.120]  Yeah, let's be clear, by law they were supposed to take Congress even pass a letter law about
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:34.120]  it.
[3:48:34.120 --> 3:48:38.720]  They refused to take silver, gold, because they won't take legal tender, and so that
[3:48:38.720 --> 3:48:39.720]  was the end of it.
[3:48:39.720 --> 3:48:40.720]  Uh-huh.
[3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:47.800]  And also, Dr. Eugene Schroeder, if you're familiar with his work, sent a report, 93-549,
[3:48:47.800 --> 3:48:53.280]  which is the 1973 Senate report that says we have been in the state of national emergency
[3:48:53.280 --> 3:48:58.000]  since March 33, and the president runs the country without reference.
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  That's it.
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:00.000]  I got to jump, Chris.
[3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  Thank you.
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:02.000]  Dan in Virginia, you're on the air, Dan.
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  Go ahead.
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  Good, Alex.
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  Good.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:10.760]  I would just like to make a few points about the RFID chip up in New York, and I have a
[3:49:10.760 --> 3:49:16.160]  few cousins that live up in New York, and they say that they have an RFID chip in their
[3:49:16.160 --> 3:49:22.600]  licenses, and I guess if you throw your license in the microwave for a few seconds, they'll
[3:49:22.600 --> 3:49:23.600]  fry it.
[3:49:23.600 --> 3:49:24.600]  That's what I was told.
[3:49:24.600 --> 3:49:25.600]  I know it sounds stupid, but...
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:29.520]  No, it's true, and then it's in your passport now, but then they'll just refuse it and
[3:49:29.520 --> 3:49:33.400]  say it's not valuable, and they're also claiming it's a felony to tamper with it so it can
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:36.520]  accidentally be broken, they'll still go after you.
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:38.680]  We're all getting our control system.
[3:49:38.680 --> 3:49:43.400]  Let me get a comment from Lindsay Williams on this whole RFID grid that's going in.
[3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:44.400]  Pastor?
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:47.560]  Yes, it's all a part of the control factor.
[3:49:47.560 --> 3:49:49.360]  That just boils down to one simple thing.
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:52.520]  They want control of every person on the face of the earth.
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:54.800]  There's one thing I learned when I lived with these people.
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:49:59.920]  The name of the game is control, Alex.
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:02.520]  And I'm going quickly to your calls so we can get to all of them.
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:08.120]  Dan, Alex, and Christian, final call straight ahead with Lindsay Williams.

[3:53:56.720 --> 3:54:01.840]  It's not the case, folks, it's a jungle out there.
[3:54:01.840 --> 3:54:05.160]  Lindsey Williams, fire out the phone number for folks to get your latest video on all
[3:54:05.160 --> 3:54:06.160]  of this.
[3:54:06.160 --> 3:54:11.520]  The next 12 months, everything that the elite plan to do, what I was told on the phone by
[3:54:11.520 --> 3:54:17.160]  one of the elite is going to happen in DVD, you can view it at home, it's one hour long.
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:24.000]  Also, I put a sequel to that on a CD that you can listen to in your truck or vehicle.
[3:54:24.000 --> 3:54:33.240]  As you travel down the road, the number is 800-321-2900, and now we only have 25 energy
[3:54:33.240 --> 3:54:37.800]  non-prices left and they are forever gone, you heard me correctly.
[3:54:37.800 --> 3:54:43.480]  I do not plan to reprint, we have 25 of them left, first 25 callers get them.
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:50.160]  When you buy my series of 8 DVDs, one of them is the next 12 months, the folks, everything
[3:54:50.160 --> 3:54:54.880]  that the elite told me that goes on behind closed doors, you'll find it in here.
[3:54:54.880 --> 3:54:59.840]  I give a whole lot more than what I'm giving on the program, it's two hours, one hour of
[3:54:59.840 --> 3:55:08.080]  CD, one hour of DVD, my energy non-prices DVD updated to 2008, and some other DVDs, again
[3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:17.800]  the number is 800-321-2900, the first 25 callers get an energy non-prices, after that you'll
[3:55:17.800 --> 3:55:23.800]  get my book to seducionation, 800-321-2900.
[3:55:23.800 --> 3:55:32.120]  We're basically out of time here, Colin Powell, John McCain, Joe Biden, foreign prime ministers
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:37.840]  and presidents have all said in late January there's going to be a giant event, some say
[3:55:37.840 --> 3:55:41.400]  terror, some say economic, but they say we even know the date, but we can't tell you
[3:55:41.400 --> 3:55:46.720]  what it is, they talk to us like we're idiots, that is so obvious, do you have any idea what
[3:55:46.720 --> 3:55:47.720]  that is?
[3:55:47.720 --> 3:55:53.960]  This was intimated by this gentleman who talked to me on the phone back in the middle of June,
[3:55:53.960 --> 3:55:59.000]  and he indicated that something might take place just before the election, well two things
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:04.680]  already have, crude oil prices have drastically dropped, we have a financial crisis that you
[3:56:04.680 --> 3:56:09.120]  and I neither want expected it to happen this quick, what else they may try to do, it's
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:14.240]  anybody's guess, he didn't name it, but he did indicate or intimate that something probably
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:16.240]  would take place, Alec, you're exactly right.
[3:56:16.240 --> 3:56:21.120]  Let's jam in, listen to Alec Jones every day.
[3:56:21.120 --> 3:56:25.120]  Let's jam in two quick calls, quick question, Alex in Florida, then Christian in California,
[3:56:25.120 --> 3:56:32.480]  go ahead Alex, hello, yes go ahead, hey how you doing man, thanks for taking my call,
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:40.280]  I've been doing my studies for 18 years now, and what I've been seeing lately and down
[3:56:40.280 --> 3:56:46.320]  here in Florida is more and more biohazard equipment being moved around late at night,
[3:56:46.320 --> 3:56:47.520]  because I work at a job...
[3:56:47.520 --> 3:56:51.720]  That's their cover for federalizing things, but that's only the front for the martial
[3:56:51.720 --> 3:56:52.720]  law.
[3:56:52.720 --> 3:57:00.640]  Right, but somehow I just want to let all the callers and listeners know that somehow
[3:57:00.640 --> 3:57:06.240]  all the information that's gathered throughout all the conspiracies or whatever they want
[3:57:06.240 --> 3:57:12.400]  to call it, it's not really conspiracies man, they're ideas, and all the ideas can be put
[3:57:12.400 --> 3:57:17.720]  together because it's like how Einstein had his theory and everybody had all these scientists
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:21.880]  had their theory, and it turns out they were all right, not just one.
[3:57:21.880 --> 3:57:25.520]  That's a unification theory, and what we have is you can see the enemy program all around
[3:57:25.520 --> 3:57:28.720]  you, not just through their documents, thanks for the call, Alex, I'm sorry to Christian,
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:32.480]  we're just out of time, Pastor Williams, I want to talk to you in the near future, thank
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:34.880]  you for joining us and have a great week.
[3:57:34.880 --> 3:57:37.880]  God bless you, Alex, thank you for the privilege of being on your show.
[3:57:37.880 --> 3:57:41.160]  Oh no, thank you for the privilege of having you on ours, take care, Lindsay Williams, there
[3:57:41.160 --> 3:57:42.160]  he goes.
[3:57:42.160 --> 3:57:47.480]  I had Willie Nelson on in about ten after an amazing hour long interview, then an hour
[3:57:47.480 --> 3:57:51.400]  and fifty minute interview with Naomi Wolfe, getting into all the different facets of the
[3:57:51.400 --> 3:57:56.320]  New World Order control grid, the police state, that is all around us, it was an incredible
[3:57:56.320 --> 3:58:00.280]  show today, great job to my crew and everybody else, it restarts on the internet only with
[3:58:00.280 --> 3:58:05.640]  the podcast and the streams at infowars.com and then rebroadcast on MNFM across the country.
[3:58:05.640 --> 3:58:30.920]  Back live tomorrow at eleven a.m., God bless you all, we'll be right back in one minute.
