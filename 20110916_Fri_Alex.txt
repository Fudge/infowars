[00:59.840 --> 01:06.480]  incredible lineup of guests today including Dr. Andrew Wakefield who will be joining us in studio
[01:06.480 --> 01:16.360]  today to discuss new revelations about HPV vaccines possibly being contaminated this is some breaking
[01:16.360 --> 01:23.160]  news that came out from Sain Vax Inc and Dr. Andrew Wakefield will be commenting on that as well as
[01:23.160 --> 01:31.400]  the topic of Governor Rick Perry from Texas and how his pushing of a vaccination mandate back in
[01:31.400 --> 01:38.400]  2007 in the state of Texas has now turned into an attack point on the man believe it or not yeah
[01:38.400 --> 01:44.520]  the fact that he was pushing vaccines back in 2007 is now coming back to haunt him as it should
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.760]  so we will be discussing that here we've also got some other interesting guests gonna have a
[01:49.760 --> 01:57.040]  superfood advocate David Wolf on in the second hour for a brief section on superfoods that can
[01:57.040 --> 02:03.640]  help protect you against radiation yeah you know Fukushima isn't over yet in fact the latest
[02:03.640 --> 02:13.280]  information showed that it had emitted 168 times the total radiation of Chernobyl and it's still
[02:13.280 --> 02:19.520]  irradiating the atmosphere so Fukushima is not over radiation is still coming our way and it
[02:19.520 --> 02:26.000]  could even get worse there's also the issue of a solar flare that we talked about earlier this week
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.080]  week in fact I was a guest on Alex Jones show I believe it was Tuesday or Wednesday we talked
[02:31.080 --> 02:36.440]  about that issue and that could also pose a radiation risk so there's more of that coming up
[02:36.440 --> 02:43.760]  also we've got breaking news on another shutdown of a raw food producer in California a company
[02:43.760 --> 02:50.120]  that made a non-dairy sorbet product made out of frozen coconut water and coconut meat and
[02:50.120 --> 02:56.080]  organic local fruit they were shut down by the Department of Agriculture there in California
[02:56.080 --> 03:02.400]  we don't have the founder of that company on as a guest today however we do have inside information
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.240]  on that from Kippy Miller and that company is called truly raw gourmet so we'll be breaking
[03:07.240 --> 03:14.040]  that down for you in addition to that we have coming up in the bottom of the second hour

[03:28.360 --> 03:36.000]  armed agents came in stormed the place stole the food poured the raw milk down the drain took away
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.440]  tens of thousands of dollars and watermelons and mangoes and raw cheese and goat dairy products
[03:42.440 --> 03:49.800]  and charged three people with felony crimes yeah felony crimes well James Stewart although he
[03:49.800 --> 03:55.880]  cannot talk about the actual court case or any of those charges because he has had his first
[03:55.880 --> 04:02.360]  amendment rights stripped away by his his release agreement we'll get into that but he is going to
[04:02.360 --> 04:07.720]  be able to talk to us about his philosophy on food and some of the other cases involving raw

[07:11.960 --> 07:17.680]  Americans at home I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they
[07:17.680 --> 07:23.840]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[07:23.840 --> 07:30.160]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[07:30.160 --> 07:35.920]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke

[07:40.600 --> 07:47.320]  to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[07:54.480 --> 08:04.600]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv from his central Texas command center deep behind
[08:04.600 --> 08:11.360]  enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:11.360 --> 08:20.000]  hey welcome back folks to the Alex Jones show yeah we're having a good time here talking about
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.360]  freedom and liberty and we're going to be breaking down some of the issues that are trying to
[08:24.360 --> 08:31.360]  encroach upon our freedoms and our liberty starting with the NFL which recently announced
[08:31.360 --> 08:38.560]  that it was going to begin an enhanced pat down procedure for all NFL fans oh yeah you want to
[08:38.560 --> 08:44.800]  go watch a football game now you got to subject to a bunch of goons at the gate patting you down
[08:44.800 --> 08:52.520]  this is from the ankles up the ankles up I've never heard a pat down to really describe that
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.840]  that way I think what they mean is from the waist down at least that's the way the TSA has been
[08:57.840 --> 09:05.760]  running these pat down so I someone's got to put together a bunch of football jokes about this
[09:05.760 --> 09:11.280]  about how the pat downs are going to be described in in football lingo I'm not going to go into
[09:11.280 --> 09:15.840]  that here because it might not be appropriate but someone put that together should be a hit on
[09:15.840 --> 09:20.360]  info wars.com send it over to the editors but here's the deal all right there've been some
[09:20.360 --> 09:25.200]  security problems at football games they say well of course there are there's always security
[09:25.200 --> 09:30.360]  problems at football games a few people drink a little too much get into a fistfight and you
[09:30.360 --> 09:34.520]  know that's not terrorism that's just people getting a little rambunctious but now they want
[09:34.520 --> 09:41.520]  to they want to break it down to a whole new level of submitting to these jack booted thugs
[09:41.520 --> 09:48.760]  who are doing the security searches now what's the point of this this is not about NFL security
[09:48.760 --> 09:56.240]  this is not about football stadiums this is about indoctrinating the public to get used to being
[09:56.240 --> 10:02.480]  patted down more this is what the TSA has always been about with their roving vans that can conduct
[10:02.480 --> 10:07.120]  searches anywhere and everywhere across the country you see we always knew it wasn't just about the
[10:07.120 --> 10:13.240]  airports it was about indoctrinating you getting you used to licking their boots getting you used
[10:13.240 --> 10:19.080]  to the idea that government thugs with badges are going to reach down your pants and feel you up
[10:19.080 --> 10:25.760]  and stare you down and intimidate you and use both verbal and physical intimidation techniques to
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.880]  make sure that you don't step out of line well a lot of people said I'm not gonna fly just don't
[10:31.880 --> 10:35.320]  want to fly I don't want to deal with that I'm one of those people in fact I haven't flown since
[10:35.320 --> 10:41.240]  much of that went into place so they say well you don't want to fly ah but I bet you want to go
[10:41.240 --> 10:47.400]  to football games don't you so now we're gonna pat you down at the football games too well where
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.960]  else is this going well remember the TSA has already conducted pat downs at a high school dance if
[10:53.960 --> 10:59.480]  you can believe that and now we're talking about sporting events we're talking about high school
[10:59.480 --> 11:05.000]  events what about shopping malls this is getting to the point where it's pretty much like like
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.720]  the secret police east german stasi situation where you have to show your papers everywhere you go
[11:11.720 --> 11:18.520]  and you're subjected to intrusive and completely illegal pat downs everywhere you go see that's
[11:18.520 --> 11:23.760]  the other side of this this is all outrageously illegal this is a total violation of your
[11:23.760 --> 11:30.120]  fourth amendment rights you are not a a criminal just for showing up at a football game with a
[11:30.120 --> 11:35.600]  ticket in your hand but now they're gonna presume that you're guilty until they can prove that
[11:35.600 --> 11:42.280]  you're innocent with a pat down there goes the fourth amendment yet again not not not like it was
[11:42.280 --> 11:48.920]  about to be recovered but again this is this underscores the importance of why we've got to
[11:48.920 --> 11:55.040]  really fight for I would say two things in particular one is sharing the word about the
[11:55.040 --> 12:00.920]  Alex Jones show and about info wars and prisonplanet.com and checking out the new TV broadcast that
[12:00.920 --> 12:05.080]  are going on each weeknight and supporting the store here and everything that can help this
[12:05.080 --> 12:11.840]  organization succeed but secondly supporting Ron Paul as you know Ron Paul is the answer to
[12:11.840 --> 12:17.560]  tyranny which is why the mainstream media is so absolutely terrified of this man it's why they
[12:17.560 --> 12:24.280]  have to distort the after the post debate poll results to make it look like Ron Paul wasn't winning
[12:24.280 --> 12:30.360]  by a landslide in the minds of the public even though of course he is he is they have to tell
[12:30.360 --> 12:35.920]  lies and say that he can't win even though they know he can he can win if people vote with their
[12:35.920 --> 12:41.080]  hearts and their minds and they vote for what they know is right rather than voting their fears
[12:41.080 --> 12:47.440]  but Alex Jones is actually called for an NFL boycott so I don't think he's even had a chance
[12:47.440 --> 12:51.960]  to announce that on the air but this is an info wars report that I'm reading from right here Alex
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.600]  is called for boycott of the NFL after the intrusive pat down searches were announced this is a big
[12:57.600 --> 13:03.680]  deal I will let Alex give you more details about that on Monday when he's back I'm sure we'll have
[13:03.680 --> 13:10.320]  some very interesting thoughts to share on that issue now getting to some other news where are
[13:10.320 --> 13:18.520]  we we've got so much to cover here today there's a man named Greg Caten who was kidnapped abducted
[13:18.520 --> 13:27.520]  by US authorities in Ecuador this story broke first in 2000 what was it 2009 that he was abducted
[13:27.520 --> 13:35.440]  and he was oh man this is an incredible story the US State Department had operatives working in
[13:35.440 --> 13:41.120]  Ecuador they bribed the local police there they had men with guns intercept Greg Caten in his
[13:41.120 --> 13:47.880]  driveway they they shoved him into a vehicle drove him to a city called Waikile where they
[13:47.880 --> 13:52.080]  after a little bit of a hearing where a local judge said you got a set him free he hasn't
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.520]  violated any law any laws the US State Department officials thrust him onto an American Airlines
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.520]  airplane he was flown back to Miami and then he was incarcerated in Louisiana and Texas he
[14:03.520 --> 14:10.240]  served almost two years in federal prison for the so-called crime of selling quote unapproved drugs
[14:10.240 --> 14:16.480]  which were nothing more than plant-based herbal cures for cancer a topical cure that really works
[14:16.480 --> 14:21.880]  by the way it really does cure skin cancer and I have numerous testimonials on that even from
[14:21.880 --> 14:27.840]  esteemed scientists including a former NASA astronaut who has used that product but the
[14:27.840 --> 14:33.840]  point is Greg recently got out of prison alright he's back in Ecuador as of right now and that
[14:33.840 --> 14:39.520]  that's a whole story by itself of how he got back to Ecuador now that he's in Ecuador he and some
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.040]  of my contacts in Ecuador because I used to live there have been able to pull together some
[14:44.040 --> 14:51.640]  documentation documentation that now proves that his removal from Ecuador was highly illegal now
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.640]  for those of you watching here on prison prisonplanet.tv excuse me there's a graphic that you'll see
[14:57.640 --> 15:06.240]  it's the Policia Nacional del Ecuador it's a migration movement document this is a recording
[15:06.240 --> 15:13.800]  of where Gregory Katon was at every time in history in other words moving in and out of the
[15:13.800 --> 15:19.440]  country of Ecuador now if he had been extradited through any kind of legal process then this
[15:19.440 --> 15:25.360]  document would have shown that he left the country legally there would be a line on here that says
[15:25.360 --> 15:31.880]  he was that he flew out of Joaquin instead there is no line on this document indicating that he
[15:31.880 --> 15:39.360]  never left Ecuador legally he was illegally removed by US operatives criminals working for
[15:39.360 --> 15:47.360]  the FDA for the State Department criminals who engaged in an international abduction of a US
[15:47.360 --> 15:53.440]  citizen who was guilty of no crime in Ecuador whatsoever now think about this folks and think
[15:53.440 --> 15:57.280]  about the fact that you probably haven't heard this story before because the mainstream media
[15:57.280 --> 16:02.240]  isn't covering this at all they absolutely refuse to cover it this is I think this is one of the
[16:02.240 --> 16:08.640]  biggest stories of the week because it shows the criminality of the US government and the just
[16:08.640 --> 16:17.280]  the desperation that it is showing in trying to intimidate those who promote natural cancer therapies
[16:17.280 --> 16:24.480]  especially ones that really work now Greg Katon is hopefully going to be joining us at a future
[16:24.480 --> 16:30.200]  show date here on the Alex Jones so Alex Jones show I've also interviewed him on natural news
[16:30.200 --> 16:34.400]  we're going to have an interview published there watch for more stories on on Greg Katon just know
[16:34.400 --> 16:39.360]  that as of right now after serving two years in prison he is safe and sound in Ecuador now
[16:39.360 --> 16:43.720]  here's another interesting thing the US Food and Drug Administration was able to get Gregory Katon
[16:43.720 --> 16:51.280]  listed on Interpol yeah Interpol red flagged on Interpol now the the red flag status is normally
[16:51.280 --> 16:58.880]  reserved for individuals who are international war criminals or mass murderers or mass rapists I
[16:58.880 --> 17:06.560]  mean we're talking about serious hardcore criminals but Greg Katon was listed on there and they
[17:06.560 --> 17:12.400]  said that he was guilty of drug crimes what drugs herbs really is that what you you're
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.840]  talking about drug crimes but it gets even worse they were also able to get Greg Katon listed
[17:16.840 --> 17:25.600]  on a parade magazine lists of America's most wanted criminals which featured none other than
[17:25.600 --> 17:33.600]  Osama bin Laden and just underneath Osama bin Laden you see the picture of Greg Katon right
[17:33.600 --> 17:39.920]  that's how desperate they are you can't sell herbs that actually cure cancer in America now
[17:39.920 --> 17:43.880]  we're going to cover a lot of topics other than just health by the way we're going to cover politics
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.200]  we're going to cover freedom many other issues but I just wanted to mention that about Greg Katon
[17:48.200 --> 17:52.560]  because you got to know you got to know the truth about this story just in fact just search
[17:52.560 --> 17:59.600]  Greg Katon C-A-T-O-N on online if you want to get more about this story now let me let me fill
[17:59.600 --> 18:04.080]  you in we've just got a couple minutes left here let me fill you in on Kippy Miller and truly raw
[18:04.080 --> 18:11.160]  gourmet check out their website at truly raw gourmet.com this company was recently intimidated
[18:11.160 --> 18:17.320]  by the California Department of Agriculture the same people who raided raw some foods and it turns
[18:17.320 --> 18:24.400]  out that this company truly raw gourmet provides a frozen sorbet dessert to raw some foods and
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.560]  even the whole foods it's sold at Whole Foods but the people who conducted the raw some food
[18:29.560 --> 18:38.960]  raids in my opinion are such morons they thought frozen coconut sorbet was raw dairy so they raided
[18:38.960 --> 18:45.720]  well it's not really a raid they showed up at Kippy Miller's house flashing a badge they weren't
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.640]  toting guns in this case all right so maybe it's not a raid it was more like a here we are here's
[18:50.640 --> 18:54.520]  our badge lettuce in we're going to shut you down and they did shut her down and when they
[18:54.520 --> 19:00.400]  realized that she wasn't selling raw dairy products that it was only made out of coconut milk that
[19:00.400 --> 19:07.080]  was frozen they were just flabbergasted and they said well we're going to come back and give you
[19:07.080 --> 19:12.720]  some surprise raids in the future or not I'm sorry not raids inspections let me correct that

[24:39.720 --> 24:45.080]  now we've got dr andrew wakefield joining us in a few minutes here in the studio but leading up to that
[24:45.080 --> 24:54.280]  let's get into some of the breaking news about hpv vaccines now going into this it's incredible look
[24:55.320 --> 25:02.040]  the alex jones show and natural news both covered this years ago all right we were out there talking
[25:02.040 --> 25:08.440]  about how bad this was before it was cool so to speak back in 2007 and what's that quote about
[25:08.440 --> 25:14.920]  patriotism at some point there's no cost to stand up and speak out doesn't take any courage but
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.840]  the pioneers it really takes courage just to tell the truth especially in a time of such insanity but
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.720]  back in 2007 we told the truth and you heard it right here on the alex jones show and on info
[25:25.720 --> 25:31.640]  wars dot com with articles by kurt nimo and many others paul joseph watson etc you heard the truth
[25:31.640 --> 25:38.520]  and that truth was that this mandating of hpv vaccines to teenage girls in texas was a very
[25:38.520 --> 25:46.360]  dangerous ploy ploy excuse me and also it was an illegal ploy because there was no law passed by
[25:46.360 --> 25:53.080]  the state legislature that would have required such mandatory vaccinations and yet governor rick
[25:53.080 --> 25:57.480]  parry said that this is now a law you got to have your children vaccinated meanwhile girls were
[25:57.480 --> 26:03.560]  suffering side effects and they're just being maimed and harmed and some some people have died
[26:03.560 --> 26:09.960]  in the hours in the days following hpv vaccinations that's on the record there's no question about
[26:09.960 --> 26:15.400]  that the question is why are they so dangerous what's really going on what's really in these
[26:15.400 --> 26:21.800]  vaccines now some fascinating news on that has come out from sainte vacs ink and maybe you can
[26:21.800 --> 26:29.160]  bring that up for the prison planet dot tv viewers sainte vacs ink has put out news about well they
[26:29.160 --> 26:35.320]  tested 13 vials of hpv vaccinations from many different countries across the world including
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.960]  vials taken from three different states in the united states and they found through laboratory
[26:39.960 --> 26:46.360]  testing they found those vials to be contaminated with the recombinant dna of two different strains
[26:46.360 --> 26:53.880]  of hpv that the human papilloma virus of course which were attached to the aluminum adjuvants
[26:53.880 --> 27:00.120]  that were found in the vaccines now now hold the presses for a minute this is a whole story right
[27:00.120 --> 27:08.760]  here okay number one why is there aluminum in the vaccines aluminum is a neurotoxic metal that
[27:08.760 --> 27:14.760]  should never be ingested in the human body and it most certainly should not be injected into
[27:14.760 --> 27:19.640]  the bloodstream so that's number one if you're getting vaccinated you're getting injected with
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.840]  aluminum and many other things such as methyl mercury in the thimerosal
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.000]  preservative but there are other chemical adjuvants in vaccines that are that are very very
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.240]  dangerous but then the second part of the story is that there was recombinant dna of two different
[27:35.240 --> 27:40.920]  strains of hpv which don't belong in your blood by the way even someone who is infected with
[27:40.920 --> 27:49.800]  human papilloma virus is not normally carrying this dna in their blood and it gets even worse
[27:49.800 --> 27:56.760]  it was a genetically engineered recombinant dna of two different strains of hpv that were found
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.880]  attached to the aluminum adjuvant that is then injected into the girls that is then mandated
[28:01.880 --> 28:07.320]  by governor rick perry who's now running for president and says he apologizes oh we didn't
[28:07.320 --> 28:13.800]  review that enough he says well how come he didn't say that in 2007 and now get this the
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.960]  scientific community out there i'm talking about well they call themselves scientists they're really
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.800]  a bunch of quacks the vaccine pushers these conventional scientists who quite literally
[28:23.800 --> 28:30.520]  believe that humans have no free will no consciousness not even a soul i'll get into that more they say
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.160]  oh what why are you even debating this issue vaccines are good for everybody governor rick
[28:35.160 --> 28:39.400]  perry did the right thing we should have all the governors of all the states announced mandates for
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.920]  all the vaccination of not just little girls but even little boys too because don't little boys suffer
[28:44.920 --> 28:51.720]  from cervical cancer bizarre what did they not take anatomy class in high school or something
[28:51.720 --> 28:57.640]  they want to push us on the teenage boys too i mean it just gets so bizarre this is like the way
[28:57.640 --> 29:04.840]  that they rewrote the rules of science about where does steel melt with 9 11 they say steel melt at
[29:04.840 --> 29:09.880]  a thousand degrees fahrenheit now they just completely rewrite the laws of physics just as
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.440]  they've tried to rewrite the laws of medicine to say all vaccination is always good for you
[29:14.440 --> 29:19.000]  and these chemical adjuvants ah they're they're harmless yeah no no problem with that
[29:20.440 --> 29:25.560]  truly incredible anyway when we come back we are going to show you we're going to play you
[29:25.560 --> 29:31.720]  some audio from a top merc scientists who openly admitted that these vaccines are contaminated with
[29:31.720 --> 29:36.920]  all kinds of viral strains also we talk about dr andrew wakefield when we return stay with us
[29:36.920 --> 29:55.880]  here on the alex jones show we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[32:06.920 --> 32:12.200]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[32:12.200 --> 32:17.160]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[32:17.160 --> 32:22.280]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[32:22.280 --> 32:27.720]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[32:27.720 --> 32:32.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands
[32:32.840 --> 32:37.960]  of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[32:37.960 --> 32:42.520]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[33:58.280 --> 34:03.240]  i'm out in public or or i'm buying something and people will say military discount and i said well
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.000]  no you know i didn't serve in the military and then they asked me did you serve your country
[34:07.000 --> 34:14.440]  and one time i actually said yes i hosted the alex jones show i served my country i served the cause
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.880]  of freedom and liberty because i contributed to info wars dot com that is just as important
[34:19.880 --> 34:25.720]  as serving your country in any other way and by the way kudos to all the veterans and all the good
[34:25.720 --> 34:31.400]  law enforcement and all the good federal agents out there who are still trying to serve their
[34:31.400 --> 34:37.320]  country even in the face of all the tyrants and all the goons and all the thugs who are of course
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.360]  trampling over our rights every day in any case it's an honor to be here now joining us in this
[34:42.360 --> 34:46.920]  segment is is dr andrew wakefield will bring will be bringing him in in just a second here but first
[34:46.920 --> 34:53.800]  i wanted to play you some audio from a little known interview from several decades ago this was
[34:53.800 --> 35:01.560]  an interview recorded with dr marrice hillamon who was a top murk vaccine scientist he was one of
[35:01.560 --> 35:08.040]  the leading scientists in fact in the history of vaccines in western medicine and this recording
[35:08.040 --> 35:13.640]  which is several decades old shows him openly admitting that those vaccines which at that
[35:13.640 --> 35:19.800]  time were largely polio vaccines were widely contaminated with unknown viruses 40 different
[35:19.800 --> 35:28.040]  strains uh also um what else leukemia he says in this interview they talk about how these vaccines
[35:28.040 --> 35:34.920]  would give people cancer and i want you to hear this interview which he never knew probably that
[35:34.920 --> 35:38.360]  there was going to be an internet he probably never knew this was going to be listened to by
[35:38.360 --> 35:43.080]  millions of people i want you to listen to his words and you have to listen carefully because
[35:43.080 --> 35:49.080]  the audio is not that great but listen carefully and then listen for the laughter of the other people
[35:49.080 --> 35:55.640]  who are in the room when they hear him talk about how deadly these vaccines are they laugh at it
[35:55.640 --> 36:00.280]  that's how evil these people are go ahead and roll that journey and the important thing is to get
[36:00.280 --> 36:06.200]  rid of these virus why would he call it an obfuscation if it was a virus that was because we well
[36:06.200 --> 36:12.920]  there are 40 different viruses in these vaccines anyway that we were inactivating and uh but you
[36:12.920 --> 36:18.680]  weren't inactivating the that's correct no that's right but yellow fever vaccine had leukemia
[36:18.680 --> 36:25.000]  virus and it and you know this is in the days of very crude science so anyway i went down and
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.520]  talked to him i was like well why are you concerned about it i said well i'll tell you what i said i
[36:30.520 --> 36:36.600]  have a feeling in my bones that this virus is different i i don't know why to tell you this
[36:36.600 --> 36:40.920]  but i've been around bars the only time i just think this virus may have some long-term effects
[36:40.920 --> 36:53.400]  all right all right go ahead do you hear that he says i think this virus may i think this virus
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.160]  may have some long-term effects or this vaccine and they ask him what what long-term effects and
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.640]  he says cancer and then they break out in the laughter like it's the funniest thing they've
[37:03.640 --> 37:07.880]  ever heard and then later on in this interview they also talk about how these vaccines are being
[37:07.880 --> 37:13.000]  tested in russia and this is how the u.s. olympic team is going to win the olympics because they
[37:13.000 --> 37:19.960]  say that all the russian athletes will be burdened down with cancer tumors this is how evil this
[37:19.960 --> 37:27.160]  industry really is if you get back to the history of where vaccines come from the evil just oozes
[37:27.160 --> 37:34.040]  out of these people it's unbelievable now here to comment on some of these issues and more
[37:34.040 --> 37:40.200]  we have in studio joining us one of the heroes of what you might call loosely the vaccine truth
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.000]  movement although i'm not sure if he would consider himself to be part of a vaccine truth
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.360]  movement i don't know he's a scientist one of the most recognized scientists in the realms of
[37:50.360 --> 37:55.720]  studying the effects of vaccines dr andrew wakefield dr wakefield thanks for joining me here today
[37:55.720 --> 38:00.200]  it's great to be back thank you it's good to see you again i haven't i haven't interviewed you in
[38:00.200 --> 38:05.160]  a couple of months a lot's been going on uh you brought some documentation with you can you first
[38:05.160 --> 38:12.120]  comment about the recent findings as as much as you can i mean i know hpv vaccines are not
[38:12.120 --> 38:17.080]  necessarily your area of expertise but uh you've studied a lot of vaccines can you comment on the
[38:17.080 --> 38:23.800]  same vax ink findings that garter still appears to be contaminated with recombinant dna certainly as
[38:23.800 --> 38:27.560]  you say mike i'm not an expert on this particular vaccine but given the fact that i have a young
[38:27.560 --> 38:32.920]  daughter it's something that as a parent i've been studying and looking at uh what same vax did was
[38:32.920 --> 38:39.000]  just to as i understand it to examine 13 uh vaccines vaccine lots from around the world for sale
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.920]  around the world and found that all of them 100 were contaminated with the dna the recombinant dna
[38:46.920 --> 38:52.120]  from which the protein that makes the vaccine was actually made it was assumed in the manufacturing
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.040]  process that it was not there an assumption it was easily tested clearly it was not tested for if
[38:58.040 --> 39:04.520]  it was tested for that wasn't disclosed but now we find that people girls are being injected with
[39:04.520 --> 39:12.520]  recombinant dna and that dna is linked in the analysis to the aluminum adjuvant in other words
[39:12.520 --> 39:17.320]  you've got a perfect storm you've got the adjuvant that boosts the immune response that activates the
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.680]  immune system linked to the dna it causes inflammation absolutely the adjuvant that's what it's designed
[39:22.680 --> 39:27.800]  to do it provokes the inflammatory response and that is why it's there but when you've got it linked
[39:27.800 --> 39:34.440]  to a dna particle then the probability is that you are going to produce antibodies not to protect
[39:34.440 --> 39:40.200]  that girl but antibodies directed against the dna which then can go on and cause any number
[39:40.200 --> 39:45.080]  of autoimmune or inflammatory responses in those individuals well that's what actually initiated this
[39:45.080 --> 39:53.880]  investigation was one a girl suffered i believe it was juvenile onset arthritis an autoimmune
[39:53.880 --> 39:59.640]  disorder within days after receiving this injection and she or her family went to sainvax and said
[40:00.200 --> 40:04.680]  can you investigate this what's going on and that's what led to this investigation that's right now
[40:04.680 --> 40:09.720]  they believe that she was shown years later to still have that same recombinant dna in her blood
[40:09.720 --> 40:15.560]  detected in a very advanced laboratory and so that is of great concern it's concern that they
[40:15.560 --> 40:19.640]  did not know it was there or said they did not know it was there therefore adequate safety testing
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.080]  had not been done by definition now this vaccine has been administered forcibly in many cases to
[40:25.080 --> 40:30.040]  many many children and now they find that it's contaminated with this unknown product really
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.880]  in terms of its long-term consequences its medium-term consequences and it is impossible for them to say
[40:35.880 --> 40:39.400]  that the benefits are the way the risk because they have no idea what the risks of that being
[40:39.400 --> 40:45.000]  there right they always say that that's the the standard line the mantra of the vaccine industry
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.600]  the benefits outweigh the risks but they don't know the risks it's a complete deception they did
[40:48.600 --> 40:52.760]  not even know such an incompetence that they did not even know it was there in the first place
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.160]  and they are not in a position to pronounce upon whether it is going to cause adverse events or
[40:57.160 --> 41:02.120]  not well truly extraordinary but but let me ask you a really basic question one of my readers
[41:02.120 --> 41:10.680]  asked me this too shouldn't shouldn't the HPV vaccine contain some level of weakened viral DNA
[41:10.680 --> 41:16.200]  isn't that well what it contains is the protein and the protein elicits the immune response
[41:16.200 --> 41:21.880]  that's the purpose of it it should not contain the naked DNA why because that DNA has the ability
[41:21.880 --> 41:26.360]  to integrate into the human DNA it gets into the cells it can get into the DNA it can get into the
[41:26.360 --> 41:31.880]  human gene and once it's in there it's in there you cannot get it out this I mean theoretically
[41:31.880 --> 41:38.920]  then this is almost like giving someone human papillomavirus internally I mean this is this is
[41:38.920 --> 41:45.480]  like spreading the disease almost we don't even know what it is it can integrate anywhere in the
[41:45.480 --> 41:50.200]  human genome and it has the potential therefore to switch on cancer genes or other things we do
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.840]  not know but clearly vigilance needs to be far more vigilance needs to be applied yeah yeah
[41:54.840 --> 41:58.920]  clearly I mean this this is stunning news a couple of things on this the Institute of Medicine
[41:58.920 --> 42:04.600]  recently admitted in its report on vaccines which of course was highly distorted in the press to
[42:04.600 --> 42:09.000]  say oh vaccines don't cause autism but nobody in the mainstream media reported some of the
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.520]  other findings that the IOM admitted to which include the fact that measles vaccines contain
[42:14.520 --> 42:21.240]  live measles viruses that actually cause measles in some recipients of the measles vaccine yes
[42:21.240 --> 42:25.800]  indeed and brain inflammation as well and brain inflammation yeah but the main outcome of that
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.720]  IOM meeting is that it was an admission that there is no science at all the science is absolutely
[42:29.720 --> 42:35.240]  pathetic in relation to safety so these pronouncements about the safety is there it's been proven
[42:35.240 --> 42:42.280]  they are simply not tenable and yet the me the mainstream media and the vaccine industry has
[42:42.280 --> 42:46.600]  fooled everybody when I put this story out this was put published on natural news as well as
[42:46.600 --> 42:53.480]  in for wars and we started to see responses come in from people one person chimed in a woman said
[42:53.480 --> 42:57.560]  this couldn't possibly be true because if it were there would be congressional hearings
[42:57.560 --> 43:02.200]  and there would be investigations and the media would be talking about it therefore I mean this
[43:02.200 --> 43:07.240]  was her logic therefore this can't possibly be true because we haven't heard about it right we
[43:07.240 --> 43:13.000]  would be put up with 15 years of tobacco is good for you science you know this is nothing new at all
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.400]  and it depends who's pulling the strings in congress and pharmaceutical industry is pulling
[43:17.400 --> 43:21.080]  those strings it's not going to get to the process of a hearing and what we're going through in
[43:21.080 --> 43:25.960]  california you'd probably know it this this bill a b 4 9 9 at the moment is taking away the rights
[43:25.960 --> 43:29.880]  of parents to determine whether their children get vaccinated so chill girls as young as 12
[43:29.880 --> 43:36.280]  can go to school and secretly get the vaccine of their own volition hepatitis b h pv and the
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.720]  rights are taken away from the parents to look after their children this is an utter disgrace
[43:39.720 --> 43:43.720]  all right are you hearing this folks are you listening to this this is a bill in california
[43:43.720 --> 43:48.840]  that would allow children to secretly say yes to vaccination without their parents consent
[43:48.840 --> 43:53.960]  and of course the state and the schools will will manipulate the opinions of the children
[43:53.960 --> 43:58.280]  or sort of intimidate them into accepting these vaccines what's the bill number again and do you
[43:58.280 --> 44:01.960]  have a website where people can go to take action on this nine and yes i'll let me give the website
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.560]  to your guy and we can put it up after okay we'll put it up after the after the break we still have
[44:05.560 --> 44:09.480]  a couple minutes here what's your website dr. wayfield that people want to learn more about
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.360]  your work well we have callous hyphen disregard dot com which is the book that i wrote in relic
[44:14.360 --> 44:21.160]  callous disregard the uk and then we have um vaccine safety first dot com which goes to the
[44:21.160 --> 44:25.480]  issue of brian dears lies in the media about falsification of data all right can you can
[44:25.480 --> 44:30.280]  you bring that up vaccine safety first dot com folks definitely go there and check out that
[44:30.280 --> 44:36.360]  information and the book your most recent book is called callous disregard which lays out some
[44:36.360 --> 44:41.080]  of the evidence of uh just just a complete abandonment of scientific principles within the
[44:41.080 --> 44:45.160]  vaccine industry is that an accurate assessment that is absolutely right mike can i just say
[44:45.160 --> 44:49.960]  one thing more absolutely if we've got time and that is the way this is going to go mike is that
[44:49.960 --> 44:53.800]  a group of children are going to go to school who've not had the vaccine and they are going to be
[44:53.800 --> 44:58.440]  shown a film and they take children we're going to show you this film and they don't tell them
[44:58.440 --> 45:01.560]  it's sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry but they will show them a film and it will show the
[45:01.560 --> 45:05.880]  horrors of cervical cancer and those children will be frightened deliberately frightened
[45:05.880 --> 45:09.720]  into getting the vaccine don't tell your parents kids but you get this vaccine because this is
[45:09.720 --> 45:13.960]  going to happen to you if you don't get it and then what will happen is maybe 50% of those kids
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.480]  will get frightened enough to get the vaccine the others won't because they'll trust their parents
[45:17.480 --> 45:23.080]  so then it'll be kids if you get this vaccine the full series you're going to get a 50% discount on
[45:23.080 --> 45:28.680]  an ipad that's what's going to happen right i know these people this is how i've seen the
[45:28.680 --> 45:33.080]  vaccine industry at work the minority of funding goes into vaccine research and development and
[45:33.080 --> 45:37.800]  safety studies the great majority of the funding in those companies goes to the marketing element
[45:37.800 --> 45:41.960]  of those companies and they'll tell the kids if your parents are against vaccines they must be
[45:41.960 --> 45:46.280]  members of al-qaeda that's it it's it the rights will be taken away from the parents the parents
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.760]  who have protected their children since the beginning of mankind on this planet are suddenly
[45:50.760 --> 45:55.240]  going to be usurped by who by the state and by the pharmaceutical industry yet another reason
[45:55.240 --> 46:01.000]  to homeschool your kids folks or uh go go to some private schools i mean yeah the the propaganda from
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.880]  public schools can be quite intimidating and and very misleading this sounds like some of the
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.440]  the films they used to show about marijuana back in the 50s to try to make marijuana look like it
[46:10.440 --> 46:18.120]  would make turn people into crazy zombie you know frantic monsters and it's called propaganda it's
[46:18.120 --> 46:24.040]  simple straightforward propaganda and children are most vulnerable to propaganda yeah absolutely
[46:24.040 --> 46:28.360]  now speaking of propaganda let's get to governor rick perry because there that we have all kinds
[46:28.360 --> 46:34.520]  of propaganda uh being shoveled around out there michelle bachman recently attacked rick perry over
[46:34.520 --> 46:41.160]  his uh mandate in texas that was trying to force all texas teenage girls to be injected with garter
[46:41.160 --> 46:45.560]  sill now what what are your thoughts on this whole debate well i think it first of all it was an
[46:45.560 --> 46:51.000]  abusive process i think you know uh executive orders are put there to protect the people
[46:51.000 --> 46:58.120]  in times of for example crisis or uh war they're not put there to force vaccination upon a population
[46:58.120 --> 47:02.840]  of girls particularly when that vaccine has been totally inadequately assessed for safety it was put
[47:02.840 --> 47:08.600]  on the market as a pure marketing exercise was not even intended for girls in this country it was
[47:08.600 --> 47:13.480]  designed as a vaccine for girls in third world countries who did not have access to regular
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.400]  cervical smears oh really that's an interesting angle oh yeah no i've listened to the girl who
[47:17.400 --> 47:22.360]  was part of this phase two and three studies on this and she says look okay i'm really unhappy
[47:22.360 --> 47:26.600]  about this vaccine because let's say it works in 20 to 30 percent of people and we don't even know
[47:26.600 --> 47:30.840]  how long it works for it may be that the antibodies don't even last for more than five years and they
[47:30.840 --> 47:35.960]  need to last for at least 15 years for that public health policy to be effective it's never been
[47:35.960 --> 47:40.760]  shown to protect anybody against any form of cervical cancer at all so let's just say that that
[47:40.760 --> 47:46.520]  vaccine doesn't work in 70 percent of the population you do not know whether you're 30 percent or 70
[47:46.520 --> 47:51.480]  percent sure you're still going to go and have your cervical smear on an annual basis and that is
[47:51.480 --> 47:56.760]  the best way of protecting against cervical cancer so there's no cost saving whatsoever now here's
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.560]  the danger it may be that you say well i've had a vaccine so i'm going to assume i'm safe so i don't
[48:01.560 --> 48:05.160]  go for my smear right and you're one of the 70 percent is not protected and then you're going to
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.640]  develop a cancer and you did so because you forewent your throat you went your your cervical
[48:09.640 --> 48:14.040]  smear because you thought wrongly that you were protected by the vaccine well and plus that whole
[48:14.040 --> 48:18.760]  scenario there is based on the idea that the vaccine actually works and doesn't harm you in some other
[48:18.760 --> 48:26.520]  ways that that are now possible issues with this dna contamination or our dna contamination uh being
[48:26.520 --> 48:31.000]  tied to the adjuvant chemical aluminum in the vaccines so there's another reason to start
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.800]  questioning the whole line that well lies really by the vaccine industry there's one other point
[48:35.800 --> 48:39.400]  on that mike this biological effect and that is what was found in the original studies which was
[48:39.400 --> 48:45.400]  not broadly uh what broadcast widely was that women who had already been exposed to human
[48:45.400 --> 48:50.040]  papillomavirus they already had antibodies in their blood to hpv in fact when they were given the
[48:50.040 --> 48:57.640]  vaccine it accelerated to a cancerous process to a pre-cancerous process so it did not protect
[48:57.640 --> 49:02.760]  and it may have actually accelerated the progression to cancer well because in that case the vaccine
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.000]  is interfering with the body's natural immune response process which is basically taking care
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.680]  of the problem as it does you know the human immune system is an amazing piece of biotechnology
[49:12.680 --> 49:18.600]  i mean miraculous in its function right so now they come in and they inject this this intervention
[49:18.600 --> 49:24.680]  and as you were just describing it it can actually then increase the woman's risk of cervical cancer
[49:24.680 --> 49:30.040]  well it seems that those women who are already positive for the virus right may well have progressed
[49:30.040 --> 49:33.960]  in having been given the vaccine now you would say well we don't know whether this is real or not
[49:33.960 --> 49:37.720]  but we should test women before giving them the vaccine on the basis that we do not want
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.440]  women to progress are women routinely tested our children routinely tested for prior exposure in
[49:42.440 --> 49:49.160]  school no they are absolutely not so what are we doing we do not know and they most certainly do not
[49:49.160 --> 49:56.120]  know i wonder how long it's going to take before this this great wall of disinfo that the vaccine
[49:56.120 --> 50:01.480]  industry surrounds itself with you know the quackery the disinformation the outright fabrications the
[50:01.480 --> 50:06.600]  lies the criminality the corruption even the bribery the falsification of data in clinical
[50:06.600 --> 50:14.440]  trials i could go on but when will this damn break when when will the the great wall of disinfo
[50:15.080 --> 50:20.600]  be shattered you think and and the truth will will pour out and the whole vaccine industry
[50:20.600 --> 50:25.960]  will be exposed as crooks and criminals like it's breaking it's leaking that damn is leaking so
[50:25.960 --> 50:31.640]  badly at the moment and the reason that they're attacks on me for example and on uh uh this congress
[50:31.640 --> 50:37.640]  woman have been so vicious is because they're losing they're losing and they cannot understand why
[50:37.640 --> 50:41.880]  the public are not being coerced by their public relations and their policy they can't work that
[50:41.880 --> 50:45.880]  out and they're furious we got to go to break it drives them crazy you're right dr andrew wakefield
[50:45.880 --> 50:50.840]  is with us here on the alex jones show we'll be right back after this break with more including
[50:50.840 --> 51:03.320]  secret memos on vaccine stay with us right here on the alex jones show alex jones here with vital
[51:03.320 --> 51:08.600]  information concerning our nation's fragile food supply folks there are some truly dangerous trends
[51:08.600 --> 51:14.360]  forming and i think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away number one study the
[51:14.360 --> 51:21.480]  past history really does repeat itself number two learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends
[51:22.520 --> 51:29.400]  number three take decisive action a perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis
[51:29.400 --> 51:35.560]  that's why i'm telling everyone to read the new book rising prices empty shelves warning signs
[51:35.560 --> 51:41.800]  that trigger the deadliest famines in history don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits

[54:32.760 --> 54:38.120]  that to happen now we're joined in studio right now by dr andrew wakefield and we've been discussing
[54:38.120 --> 54:44.440]  the garter cell vaccine and the hpv vaccinations and governor rick harry and i promise before the break
[54:44.440 --> 54:51.400]  that dr wakefield will be bringing you some secret memos actually are you sure that these are secret
[54:51.400 --> 54:56.760]  memos dr wakefield or these are what are these public posts or these are public posts yeah they're
[54:56.760 --> 55:01.800]  again all right i'm the initiative of sane banks they've obtained what appears to be at least a first
[55:01.800 --> 55:08.680]  blush um insider uh blogs or exchanges on a blog for members of the pharmaceutical industry and
[55:08.680 --> 55:13.160]  these are people who work in the vaccine industry posting these things that is certainly the inference
[55:13.160 --> 55:16.920]  from the way these are written a language that's used all right read us a couple let's hear what
[55:18.120 --> 55:22.840]  what they go to is a reflection of what's happening behind the scenes the state of moral and the
[55:22.840 --> 55:28.040]  perception of this problem from people working within the industry itself and i imagine at various
[55:28.040 --> 55:33.800]  levels it says here all the farmers bend the truth a little this is a quote there's a direct quote on
[55:33.800 --> 55:39.160]  the blog it goes with the business the issue is that we can't screw up the product during the
[55:39.160 --> 55:44.680]  manufacturing process we need a better system in place to pick this shit excuse me up oh you can't
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.240]  see you can't say that on the air i am sure we have a department that checks this crap i guess i
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.240]  can say that yeah that's about as far as you go they are sleeping behind the wheel not only does
[55:53.240 --> 55:59.080]  this screw up my sales it's expletive deleted yeah up getting products through the pipeline because
[55:59.080 --> 56:07.160]  the fda has no faith in us new products is how we make our money seek it then goes on and murk
[56:07.160 --> 56:12.920]  will handle this just the way they handled viox deny deny deny until the fda is forced to do
[56:12.920 --> 56:18.680]  something it's one thing when adults are hurt when kids get hurt look out murk will finally get it
[56:18.680 --> 56:23.720]  what what it deserves that's great as if trying to sell a vaccine with this many reactions isn't
[56:23.720 --> 56:29.240]  hard enough already the most depressing thing about these posts is that none of us are surprised
[56:29.240 --> 56:34.840]  that this happened maybe it's time to cut the cord now what what website is this from this is on
[56:34.840 --> 56:41.240]  sainvax but i mean they they sourced it from another discussion group that's vaccine or pharma
[56:41.240 --> 56:46.840]  insider i think is called cafe pharma which is an internal a blog within the industry i've seen
[56:46.840 --> 56:52.440]  i've seen that before i've seen yeah i've seen some people on there sort of venting but in in all
[56:52.440 --> 56:59.400]  fairness we don't really know that these could be people just sort of planting these it's possible
[56:59.400 --> 57:04.600]  right we don't know who they are necessarily it could well be it could well be any but it says here
[57:04.600 --> 57:08.760]  and you read you and i remember that when we were at the launch meeting and they were laying out the
[57:08.760 --> 57:12.920]  marketing marketing strategy for garthasil you didn't have to be a genius to see that the whole
[57:12.920 --> 57:19.000]  thing stank from day one now at least one can infer from that reasonably without invoking
[57:19.000 --> 57:25.720]  defamation that this came from someone within the industry who was in fact themselves at that
[57:25.720 --> 57:30.680]  marketing strategy meeting well and it fits a pattern we've seen x pharmaceutical reps speak
[57:30.680 --> 57:36.200]  out and write books and go public with what happened inside the industry there have been people
[57:36.200 --> 57:43.000]  from the pharmaceutical companies who have gone public from the executive level inside pharmaceutical
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.160]  companies that have gone public and that have told similar stories so it definitely fits a pattern
[57:47.160 --> 57:52.760]  it's not like this is some odd you know where did this come from no this this is fitting the pattern
[57:52.760 --> 57:57.800]  of what pharma is doing quite right and it was first disclosed to me this issue of women who
[57:57.800 --> 58:03.720]  are already positive for him papillomavirus antibodies progressing to develop more invasive
[58:03.720 --> 58:11.000]  forms of tumor or pre tumors that this in fact was inside information provided to to me from someone
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.960]  within the company extraordinary information i'd like to ask you to stay with us we're going to

[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:45.720]  down from the ankles up just for watching a football game it's there it's the beginning
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:53.320]  of the massive invasion of your privacy in public places no longer just the airport no longer just
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:59.320]  government buildings now it's going to be every sporting event every shopping event every school
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:05.320]  event you name it and we'll get into that later right now i'm joined in studio by dr andrew wakefield
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:13.080]  who is of course the researcher researcher who first looked at the links between vaccines and
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.400]  gastrointestinal disorders in children now interestingly dr wakefield never said he never
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:27.880]  said that vaccines cause autism and yet that accusation has been used against him in numerous
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:34.600]  smear campaigns and total lies and total fabrications by even medical journals and of course
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.160]  virtually everyone in the mainstream media all the usual suspects we're not even going to get
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.280]  into that now we were talking before the break dark and wakefield about the the bill in california
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:51.720]  what this this bill once again would allow schools to inject children with vaccines
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.640]  without parental consent correct i want to get another action item from you on this what can
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:03.240]  people do right now to resist this vaccine tyranny in california and help defeat this bill
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.600]  well i think if parents do not oppose this bill then they're going to fail their own
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.960]  children in california for a long long time to come the thing to do is to contact the office of
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:18.680]  governor brown to veto the bill ab 499 and that must be done as soon as possible the bill has
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.760]  actually been passed but not signed off but there are many in california who think it has
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:29.240]  actually been put into action so it has passed it must be vetoed by the governor refusing to sign
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.960]  it off so if governor brown goes along with this bill he could end up having the reputation that
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:39.800]  governor perry has today for mandating vaccines although it's a different it's not a it's not
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:45.080]  a mandate necessarily but it's the same issue of vaccines being injected into children without
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.040]  parental consent i think governor perry made a mistake i think he acknowledged that he made
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:55.320]  a mistake and that has since come to light and hasn't gone as far as this has gone this is a
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.600]  bill that is actually passed and is merely waiting to be signed off by the governor this is far more
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.560]  insidious and far more dangerous yeah that's scary that that all the the state legislature
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.920]  there in california approved of this they must have received all kinds of money from the drug
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:18.040]  companies one can only yes you can that's a pretty pretty safe assumption what's the latest on the
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.800]  autism situation and also want to ask you has the british medical journal yet retracted their
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:30.440]  baseless attacks on you where they distorted the the facts where they lied they just openly lied
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:36.200]  about where your data came from in your research and why it it didn't match some of the original
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.840]  uh general physicians and so on any updates on that situation well the simple answer to the
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.240]  question is no they have not retracted but they have now in the very in the last few days been
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.080]  given the opportunity to retract having been presented with the definitive evidence there
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:54.520]  was absolutely no fraud in fact the fraud was fully on the part of the journalist brian dear so
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.560]  we shall await events on that one and see where they go with that but clearly the bmj are incompetent
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.400]  in as much that they failed to check their facts and they've got themselves into a very difficult
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.360]  situation now as far as autism in general what has happened since i spoke to you last mic we've had
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:14.280]  the paper from south korea showing uh one in 38 one in 36 children in south korea have autism an
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:20.120]  extraordinary level of disease we've had a number of papers showing that it is far more uh of an
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:25.320]  environmental disorder than previously thought far less of a genetic disorder so that may simply
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.960]  be that the profile of the disease is changing and what we're seeing is a novel environmental
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:35.240]  disease emerging well and by environmental you mean things that have been injected into them
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.320]  or that they've been exposed to yeah things in the environment that they have been exposed to
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.240]  all right we got to go to break i want to thank you for joining me dr wakefield wakefield it's

[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.720]  oh this is great comedy but it's not comedy this is really happening attack watch dot com
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:07.960]  this has been put up by the obama group the obama supporters uh oh my gosh this is this is great
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:14.360]  where you're supposed to report any kind of a smear or any kind of attack on obama yeah or
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.960]  maybe maybe did you hear your neighbor say something bad about obama like we lost our jobs
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:26.440]  because the economy is being crushed by global uh global bankers and criminals who work for the
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.160]  government you might be reported on attack watch dot com yeah what a great site i want to encourage
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:41.880]  um all info wars fans and alex jones listeners to go on to attack watch and report report some
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:47.960]  comedy report some really funny stuff report the fact that you saw janet napalos the politano's
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:57.240]  face on a screen and walmart teaching you to be afraid tell them all about that uh report the fact
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.720]  that you're being advised to walk through a microwave scanner at the airport or that someone
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.240]  reached down your pants and they flashed a government badge and said that was their right
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:12.280]  because oh they run security now in this country yeah report all that too fight the smears it says
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:19.560]  well so so wait a minute you mean if you criticize obama over the loss of jobs the economic
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:26.520]  implosion the massive massive increase in public debt government debt the trillions of
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.800]  dollars in fiat currency that has been printed by the federal reserve and that has been taken
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:37.400]  on in new debt by the u.s treasury under just the obama administration if you complain about
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:43.320]  that or criticize that or even ask questions about it you could be reported to attack watch
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.800]  dot com i'm sure i'm going to be reported to attack watch just for saying this in fact
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.440]  someone's going to post on attack watch that mike adams was on the alex jones show attacking
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.640]  attack watch dot com dot com that's going to be the the complaint i can't wait to see that
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:03.880]  it's incredible it just look the situation just gets more bizarre with each passing day
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:10.680]  there's something like a like a weird macartheism happening in america today that may not even be
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:17.000]  the right term but now the secret police are are just expanding out into every realm of your life
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.680]  the fda now under the food safety modernization act is going to unleash an army of new agents
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:28.440]  we're going to inspect your gardens and inspect your greenhouses and now women like kippy miller
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.000]  who i mentioned from truly raw gourmet you know men with badges show up at her door flashing their
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.960]  badges let us in we're going to shut down your coconut creamery julie bass oak park michigan
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:45.400]  intimidated for growing gardens in her own yard i mean it's just unbelievable the level of secret
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:51.640]  police activity in this country is just beyond belief so i'm not going to dwell on it right now
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:56.520]  in fact i'm going to get on to another topic i just want to put that out there attack watch
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:02.280]  dot com is some pretty pretty freaky stuff i'm not going to use the same expletives that dr
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:08.440]  wakefield accidentally aired on here in the last segment but they do come to mind in this segment
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.880]  we're going to talk about superfoods versus radiation and we've got a great guest joining us
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.240]  but let me let me give an intro to him and explain why we're covering this topic in particular
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:27.160]  you know uh fukushima isn't over the radiation is still coming our way on top of that we now know
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:35.320]  that the nuclear industry is in many ways staffed by people who just don't know what they're doing
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.680]  now i know look i know there are a lot of good people in the nuclear industry i know there are
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.400]  a lot of veterans who are really smart nuclear engineers who know exactly what they're doing
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.520]  they're good people and they're trying to keep those nuclear facilities safe but but there's a
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.640]  problem in the nuclear industry which is once you hit your lifetime limit of exposure to ambient
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:58.040]  radiation from working there you're out and they bring in new people new people who don't
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:03.640]  know what they're doing this is what happened in fukushima and then they mess things up even worse
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:08.680]  or they fail to uh to operate the facility the way it's supposed to operate in a safe manner
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:15.000]  and things get out of control so we have i think a risk a very real risk of other
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.640]  additional nuclear catastrophes happening in the future and that's not even counting
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.520]  the possibility of a solar flare which is not a big risk tomorrow or the next day but within a
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.320]  human lifetime it's a significant risk that a solar flare could knock out the power grid knock
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:34.600]  out the transformers and and take offline many of the new nuclear facilities meaning they would
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.000]  have to run on diesel generators or propane generators or backup battery power just to keep
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.360]  themselves from not going into meltdowns and there are hundreds of nuclear power plants around the
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:51.400]  world 440 i believe commercial nuclear facilities operating today so in order to keep ourselves
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:57.320]  safe we need to be able to protect ourselves from radiation now the government only has one option
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.280]  for you take some potassium iodide and that's about it they don't teach you the rest of the story
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:09.240]  as usual the rest of the story comes from people who are schooled in holistic nutrition superfoods
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:15.720]  is what we're talking about here and one of the best red and most informative people in that realm
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:22.280]  is david wolf and david wolf is actually credited for really popularizing goji berries in america
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.680]  and to a large extent cacao he's he's helped to uh repopularize cacao and he's joining us here by
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:35.080]  skype on the alice joneshow david are you there all right great great to have you on now you
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:41.640]  probably heard the intro there first of all talk about the role of nutrition in protecting us from
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:47.720]  ionizing radiation if you would we learned from hiroshima and nagasaki that diet does play an
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.560]  important part of protecting yourself there's genetic factors their dietary factors there's
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:56.440]  lifestyle factors but nutrition is the most important there are a number of ways that radioactive
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.720]  debris can actually harm us one is that they burn us it's like that's the radiation that's actually
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:08.280]  the it's like a free radical damage so we can help to alleviate that by nutrition if we take in
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:13.880]  for example medicinal mushrooms which are very rich in a compound called beta glue cans which is a
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:22.040]  sugar it actually helps to soothe over and smooth over and calm the burn caused by radiation also
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:29.400]  when we uptake a radioactive mineral we can limit that uptake by having enough minerals in our system
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:35.800]  that out compete the radioactive mineral that's the whole idea of iodine radioactive iodine 131
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:41.800]  you breathe it in if you're saturated in iodine you do not breathe it in and therefore you do not
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.640]  develop thyroid disease or thyroid cancer which is the very first symptom of radiation poisoning
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.720]  in addition to that there are certain superfoods like ginseng which is really a super herb that
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:16:02.840]  helps to deactivate and step down the radioactive isotopes so that they help them degrade into
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:09.480]  isotopes that are non-radioactive what about the role they've what about bentonite clay and
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:15.080]  clays clays for absorbing and detoxing radiation is that something you also advocate absolutely
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.840]  and we go to the most powerful earthy compounds that are available which are things like folvic
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:30.920]  acid not folic acid but folvic acid and black mica extract which neutralize radioactive isotopes
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:36.440]  and lock them up so your body can excrete them yeah that's the key is getting it out of your
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.840]  body because as you know just one of these particles can actually kill you if it starts
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.800]  irradiating from inside your body i want to mention too a couple things i'll david wolf is
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:51.400]  the co-founder of longevity warehouse dot com and also inner food which is a sponsor of this show
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.760]  inner food is a superfood that contains many of the elements that david is actually mentioning
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.560]  so i do want to encourage you to check out that superfood um obviously they can't say you know
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.160]  that it protects you from radiation that's probably not an fda approved statement in fact
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.280]  what would you say david that the fda doesn't really allow anybody who offers superfood products
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.240]  to really talk about radiation protection do they that's right i mean the fda doesn't allow us to
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:22.120]  really get away with any claims that are substantial um and even if those claims are based on for example
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:27.400]  seven thousand peer reviewed studies i'm thinking of fish oil my friend dr. david is a fish oil
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.800]  scientist seven thousand studies he cannot make certain claims like anti-inflammatory claims
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.280]  because the fda doesn't allow it well it's incredible but the fda we've seen is censoring
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.720]  science we've seen all kinds of censorship of science again in the post 9 11 era where they
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:47.160]  have to rewrite the rules of physics to match the government cover story the fda is rewriting
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:53.080]  science all the time saying that there's no such thing as a nutrient or a mineral that has a beneficial
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:57.720]  health effect in the human body that's their official position it's astounding and yet in
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:03.480]  your world david you are steeped in the world of nutrition you must see people all the time
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:09.480]  who are revolutionizing their health due to taking superfoods or just just getting some some quality
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.960]  supplements into their bodies from time to time absolutely and that's what drives me on i've had
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:19.480]  so many people who've lost 200 pounds 100 pounds radically changed their health overcame diabetes
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:25.080]  overcame cancers overcame all different kinds of heart disease plaque formations in their body
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:30.120]  and they're still going strong today i had a guy 18 years ago i helped he had celiacs disease i
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:35.960]  helped him out he's going strong today completely free of all symptoms so there are natural solutions
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.040]  of course that are out there but we've got to be aware of what our choices are because
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:45.480]  obviously those choices are being inhibited or blocked in some way by government agencies
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.200]  and and by the media to some degree as well fortunately we have the internet fortunately
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.840]  we have the alex joneshow that can get the information out yeah what did you do you're
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:01.080]  are you based in california right now or were you in the aftermath of the fukushima catastrophe
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:08.760]  i was literally in soul korea and we flew over right over fukushima the next day after it happened
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.200]  i looked at the flight maps and we actually literally flew right over fukushima i drank
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:21.400]  a bottle of ginseng like a 30 day supply on that flight so i i was trying to protect myself as
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:27.000]  best as possible i ended up in hawaii by the way hawaii is getting about five hot particles per day
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.160]  which means that anything that is processing air like your lungs like your air filter on your car
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.280]  can actually be up taking these radioactive particles if you work as a mechanic stay with us
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.960]  david we got to go to break sorry to interrupt you we're going to take a break stay with us
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.960]  on the other side we will we will continue with david wolf and i want to ask david about the
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:20:00.600]  raw some food raids and food freedom in america stay with us here on the alice jones show we'll be right back

[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:39.240]  speech and the bill of rights all of these things right now we're talking about food freedom with
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:45.720]  our guest david wolf and david i got a question for you i actually uh sorry i should mention this
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:52.840]  to you on the break but a dr az is in the news right now for warning people about the arsenic
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:58.360]  level of apple juice now he says there's arsenic in there from apple seeds but of course there's
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.800]  arsenic in apple seeds but people like you and i david we juice apples and we juice the seeds we
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:09.800]  drink apple seeds we drink a little bit of arsenic every day when when we juice right isn't that normal
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:15.960]  that's normal it's just like there's mercury and and seaweeds it's just a natural part of the ecosystem
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.160]  and it's a natural variation in minerals that are available in our foods yeah in fact in fact
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:27.720]  arsenic i believe it has an anti-cancer effect which is that gets into a leitreal and vitamin b17
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:33.800]  that the pits inside peaches do you want to comment on that at all there's no question that
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:40.040]  leitreal was the victim of suppression by the fda and the and the federal government actually um
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.200]  and it was driven out of the country leitreal treatments are treatments that are developed
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:50.360]  out of apricot kernels and apple seeds and other natural foods contain this compound which is a
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:56.120]  natural form of cyanide for cancer cells but your healthy cells can deactivate it so it
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:01.240]  selectively kills off cancer cells yeah there's a great book on that i think it's called world
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:07.480]  without cancer by ed griffin in fact yeah the same the same guy who did the what the creature from
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.280]  jackal island and wrote about the federal reserve ed griffin one of the great patriots in our nation
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.720]  today so check out check out that book david while you're with us here this is a relatively
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:25.560]  short segment so i wanted to ask you to comment on the raw some food raid situation you uh you
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:30.520]  are very familiar with superfoods and the power of raw foods i mean you are a raw food advocate
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:36.040]  you you've been living on a raw food diet for what a decade now something like that 18 years 18 years
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:43.400]  yeah and i'm an advocate for the availability of superfoods like like clarella that can protect
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.000]  us from radiation and like the things that raw some offers or at least did offer before the raid
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.120]  i shop at raw some and i know everybody there and this is a complete tragedy in the community
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:59.240]  it's completely frivolous in fact it's totally ridiculous i mean why don't they spend time going
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.880]  after people who are shooting each other on the streets of la why go after people who are into
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:11.720]  health food why spend these resources on chasing down people who want their raw food instead of
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.520]  people who are running around making drugs and killing each other i don't get it isn't the answer
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:21.720]  obvious they want people to be a disease david they want people to not have access to the foods
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:26.760]  that can keep them healthy and prevent chronic degenerative disease i mean i don't know if you
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.840]  agree with that statement but i've come to that conclusion that they they literally want the american
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.720]  people to be to be sick to be diseased to be enslaved to have no knowledge to be completely
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:41.000]  ignorant of nutrition do you agree with any part of that absolutely it's part of the agenda and it's
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.880]  it's part of the story it's part of the pharmaceutical petroleum banking government control grid
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.640]  let's get rid of everything that can actually heal you and united was doing some research on
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:56.760]  monsanto corporation found out they're owned by by phaser they're actually owned by the biggest
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.800]  pharmaceutical company in the world and this is a big deal it means that they get you sick on one
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:06.280]  end then they sell you the drug on the other end it's a perfect system so we're we're looking to
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.920]  create freedom that evades that little trap they've set up for us yeah i think just just for the
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:16.200]  record i think i think phaser is uh an investor or a shareholder in monsanto but but you're right
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:21.960]  that they're they're financial ties back and forth there are board director uh board of director ties
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:27.640]  across all of these corporations even going into high tech companies like like microsoft and you've
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.880]  got bill and melinda gates foundation and so on but we don't want to go in into all of that we've
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:36.920]  only got a couple of minutes left is there anything else you wanted to add to what people can do to
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.960]  protect themselves from radiation what about things like zeolites is that something that you advocate
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:49.240]  absolutely i mean chernobyl was sprayed with a foam of zeolite and boron those are two things you
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:55.480]  can take zeolite is an earthy compound that's created when volcanic lava hits the ocean and in
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.920]  areas where that's happened in the history of the earth they have zeolite formations you can
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:05.080]  actually eat that and that blocks up radioactive material boron neutralizes neutrons so when you
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:10.360]  have a radioactive particle in your body it will spontaneously excrete neutrons boron will
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:15.320]  neutralize that boron is one of the best supplements against radiation and that's very likely what
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:20.280]  they're going to be spraying on fukushima here shortly yeah that's interesting i know boron
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:25.080]  is also taken up by cantaloupe so uh that's one food that's got a good source of it david i want

[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:59.880]  talk about that in the in the meantime we have an amazing guest lined up for you here in fact
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.400]  we just talked about the raw some food raids with david wolf in the last segment
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:11.240]  i want to thank david for coming on the the raw some food situation you've you've heard about it
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:15.480]  in great detail here on the alex jones show so i'm not going to go into all the detail of it however
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:23.080]  james stewart was one of the three who was arrested at gunpoint and charged with felony crimes yeah
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:29.160]  felonies uh some very serious crimes especially considering that they were just basically distributing
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:35.960]  food raw goats milk raw cheese tomatoes mangoes farm fresh eggs that oh my god they weren't even
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:41.240]  refrigerated uh i can't believe that that's one of the issues that you have to refrigerate your
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.960]  eggs uh people don't know the truth about this look i i used to live in south america we would buy
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.920]  eggs down there all the time they were never refrigerated because they weren't washed if you
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:55.240]  wash the egg then you take off the outer layer and then it can get infected and that's when you
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:59.640]  need to refrigerate it if you don't wash the eggs you don't have to refrigerate them right away
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:05.720]  they're perfectly safe you know it's funny the the food police in america are just clueless morons
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:13.800]  okay they have no understanding of real food sorry i'm getting off track but anyway joining us now
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:22.520]  for the very first public interview following the raw some food raid is james stewart himself now i
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:27.880]  gotta say we're not going to be able to talk to james about any details related to the pending case
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:34.600]  itself for reasons that will go into uh james are you with us on the phone i am hey it's great to
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:40.680]  have you on the alex jones show today james now let's just start with the important issue that
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.960]  you are not allowed to talk this is a condition of your bail release right you're not allowed to
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:52.280]  talk about anything related to the case that is correct okay well now i see you're demonstrating
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:58.200]  that principle right there how frustrating do you think that is yeah that's very frustrating so
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.800]  we're not going to be able to ask you about anything about the raid i'm not i'm not going to try to
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.160]  trick you into talking about that we don't want we don't want to get you in any more trouble
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:11.400]  what we do want you to do is talk about your philosophies of nutritious food and food freedom
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:17.960]  what is it that you believe about food in america and and why is what we're seeing all across the
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.640]  country with the fda and department of agriculture raids why is that a violation of basic food rights
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.520]  well you know it says in the in not only the constitution but the declaration is in attendance
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:35.320]  we all have unalienable rights you can also re pronounce that word unalienable rights and that
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.720]  word means that they can't be transferred well the question is what can't be transferred your
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:45.720]  rights can't be the idea that people can't choose what foods they want to put in their body is
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:51.480]  insane so i mean that's that's the bottom line of any of this this is not about raw dairy or
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.480]  anything else this is about our rights to choose what we want to put into our own bodies and our
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:01.480]  children's bodies well yeah any violation of that is absolutely insane but that's par for the course
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:08.120]  today what we're seeing the government do across many areas many industries is pure insanity i mean
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:13.800]  the atf with operation fast and furious totally insane completely criminal the drug companies
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:19.080]  the vaccines that are that are contaminated that that harm and even kill many children totally insane
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.520]  by the way i wanted to make one uh collection to something you said before you were leading in
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:30.600]  and this time when they came there wasn't any guns drawn i was arrested but there were no guns
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:36.760]  drawn okay they weren't drawn but they were they were carrying firearms right that's true yeah i'm
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:40.760]  just i'm just correcting that no i appreciate the correction and uh i'm thinking the last time they
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:45.560]  had the raid there was video of them drawing their guns and pointing their guns at the food
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:52.360]  that that's correct that's that's bizarre did they think that raw dairy is alive or something like
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:59.240]  the cheese was going to leap off the shelf and attack them well that's been the question for a while
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.800]  yeah i guess so well they they think they think uh raw food is some kind of terrorist substance i
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:10.920]  suppose um i've got a lot of questions for you here and i will respect your boundaries on on what
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.760]  you can talk about and what you can't i do want to emphasize to those listening here on the alex
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.720]  jones show that this is the first public interview you've done james and for those who want to follow
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:27.720]  more of your information check out the website realfoodrights.com and this website keeps you
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:33.400]  posted on what's happening with raw some foods um raw some foods technically never really never
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:38.600]  really close isn't it true that raw some is still uh accepting memberships and planning to be
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:46.680]  operating again very shortly um yeah i don't know what i how would i answer that okay well i was
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:52.760]  here i was are you there yes i am okay you know first of all raw some that was never it's never
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:58.520]  been a business and that's what people have got it raw some was never a business it was a community
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:05.000]  of the like-minded people that were pulling their energies together uh to you know to obtain you
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.880]  know sustainable uh ascertainable verifiable sources of food you know that they uh choose to
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.200]  put in their own bodies yeah yeah i do want to make that correction the voice you heard in the
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:21.640]  background was james uh attorney who is uh listening in on this conversation making sure that he
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.280]  doesn't get into any more trouble with uh you know saying something that the court doesn't want
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:32.200]  and i appreciate you being here for that yeah raw some food was a a food distribution point a private
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.840]  club not a grocery store and it was never open to the public exactly i do want to say one thing
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.200]  i'll just briefly introduce myself my name is pashna shama wilson i do represent james stewart
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:50.440]  and i do also represent the members of raw some and uh you know basically at this point uh raw
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:56.040]  some was a community it was a very special place where people were learning about food and
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.960]  from people like james who are so knowledgeable and the only resources we have really to gain
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:10.280]  true knowledge for each other so raw some was a great community and is still existing um you
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:16.040]  know among its members and inviting people to educate themselves and think for themselves
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.680]  yeah well said in fact the loss of uh or i'm sorry the the the raid on raw some has been devastating
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:29.000]  to many people i've heard stories of uh parents who were buying raw goats milk to feed their infant
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.360]  children and now they they can't get that uh it it is a shame that this was being attacked
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:40.840]  let me get back to you james what what are you looking at the history of our country i mean
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:46.600]  america was in many ways founded on food freedom and the right to grow your own food the right to
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:51.720]  consume raw raw milk what do you think are uh people living even just three or four generations
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:57.560]  ago would think about what has happened today with raw some uh well you know back in the 30s
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:03.560]  in the early 40s um there was no such thing as pasteurization so you know there was only raw
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:09.560]  milk in those days and raw dairy and and so if somebody had told you back in the mid 40s that
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.520]  in the year 2000 that raw dairy would be illegal and you could be arrested for it they probably
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.720]  would have sent you to some uh some the same asylum someplace you know or they were completely
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:25.400]  crazy and here we are 60 years later uh with that being the very fact so you know the idea
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:31.480]  that people can't uh choose to put what they want into their bodies is uh is it and obtain the food
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:36.680]  that they want to feed themselves you know thomas jefferson said which is i think it's incredible
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:41.720]  i read a lot of quotes recently and we said uh if people in government decide what foods they eat
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:47.000]  and medicines they take they will be in as soon as sorry as state as those that live under tyranny
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.640]  and that was said 230 years ago yeah he he could see a brilliant man of course he he saw what was
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:42:00.280]  coming and now now we're seeing it right in our faces speaking of tyranny by the fda there was
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:06.520]  a lawsuit filed i believe last year by the farm to consumer legal defense fund where they sued the
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:13.720]  fda over its restrictions essentially it's outlawing of the interstate transportation of raw dairy
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:19.640]  now you've looked into this case in great detail james and i understand do you have some uh do you
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:24.680]  have some quotes from the fda to share with us today yeah actually i was going to go ahead and do
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:31.080]  that um you know last last year the fda responded in law suit and james and i kind of went over it
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:38.280]  and in the legal response the fda counters that um and this is their direct quote there is no deeply
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:46.760]  rooted historical tradition of unfettered access to food of all kinds all right uh let me get that
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:51.160]  again there there was no deeply rooted historical tradition of unfettered access to food of all kinds
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:55.800]  so the fda is saying you don't you don't have a right to food right and as and basically as
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:03.160]  evidence of the position the agency cites the dietary laws of biblical crime the fda actually
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:11.960]  went further and stated that there is no absolute right to consume or feed children any particular
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:21.480]  kind of food because comprehensive federal regulation of the food supply has been in effect
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:31.000]  at least since congress enacted the pure food and drug act of 1906 thus the plaintiffs the people
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:40.680]  claim to fundamental privacy interest in obtaining food of their own choice for themselves and their
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:47.960]  families is without merit that's it's it's incredible yeah that this is without merit
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:55.320]  and they even go on and they yeah go ahead you know furthermore they do say that there is no
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:03.160]  generalized right to bodily and physical health and you know and as just excluded how finally
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:11.400]  if such right did exist it would not render the fda's regulations unconstitutional because
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:19.720]  prohibiting the interstate sale of distribution of uncastrized milk for most bodily and physical
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:26.600]  health and it's oh my okay so it's lies with their lies within lies and i love the part about the
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:34.120]  fda quoting the bible as their justification for just outright total tyranny total intimidation
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:40.680]  and stripping away our our food freedoms it's it's absolutely insane james what the question
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:45.960]  has always been for many of us around the country not just myself and and you know these
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:56.120]  lovely um you know food uh you know uh communities it's it's really the question of who's because
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:01.480]  well you know i've said this many times i don't i really don't have an issue with some of the agents
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:07.560]  and whatnot are just doing their job the question is who's authorizing it and for what purpose well
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:11.960]  i i've got an issue with the agents just doing their jobs i mean maybe maybe you don't but i do i
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:17.480]  i mean that's that's what the nazi ss soldiers did that's what the people did is shooting people
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:23.000]  on the uh the berlin wall i mean it you know tyranny happens because people just do their jobs
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:28.760]  without thinking about the the actual rights whether it's god-given rights or or constitutional
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:33.320]  rights you know i mean just doing their jobs i'm sorry they're they're they're just i think
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:37.480]  they should be brought up on charges personally yeah well you know the the idea that people can't
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:43.640]  choose and find a place that has the highest quality which is what this community was all about the
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.600]  highest quality products available you know in the beginning of this conversation uh you were
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:53.960]  mentioning eggs and i think it's interesting because you know where here's my question to
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:46:01.160]  everybody where were eggs sold at any store before 1992 here in the united states they were sold
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:07.400]  in the non-refrigerated sections of stores so what happened in 1992 and as you said you can go
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.840]  anywhere in the world and of course you are also correct by the unwashed eggs and whatnot so i'm
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:18.600]  you know all these regulations are prohibiting people from getting the fresh high quality foods
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:26.200]  that they really want again going back to the quote that ajna read there there is no absolute right
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:32.600]  to consume or feed children any particular kind of food and the FDA says quote there is no generalized
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:39.800]  right to bodily and physical health folks this is the essence of the FDA's criminality and and total
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:46.680]  i call it terrorism to to intimidate raw dairy producers in the united states and then claim
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:51.240]  you have no right to health you have no right to bodily and physical health and they can tell you
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.320]  what to eat and what you can't eat it's just incredible this is this is the root of tyranny
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.480]  right and it's not just about raw dairy it's about all the food they're they're going after
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:06.040]  indian all food well exactly they i mean they've look uh raw almonds have been outlawed in california
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.920]  that wasn't an FDA issue that was more of an agriculture issue but uh same thing the FDA has
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:16.440]  gone after even things like natural sweeteners stevia was outlawed in america for decades
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.240]  before it was finally allowed and tolerated by the FDA because it was brought in by cargill
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:26.920]  at that point um what else do you see that that disturbs you out there in the country
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:34.040]  with food rights and food freedoms james well it it it farms i mean it's it's going on everywhere
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:40.360]  at this point they're they're attacking the very source of the of the food sources so
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:46.040]  you know you have to ask yourself the question again what's really going on why why are people
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:53.640]  being prohibited from making their own unalienable choice of what they want and by the way the word
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.840]  unalienable means you can't transfer your rights away so their contention that people don't have
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:04.760]  them in the first place uh is is crazy of course we do and of course we have the right to feed
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:11.480]  our children and it's going on on farms as well in you know stores i see it everywhere at this
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:19.720]  point so again you know i think once you start seeing one urocratic system uh and start educating
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:26.360]  yourself and really this does kind of touch upon personal responsibility yeah once you start educating
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:34.040]  yourself and seeing one travesty it it becomes um almost something your blinders come off and
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.520]  assess well that's that's what's beautiful about this is this whole issue has really awakened many
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:44.360]  people in california uh people who perhaps weren't paying attention to the political arena but now
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:49.240]  with the raw some food raid and and and many other raids going on many other businesses
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:53.480]  being intimidated they're waking up and saying wait a minute this is not right what's going on
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:59.080]  here i mean are you here go ahead no you're right this is this is a wonderful wake-up call for
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:04.920]  people to understand that something more uh than something simple that they think oh that's just
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:10.280]  about raw milk or something it's not at all and that's why you know this is really sort of jailed
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:16.040]  the entire by the way there's an international response going on as well on the internet oh yeah
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:21.560]  absolutely by the way uh a break is coming up here in a couple of minutes after the break
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:27.800]  would you be able to stay on with us and perhaps take a call or two sure i have no problem all
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:31.720]  right well uh let's see if we can get some callers in to talk to you and of course we'll
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:37.720]  instruct callers they they cannot ask you about the court case because again because your first
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.320]  amendment rights have been stripped away people look people thought i made this up when i first
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:47.160]  reported this as well but you were forced to sign something as a condition of your bail or of your
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:53.560]  release that said what did it say specifically you can't discuss there are there are five paragraphs
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:58.840]  and in those five paragraphs i'm sure arjuna maybe she has them with them i i don't i don't have them
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:05.720]  with me but they basically are you know they're talking about not being able to uh go ahead arjuna
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:12.440]  i well let's go ahead we can actually what we can do i mean if people are interested um you know i
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:18.520]  can probably get you a copy of that and then maybe that's something that you can report on um there
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:26.280]  and and they are personal conditions they are just basically not to incite uh he unfortunately
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:32.920]  games has been put in a position where um it was he was given a choice he had to comply with what
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:39.400]  they were telling him to do or stay in jail well incredible uh we got to go to a break here arjuna

[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:27.080]  felony multiple felony counts after the raw some food raid took place what was a couple of months
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:33.960]  ago now it seems like oh my gosh i can tell you it was august third and it's actually 14 criminal
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:39.000]  counts 14 criminal counts and and by the way jaren can you boost my audio in my ear uh so i can hear
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:46.600]  a little better please thank you um james so this is james first interview on the air after the the
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:51.000]  raids took place and half after he was arrested and now just before the break we invited some
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:57.160]  callers to call in and ask some questions we've got mark and diane and uh julio on the uh on the
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:02.200]  calls i just want to remind you there are certain questions that james is not allowed to answer because
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:06.440]  of the conditions of his bail release if you can believe that i guess the first amendment
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:12.600]  doesn't apply in california's justice system anymore so let's go to mark from philadelphia
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:18.600]  you're on the air mark good afternoon uh i really appreciate mike which the great work you're doing
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.920]  and the great work you're doing out there james uh i'm i'm originally from missouri and the same
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:28.760]  kind of things going on in missouri uh with the morning side dairy being raided uh in southern
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:36.040]  missouri a year ago concerning raw raw cheese and i think there was some connection with uh raw some
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:44.680]  but uh it's morning by the way it's morning land dairy or morning land okay yep uh to me and by the
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:48.680]  way i grew up in the restaurant business in southern missouri and so and i grew up in the
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:54.280]  in the rural area i'm very i know the connection to the farms to the land to the people to our
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:58.840]  community and food's a very important part of this and i but my sense of it is it's not just
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.600]  about the food and there's also issues going on with the rabbits i don't know if you heard about
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:08.840]  the the dollar rights in southern missouri the the uh usda trying to give them trouble about
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:13.960]  raising rabbits which is totally ridiculous to me it's not about the food it's not about the rabbits
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:20.040]  it's not about the the puppy dogs it's not about the cows what it's about it's about teaching us
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:24.920]  who's in charge with fear through fear and intimidation and ultimately they want to destroy
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:30.440]  the independent thinker the independent small farmer the independent businessman and that's
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:39.240]  so what would you have to say about that james well said you know it's true i they're there
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:44.600]  they they it seems that they want everybody to be in a submissive mode at this point and
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:52.520]  you know that it's not constant it's you know whether you you feel the those things it's about
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:58.360]  knowing as a free thinker what you know is right and the right thing to do and the right thing to
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.680]  do is what we've been talking about and that's that's really the bottom line of it all and
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:09.080]  yeah i i know it's going on everywhere and it's uh it's sad but you know the whole point is people
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:14.920]  just need to start standing up yeah thank thank you uh mark for your question and for your comment
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:22.840]  there james let's go to diane in louisiana who now has a question for james i was i was aware of
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:29.000]  that rosson food i'm sorry if i'm pronouncing the company wrong but when i saw that video air
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:36.680]  i was just floored and my thing of it is is that this system it is so jacked up now if i had small
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:45.560]  kids right now and refuse to feed them i would be arrested and they would they would come get my kids
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:53.000]  it's and if i had a choice right now to choose a certain food i would go with the more nutritious
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:00.280]  food and these gmo's that they're uh serving us now and forcing us to buy and another comment i
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:07.400]  like to make uh i'm hoping that ron paul would bring up some of these issues you know to help
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:13.400]  his campaign to show what obama is doing and rick pear i believe he would do the same well good
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:17.800]  good questions diane we got to go to break but james a comment real fast on diane's uh
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:23.560]  comments there well i i think that uh the the waking up process is going on all over the country
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:30.760]  with uh a few politicians but uh you know you're you're correct we should be able to allow ourselves
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:35.080]  to choose for especially feeding our kids stay with us we got to go to a break we'll be right

[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:42.040]  james stewart and his attorney james of course is speaking out now for the first time the first
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:48.200]  interview following the raw some food raid that uh wow just has really demonstrated how much the
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:53.720]  fda and the and the california department or i'm sorry the la county department of agriculture
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:58.920]  is working to take away our food rights it's pretty scary and we've been taking some calls
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:01.880]  i want to thank the previous caller sorry to cut you off there we had to go to a break
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:08.440]  now holding on the line is julio from illinois julio you're on the air with james stewart
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:15.800]  you know it's frightening that uh mike by the way great job uh as always uh it's it's crazy that
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:24.280]  here in america nowadays we put formaldehyde and no carcinogen in uh vaccines with mercury we have
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:30.440]  genetically modified foods imitation meat imitation crab food it's it's frightening and
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:37.160]  but the fda is more concerned about raw and organic foods that empower our bodies yeah i know
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:43.160]  it's it's crazy their priorities are all mixed up you're exactly right and uh do you have a question
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:48.280]  for james or something you'd like him to comment on i do james just i want to hear your comment what
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:53.960]  did you ever in your wildest dreams think that the united states of america would get in the
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.880]  situation that you would in particular would find yourself you know fighting for for food
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:05.480]  rights and then uh mike when alex comes on just about the full nfl thing it's just frightening
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:11.240]  again that a variety of priorities are messed up that people will eat these gmo foods and globalist
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:17.000]  beer as football games and i care about their fourth amendment right and it's just it's just
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.920]  frightening yeah it's uh you're absolutely right i i never expected uh this to happen no i mean it
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:29.880]  it just is it's so beyond anything that i you know because i what is this community involved with
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:35.560]  this involved with high quality natural foods i mean you'd think that would be the last thing on the
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:42.760]  list period yeah that was a great question thanks for your answer there james and and you're absolutely
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.080]  right you would think that california in particular which is suffering under the burden of health care
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:52.600]  cost or really sick care degenerative disease management would want folks like you to bring
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:58.360]  healthy food to people so they could help be healthier and even prevent some disease which
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:03.000]  we know healthy food can help do let's go to another caller mac in pennsylvania you're on
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:08.280]  the air with james steward go ahead mac yeah i'm just going to be the voice in the wilderness here
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:14.600]  i think you guys are just completely nuts because if you it's obvious there are laws out there that
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:20.200]  need to be followed when it comes to the sale of pretty much anything so when it comes to the sale
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.160]  of food there's laws that need to be followed i think these people are just sensationalizing
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:30.680]  something that doesn't need to be sensationalized for the purest sake of advertisement well mac i
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.440]  think i think you're not just the voice in the wilderness i think you're the voice of genetically
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:39.160]  modified organisms it looks like you've been uh drinking a little too much fluoride and eating
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:44.760]  a little too many modified corn chips there um what do you say to that james disagree with you sir
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:53.080]  no and i can feel that question as well i i also feel like um these this is it they should have the
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:58.760]  right to choose what we can all stand behind no matter what happens is that we have the freedom
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:06.280]  as american citizens and human citizens to have the freedom to choose you may not like our choices
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:13.240]  but that's our right to choose what we want to have in our body no but i adana mac doesn't want
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:19.400]  you to be able to choose actual fresh eggs farm fresh dairy he wants you to choose his gmo's or
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:23.880]  whatever he's been eating or drinking or smoking as the case may be let's move on to another caller

[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:20.040]  fill-in hosts today we just finished taking some calls with james stewart from raw some foods
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:25.720]  and including one caller who was i guess a voice in the wilderness and uh now we shouldn't have the
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:29.880]  right to choose our own food we have to follow the laws and follow the tyrants and do what they
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:34.920]  tell us and eat what they tell us and swallow everything literally that they tell us to swallow
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:39.160]  you know what's fascinating about that is there is a segment of the population the unawakened
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:45.320]  segment that just loves to be ruled by tyrants they just love it i mean they love to take the
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:49.800]  psychiatric drugs and drink the fluoride and go to their doctors and their doctors diagnosed them
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:54.200]  with some kind of behavioral psychiatric disorder and they say oh yeah there must be something wrong
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:57.800]  with me so i'm going to take these psychiatric drugs and then they take these drugs and then
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:03.560]  they call in the shows like this and give their comments and it makes for some interesting radio
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:10.120]  speaking of radio we got to help support the infrastructure here so i want to thank our sponsors

[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:58.920]  about to shoot a video actually rob do the director of the whole nightly news actually
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:03.960]  just drove over to my family's house here where we're having the birthday party to shoot a special
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:09.160]  report over here tonight because this is such a big deal that will air during the info wars
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:14.920]  nightly news seven o'clock tonight and we're going to have the regular news tonight with

[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.880]  and we're going to have that and we're also going to review the last two weeks the first two weeks
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:39.320]  of info wars nightly news that was only possible because a prison planet dot tv members i want to
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:46.600]  thank all those folks but i was beside myself with not even anger but just discussed and confirmation
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:55.400]  of this morning when i got up and went to info wars dot com and saw a link to usa today and i know
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:01.080]  paul watson's about to have a detailed report out or it may already be out because i did some digging
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:07.240]  and i discovered i was hitting in plain view last year uh at not the last super bowl but the super
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:15.240]  bowl before last that homeland security ordered them to do the genital growth which again sets the
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:21.240]  total precedent for no fourth amendment total control and so now when the nfl announces at all
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:29.480]  of their 30 plus franchises that everyone every man woman and child including the babies will
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:36.680]  from the ankles up a breast will be squeezed genitals will be squeezed all of this is going to
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:42.680]  happen and this is done to completely break our will and this has all been part of a larger plan
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:47.880]  where as governor rich said nine years ago the former head of homeland security currently
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:53.400]  the head at that time he openly said that you're going to have to have a government approval to
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:58.360]  have a job and if you're not in good favor it's like a no fly list it's a no work list a no travel
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:04.920]  list everyone is being basically put in databases there'll be a no gun by list uh just the end of
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:10.520]  due process the end of everything under the rubric uh and the max of the cover of keeping
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:15.960]  it safe of course from the synthetic manufacturer to provocateur states tariff well alex what what's
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:20.440]  your assessment do you think that nfl fans are going to just go along with this because they've
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:25.400]  all been indoctrinated now into this security police state system or are we going to see more
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:30.200]  people rebelling against this now and waking up what do you think well that's the point i wanted
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:36.360]  to get to next and i'm glad you raised that this has been a plan all along that's why
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:41.720]  it's on record on the show in the articles in the films we're on record now for nine years
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:47.400]  laying out exactly what would happen because homeland security arrogantly said uh what they
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:53.080]  would do homeland security admitted what they were going to do and it's such this incredible
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:14:01.400]  precedent and and just the sorrow world no common sense you know craziness but uh that is from their
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:05.080]  perspective of keeping us safe but if you buy the official story none of this makes sense if you
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:08.440]  know that it's all aimed at the public but they call all of our rights and liberties that you
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:12.920]  understand it's completely crystal clear it is an overthrow of our free society the innocent
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:18.680]  until proven guilty uh it's an overthrow of our bodies being our own personal property and that
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:25.480]  uh big uh taboo against anyone touching you who's unauthorized this is all about forced
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:30.760]  inoculation it's all about federal grants for blood draws without warrants all over the country
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:37.240]  it all ties in this is their ultimate revolution and you you publicly predicted this many times
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:42.200]  that this is exactly what will be going on at public sporting events what else is in clear
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:47.960]  i did not predict it again it's always been their plan and and so this is why they don't
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.200]  care if it's making everybody mad and the covers on the edge of revolution and 90 plus percent of
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.400]  people are angry about it in every poll they've got to do this to break our will ahead of the
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:02.120]  martial law they've got to train the general public be treated like criminals to have home
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:06.120]  inspection by the fake environmentalists to be pulled over on the side of the highway and have
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:11.720]  everybody to frisk you and touch your body and even take blood it is about a total transformation
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.520]  into an authoritarian system so to answer your question of a minute ago the people aren't going
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:23.240]  to put up with this they're angry but they've got to train the enforcers the tsa this is the key
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:33.160]  tsa certified tsa certified security that's why federal judge ruled three months ago oh yes
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:39.000]  you need to have security at this prom in santa fe and so you've got to have tsa come in and train
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.640]  the people because when they wave a magic federal wand now they're allowed to go down your daughter's
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:50.040]  pants or grab her breast so so so it is outside of law it is a total incomplete power grab and
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:57.960]  everyone must understand that if they can make 16 million people go through this every year at the
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:03.000]  sports stadium that will condition that will show the media that will show the public it's meant to
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:09.960]  normalize it and acclimate it it's a color of law totally illegal power grab now suddenly cops
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:15.160]  are routinely groping people saying well i don't need a warrant anymore it's just a possession
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:21.080]  is nine-tenths of the law they are practicing this they are doing it uh by just adverse possession
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:26.920]  they are seizing this they are doing it as as tyrannical brutes i want to get bob Chapman's
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:34.200]  take on this because i know he's scheduled to be on but we must all of us all of us must hold the
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:39.800]  line here just like we did boycotting gelette when they were going to put tracker rfid and all
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:45.160]  their products we backed them off than hundreds of other companies uh didn't do it six years ago
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:53.560]  everyone must write the nfl and the commissioner and but also call in to talk radio sports shows
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:58.920]  and say we're not going to have america's quote pastime this religious thing they turned them to
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:03.960]  become a religion of having our rights violated we are not going to go to football but more
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.520]  importantly because most folks can't afford the tickets to begin with we are not going to watch
[02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:15.320]  football and we are going to contact the sponsors that are sponsoring football and let them know
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:23.640]  the power of one letter or email they see that as a thousand people by email ten thousand if it's a
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:30.360]  personal hand written letter a phone call is seen as over a thousand people everyone i'm going to
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:35.400]  organize this next week we're going to have another contest to put out videos to expose what the nfl
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.840]  turned into they always use it as an end cap a demonstration system to sell total tyranny
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:46.760]  and corruption this is america with a new world order hydra trying to pull us beneath the waves
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:51.320]  trying to strangle our republic trying to break our will and trying to say you want access into
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:55.320]  the planes are they gonna feel you gotta do this and they've stated they've already bought the huge
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:59.960]  mobile trucks to set up on the side of the highway people say well i just won't fly well they're

[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:40.280]  just calling in and giving us a really powerful segment on the nfl boycott and just to quickly
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:45.080]  repeat what he said and by the way i apologize to bob Chapman who's on hold bob will bring in in

[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:04.760]  the nfl to overturn this latest example of government intrusion and total tyranny into
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:11.320]  the privacy of our physical bodies it's getting crazy out there yes it's happening now they're
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:19.000]  coming after us at the football games bob Chapman joins us now and i know bob alex wanted to ask
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:26.040]  your opinion on these events thank you for holding i'm sorry to make you wait and bob i'm a great fan
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:33.800]  of yours i listened to you on the alex jones show so uh good to be with you today well thank you very
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:40.040]  much and it's good to be here and i don't mind waiting at all because it teaches me things and
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:46.440]  i want to learn things every day even at this advanced stage of life well what what's your
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:54.520]  take on the nfl pat down situation now and what this means for liberty in america well i think
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:01.000]  the most important thing is getting the message out and second of all what i would do let's say i
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:10.040]  was a ticket holder for the season i would call them up and say um if you have that happen if you
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:16.440]  allow that to happen i will be there with all my tickets on monday morning and you can give me my
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:24.600]  money back and i don't hear if i ever go to a football game again yeah very very good advice i'll get to them because
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:32.600]  the revenue that they have to give up back is enormous they would bankrupt every nfl team well
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:37.560]  let me pose the same question to you that i posed alex when he called in and by the way just just
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:43.000]  to remind listeners bob Chapman is from the international forecaster uh dot com so be sure
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:49.560]  to check out that website as as always but bob do you think that nfl fans will go along with this by
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:53.480]  in large or do you think we're now looking at a new wave of people standing up and saying
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:27:00.040]  enough is enough let's stop this here it's hard to say you won't know until you get there but we
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:06.520]  got to tell them that's what they got to do uh but they really shouldn't attend let them play to an
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:12.600]  empty stadium and take your tickets in and get demand your money back because you're not going to
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:20.680]  be groped by a strange group of people sent from the government trained by the government in special
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.880]  physical and and verbal interrogation techniques in fact this ought to be interesting
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:29.640]  kind of makes you wonder how large is government going to get if they keep having to send
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:34.280]  tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of agents across the country to
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:38.680]  search people under different contexts i mean what does this mean about the growth of the
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:49.000]  dangerous growth of government bob well actually it goes to i would say around 1936 37 in germany
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:58.520]  and um for those of you who were not aware of it uh you know who ate all hitler is i'm sure but uh
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:07.320]  just recently we had legislation which is passed by the house and the senate and it was for the
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:17.080]  extension of debt but within that context they said that they had to reduce the amount of money
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:25.080]  in the budget that was going to be used and at the same time s and p come in and said well
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:33.640]  we're going to lower your rating because you're not cutting enough and if by november you haven't
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:39.000]  cut medicare and social security substantially then we're going to lower your rating again
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:46.600]  and of course the standard of pause is controlled by the banks and the brokerage rooms on wall
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:55.960]  straight i know yeah i was there for 30 years and the other thing that they did which pertains to this
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:29:06.760]  is that they formed a committee of 12 that we're going to do this cutting or increasing
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.240]  in taxation whatever they were going to do and they have every intention to keeping this committee
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:20.680]  in its place and it's unconstitutional yeah the super congress when they come up with the
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:28.440]  information that they do in a law they sent it to the house of the senate bob stay with us we
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:32.520]  started to interrupt we got to go to a break here stay with us we're going to return here after the
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:38.040]  break on the alex jones show with bob Chapman the international forecaster to discuss more about us

[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:25.160]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:30.440]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:35.080]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:40.440]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:19.800]  the day off but he managed to call in because you know that guy never stops working or the
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:25.160]  reasons i admire what he does he's always getting the job done for freedom and another individual
[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:30.440]  who's also working very hard on the front lines of freedom is of course bob Chapman from the
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:36.120]  international forecaster and bob and i were just chatting off air about some of the things that we
[02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:43.480]  want to cover um bob you talked about the overreaction of the government uh the super congress
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:48.360]  and even the enabling act can you get into all that we got a lot of territory to cover here
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:55.880]  it tony takes a second and so what the this super congress is it's called can do is put
[02:33:55.880 --> 02:34:02.520]  together the law and they sent it to the house and the senate and they cannot debate it they can't
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:09.160]  amend it they can't spill a buster it they vote up or down and that's the end of it so what this
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:15.720]  is done is take the house and the senate out of the context they don't do anything they just stand
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:23.720]  there as river stamps like zombies and so the reason i brought this up is a parallel example
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:31.720]  of this tsa thing with groping people only here they're groping your freedom because this whole
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:39.080]  thing is modeled after the 1933 enabling act with the national socialist party in germany
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:46.920]  past which made adolf Hitler a dictator and with this panel these 12 people that's exactly what
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:53.880]  they intend to do so we're going to have a dictator in a few years because we've allowed
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:35:03.000]  that kind of thing to go on in our government now can you explain is true this this council of
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  the super congress how does this how does this make the dictatorship the dictator even more
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:16.520]  powerful is it because these selected members of congress are selected by the president or
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:22.840]  influenced by the president how exactly does that work well the two parties put up these six and six
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:29.000]  each and from the house and the senate and of course there are people who will lay down for
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:35.400]  anything yeah and the president just says okay this is what you're going to do and they go to the
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:44.040]  congress and say here's the bill either defeat it or pass it and 90% of the people in congress
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:48.920]  have paid off so they do what they're told otherwise they don't get reelected sure and so
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:55.560]  all the garbage in the world can get passed and let's say that they they uh the president said
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:00.760]  i want to collect everybody's guns so they put a bill together and they'll send it to the house
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:06.200]  and the senate and these meatheads will vote for it and so they go around and they'll kick
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:11.800]  everybody's door down and take their weapons that's all it takes aren't there many examples of this
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:18.120]  in human history of legislators for example in the roman empire the roman senate eventually
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:24.040]  became corrupted and just sort of rubber stamped the the the dictatorship aims of the leaders
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:31.480]  that's correct and now almost every civilization every dictatorial government has had the same
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:39.080]  problem and has ended up the same way not all of them but most of them and it's an evolutionary
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:47.080]  process of pure evil and not caring about people at all as long as whoever was in power got their
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:56.200]  way i mean you know in the latter stages in roman the 300s and the 400s as soon as they had disruption
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.640]  they had somebody come out and say well i'm going to buy the army so i can be dictator
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:08.920]  which they did and then they go off you know the outskirts of roman fight off the barbarians and
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:15.000]  sooner or later the mercenaries which is most of the roman army at that time said was oh we don't
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:21.880]  want to do this anymore i'm going home to gall or wherever they came from and uh and that's the
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:28.680]  way it's going to end up but what's so frustrating america if i'm sorry go ahead if america does
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:34.040]  not erect elect ron paul and people like him in the next election that's what they can expect
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:41.560]  but these people are preempting that in tsa and in government in relation to the super congress
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:47.560]  the same kind of overriding overbearing we're going to do what we want to do even though it's
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:53.000]  unconstitutional we don't care there is no constitution that that's what it's so frustrating
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:59.800]  about this is that it seems like u.s government is now on a track to tyranny they're following a
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:07.000]  blueprint that other civilizations or other nations have followed on the road to tyranny this is
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.680]  happening right in front of our our eyes the things that you have warned listeners about
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:16.440]  are coming true the things that alex has warned about are all coming true uh even alex says they
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:21.000]  openly admit what they're trying to do it's it's like a a recipe book a playbook and they're just
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:26.920]  following it step by step and yet most of the people out there are completely asleep at the wheel
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:31.560]  they don't understand what's happening they don't understand why the super congress is such a threat
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:37.800]  to their freedoms do you think bob that this is about to shift are we going to have a reawakening
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:44.280]  a resurgence of freedom in america or are we doomed to go down this path of tyranny a lot
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:51.320]  farther until uh until things finally turn around well i think it's up to the american public and
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:59.240]  there's no better place to start than at the nfl football stadiums and uh people say no i'm not
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:03.640]  going to go give me my money back all the teams are going to go out of business all the players are
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:09.480]  going to be out of a job and everybody's going to be mad at the government and if they tried at
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:14.760]  railway stations well people will stop traveling unless they absolutely have to i mean i won't get
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:20.520]  on a plane just like that jessie ventura won't i'm on every s less in the world in fact i don't
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:25.000]  even live in the united states because i think if i lived there they'd kill me yeah and i'm not used
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:32.200]  to suicide right right well i don't i don't fly either for the same reasons uh i i think gosh if
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:36.680]  the tsa saw me in an airport they'd probably plant cocaine in my bag and steal my ipad and
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:42.760]  still groped me just just for their own amusement um so i stay away from airports for that reason
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:48.920]  but you know what why is it bob that that mainstream public and look the nfl the people that go to
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:53.480]  these these football games sports fans they perhaps don't realize that there was also something in the
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:59.000]  roman empire called bread and circuses right that the sports were all a form of distraction
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.480]  so that you don't think about the really important things that are happening around you
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:08.440]  i mean are these the people that they can stand up i hope they are but i'm not sure yet
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:15.960]  i don't know we're gonna find out but we gotta tell them all of them who are listening
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:21.880]  tell the nfl if that's what they're gonna do at the stadiums i'm coming in with my tickets and
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:27.160]  i want my money back and that's strong motivation for them to call the white house and say hey
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:33.000]  there is not going to be an nfl and if you try it with the nba get the same thing and the hockey
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.760]  league and so on there you go yeah that that that's the answer you want to shift gears you know we
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:48.120]  don't have to have sports we don't have to have sports it's entertainment i mean i play professional
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:54.440]  sports i know what it's all about yeah i look i i don't even have time to watch sports so i
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:58.200]  wouldn't have seen this news if it wasn't on info wars i mean we prop i don't know what your
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:04.600]  personal viewing habits are on sports but i don't even look i'm so busy fighting for freedom and
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:10.520]  exposing the fda and exposing vaccine dangers and so on that i don't even have a spare minute
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:14.520]  to look at sports but i hope that those who do are going to pay attention to this
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:22.040]  bob can you comment on now as we shift gears to the european union the financial catastrophe
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:28.680]  that is mounting there and the massive financial fallout that that lays ahead of us here as the
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:39.400]  dominoes start to fall well mr geithner who is a treasurer secretary just went to wasa to the
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:49.240]  conference that they have there and uh yesterday uh the united states and japan and great britain
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:55.960]  which is broke and uh and switzerland which just devalued their currencies for the first currency
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:42:01.400]  for the first time ever and you should see the letters we're getting about people pulling all
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:07.320]  their assets out of switzerland and swiss frank people are infuriated and they shouldn't have done
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:12.200]  it and they didn't have to do it but anyway they were told to do it and they do what they're told
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:19.640]  by the alumnus behind the scenes so what they decided to do was contribute money loan money
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:28.280]  on a 45 day basis not giving the total but i'm i'm told it's over a trillion dollars uh to european
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:39.640]  financial uh sectors such as banks and also the uh the central banks of all of the countries
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:46.200]  like germany etc and in addition to that which they didn't tell you is they're going to do another
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:54.520]  currency swap for 500 billion and that's when several countries get together and they digitally
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:01.560]  tell you you have x amount of swiss ranks and you're going to give us x amount of dollars
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:12.840]  and the reason for that is that they want to be able to use the dollars in commerce because
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:19.560]  what's happening is everybody is pulling their money out of the banks in europe particular
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:26.440]  particularly dollar deposits and there's a run on the banks in europe right now
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:33.560]  just like we had three years ago in the credit crisis and the fed again ran came to the rescue
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:44.120]  and just and provided trillions of dollars secretly right and didn't tell us about it the gao under
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:56.200]  the uh the dod frank act uh audited them the audits not finished and they said that the fed led 16.1
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:02.680]  trillion dollars what is the colossal sum of money and when they were doing it i knew it
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:08.840]  and in my publication i said the figure is 13.8 well ladies and ladies and gentlemen i'm sorry
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:18.840]  i missed it by a few tricks the point is this i called it and it was out of control but even
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:29.560]  more than i thought it was and so this is the stopgap method of trying to save the euro the euro
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:40.760]  zone which is 17 of the 27 countries and being able to kick the can down the road oh probably for
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:47.000]  45 days well let me ask you about the timing on this in this body three months and that's it
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.920]  they're going to have to do it over and over again although things going to collapse so not
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:56.600]  not folding anybody what's your assessment of the timing on this um uh sorry to interrupt you there
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:02.680]  but how how long do we have before the real fallout begins across europe for this you said
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:09.480]  kicking a can down the road 45 days or so but also the question is when do we feel the european
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:17.880]  financial catastrophe in the united states is it immediate is there a lag time i mean why should
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:25.640]  listeners in the us today be so concerned and rightly concerned with the analysis that you are
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:31.880]  offering about europe and the timing there why does it matter here in the us well it looks like
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:37.880]  they're going to buy two or three months here and so it's not going to be that quickly and uh
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:44.680]  what about greece well that'll depend upon what the german bundersdag does and which is house
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:53.160]  representatives and that will be on the 29th and if they don't pass the loan approval uh
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:59.960]  from the bundesbank to the european central bank then there won't be a deal and that means the
[02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:08.040]  us will have to step in again via the federation and help these help the european central bank
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:14.120]  come up with the funds to lend them now it's illegal for the lend them but nobody's making
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:19.480]  an issue out of it because they don't have that authority they can't create money and credit
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:26.040]  even though they do illegally you see there's no rules anymore right we see that everywhere
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:32.680]  in the united states concerned the major banks in new york of which is five they have ensured
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:43.000]  the death of greece for the banks in europe in part of what they bought and it's about 150
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:48.440]  billion dollars they say it's 75 but it's double that and because they lie about everything and
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:55.240]  we can't tell because we can't see their books and also the money market funds pension funds
[02:46:55.240 --> 02:47:02.520]  have been buying greek and other paper to get the yield the yields over 100 and so they're making
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:09.240]  the risk well if they're offside to get another 150 billion more and so you're offside 300 billion
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:15.560]  and maybe more and that's going to affect the lending institutions in the united states which
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:21.000]  then means that the federation will have to give them more money again now what's the flip side of
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:33.320]  all this it's very very very inflationary and what instruments profit by inflation gold silver
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:39.400]  and commodities and that's it yeah where where's gold today bob i haven't been tracking it this
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:46.200]  week what's it up to now i track it while i'm talking to you we're we're dealing with the outside
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:54.680]  month which is december in both gold and silver and gold is up 3260 and silver's up 129 a bit off
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:48:02.120]  their highs on the day and um i said yesterday morning on my shows that i want i do lots of them
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:08.200]  that uh this was the turning point again and i think that's the third time in a row i picked it
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:14.440]  within like three or four weeks and we're going to run right back up again and uh this time
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:25.320]  they used again as they did before the uh the derivatives options and futures but this time
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:34.120]  they also had some of the central banks in europe leasing gold to gold bullion banks like jb morgan
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:43.800]  chase how much i don't know uh the structure i don't know but when what why why would they be leasing
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:49.320]  gold to jp morgan so that jp morgan can cover its obligations in physical gold
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:57.560]  that could be but more importantly what morgan normally does is immediately sells the gold into
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:05.000]  the market and when they go to pay the lender back let's say it's portugal uh when they go to pay
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:12.600]  him back to payment dollars but portugal still has the gold on their books as if they still had it
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:19.960]  and that's approved by the imf so the whole thing is a scam but what they were doing i think
[02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:27.080]  i think was lending gold into the market what it which is can't amount to gold sales
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:33.800]  right okay um now by the way we're coming up on a break here in about a minute and we're
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:40.520]  going to continue with you bob here on the show i want to ask you uh perhaps this is not the realm
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:45.480]  you normally comment on but i i really value your assessment in your opinion i want to ask you about
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:51.320]  algor and how now even environmental groups excuse me environmental groups are now saying
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:50:00.440]  that algor is so polarizing that perhaps he is harming the the global warming uh uh industry
[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:05.400]  you might say or the or the whole advocacy of that theory so i'd like to ask your opinion
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:09.240]  about algor we've got about a minute if you want to get into that and then we'll continue on the
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:19.480]  other side go ahead bob um armen hammer was the uh person who really financed al algor's father
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:28.280]  and uh after he died the russians uh said that he was a communist by starting in 1923
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:35.560]  uh i knew we are armen hammer and i knew he was a communist all those years and so was an algor's
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:41.880]  father and algor now today in our realm today there's so many different kinds of socialism
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:46.280]  it doesn't matter we gotta go to break here stay with us though bob sorry to interrupt you

[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:29.720]  this story about big sis ordered nfl grope downs this is now a story posted on info wars.com by
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:35.880]  paul joseph watson alex himself already called in and chimed in on this issue and warned us
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:41.000]  that we've got to rise up and resist this we've got to call the nfl we've got to call the team
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:47.320]  franchises we've got to go bob Chapman suggested we go and ask for a refund on our football tickets
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:53.800]  so that we do not provide any financial support for the nfl if it's going to go along with big
[02:54:53.800 --> 02:55:00.200]  sis and napolitano and its homeland security touch my junk agenda uh not something that we
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:04.680]  want to be given into now bob Chapman continues with us in this segment want to mention if you'd
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:12.360]  like a free copy of the international forecaster his publication just call 1-800-686-2237 again
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:22.680]  that's 1-800-686-2237 and bob before the break i wanted to chat with you about al gore and how
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:27.640]  he's becoming a nuisance of sorts to the environmental movement itself now i've always
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:32.440]  thought gee al gore well i know he's a a fake environmentalist because he won't speak out
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:37.240]  against gmo's which is a huge environmental issue but now even i guess some of his own friends are
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:43.160]  saying he's he's not the right guy to lead their march of fraud i don't i don't know what what
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:48.120]  continue with that bob where do you where do you think this is going well i think he's torn
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:56.280]  between the power trip and the fact that he's healthy rich and he's also part of this carbon
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:02.360]  trading operation he owns part of it and so that'll bring him income if it continues
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:13.000]  out into an item this this carbon is nothing but a way to tax people and i did a lot of radio work
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:20.680]  on that two to three years ago and helped expose what they were up to in this carbon scam that
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:31.480]  they've got going but al gore is passe he's been proven to be a liar essentially and many other
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:38.680]  people who were hooked up with the movement particularly people who are connected to government
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:44.280]  or the council and foreign relations of the trial and commission of the bill de verger group and in
[02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:52.360]  fact are the man who calls himself president united states either has or isn't in the process of going
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:57:03.240]  to australia uh to help the p m there was a lady and uh to try to get the people to accept carbon
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:10.600]  taxes and uh you know what is he doing doing that i mean there's more important things here in america
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:18.520]  well anyway exactly the point is that he and others have crippled that whole movement
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:25.400]  and it's lost its validity and i don't think they're going to get it back they continue to pursue it
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:31.720]  because carbon taxes are the way that they want to tax everybody in the world it's very important
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:37.080]  to them they've been working on it for 30 years here here are words from the guardian itself
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:43.720]  environment blog where uh these these are folks in the environmental movement saying al gore is a
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:51.160]  hugely polarizing figure particularly in his homeland that's an interesting term there to use
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:57.400]  whatever he does or says no matter how cogent or sensible they claim will attract scorn and
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:03.880]  derision they say from those who just can't see past the man well i think we see right through the
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:09.960]  man actually i i think we know exactly what he's up to but bob i well i think if you really want
[02:58:09.960 --> 02:58:15.400]  to find out why don't you consult with his ex-wife i'm sure she's got plenty to say yeah bob i want
