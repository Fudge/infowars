[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.000]  It doesn't matter how much time, because at five o'clock, they take me to the gallows
[00:42.000 --> 01:06.000]  The sands of time for me. The sands of time for me are running low. And the sands of time for the beginning of World War 3 are running low, running low.
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  You study global conflicts throughout history, regional conflicts, World War 1, World War 2. This is exactly how they start.
[01:14.000 --> 01:27.000]  An economist, researchers, historians across the board in the last year have said the world is cruising towards nuclear war.
[01:27.000 --> 01:43.000]  For me, it isn't about the US or Russia or Palestinian versus Israeli. It isn't about black versus white. It isn't about Christian versus Muslim or Jew versus Muslim or black versus Hispanic.
[01:43.000 --> 02:04.000]  It's about global destabilization being carried out by corporate interest operating at different levels for the same goals and interests, sometimes not for the same goals and interests, creating this out of control headlong rush into what I'm calling the age of crisis.
[02:04.000 --> 02:17.000]  Humans have always had wars, always had giant disasters, but this one's different because of all the weapons and the communications.
[02:17.000 --> 02:27.000]  There's a reason elites are all moving to armored redoubts in the Caribbean and the Cook Islands and New Zealand right now.
[02:27.000 --> 02:38.000]  The top billionaires of Israel, it was reported a year ago, have basically all left Israel to go to Luxembourg, Switzerland or London.
[02:38.000 --> 02:49.000]  Elites are buying huge yachts, openly saying that they're not so much to party on but to survive on. This is serious, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49.000 --> 03:03.000]  The British Ministry of Defense says global total meltdown is going to happen in their 2007 report. Our Pentagon came out last year in a report saying we're preparing for collapse, but then only they are allowed to say it.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  If citizens pointed out, it's like, oh, that's not happening. Don't be a fear monger.
[03:08.000 --> 03:23.000]  I want to have a debate about all of this so that we can avert the disasters that are coming. Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[03:23.000 --> 03:34.000]  We don't know history on average. We have the most historically ignorant population in the West we've probably had since the Renaissance began.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  And the general public is watching their ball games and drinking beer. I get it.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  But this is undoubtedly the most unstable time in human history.
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.000]  And Obama came out last week, remember, and said the world owes his administration for the unprecedented global stability.
[03:53.000 --> 04:05.000]  And you didn't build your business and Obamacare is cutting your prices and he's not coming after your guns and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit and he wouldn't hire one lobbyist.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  And again, it's beyond Obama. It's the age of total bull.
[04:09.000 --> 04:27.000]  Carney, the carnival Barker from the White House Press Secretary is going to work at Apple. I mean, how fitting. Oh, they're so liberal. They're so sweet. They run the most vicious slave camps in China with suicide nets, forced drugging, forced abortion on record.
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  But they talk with Lisb and wave rainbow flags so they're not threatening.
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  You see, Darth Vader looks scary. Hitler looks scary. So we know they're bad.
[04:39.000 --> 04:50.000]  Modern evil is in a suit acting very friendly, speaking with an NPR list when it's actually a military globalist corporate operation.
[04:50.000 --> 04:57.000]  So we either grow up right now or we lose everything because the globalists plan to fully conquer America while they conquer the world.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  It's total full spectrum dominance.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs. Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes.
[05:07.000 --> 05:17.000]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that good stuff.
[05:21.000 --> 05:32.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[05:38.000 --> 05:45.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day. I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  Not just the super male vitality, all the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[05:51.000 --> 06:17.000]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[06:17.000 --> 06:24.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[06:24.000 --> 06:39.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[06:39.000 --> 06:47.000]  People calling themselves members of the weather underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  They took the babies out of incubators and left their children to die on the cold floor.
[06:51.000 --> 07:02.000]  Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgment that the Israeli Air Force bombs a U.S. intelligence Navy ship.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[07:07.000 --> 07:17.000]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a U.S. helicopter. More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are U.S. Navy SEALs.
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  There may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down and you'd be used for the excuse to accelerate the next war.
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.000]  If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between, it's that we all hate that the bank bail out.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducations.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[07:57.000 --> 08:05.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[08:05.000 --> 08:12.000]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen. It is the 20th day of July, 2014.
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be here as we are every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[08:19.000 --> 08:27.000]  Shumblecast on over 90 AM and FM affiliates on the Sunday show and also going out on Global Shortwave.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  Number one political podcast is free and you can subscribe at infowars.com.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  We also have video feeds at infowars.com forward slash show with a full television production, not just radio.
[08:40.000 --> 08:50.000]  And, of course, the weekday show has over 100 and 60 AM and FM affiliates and it airs 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  Eastern, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  First off, for regular listeners, you can attest to this.
[09:05.000 --> 09:11.000]  If you're a new listener, I would suggest you say go to one of our many YouTube channels.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  One channel alone, the Alex Jones channel has about 403 million views on it.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  Just for your new listener, just let you know freedom and the truth is popular.
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  And I suggest you just go back into the archives six months and click on any show.
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  And if you listen a couple hours, you'll hear me give the speech I'm about to give right now.
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  But augment with the latest information that you're about to see all hell break loose worldwide
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.000]  and war on the border with Russia, war all over the Middle East, war all over Africa, all over Asia.
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  China may even attack the islands of the Philippines and now they've said they're going to do that.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  They say, well, we're going to take them in by force.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Everyone tries to stop us. We're going to nuke you.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  They've told Japan and the U.S. that you're seeing our borders imploded.
[10:00.000 --> 10:09.000]  That was coming. This is the globalist that sent above the nations and are manipulating the nations into a global crisis
[10:09.000 --> 10:19.000]  so that when the dollar goes down, a new IMF World Bank backed system is the new global digital currency,
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.000]  not the dollar and not the bridge going on right now in South America with world leaders
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  openly saying we're in a global depression, openly saying the dollar is going down.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  Now, what are the globalist response? Start a war with Russia.
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  And again, I'm not saying the U.S. is good or bad. I'm not saying Russia is good or bad.
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  The globalists are outside of this manipulating the whole process.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  So while Vladimir Putin is in South America down in Brazil and traveling around other countries,
[10:59.000 --> 11:07.000]  saying they're devaluing the dollar, printing trillions of dollars or issuing trillions of dollars a month of digital currency
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  and the world is pegged to the dollar so it's causing inflation all over the world.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  I was in the Caribbean, folks, and pesos were almost buying more than dollars now.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  I mean, it is just three weeks ago. It is hardcore.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  We are insulated somewhat from the inflation, though it's starting to really accelerate here.
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  It's nothing like it is in Europe, nothing like it is in Asia or Latin America.
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  So the world is being forced into this crisis. They don't want it.
[11:39.000 --> 11:48.000]  Now, we have seen the shoot-down of MH17 that was flying from Amsterdam to Australia for an AIDS conference,
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  the Malaysian airliner, not the one missing in the Indian Ocean off the other Garcia.
[11:55.000 --> 12:02.000]  Remember the RMS Lusitania. Heard that name?
[12:02.000 --> 12:11.000]  In 1915, she was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat causing the deaths of 1,198 passengers and crew.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  The Germans had put full-page articles in ads in the New York Times and the Times of London saying,
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  this is an auxiliary ship carrying armaments under law. We are going to torpedo it next time we see it.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  But the Germans didn't do that for a few months.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  So the British officer on board, and this all came out years later,
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  sailed back and forth, steamed back and forth in front of the German U-boats until they took it out.
[12:40.000 --> 12:48.000]  What came out from the shoot-down last week? We're not sure who's behind it, probably the Russians.
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  Ukraine had been bombing Russian-held ethnic areas, killing thousands a day some days last week.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  The Russians responded last Sunday. You were listening. I said, the Russians said,
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  we're going to have targeted strikes back. We're going to shoot down these aircraft.
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  For two months, the FAA is in Europe, but also the EU system had said you will be arrested.
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  If you fly over this area of Crimea, it's controlled airspace like flown over military base.
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  It's a war zone. Do not fly over it. The FAA reissued that warning last Thursday.
[13:22.000 --> 13:31.000]  No flights have flown through there in two months. They directed this sole flight right over the missile batteries.
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  Again, can you say Lusitania? Lusitania, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:38.000 --> 13:47.000]  It didn't matter that the Germans had said we're going to sink this ship carrying armaments to the front from the United States.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  It didn't matter if they put full-page ads in the U.S. newspapers and British papers saying, don't sail on it.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  We're going to torpedo it. It didn't matter if they sailed it back and forth in front of them.
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  How did the Spanish-American War start in 1898, blowing up the main in Havana Harbor?
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  How did the Vietnam officially start, even though I had family there in 1961?
[14:08.000 --> 14:25.000]  It started in 1964 when they claimed our destroyers were attacked. It was declassified on the 40th anniversary in 2004 that it was totally staged by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  The ships were not attacked. Am I endorsing the North Vietnamese? Absolutely not.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  The point is reality is reality is reality is reality.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  2003, declassified in 2006, Blair and Bush met at the White House and at Downing Street in two different meetings.
[14:45.000 --> 14:55.000]  The White House and Downing Street memos released to Congress where they said, we'll paint up a U.S. aircraft like another aircraft and get it shot down over Iraq to go after Saddam.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  Am I endorsing Saddam? No.
[14:58.000 --> 15:09.000]  Do you, though, get a plane shot down that Saddam thinks is military so you can say that he went after the UN? No, you don't do that.
[15:09.000 --> 15:17.000]  The point is they think you're so stupid, now they're saying Russia wanted to hack and bring down the U.S. stock market in Nasdaq.
[15:17.000 --> 15:25.000]  Of course they did. What do you think the Pentagon trains to do all day to take down every other major stock market if a war starts?
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  The issue here is Russia has imploded. Russia is trying to rebuild economically.
[15:30.000 --> 15:39.000]  Russia endorsed Alexander Shultz and Itza. Vladimir Putin endorsed anti-communism and Alexander Shultz and Itza before Shultz and Itza died.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  Does that mean I trust Putin? No. Is Putin, though, trying to pass anti-gun laws? Did he pass Obamacare? Did he collapse our borders? No.
[15:46.000 --> 15:57.000]  He is setting up a new economic system against the collapse of the dollar, just like Iraq tried to go on another gold standard and was attacked in 2003.
[15:57.000 --> 16:21.000]  The same thing is happening now.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[16:27.000 --> 16:34.000]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower in IQ, and even cancer.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water.
[16:37.000 --> 16:45.000]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  This is very tasty. It's good water. It's refreshing. It's good.

[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  I can take her on romantic dates. I get her flowers. You name it. She's just not the woman I married.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  Oh Ralph, that's just awful.
[17:12.000 --> 17:19.000]  Does this seem familiar? Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone? If so, consider this.
[17:19.000 --> 17:28.000]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[17:34.000 --> 17:45.000]  Forget synthetic chemicals. Superfemale vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  Infowarslife.com. Live life healthy.
[18:00.000 --> 18:06.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified.
[18:06.000 --> 18:15.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[18:15.000 --> 18:24.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[18:24.000 --> 18:31.000]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[18:31.000 --> 18:40.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:40.000 --> 18:49.000]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[18:49.000 --> 19:00.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[19:00.000 --> 19:10.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group. It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[19:10.000 --> 19:21.000]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[19:21.000 --> 19:31.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[19:31.000 --> 19:43.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today. It delivers 650 micrograms per drop. Experience the new formula. Experience the ancient purity.
[19:43.000 --> 20:01.000]  Shield your family. Survival Shield X2, available now at infowarslife.com.
[20:01.000 --> 20:22.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:22.000 --> 20:34.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[20:34.000 --> 20:41.000]  Alex Jones here back live. I have studied the globalists and how they operate for about 22 years.
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  Longer than that, but full focus, 22 years. On air, almost 20.
[20:47.000 --> 20:54.000]  I've read their books, hundreds of them, five books by Brzezinski. You name it. I mean, we've quoted them here. We've made films about it.
[20:54.000 --> 21:08.000]  They explain how they do all this. Brzezinski admits that our government helped Pol Pot get into power. He killed about 30% of his population.
[21:08.000 --> 21:18.000]  And then you see how naive the public is while Brzezinski writes a book admitting his involvement in mass murder.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  Or how he set up Al Qaeda.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  And the public wears their ignorance like a shield.
[21:28.000 --> 21:38.000]  I mean, people are saying, Alex, you need to cover what's going on in Gaza, what the Hollywood cause celeb deal, the Palestinians.
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.000]  I'm supposed to only be concerned about who the media tells me I am and want us to go out and riot about it.
[21:44.000 --> 21:50.000]  I've criticized Netanyahu for openly endorsing a month and a half ago ISIS.
[21:50.000 --> 21:58.000]  And we know the Israeli forces up on their northern border are coordinating attacks into Syria with them.
[21:58.000 --> 22:06.000]  Oh, but you notice that the Southern Prairie Law Center ADL and the Israeli pro press doesn't criticize me for that because they don't want to discuss it.
[22:06.000 --> 22:17.000]  I criticize Israel effectively, but not from a hateful position wanting to see Israel destroyed, but from a moral position.
[22:17.000 --> 22:25.000]  What about the 300,000 dead plus in the last three years of the Western backed attack on Assad?
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  The West started it using Al Qaeda, now called ISIS.
[22:28.000 --> 22:34.000]  Now they're running around blowing up moderate mosque and Christian churches and murdering Christians and the Iraqi police.
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  We trained in mass and Obama has done nothing to stop them because they're behind it and so is Saudi Arabia.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  And that came out in the news.
[22:43.000 --> 22:55.000]  300,000 dead, at least half of them Christians murdered by Al Qaeda, the scum of the earth.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  And our government gave them stinger missiles.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  That's now mainstream news.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  Where'd you hear it?
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  Hear first.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  I'm not bragging, folks.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  I know what I'm talking about.
[23:03.000 --> 23:14.000]  We got 400 dead Palestinians, most of them combatants involved in heavy fighting, you know, fighting Israeli armor.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  Certainly soldiers, you can say that they're not wimps.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  Whatever.
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  I get their position.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  I get the Israeli position.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  It's tribal warfare.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  I'm sitting back like an anthropologist looking at two tribes in New Guinea killing themselves.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  I don't belong to either one.
[23:30.000 --> 23:38.000]  See, can't you be scientific about this, folks, and pull back from the emotions and look at what's going on?
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  I mean, I get emotional when I see the ignorance of the public.
[23:42.000 --> 23:47.000]  All you're hearing about right now is Gaza.
[23:47.000 --> 23:57.000]  When Ukraine put out headlines last Sunday that they'd killed, quote, a thousand rebels in one day.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  And then Russian TV and British TV showed it as well, just smoking, burning whole neighborhoods.
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  They're just bombing, carpet-bombing neighborhoods.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  And then Russia said, we're going to start shooting your planes down.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  And so they went, oh, you are?
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  Let's just run some airliners right over that no-fly zone.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.000]  Let's just drive the Lusitania right in front of the U-boats after the Germans put full-page ads in the New York Times.
[24:23.000 --> 24:30.000]  I mean, this is literally the 1915 trick that got the United States into the war.
[24:30.000 --> 24:39.000]  They even picked a ship they knew had U.S. passengers on it.
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  On purpose, they were putting it on a passenger liner.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  Armaments.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  And the Germans said, we're going to sink that ship.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  Don't sail on it.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  Again, am I endorsing the Kaiser and the Austrian-Hungarian Empire?
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  I don't know, against the British Empire at that time.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  Yeah, they weren't the Nazis.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  And that brought the Nazis in, by the way, and then we get World War II.
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  So here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  The West is trying to start a real war with Russia.
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  They tried it in 2008 during the Olympics again, just like they did this year.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  On the world scene, it's what it's all about.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  And the CFR and all of them put out prospectuses the last few years, saying this was the plan.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  Brzezinski wrote the grand chess board about how they finally bring down Russia
[25:32.000 --> 25:42.000]  and how they'd use radical Islam to bring down the entire Middle East and kill every secular leader there.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  And then use the threat of radical Islam to take all of our rights here domestically.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  I want to be clear, there is radical Islam.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  The media always says that I say, and weird Al Yankovic says that I say, you know, there's no Islamic terror out there.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  It's there and it's funded and shepherded and protected.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  And it is allowed to kill U.S. troops.
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.000]  I mean, Marines, Army, you name it, they actually die fighting groups that the globalists around our country armed.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  People go, that doesn't make sense.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  Of course it makes sense.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  They stabilize things and wreck the Middle East and wreck the world and have a threat to take the liberties here at home
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  and have trillions and no bid weapons contracts.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  What do you do?
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  You arm the crazies.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  You open the door for the crazies.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  And then you bury your sons and daughters who really died fighting them.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  Don't you see the master stroke of this?
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  And again, I'm not even saying that the West NATO shot that aircraft down.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  I said that day one.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  I've been watching Russia.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  I think they probably did it.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  They said last Sunday, seven days ago here, go listen to the archives on info wars.com free podcasts.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Go back to last Sunday.
[26:52.000 --> 27:00.000]  I said right during this segment, Russia is going to start shooting aircraft down and get ready for this to escalate quickly.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  And boy has it.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  Here's Diane Feinstein, the senator.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  You know, the one that wants your guns.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  It isn't Putin.
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  Feinstein, the U.S. is now at Cold War levels with Russia.
[27:11.000 --> 27:18.000]  Putin, you have to man up, says the woman that wants to disarm the American people.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  Well, that's a joke.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now they're sending in NATO advisors and troops and weapons.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  And the Russians say if they start engaging Russians, the Russians are going to attack the NATO troops.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  Then the NATO troops are going to escalate with their power.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  The Russians are going to pour in and then people will start using tactical nuclear weapons.
[27:38.000 --> 27:50.000]  And about 30 minutes later, submarines pop up with cruise missiles on them off each shore and missile cruisers and start firing nuclear weapons into major cities.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  We barely stopped this in 1961 with the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  Here's another headline.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  Ukraine rebels argue over Wreck. Europeans give Putin last chance.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  That's a quote.
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.000]  Last chance before they start putting blockades on Russian ships in European ports.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  That's an act of war.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  This isn't some Iraqis we're slapping around.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  This isn't some third world country.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  This is Russia with 150 million people and at least 10,000 operable missiles.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  3,000 of them total M with 20 warheads and MERS up inside of them.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  You know what happened on 888 when the West attacked the Russian-held areas of Ossetia and Abkhazia?
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  The Russians rolled in mobile medium-range missiles and said we're targeting NATO bases in one hour.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  We'll begin firing pull NATO forces out.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  And NATO backed off.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  But Obama will be too busy eating a hamburger or playing golf to care this time.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  I'm telling you folks, this is like Napoleon and Hitler attacking Russia.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  We're on the edge of World War 3.
[29:00.000 --> 29:07.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.000]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[29:52.000 --> 29:59.000]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[30:22.000 --> 30:26.000]  We're talking about Made in America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  But to expand the Info War we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free.
[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  Right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time only $39.95 a year.
[30:43.000 --> 30:47.000]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.000]  Not just this July 4th weekend but the entire month of July.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  At prison1776.com.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  Moan Lombay.
[30:55.000 --> 31:24.000]  You can take my gun from my cold dead aunt.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[31:31.000 --> 31:39.000]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so called rebels.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.000]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family. Visit infowarsnews.com today.

[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[32:02.000 --> 32:07.000]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[32:07.000 --> 32:12.000]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs
[32:12.000 --> 32:17.000]  harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[32:17.000 --> 32:22.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that's good stuff.
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others,
[32:25.000 --> 32:32.000]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[32:32.000 --> 32:39.000]  Super male vitality by Info War's life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[32:41.000 --> 32:45.000]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[32:45.000 --> 32:51.000]  It's not just the super male vitality. All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[32:51.000 --> 32:56.000]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality
[32:56.000 --> 33:19.000]  and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[33:19.000 --> 33:23.000]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling
[33:23.000 --> 33:27.000]  means that we're running up our debt. Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done
[33:27.000 --> 33:34.000]  over a hundred times, does not increase our debt. It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.000]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress.
[33:38.000 --> 33:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  So if you just joined us, I want to break this down.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  And if you disagree with me or agree or want to augment this point
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  or you're currently in the U.S. military, especially I would like to hear from you,
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.000]  some callers on this live Sunday edition, I'm going to give out the toll-free number to call us
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  here in just a few minutes and we'll start taking your calls.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  In the next segment, we'll also get into the latest on the collapsing border,
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  the latest on the devalued dollar and more.
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  Now, I'm a libertarian, a constitutionalist. I don't like government.
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.000]  I really don't like big government.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  So I don't lionize Vladimir Putin.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  But he wants a strong nationalistic Russia.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  They're moving away from communism.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  Alexander Shelton eats an endorsed Putin before he died.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  Let's look that up.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  London Guardian.
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  U.S. Ambassador to Russia met with him and says, is this really true?
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  And he said, yes, we want nationalism.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  And Shelton Silesian wrote a book, How the West Funded Communism
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  and actually put the Bolshevik Sand.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  It's all through.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  He wrote a Nobel Prize winner that was such a hero to Ronald Reagan.
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.000]  Ronald Reagan said his greatest hero.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  John Wayne's hero.
[35:08.000 --> 35:15.000]  He endorsed Vladimir Putin.
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  And, you know, wrote on chalk his book, Gula Gerkepellego,
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  when he was in decades in a forced labor camp,
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  under the Stalinist and memorized it,
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  and then wrote it when he got out.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  He had dozens of other books.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  And some of his last books basically could have been written by me.
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  I was reading his quotes just last night.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  They have huge websites of them.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  And it was exactly everything I say.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  Even though I've only read a few of his books,
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  I've got to read the rest of them.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  It was that he understood tyranny so well that it was quotes
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  that I've basically given,
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  but just a little bit more elegantly put,
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  because he had seen evil up front.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  It wasn't that...
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  I'm not comparing myself to Alexander Shultz and Eson.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  My point is truth is truth.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  It's self-evident.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  And there's the U.S. Embassy Cables, the Guardian.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  Shultz and Eson praises Putin.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  2010.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  2008 as well.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  All right, anyways, continuing.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  Oh, yeah, they were very concerned.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  And I'm not bragging when I tell you this,
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  because I knew about this years ago
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  when I was at RT headquarters in New York,
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  and then in LA,
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  the head of RT at the time who was replaced,
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  because the State Department freaked out
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  and threatened to shut him off if I was ever allowed back on there.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  So I'd go on national Russian TV
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  and criticize communism, criticize Stalin,
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  criticize the New World Order,
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  to say whatever I wanted.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  The head of RT was a huge listener,
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  and they were...
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  I was told they literally started it,
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  modeled a little bit off Info Wars.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  That was part of it.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  That was the basic Russian government
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  listening to my show.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  And I never really said that on air,
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  because it sounds so wild, but it's confirmed.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  And it's come out in communiques and cables
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  and stuff like that.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  And it's been the one in telegraph that
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Assad also, they hacked his emails,
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  and the government was reading our analysis
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  and InfoWars.com,
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  my analysis.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  And I'm not saying that arrogantly,
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  but when the Russian government's listening to you,
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  you might as well just say that that's going on.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  I mean, it's no mistake that...
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  I mean, now I've been invited
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  on national Russian TV
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  repeatedly
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  to be on with Vladimir Putin's
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  best buddy, I forget his name,
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  that runs the state-run media over there,
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  and I've said no.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  The crews had the request come in, I've said no.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Because this is getting too close to war,
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  and I'm not going on Russian media.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  And again,
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  Vladimir Putin was in the KGB,
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  did head up the FSB,
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  and after that he was the deputy mayor
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  of Moscow.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  And I'm not lionizing him,
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  but do you know that Liberty's sexy
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  and we could sell people on freedom?
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  Putin pays them to have kids.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  On national TV,
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  talk about cancer viruses and the vaccines,
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  the globalist creating AIDS,
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  the New World Order,
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  the whole plan.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  And you have to understand,
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  this broadcast,
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  I've had the number three guy in the British...
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  well, the British government as well,
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  but I've had high-level folks from the Japanese government on.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  I mean, I'm not bragging, folks,
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  I've had to come to the fact of the realization
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  that this is the good news
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  to all of you out there.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  The world listens to this broadcast
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  and governments listen.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  And you know why the governments listen?
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  You know why the military listens?
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  And why they have news articles?
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  Mainstream news where they're ordering the military
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  not to listen to my show?
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  Why do you think that is?
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  The globalist that have hijacked the CIA
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  and the Pentagon and our whole system,
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  it scares them that we understand
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  the game plan.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  They're scared of Ron Paul.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  They're scared of Rand Paul too, folks.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  They know Rand Paul's for real.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  I don't know about Ted Cruz, I like him.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  I like what he says.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  But I tell you, I know Rand Paul, he's for real.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  See, we're just
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  normal people who don't want nuclear war
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  and want dads to be dads,
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  moms to be moms, private property,
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  kids to defend yourself, right to have a future.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  We like America.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  We like Russia.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  We like Japan. We like Brazil.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  I want to see Brazil do good.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  I want to see the world do good.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  We have good will.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  And that's infectious in a time
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  of great evil.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  People want to be good.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  They just have been taught
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  that only evil gets them ahead.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  Well, it doesn't get you ahead in the end.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  And we're coming down to the end game
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  of these, gentlemen.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  We're coming down
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  to
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  21st century high-tech war.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  And Vladimir Putin
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  and Brazil and China
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  and boy, you know how much I hate
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  communist China and they're totally
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  evil leaders. The point is, they are
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  seeing their currency devalued
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  because of the dollar devaluing that
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  our elite and the private Federal Reserve cartel
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  is engaged in. And it's these
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  same bankers that are invested in China.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  They're invested in Russia. They're playing
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  us all off against each other.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  We should come together as a human
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  family
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  and say no to war.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  And no to destabilization.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  And no, no to
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  the western backed
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  Palestinian groups launching rockets
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  to give Israel a pretext
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  to attack to cause destabilization.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  The same globalists are pulling the puppet strings
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  on Israel and the Palestinians.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  But we should say, okay, I'll talk about the Palestinians
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  because I care about them.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  Nobody likes images of dead kids.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  If you'll talk about hundreds
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  of thousands of Christians killed
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  in Iraq and Syria and Libya
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  by western backed
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  worst of the worst, bottom of the barrel
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  jihadi al-qaeda
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  ISIS scum. If you
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  do that
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  then all morally know you really
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  care. See, I'm just as upset
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  about dead Jewish kids
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  and Palestinians
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  and Christians, ladies
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  and gentlemen, because I know
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  the globalist hand
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  is not on scene, folks.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  When you know about it, it's right there.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  It's organizing chaos, just like the
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  first James Bond movie, written by a high level
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  former
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  member
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  British intelligence
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  Ian Fleming
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  where the organization
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  chaos
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  or is it specter
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  is manipulating
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  the Russians and the U.S. off against each other
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  to consolidate power
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  because who gains when we have
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  sanctions and things are shut down
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  and economies fold and Obamacare
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  banks erupts things and the border is collapsing
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  and our jobs being shipped. Who wants this bank
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  erupt? Banks.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  And not your corner bank.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  When I talk about banks, I don't mean your bank
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  down the street that gives you a loan for farming
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  or if I talk about the military,
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  I don't mean our military men and women. I mean the people running it
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  at the top.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  They don't
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  have our goodwill
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  at heart.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  They don't have our interest at heart.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  When I come back, I'm going to give the phone number out
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  and then we're going to get into
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  why this is all happening
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  and get into the big picture of what's going to happen next.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  The toll free number
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  to join us, first time callers today.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  I haven't done that about a week or two.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  It's 877-789-2539
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  877-789
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  Alex.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  For Alex Jones, I'm your host.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Different number than the weekday show.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  Weekday show is produced
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  in the same studio, but the phone lines are in Minnesota.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  This is all produced in
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  house right here on Sundays.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  4-6pm from South Austin.

[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  crystals, and the results

[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  infowarslife.com.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  I can taste dirt in it. God knows what's in this.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  These people just sampled city of
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  Austin tap water straight from the
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  faucet. Next, we had them try a sample
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  of tap water filtered through the
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  Now when it is better. Tastes like
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  nothing. Yep, I know a good water tastes
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  like it's good water. Most tap water contains
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  added substances like fluoride,
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  chlorine, glyphosate, and
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  many others. Studies prove that these
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  substances are linked to an assortment
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  of major health issues, including tooth decay,
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  lower IQ, and even cancer.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  when you're drinking tap water. The Pro Pure
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  G2.0 filtration system
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  removes these deadly substances
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  clean water. Okay, this is very tasty.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  It's good water. Refreshing. It's good.

[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grupp.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  It took me 20 years
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  of searching the globe to find
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  the deposit of the highest purity
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  iodine available. The new
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  Survival Shield X2
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  is mined from 7
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  to 10,000 feet below the
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  earth in pristine,
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  environmentally clean conditions.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  The iodine crystals we use
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  are extracted from an ancient
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  300 million
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  plus year old deposit
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  deep in the earth.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  on the market today.
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  It delivers 650
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  micrograms per drop.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  Experience the new formula.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  Experience the ancient purity.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  Shield your family.

[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  Margaret, David,
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  Brian and many others
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  in this segment
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  and I'll get more into the border
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  and pull back from Ukraine
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  coming up.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  But first off,
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  I want to explain something.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  About 100,000 Americans,
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  this is in congressional hearings
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  with Frank Church,
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  Senator Church, Anthony Sutton,
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  the late great,
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  how Wall Street financed the Soviets,
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  the USSR and Hitler.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  He wrote that book off government documents.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  He was the head archivist for Congress
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  at that time
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  and ran some of the hearings.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  And this freaked Congress out
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  so bad in the 70s
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  that they almost abolished the CIA
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  and found out about the 36,000,
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  35,000 Nazis that have been brought in
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  under paperclip.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  I mean, it's just a disaster, folks.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's a disaster how bad this is.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  But in 1917,
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  the British intelligence
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  working with the U.S. government
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  shipped in
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  100,000 Russian Americans
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  that spoke Russian.
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  You know them as neocons today,
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  because they came back to the U.S.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  when Stalin
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  decades later kicked them back out,
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  kicked Trotsky back out.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  They came here and took over the Republican Party,
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  you know them as neocons.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  By the way, that's the Wall Street Journal.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  You didn't know the neocons were actually Russian communists,
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  but it's too much,
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  the average person.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Reality's just too insane.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  Our government, shadow government,
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  was so evil even then
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  that it ended the takedown
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  of the Czars
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  who were pro-West
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  and pro-U.S.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  And it put
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  the communists in.
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  And Alexander Sholzenitsyn exposed this.
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  I mean, everybody knew this in a liberty movement.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  That the big tax-free foundations
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  were funding communism
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  that trucks by the hundreds of thousands
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  over the decade of the Vietnam War
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  were shipped from
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  Ford and GM factories
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  to Russia,
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  to Vietnam, missile launchers,
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  you name it.
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  I mean, the U.S. the whole time was in Russia
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  helping them build all this.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  That's on record.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  Because again, they couldn't set up
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  as evil base here in the U.S.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  in front of Americans and fund evil
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  and a thing called communism
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  and human enslavement.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  So our own criminal elite
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  that had hijacked our government
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  overthrew Russia that was a monarch
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  kicked out the white Russians
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  as they were known, pro-imperials
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  and then used
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  Russia to export
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  evil worldwide under the name of communism.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  That again, as Sholzenitsyn said
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  shouldn't be called communism.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  It doesn't even exist. It's just evil.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  You shouldn't be anti-communist.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  That implies communism is
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  elemental and part of something.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  No, it should be called anti-anti-human.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  It should be called
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  anti-human exterminism, anti-criminal,
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  anti-terrorist, anti-scum, anti-gang,
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  anti-filth,
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  the elite,
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  the globalist elite,
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  the British Empire.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Not the British people.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  The British Empire model of control
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  behind the scenes control.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Harold Quigley wrote an 1100 page book
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  headed Georgetown Political Science on this
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  called Tragedy and Hope. We sell the book
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  back in print
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  at infowarstore.com. Read it!
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  How they funded Hitler.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  How they funded Lenin and...
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  Oh man, folks, it's so evil.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  So the Russians
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  actually got obsessed in the last
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  25 years with Alexander Sholzenitsyn.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  They got sold on his book.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  So then they said the CIA and others
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  that tried to prop him up. That's why there was the rumor
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  that the fall of the Soviet Union was staged.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  Because it was staged.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  Their people wouldn't go along with it anymore.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  They wanted freedom.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  And so they made a deal with Gorbachev
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  to end it
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  and to put Yeltsin in. But that
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  failed.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  And Vladimir Putin, a secret acolyte
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  of Alexander Sholzenitsyn
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  got control.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  Does he have his own big bank accounts?
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  Does he run around
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  and do all this stuff? Sure.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  Do I trust him? No.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  The point is he's paying people to have kids.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  On national TV
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  they exposed that 9-11 was
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  an inside job that cancer viruses
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  are being put in vaccines. Russian
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  television now, folks, is like this show.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  You understand that?
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Not because it's their plan.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  Alexander Sholzenitsyn
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  influenced them with Thomas Jefferson
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  power. I influenced them
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  and others do. And they've influenced
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  themselves wanting
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  to be free.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Does that mean they're perfect? No.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  But when you've gone through 80 years of hellish
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  evil, when you've been through communism,
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  when you know what evil is,
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  when you know what bureaucracy is,
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  when you know what standing in line to get your food
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  is, clowered in piven,
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  then freedom becomes
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  so sexy and you rebel against
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  the evil.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  Just like the East Germans rebelled
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  and stood down and didn't want to be evil
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  anymore under communism.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Freedom is popular.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  Freedom is sexy.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  We have snow cones in hell.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  We're selling
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  a coat to a man in Siberia, folks.
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  He wants the coat.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  Freedom is good. We have to be ready to win
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  and not just believe
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  that, oh, there's no good. Alex is really
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  this or blah, blah, blah.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  Or we got to have war with Russia.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  They're our enemy. We'll get ahead by defeating Russia.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  No, we won't. The globalists
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  are playing us off against each other.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  And the Russians and the Chinese
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  and others have their own serious
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  problems. And China's in bed with the globalists.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  They're ultra-maximum evil.
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  Not the Chinese people, but I mean,
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  the Chinese government is
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  double-dealing, absolutely
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  one-child policies, forced abortion,
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  new order model. They adopted it.
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  The CIA put Mao Zedong in in
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  49. That was declassified 10 years ago.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  It's even on History Channel.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  I mean, I heard that from the John Burt
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  Society when I was six years old.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  They know. They killed the CIA
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  operative who wouldn't go along with it, John Burtz.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  He tried to lead a group against it
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  and they killed him and a bunch of other operatives.
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  There were rebellions then against doing this.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  Mao killed 84 million people.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  See, our government put Mao
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  in. Our government put Pol Pot
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  in. It's criminals
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  in our government. It's chaos.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  It's Hydra. It's
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  Specter. Why in all these movies is it
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  an octopus symbol that's manipulating
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  all the sides? Because they're telling you.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  Because anyone that knows how this really works
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  understands the octopus is the big
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  private banks that control the issuance
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  of currency and credit.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  It's the Hydra
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  of Greek mythology, the multi-headed beast
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  or the multi-legged beast, ladies
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  and gentlemen, okay? And it only
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  wins by being in the dark and not being
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  exposed.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  And it feeds on human suffering
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  and no-bid weapons contracts.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  Well, why do they
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  want to fund Al-Qaeda to take over
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  Afghanistan so we can invade to get
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  trillions in OPM and trillions
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  in no-bid weapons contracts?
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  Why?
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  Hail Hydra.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  I mean, you go see
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  the new Captain America, folks.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  That's
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  basically what you're dealing with, right there.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  I mean, this is the
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  real deal, people,
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  okay? And the globalists
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  have underground bases. They have all the
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  mitigation plans. They're ready to
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  have a war with Russia.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  The Rand Corporation three years ago came out
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  with a story about it on infowar.com
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  and said to bring in the world government
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  there needs to be something bigger than a regional war,
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  a new world war.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  Maybe they've got back room deals with the Russians
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  and the Chinese and it's staged. I don't know.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  But this stuff can get out
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  of hand, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  You can look up different
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  transcripts and letters from British kings
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  to Norman kings
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  in France going back
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  700 years ago where they say, I'm having
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  uprisings, cousin.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  We need to have a war and staging
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  a war against each other
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  to kill off their own population.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  This has been going on forever
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  and
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  we better transcend it or we don't
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  have any future. We're going to start the next
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  hour, go to your phone calls, but
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  they force the world into trying to
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  leave the dollar
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  as the private fellow reserve
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  devalues the dollar
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  and gets outside countries first.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  Then when Russia and others try to move away from the
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  dollar, as they're under sanctions, they go
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  uh-uh-uh because they want the dollar
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  to die slowly,
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  not have a competing economic system
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  and then bring in the SDR
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  IMF World Bank model.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  Joseph Stiklitz exposed that when the documents came
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  out in 2002.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  So they want to kill the old
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  unipolar financial system
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  and bring in a new
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  Europe
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  unipolar
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  or one.
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  So let's continue here.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  This is what it's really all about
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  is the BRICS summit
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  happening right now in Brazil, the 6th
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  BRICS summit
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  in Brazil
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  here's the headline AFP, BRICS
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  Shake Up Global Economic
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Architecture, a system
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  outside of the IMF and World Bank, the Federal Reserve
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  is the
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  US name of the European arm.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  Here's another one, OECD
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  that's the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  that was the Marshall Plan emergency
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  system they now want for the new European war
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  fears middle-class civil unrest
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  is coming, zero
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  hedge preparing to suppress
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  the population. See, they're not
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  just going to hit Russia, they're not just going to destabilize
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  the Middle East and put al-Qaeda and ISIS
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  in charge, they're going to implode
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  our borders, flood our borders
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  and use that crisis to bring in civil emergency.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  You know it is Marshall law as well.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  Hydro
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  Specter, the New World Order
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  the private megabanks, the 6 megabanks
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  are moving against humanity
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  they've taken over our government
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  they're like the V.C. French, second hour
[57:47.000 --> 58:07.000]  coming up, stay with us.
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  From the water table
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  to our soils
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  to the atmosphere itself
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  our world is becoming more and more toxic
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.000]  each and every day
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  indoor air has been shown to have
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  two to five times higher concentrations
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  of pollutants than even outdoor air
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  inside using toxic chemicals
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  within their homes. There are more than
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  42 million smokers in the United States
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  well over a thousand types of
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  and don't forget the fact that
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  6 million Americans live with pets
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  they're allergic to as well. When I began to research
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  these statistics it was clear to me
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  in order to combat the toxic
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  environment that we cannot escape
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  but that we can fight back against. Made with organic
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  and wild cultivated herbs
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  The new Info Wars live lung cleanse is here
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  with you throughout any toxic environment
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  or by calling toll-free
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  888-253-3139
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  Coast to coast
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  direct from Austin
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  Broadcasting Network
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  deep behind enemy lines
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  the information war continues
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  it's Alex Jones and
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  there's about 7
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  billion 300 million people
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  on this planet and I am the organic response
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  you are the organic response
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  to this tyranny
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  I'm not just going to just be programmed by television
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  and think I watch ESPN all day
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  our own government funds Al Qaeda
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  and ISIS worldwide and tries to start a war
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  with Russia as they devalue the dollar
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  I saw them coming at the Second Amendment
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  taking farmers property
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  that I knew outside Austin
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  to turn it over to groups
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  to then build on it later under the guise
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  of environmentalism I got angry
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  and I'd already studied so much history
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  that I recognized
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  exactly what it was when I saw it
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  flaming totalitarian
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  scientific
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  anti-human garbage
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  scientifically deployed
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  and you can just see
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  the total preparation
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  for an authoritarianism
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  as William Benny
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  number four at the NSA blew the whistle
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  just last Sunday
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  in fact I want to reprint that article
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  I'm doing a taped interview after I want to bring it up
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  with the person that's going to be in there after the show with me
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  for a taped interview
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  very interesting talk we're going to have
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  I'm not going to announce it until later
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  but
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  he said no it's a total plan for total social control
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  for total totalitarianism
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  total domination
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  I kept using the word total
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  total population control
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  totalitarian mentality
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  I mean
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  look bad guys are in control
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  and they always want world domination
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  don't they they always
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  they're going to make it this time why they've got the NSA
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  they've got the predator drones
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  they've got the social engineering
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  they've got ESPN
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  I want to go to your phone calls right now
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  Margaret, Anonymous, David
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  Brian, Richard, Joseph, Zach
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  Matt, Bruce, Bob we're going to all of you
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  Margaret you're the first caller today
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  from North Dakota
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  welcome to the airwaves
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  hi Alex
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  I wanted to talk
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  about everything that's going on
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  in Russia
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  and
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  my brother is married
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  to a
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  lady from Ukraine
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  and her family
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  her family's all still back there
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  and
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  I agree with you about a lot of things
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  but I know a lot about
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  what's going on in the ground in Ukraine
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  and
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  the people that rose up
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  when this all first started
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  they rose up
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  to get rid of
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  the coronavirus
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  because
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  he was one of them people
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  that was stealing
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  money at people's bank accounts
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  he was also
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  pushing them
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  towards Russia rule
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  and they wanted
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  freedom, they wanted what
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  ma'am I try to
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  get that the issue is George Soros
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  is capitalizing
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  I know all the different parties involved
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  the West
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  sees themselves as Europeans
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Western Ukraine, mainly Catholic
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  they were pro-Nazi
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  they're bad people today
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  but they were allies of the Nazis
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  the East is mainly Russians
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  and historically has been part of Russia
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  and so both sides have bad past
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  one of them is Stalinist
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  the other is Hitlerian
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  and the State Department
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  spent $5 billion
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  I can play the State Department
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  a few months ago
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  saying they spent $5 billion
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  to destabilize Ukraine
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  so I'm not saying there's not real beefs here
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  the issue is
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  it's part of a larger destabilization
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  program of the entire world
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  do you see what I'm saying?
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  I've also heard that
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  the Ukrainian
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  military
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  is the one going over the border
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  into Russia
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  and that's not true
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  it's the Russian military
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  from the very beginning
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  has been coming over into Ukraine
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  well wait a minute
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  the Russians did grab their military base
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  their gas lines
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  and any government would do that
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  it's only Crimea though
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  but we've seen the Ukraine
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  shelling into Russia
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  so what I'm explaining man is
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  it's different perspectives here
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  but the globalists are behind it
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  exacerbating it
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  I don't like two roosters
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  I know the two roosters don't like each other
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  I get that
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  but there's a ring with a rooster handler
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  that's who I'm talking about
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  see who's running the show
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  city of Austin tap water
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  versus filtered city of Austin tap water
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  I can taste dirt in it
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  God knows what's in there
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  these people just sampled city of Austin tap water
