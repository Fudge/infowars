[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.000]  Right now I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  John has a long mustache. John has a long mustache.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  But they took a lot of people away. People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  Where?
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  We had education camps. That's what they call it.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of pride idea that kids belong to their parents
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  And we need the type of camps that you all run. I mean, really.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  I'm a sorry citizen. I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  I mean, we've got a lot of consultation with a lot of people that start power weapons.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  Put your gun down, really?
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[02:35.000 --> 02:46.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  that he's mean as a Wolverine.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  Wolverine!
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  Therapists in the U.S. say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  with what they call Donald Trump anxiety disorder.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  Trump anxiety disorder.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  Trump derangement syndrome is clinically real.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  It doesn't merely affect individuals, but entire political parties rendering them unrecognizable.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  One minute. They're perfectly normal. The next. Rapid.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  Families and culture are collapsing.
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern law.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  You can't trust your mother.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  Get the hell out of here!
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  Get the fuck out of here!
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  Your best friend.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  I'll get that camera out of your face.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  The labor. Next door.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says for his clients it started the morning after the election.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder.
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  A number of people are manifesting what I would call post-traumatic stress disorder.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  An overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  Pray it doesn't happen to you.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  Land of the dead!
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  Revit.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  White males.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra-12, the highest quality B-12 you're going to find on the market,
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  sold out for many months, but now it's back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Now, in the next 45 seconds, I don't have time to get into vitamin B-12,
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  but do your own research and realize when it is organic, high quality vitamin B-12,
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  it energizes every other vitamin mineral in your body and all of your hormones and so much more.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  Ultra-12 is incredible.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  You take it out of the tongue, so it's better absorption into your body, and it is a game changer.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  infowarstore.com has Ultra-12 back in stock.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  And despite the fact it's back in stock, despite the fact it's sold out very quickly,
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  it is 40% off for a limited time.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  So at now, fund the info war and experience the purest, highest quality B-12 now
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  at infowarstore.com, or call toll-free,
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  triple-eight, two-five, three-three-one-three-nine.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  Let's take action and get your bottle of Ultra-12.
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  The first year of my registry, the first year,
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  I received an estimate of nearly a decade of employees.
[06:38.000 --> 06:44.000]  We inherited economy from the great, great, great pressure.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  We didn't need people losing their jobs in their homes,
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  but it's even more important we didn't need help.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  The amount of long lines of the state of television
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  people line up all kinds of videos, just to get a box of food
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  in their stomach.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  How could you forget?
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  People were hurting.
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  And we wanted to define what we wanted to do.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  Forget it. Forget it.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  God says in the United States of America,
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  the idea that people will have to wait
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  for hours, hours, hours and a half to get a box of food
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  is a struggle.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  It's a struggle.
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  That has got to be the most insane gaslighting I've ever seen.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  It'd be like if somebody walked up to you
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  and hacked your arm off with an axe,
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  and they started waving their axe around saying,
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  oh, the police, somebody attacked this man with an axe.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  How dare Trump cause these food shortages?
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  How dare he cause this inflation?
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  How dare he cause these gas prices?
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  How dare he cause all these food processing plants to blow up?
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  How dare he cut off all the different resources?
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  Unbelievable.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Now, we have an archivist,
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  and it's not about proving we were right.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  It's about people understanding that the globalists are doing this to them.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  And I want the archivist to go back two years ago,
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  or 26, 27 months ago,
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  right through up until about a year ago
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  and get the clips of where I said when the first world collapses
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  under this designed great reset,
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  because that's what the plan is.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  It's how we know what's going to happen.
[08:32.000 --> 08:33.000]  It's what's so frustrating.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  We have the whole battle plan,
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  and people are just starting to only listen now.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  And I said when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  This is an exact formula,
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  formulae that has been used in the third world
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  and in former first world countries
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  to have the IMF and World Bank come in the last 60, 70 years,
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  pay out their politicians to bring in these policies
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.000]  to implode everything,
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  then they come in and buy it all up for pennies on the dollar,
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  and the country never emerges out of the debt hellhole it's in.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  This is conquest through economic fraud.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  This is what the New World Order is.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  It's what we're now living.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  In 2002, Greg Paulus, back with the BBC,
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.000]  still did some good work.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  Let's get an American journalist, best-selling author.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  We should get him back on the show.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  In fact, get Greg Paulus back on, please.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  He'll come on.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  He's a real liberal, but he may be scared to come on
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  because I'm so right-wing according to the media now.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  He got over 1,000 pages of secret documents
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  when he attended a World Bank, IMF World Bank joint forum.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  It was in Greece, if I remember correctly,
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  and we published some of those documents,
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  and it went super viral.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  Biggest story we'd ever broken up into that time.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.000]  He covered it on the BBC.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  It got almost no attention.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  And in those documents, it's a 100-point plan to come in,
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  buy out the politicians, divide the country along racial
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  and religious lines, and then slowly devalue the currency
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  while the special interests buy up all the infrastructure
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  and hand the debt and the inflation to the people
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  who were then enslaved to the same private central banks
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  that set the policy and then loaned the money to them
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  that was then paid back to them
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  through the money laundering scams.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  And you can look up those documents,
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  infowars.com, Greg Paulus, the IMF riot,
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  things like that will bring up the original documents
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  and articles on info wars.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  I also put a chapter in my book, 9-11,
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  to sit in a tyranny on it as well in 2002.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  So there's nothing more frustrating
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  than having the enemy battle plan.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Here's an analogy.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  Let's say the police are given a diary they find in a ditch.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  And the diary says, starting next month on this date,
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  I'm going to go to this particular, this is hypothetical,
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  I'm not saying I'll do this.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  It's a hypothetical parable, an analogy, a story to illustrate it.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  I'm going to go to this Baptist church
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  and I'm going to shoot everybody in it.
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  And then on this next date,
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  I'm going to go to this Catholic church
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  and I'm going to shoot everybody in it.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  And then on this next date a month later,
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  I'm going to go to this local Buddhist temple
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  and it names the temple and I'm going to shoot everybody in it.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  Well, the police aren't sure what it is,
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  if it's fiction or not.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  Maybe they sent a squad car to the church on the day,
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  but he doesn't see anything.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  He gets a call of a wreck.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  He's got to go to it.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  He leaves and a crazy person goes in
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  and shoots 20 people and leaves.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  Now, do you think the cops are going to pay attention
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  to the next dates at the Catholic church
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  in the Buddhist temple and the Muslim mosque?
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  Yeah, at the next location on the next date,
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  there's going to be 50 police there
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  with snipers on the roof and there should be.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  It's the same thing here.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  We have the globalist blueprint.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  We have the globalist plan.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  They say what they're going to do.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  They're following it exactly.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  And they haven't just attacked one target.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  They said they would.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  They've done hundreds of things.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  They said they would do an exact order.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  And then we're going to just watch the next thing happen.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  And the next thing happened.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  And the next thing happened.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  And the next thing happened.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  And the next thing happened.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  And the next thing happened.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  And that's why I am just pulling what little bit of hair
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  I've got left out of my big fat head.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  Because it is so frustrating to know the formula,
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  the program, how these criminals operate the same
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  over and over again and follow patterns.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  It's basic criminology.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  And they're bragging how they're doing it
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  because they're in charge and they want their minions
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  to be confident about their operations exceeding.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up today speaking of that.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  Big article on infoworse.com by Jamie White.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  It's so damn important.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  I'm going to have it added as another link
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  under the live show feed today so you can't miss it
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  because it came out last night.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  WEEF Debo Summit aims to restore trust,
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  quote, in globalist institutions amid great reset push.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  They know they're in trouble.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  They know they're being exposed.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  And what is their program?
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  Have a global lock-down.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  Start the third world.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  Organize the third world to flood the first world.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  Allow Russia and China to launch their military operations.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  Although West launches its military operations,
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  but globalist above and all, coordinating the different sides.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  They don't control the sides, but they're coordinating
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  because they've got their operatives in key places
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  that have penetrated all the major governments
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  enough to be able to manipulate, in most cases, the outcome.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  Devalue the currencies while they handle the wealth themselves.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  Create massive racial and religious strife.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  Bankrupt the general public so that the main carrying system
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  of the economy and of food production
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  and of transportation and energy collapses.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  Think, Cloward Piven on steroids.
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  And if you don't know what that is, you better look it up
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  because you and I and all of us are living.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  This is life and death information.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  It's like if the police were given a serial killer's battle plan,
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  mailed to the police department.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  A lot of serial killers do this because they like the fun
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  of teasing the system and rubbing people's noses in it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  It's psychotic psychology.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  That's why Gates goes around and brags.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  He says, I'm going to kill all of you for your own good,
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  but also take the shot I want to save you.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And the Zodiac killer would send police letters and clues.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  Imagine if someone just sent you the whole battle plan
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  and said, on this date, I'm going to start killing X, Y, and Z.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  And then on that date, they killed X, Y, and Z.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  You'd start paying attention.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  And that's what I go back to here is we're sitting here
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  knowing what the next shoot-a-drop is.
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  And I really don't want to evacuate to our ancestral ranch
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  in East Texas because they shut down the internet
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  as we know it and bring in the selective internet kill switch.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  And all the carnage that's going to be involved in that.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  Because they want to organize civil war as the icing on this situation
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  in the Western world to be the further system that collapses
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  all confidence in the government and all confidence in the system
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  so they can bring it all down and bring in their new system.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  That doesn't mean the government's perfect.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  It doesn't mean that I defend what it does.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  I want to reform it.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  But they want to burn it all down.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  That's what the great reset is to build back better on it.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  And they live in their armored fortresses and compounds
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  and in their private jets in their 100,000-acre ranches
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and palatial facilities.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  And they are executing this operation.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  And if people aren't aware of the operation you don't have,
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  I don't have a chance in hell.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  But we're going to walk through it all.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  It is a gigantic broadcast today.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  Believe me, you're going to want to hear and see this
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  and you're going to want to share it
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  and you're going to want to resist what's happening
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  because it's only going to get worse until you start standing up.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  To me, there's no choice.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  You don't need to starve to death or stand up and be prosperous
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  and win and make your ancestors proud of you
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  and your progeny proud of you as well.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  We're at the Crossroads. Stay with us.
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is tomorrow's news today,

[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  accurate, real-world information.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  And when it comes to our supplements,
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  they are so game-changing for your body, for your health,

[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  X2 is definitely the most amazing.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  It is the purest, highest quality, atomic iodine you're going to find.
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  and compounds that you don't absorb at all or fully.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  and it's been sold out for months
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  because the supply chain right now is.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  than it goes back to full price.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.

[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  with word of mouth and prayer.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  during their major takeover is because of you.
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[18:15.000 --> 18:16.000]  at cost right now.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  That's just regular plain-chain shirts.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.000]  We used to sell for $40.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  Whatever the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5,
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  We've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  and we've got short sleeves.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  and they're limited edition because
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  We are going to come out with some new designs
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  We've got to sell this to keep Info Wars on the air
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  to your historic apparel now infowarstore.com

[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  Our organic formula is made from high quality

[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  Knockout packs a powerful punch to get you through the night
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  and achieve proper sleep.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Millions of people around the world experience
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  daytime drowsiness but with the rapid speed of life
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  That's infowarslife.com
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.000 --> 20:28.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:36.000 --> 20:47.000]  But it's fear.
[20:47.000 --> 21:04.000]  Look out!
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.000]  Thursday live, Republicans must file articles
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  of impeachment against Biden for cutting off America's energy
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  and obliterating our southern border
[21:14.000 --> 21:21.000]  or they themselves are guilty of treason.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  I am going to start that important analysis
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  and indictment publicly at the start of the next hour.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  You'll want to join us for that.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  Now is the time to move for impeachment
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  and not on the distractionary issues they've used
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  which you can't 100% prove
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  because the courts won't hear it though we have the evidence.
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  Election fraud, making up Russia gay, no.
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  You impeach them on the deliberate shutoff of U.S. energy
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  and the deliberate shutoff of the food supply
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  on record in his own department heads bragging
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  that it's part of a transition.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  We have them.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  You would be impeached.
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  Democrats would be forced to vote for the impeachment.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  Then your argument is, what about Kamala Harris?
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  What about Nancy Pelosi?
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  We'll impeach them too.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  The stinking Democrats impeached Trump twice for no reason
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  but never had the trial of the Senate.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  We have the evidence.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  Their operations were bluffs.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  We can put on the evidence the Great Reset
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  and how they said they were part of the Great Reset
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  and build back better and how it's a program
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  to force us onto the green economy
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  and a program to force us into bankruptcy
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  and force us onto welfare.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  I'll give the analysis hour two.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  You want victory?
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  Now is the time.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  I woke up at 3 a.m. last night
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  when I had these epiphanies and a cold sweat
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  and I normally sleep like a dead emperor
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  and I just got up for like an hour
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  and sat there in the starlight in my backyard
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  and really mapped all this out.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  I think you know deep down to it's the right time for this.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  And this way we can put major heat on Republicans
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  as a litmus test of whether they're patriots
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  or whether they're rhinos or neocons
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  and force them to support the impeachment move.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  It will then illustrate the crimes of Biden and his controllers
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  and it will force Democrats to defend him
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  and hurt them in the midterms.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  It'll hurt neocons and rhinos and Democrats worse.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  If the Republican cowards like Mitch McConnell
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  and others don't do it,
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  well that just illustrates it all the more.
[23:36.000 --> 23:37.000]  So let me just tell you what's coming up
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  and I'll hit it all next segment.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  This is just incredible.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  This is just unbelievable.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  The stack of the economy being shut down by design
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  is just over the top.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  We'll hit that first.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  Then we knew this was going on
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  because I've experienced it and it's been in the news.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  But this huge FBI whistleblowers released all the documents,
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  all the proof, it's just incredible.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  Merrick Garland lied to Congress when he said
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  that they had not given FBI terror tags,
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  anybody protesting critical race theory
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  or pedophile drag queen story time.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  Well now the documents have all come out
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  and it's exactly what we knew was going on.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  This is stuff out of North Korea.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  This is stuff out of East Germany under the Stasi.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  I mean this is on a scale of one to ten.
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.000]  This is a ten.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  I mean this is just illegal as hell.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  We got that.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Then we got the geopolitical news.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  Unbelievable developments in Ukraine
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  and this mainstream news, AFP,
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  it's all being reported by the American military news.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  China surrounds Taiwan in their own words
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  for massive invasion, rehearsal drills,
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  opening up a true front war in Ukraine and now there.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  We got a lot of the big abortion fight news
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  and some good news on that front.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  Managing to oppose Democratic bill,
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  guaranteeing abortion rights as a federal law.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  We have just got so much to break down here today.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  The big free speech fight that is going into overdrive as well.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  It is all coming up today.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  I mean just look at this.
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.000]  I almost came in here today and only covered this
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  because I could spend a whole three, four hours
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  on this enchilada right here.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  You know, the Russians lie.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  Just like any major government does,
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  especially in a war, that's part of war,
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  when they said they weren't going to invade Ukraine
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  and they were.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  We told you back in October the word was they were
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  because we had military sources over there.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  But when they do tell the truth, I'll tell you,
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  and I'll tell you, the Russians lie about 10%
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  as much as the globalists do.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  Just because they know when you lie all the time,
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  nobody believes anything you say.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  You become a clown, not lionizing the Ruskies.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  But this news, it's on Gateway Pond
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  and it's on Info Wars.
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  Ukraine bio update, Ukraine bio weapon update,
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  Russia implicates Pfizer, Moderna, Merck,
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  Obama, Soros, Clinton's, Biden's, Rockefellers and others.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  And I've studied this so much for decades,
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  but the last 26, 7 months of the whole COVID attack plan
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  that I know that everything the Russians said
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  is dead on, if not hardcore enough.
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.000]  In fact, it's not dead on.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  It's about 90% as hardcore as it should be.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  But it's the German documents.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  It's the U.S. documents.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  It's the NATO documents.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  It's the Eco Health Alliance documents.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  It's all the stuff that's already come out.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  And the Russians put out a big report in English and Russian
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  with links to all of it.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  And I went and looked at the links.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  I spent an hour on this this morning.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  It's all real.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  It's all stuff we already covered.
[26:53.000 --> 27:00.000]  But they put out a really nice blueprint of how they did it
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  and how it's part of a biomedical world takeover,
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  just from an economic perspective
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  that'll allow big pharma to take over the planet.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  And the Russians don't even address the fact
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  that they're making us permanently sick with this plan
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  for the biomedical system.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  So they don't go the rest of the way about the population,
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  the rest of the way.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  They just show all the documents of this takeover.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  Powerful report by Kellan McBreen,
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  who's reported this before the Russians did,
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  even before the war started over there.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  Kellan McBreen reported on it before February.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  Right now, Ukraine bioweapon lab update.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  You've got to go read this for yourself.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  RT did a story on it from the angle of Syria scenario,
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  possibly Ukraine, Russia, military warrants.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  Because that's a footnote, or not a footnote,
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  but a subchapter of the report where they explain,
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  just like they tried to set the Russians up
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  with chemical attacks in Syria, which was later confirmed,
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  that was mainstream news confirmed
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  that years after we broke it,
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  because the damn al-Qaeda and ISIS people would brag to get money
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  back home if they showed themselves launching a chemical attack.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  So the West was saying it was the Russians,
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  but the al-Qaeda would film themselves doing it.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  Because again, they'd get millions of dollars back home
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  when everybody saw that, donated to them.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  That's how they go make a living.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  They go get blown up and killed,
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  and their family gets a couple million bucks.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  They launch a chemical attack,
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  they get a couple million bucks.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  And the whole point is they're planning a false flag in Ukraine
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  as a pretext for the US and NATO to openly come into the war,
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  and then we're off the races, World War III.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  So we're trying to stop that.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  But when we come back, what they've done to the economy
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  is even more devastating than I thought it would be this quick.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  They are acting fast to break this country,
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  and if Congress doesn't move with impeachment over this,
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  then they're culpable.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  This is cutting the energy off, folks.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  You can't let them do this.
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  It must stop.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12, the highest quality B12

[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  and on the back it's got a hologram.

[30:16.000 --> 30:19.000]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out

[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt

[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  resistance to the new world order
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  than the Alex Jones was right shirt,

[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  funding the info war.
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  Our immune systems have always been critical,
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.000]  but the globalist era, with all the criminal activity
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  they're involved in, it is more important than ever,
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  to take the tools God gave us
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  and supercharge our immune systems.

[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  Well, so does he.
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  I've been watching and I've been waiting
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  for them to make their move,
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  and now they've made their move,
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  make time, and we're in the fight of our lives.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  I think it's beyond critical for listeners and viewers
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  to realize that you are the vanguard
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  of people that are the most awake,
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  the hope and future of the world lies with you.
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  if you take one of these stories
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  we're going to cover by itself, it's bad enough.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  But when you add all of these concerted attacks together,
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  and then you have the Debo script,
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  the Bilderberg group, the UN, the Club of Rome,
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  the IMF, the World Bank, the XM Bank,
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  and the Big Think tanks, the Carnegie Endowment,
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  the Rockefeller Endowment,
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  admitting their coordinating mesh
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  and admitting they're doing it on purpose,
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  is outrageous that we continue to allow this to happen
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  and I'll talk about how we need
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  to peacefully, legally, lawfully remove Biden.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  Even if he's a puppet,
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  even if they plan that down the road, it doesn't matter.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  It's our duty to engage in justice
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  though the heavens may fall.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  And we cannot survive what they're doing right now,
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  and everybody needs to get that through their head.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  I mean the legislatures and the governors
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  and the Congress, I've got three clips here.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  I didn't even ask for, I'm glad they're there.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  But my point is that these just showed up here
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  because there's so many of these things being said
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  to illustrate my point of man,
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  Biden's kicking his own ass since Senator Kennedy.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  Man, the Democrats are the biggest morons ever, boy.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  They sure are destroying the country.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  They're a bunch of inept fools.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  They're not inept fools.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  Yeah, they're evil, soulless people
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  they put in charge as placeholders,
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  but the corrupt institutions
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  and organizations and individuals
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  pulling the strings are ruthless
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  and are engaged in economic and cultural
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  and spiritual warfare against us.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  And so I'm going to say it,
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  our biggest problem is not the Democratic Party
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  or it's not the Labor Party in the UK
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  or other leftist groups because we know who they are.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  Our problem is people claiming their conservatives,
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  claiming their nationalists, claiming their Christians,
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  claiming that they are capitalists
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  when they are pretending like they're actually fighting.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  And I get why they pretend.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  You actually fight them, your plane crashes
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  like Nigel Farage barely lived.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  The pilot later died.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  They come over to your house and they break your ribs
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  and puncture your lungs and try to kill you and your family.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  And they come to baseball games and try to shoot you dead
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  and put bullets into members of Congress.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  And they sue you and they try to indict you
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  and they lie about you.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  Believe me, I know, I've been through it.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  But I can't roll over to these thugs
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  because it's only going to get worse the more we submit.
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.000]  Ebel has hijacked almost every facet of the corporate system.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  They've got Hollywood 100%, they've got half of Congress,
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  they've got 47% of the states, they've got most of the big cities.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  They are making their move right now before we fully wake up.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  So let me hit these incredible stories
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  and they all tie together and each one is more insane than the next.
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  Gulf State OPEC members sound alarm
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  about dwindling global energy capacity.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  Not the amount of fuel, gas, oil, and refined fuel,
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  but because they're not delivering the capacity,
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  they're being blocked everywhere by the globalist.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  Inflation is more persistent than many have thought.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  St. Louis Fed Chief says, really?
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  Think so?
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  It's up at 8% to 11%.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  Breaking U.S. producer price index,
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  a measurement of inflation reaches 11%.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  The numbers are always a few months behind in April.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  Obviously accelerating upwards.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  Now here's where it gets really sick.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  With gas prices at all time highs,
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  Biden decides to cancel oil and gas lease sales
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  And the head of the Department of Energy says it's part of a transition
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  when we don't even have the electricity capacity
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  if everybody had electric cars.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  They're claiming they're giving you a new system
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  when they're taking the system away and giving you nothing.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  It's like saying this perfectly good boat
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  that you're out in the ocean on, 100 miles from land,
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  in high seas, we're going to sink it
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  and we're going to give you this new boat.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  And you walk over and you go, where's the boat?
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  And they go, it's just right down there in the water.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  Just walk this plank, jump right in the water
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  and the boat will appear.
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  We can impeach this whole group of rats like that.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  They got national polls out where 90% of Democrats
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  said the number one issue is energy.
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  And 90% of Republicans say it's the main issue.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  And 80% and other polls.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  I mean, people are pissed and they get it.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  We don't have baby formula,
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  but $40 billion can be shipped to Zelensky
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  to launder half of it back to the globalist.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  With gas prices at all time highs,
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  Biden decides to cancel oil and gas lease sales
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  So he's already shut them down across the country.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  Now he's intensifying it.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  Real wages fall again as inflation stays near 40-year high.
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  Again, cancels more oil and gas leases as fuel prices skyrocket.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  Biden administration cancels Alaska oil and gas leases
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  in the Gulf of Mexico.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  U.S. suffers under record inflation
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  as draining strategic oil reserves offers only slight reprieve
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  as we prepare to go into huge wars.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  Here's one of the polls.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  New poll finds 80% of likely voters are concerned
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  about high gas prices under Biden and blame him,
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.000]  not the Russians.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  But that's okay.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  Because what do they do every time we talk about this?
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  I see it all over Twitter and Instagram.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  People send it to me.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  I'll make comments about America being angry,
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  people being upset about open borders
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  and the evaluation of currency and exploding pedophilia,
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  and the left just laughs.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  That's all they've got is their arrogant laughing in our face
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  as if that makes us feel belittled and powerless.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  No, it makes us hate you more.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  We got the video of this, but I can barely watch it.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  Biden's incoming press secretary laughs
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  when asked who's handling baby formula crisis
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  and says there is no crisis.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  Let them eat cake.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  That's why there's a joke in the Babylon B
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  starving American babies
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  disguised themselves as Ukrainian soldiers
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  in hopes of getting $40 billion in federal aid.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  The other attacks were under U.S. drug overdose
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  deaths past $107,000 last year.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  Another record.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  But that's okay because Biden's screaming and yelling
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  and blaming Republicans for food shortages
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  when he's cutting off all the energy
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  and the supplies.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  And again, Senator Kennedy says the Biden administration
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  just keeps kicking its own ass.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  Nothing is built, nothing is back, and nothing is better.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  But you do nothing to stop them
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  except say what an idiot Biden is.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  And then Biden comes out,
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  will play the clip here in just a moment,
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  and says Trump is the Make America Great Again King.
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.000]  Funny, he got elected, you didn't buddy with your 2,000 mules.
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.000]  So here is Biden projecting what he is on a Trump.
[41:16.000 --> 41:38.000]  And the Democrats can't even get audio of their speeches now.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  Everything they're doing is mismanagement
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  and fraud and delusion.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  He goes on to say that the U.S. economy is on the brink
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  of depression when he got in.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  No, it was doing pretty well and jobs were coming back.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  Incredible.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  Now, we've covered that.
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  And just let that sink in real good.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  That he shut off more drilling for gas and oil
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  and more leases while he tells you
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  that it's the Republicans, the American people that did it.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Oh, and Vladimir Putin.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  I forgot.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  Oh, oh, by the way, I have another article.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  They're in the news, the Democrats say Marjorie Taylor Greene
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  for complaining about baby formula is a Russian agent.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  That's right, if you don't like there being no baby formula
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  and skyrocketing prices, well, you are a Russian agent.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  Isn't that right?
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  Of course, you didn't get 3.3 million from the mayor of Moscow,
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  like Biden did, but that's okay.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  See, he gets to point his finger at you and talk about what he's done.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  When we come back, the massive FBI leak of them trying to surveil
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  and indict prominent members of conservative journalism
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  and more straight ahead.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is tomorrow's news today,

[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply,
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  and it's been sold out for months because the supply chain right now is.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  than it goes back to full price.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.

[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  that is now available at infowarstore.com.
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today,
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.000]  for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  According to ancient Samoan legend,
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.000]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,

[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[45:17.000 --> 45:24.000]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  than what we're selling these for.

[46:54.000 --> 47:16.000]  And I salute you and thank you. Visit infowarsstore.com today.
[47:25.000 --> 47:32.000]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  We thought a lot about this over a long time as the author of Losing Our Dignity How Secularized Medicine
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  is undermining fundamental human equality.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  He's also a professor at Creighton School of Medicine.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  He joins us tonight.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Professor, thanks so much for coming out.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  I know that you were the first person we thought of when we saw this piece.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  Are we overstating what's happening here?
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  No, and first of all, thank you so much for covering it, Tucker,
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  because it doesn't get a lot of coverage.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  And I think I have to wonder why.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  I mean, violence is something we hear covered ad nauseam.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  Everything today is violence, even things which obviously aren't violence.
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  Yes.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  This is violence. This is medicalized violence.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  Why isn't this being covered? Why aren't we talking about it?
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  Especially when it's poor people, especially when it's working class people
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  who are structurally pushed into that.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  I think that's a question worth asking.
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  Sure. And there's this very difficult problem, which is,
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  what do you do when an economy based on finance starts to go south
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  and average people can't kind of sustain themselves?
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  Do you do guaranteed basic income or whatever?
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  This seems like an obvious choice for ghouls, neoliberal ghouls,
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  like we'll just get poor people to kill themselves.
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  And how many times have we heard from Canada about their health care system,
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  their social care system, talking down to us about so many things?
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  And now it's come home to ruse.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  Canada's policies are seen for what they are.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  And we need, I mean, Canada has their own problems.
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  We need to learn from this.
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  We need to say, look, what's happening to our poor people, to our disabled people?
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  The dementia population talker, which we talked about the early part of the pandemic,
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  is set to double in the next 20 years.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  It's going to triple in the next 30 years.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  What are we going to do?
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  Are we going to put the resources into care for them?
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  If we don't, I really only see two options.
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  So-called robot care or straight up no chaser euthanasia?
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  Yeah.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  So why don't politicians just say out loud now?
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  I mean, so many things we're seeing now, we couldn't have imagined 10 years ago,
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  or five years ago even, and now they're commonplace.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  That's right.
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  Killing yourself is not liberation.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  It's really sad.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  You shouldn't be forced to do it.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  Like, why does nobody say that?
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  Well, your show is an example of giving people a voice who have no voice.
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  The people who are most dramatically impacted by this, the working class and the poor,
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  don't have a voice.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  And so we need to decide.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  And it's so interesting to see the political realignment underway,
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  which party is going to be the voice of the working class,
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  the working and of the poor, to be on the side of people who say,
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  I don't want to die.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  I don't want to die, but I don't see any option,
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  given what's been offered me.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  That's just diabolical.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  It is, diabolical is the word for it.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  You've been writing about this for so long,
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  and thank you for doing that.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  Professor, great to see you.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  Mainstream news in Canada, in Europe, is promoting,
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  basically forcing poor people to kill themselves.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  This is the same globalist eugenics, build back better, great reset party.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  It says they want you to take a shot because they want you to live longer
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  and they love you so much.
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.000]  It's a surprise you found out the shot actually gives you all simers and heart failure.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  These people mean business, ladies and gentlemen, and it's here.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  They're going to cut the world resources off
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.000]  and then force those of us that are productive to go along with the globalist
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  to kill everybody off or ourselves will starve to death.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  This is the sophisticated New World Order plan.
[50:46.000 --> 50:52.000]  It's what my film, Endgame, and I made in 2007, 15 years ago,
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  documents it is the blueprint for global enslavement and extermination.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  I'm about to hit some really important news, obviously,
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  about the internal police state and this incredible FBI leak.
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.000]  I'm going to detail the calls for the impeachment of Joe Biden next hour
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  and hit other news as well.
[51:09.000 --> 51:14.000]  But the wheels went into motion for this a year and a half ago
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  and they finally came in about a month ago
[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  and we put a $300,000 investment down on this and it's amazing
[51:22.000 --> 51:27.000]  and it's here to fund our operation and to make your life better and safer.
[51:27.000 --> 51:34.000]  And that is Made in America, Patriot owned, military grade,
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  means we can sell to the military, fair day cages for small phones, big phones,
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  iPads, laptops, and even big computers.
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  This thing is up to big trash bag size systems and it's 100%.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  Now we've been selling for a long time, more than a decade,
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  inexpensive fair day cages that are about 95% effective,
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  that last a while but tear up pretty quick because they're inexpensive.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  We've sold probably 50,000 of these over the years
[51:59.000 --> 52:04.000]  and these are still available, not Made in America, at infowarstore.com
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  in green, red, black, and blue.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  And they fit small phones and medium sized phones, that's the size that's available
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  and we still have those and they're great.
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, we went out to one of the top companies in the US
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.000]  that supplies US military and we got them to come out with our own line
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.000]  of their product cloned and it is amazing, it is Redux
[52:29.000 --> 52:36.000]  and it's an info wars brand exclusively available at infowarstore.com right now
[52:36.000 --> 52:42.000]  and we've got it in all different sizes.
[52:42.000 --> 52:50.000]  So you want it, you got it, exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  from small phones that will go in your back pocket to systems that will hold,
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  I mean, you know, a couple desktops
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  and then you can travel around, do what you want and not be surveilled by hackers,
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  criminals, big corporations that are out of control, government,
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  they are all available at infowarstore.com,
[53:12.000 --> 53:17.000]  we're going to put manners up at the top of infowarstore.com
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  and I can tell you that we're making about 55% on these
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  so we're not putting a big markup on these
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  from what it cost us to produce these and make these.
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  These are heavy duty, they are amazing
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  and they are what the military uses.
[53:37.000 --> 53:40.000]  I went to folks in army special operations
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  and I said, what does Delta Force use?
[53:43.000 --> 53:48.000]  They said they use this brand, they use this organization,
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.000]  I'm going to leave it at that, and that's what this is.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  This is what the Pentagon uses.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  This is the highest rated at a very, very low price comparatively.
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.000]  You can get something like this made in China for 10% of the cost
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  and if you want to, go ahead.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  If you want to support the broadcast on American Patriots,
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  the Redux brand is available and they got a bunch of bags
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  and a bunch of other stuff that's made overseas
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  and have that made here.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  That's going to be added very, very soon as well
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  but this line is made in America.
[54:17.000 --> 54:22.000]  It's available as low as $19.95 at infowarstore.com.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  It's all there.
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  Here's a little one minute promo we put together detailing
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  and here it is.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  We are now proud to release the Redux line of Faraday bags.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  This line features quick roll down and bell crow seal closures
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  with discreet branding.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  With six different sizes to choose from,
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  they have a signature reduction solution
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  for all of your electronic device needs.
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  Redux specializes in quick access
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  weatherproof nylon Faraday bags
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  with signal blocking Faraday shielding technology
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  specifically designed for electronic devices
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  carried in unsecured locations
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  to instantly block all wireless signals
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  and protect them from remote wiping, tracking and tampering.
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  Redux is dedicated to producing and selling
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  cost-effective signature reduction products
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  for professionals needing to secure devices
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  from wireless threats and more.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  So check out Redux to instantly block cellular Wi-Fi,
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  Bluetooth, RFID, camera, EMP,
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  weather and even GPS today.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  Very proud of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  It's going to have its own website soon.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  It's going to be launched
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  but we put a lot of money into this.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  $300,000 investment.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  It's here and we're betting on you.
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  We're betting on America and it's got everything.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  And listen, this is for good people.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  But even the criminals in 2,000 mules
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  that are caught going to the dropboxes
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  up to 10 or more a day,
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  they weren't covering up their cell phones
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  so they got geo-located and tracked
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  and Vanessa Susan was able to buy that data
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  from the app companies and the cellular providers.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  Everything the contact tracers,
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  everything in the globalist new order model
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  of the future is going to be about you not having this.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  So cell phones are powerful but use it when you want to.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  Be tracked and located when you want to
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  because even when you turn the location system off
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  on your phone, they're still tracking you.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  That's come out in Congress.
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  This is the only way, ladies and gentlemen,
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  it funds the info war.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  It protects you and your family.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  The Redux line to lower your signature,
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  your electronic signature,
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  is now available exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  Protection the Faraday way, great job to the crew
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  and our researchers and our military connections
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.000]  for getting us this.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  We're very, very excited about Redux.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  Protection the Faraday way,
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  or by calling toll free,
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.000]  toll eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  And it took six months to get this manufactured.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  So this is the limited first time run.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  I would imagine these will sell out in a week
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  and then it'll be three months or longer
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  Until we get more, we're going to take all the profit from that
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  and put it into making even more stuff for our own brand
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  and then expanding the products and the things that we have.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  But this is first rate, we're very proud of it.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  It's a 360 win infowarstore.com
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  for your Redux signature elimination programs
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  and we have the good old fashioned cheap ones made in China
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  as well if you want those.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  But we have these now available for you at infowarstore.com.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  Also survival shield X2 and Ultra 12 back in stock,
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  both together, 40% off in a combo
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  and of course X2 is selling out.
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  Here at info wars,
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  our slogan is tomorrow's news today,
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.000]  whether it's politics or health or spirituality.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  We're about bringing you the very best documented,
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  accurate, real world information.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  And when it comes to our supplements,
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  they are so game changing for your body,
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  for your health, your immunity, your libido,
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  your middle clarity, they're incredible.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  And out of all the products, X2 is definitely the most amazing.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  It is the purest, highest quality, atomic iodine you're going to find.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.000]  and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  and it's been sold out for months
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  because supply chain right now is.

[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  then it goes back to full price.

[58:55.000 --> 59:00.000]  Patriot Americana, Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts,
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  ball caps, flags, you name it.

[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  That's just regular plain chain shirts.
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  We used to sell for $40.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  Whatever the shirt costs us, the shirt costs $5.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  We're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  It costs $10 or selling it for $10.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves
[59:28.000 --> 59:29.000]  and we've got short sleeves.
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  and they're limited edition because
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  we're never going to make any of these designs.
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  that will be limited, limited edition in the future.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com.
[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  Here's historic apparel now infowarstore.com.
[59:50.000 --> 59:55.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Conservative states are threatening legal action
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  against the Department of Homeland Security's newly formed
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Disinformation Governance Board,
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  which they said will have a chilling effect on freedom
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  of expression and described it as un-American.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Unconstitutional would be the word I would use.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  Now the good news is that almost all the big tech platforms
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  and they're investing in large teams of people to monitor it.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  While content moderation can limit the distribution
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  of clearly dangerous content, it doesn't go far enough.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  This mega crowd is really the most extreme political organization
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  that exists in American history.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  If it were that simple, it would merely be irony
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  that the Biden administration, led by its chronic serial fabricator
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  in chief, is just a bypass that worthless old First Amendment
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  and set up an Orwellian Ministry of Truth
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  led by esteemed disinformation regurgitator, Nina Jankowitz.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  So what I'm encouraging individuals to do in particular,
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  just your normal average everyday citizen,
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  is to practice informational distancing,
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  where recognizing that disinformation and misinformation
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  often run on emotional manipulation.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  When you feel your emotions rising to just walk away
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  from your device for a little bit, let yourself cool down,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  and then start to consider the source.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  Why does that particular source have an interest
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  in emotionally manipulating you?
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  But we're going to begin tonight with that alleged terror plot
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  and the chilling plan.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  The FBI says it stopped before it could be carried out.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  A plan to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  and then what they were planning to do to her.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Thirteen suspects arrested, including seven alleged members
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  of a right-wing militia group.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  The local four defenders first told you the men charged in the plot
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  to kidnap Governor Whitmer say the men who trained them
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  the entire time were undercover FBI agents.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  Now, a new court filing obtained by the defenders,
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  filed by so-called ringleader Adam Fox,
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  says paid FBI informants were also the ones
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  to come up with the plan to kidnap the governor
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  and attack her summer home.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Jankowitz has praised the debunked dossier
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  author Christopher Steele and vehemently claimed
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  But Jankowitz's manic zealotry is far more complicated
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  than what appears on the surface.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Who do I fuck to be famous at her?
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  I've done everything I can and now the rest is up to you.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Jankowitz's resume reads like a quintessential job application
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  to the Biden-Ukrainian Corruption Corporation,
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  an organization hell bent on New World Order Russia regime
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  change fueled by the fleecing of the American taxpayer.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  In 2010, Jankowitz attended a university in Russia.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  In 2017, she was a Fulbright fellow in Kiev,
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  working alongside the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  She has also served as a disinformation fellow
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  at the Treasonous Woodrow Wilson Center
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  and as supervisor of the Russia and Belarus programs
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  at the National Democratic Institute.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  Republicans are criticizing your decision,
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  the administration's decision to choose Nina Jankowitz
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  to lead this disinformation board.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  They say she is not somebody who is neutral.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Your response?
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  Eminently qualified, a renowned expert
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  in the field of disinformation.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Absolutely so.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Honoring is really quite ferocious.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  It's when a hoax detects the lies and makes them sound precocious
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  by saying them in Congress or a mainstream outfit.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  So disinformation's origins are slightly less atrocious.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  When the department picked her,
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  was the department aware of her TikTok videos?
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Senator, I was...
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  They're really quite precocious.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Senator, I was not aware
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  of those videos.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  What is the endgame for a ministry of truth?
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  No, don't do that. Your door's being kicked in.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  John Bound reporting.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  Do your own research and realize
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  when it is organic, high quality vitamin B12,
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  it energizes every other vitamin mineral in your body
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  and all of your hormones and so much more.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  Ultra 12 is incredible.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  You take it out of the tongue,
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  so it's better absorption into your body,
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  and it is a game changer.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  infowarstore.com has Ultra 12 back in stock.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  And despite the fact it's back in stock,
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  despite the fact it's salt very quickly,
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  it is 40% off for a limited time.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  So act now, fund the info war,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  and experience the purest, highest quality B12 now
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  at infowarstore.com, or call toll-free,
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  triple-82533139.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  Now take action and get your bottle of Ultra 12.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  You have to collapse it.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  So you can build your new system.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  And if you think the collapse of this system
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  is going to be hellish,
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  well, then you haven't studied the New World Order's in-game.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Because we're going to look back
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  on the organized, engineered, planetary collapse
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  that leads us to the year 2030 of their agenda.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  And you're going to look back on this as a cakewalk.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  That's why it's very important to try to stop this
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  as best we can now.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  And that's putting it very, very mildly.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  All right.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  We need to pressure the Republican Party
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  to move for articles and impeachment
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  and to have the hundreds of Republican members of the House
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  and the 47 members,
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  48 members of the Senate
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  to get up and to give speeches,
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  exposing the crimes and the deliberate sabotage
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  of the infrastructure and energy
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  and food production of the United States.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  And they have all the admissions.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  They can play the clips.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  They can show the big blow-up articles
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  where Biden and his controllers say they're doing this
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  to get us off carbon in a transition.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  His energy secretary, his transportation secretary,
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  they're all on record.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  It's not just the right thing to do.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  It is a political supercharger
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  so that Democrats have to come out
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  in favor of no-baby formula,
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  in favor of $6 gas,
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  in favor of devalued massive 11% inflation,
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  in favor of open borders,
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  in favor of their whole agenda.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And the Republicans spend all their time
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  going, we're not Russians
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  and you've been proven to lie in that dossier
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  and we're not Russians.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Everybody knows you're not Russians.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Some Americans don't want a war in Ukraine.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  So stop obsessing on what the people don't care about.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  They care about no-baby formula and $6 gas.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  They care about collapsing borders.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  They care about crime.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  They care about defunding the police.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  They care about old race theory.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  They care about drag queen pedophile story time.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And we have a big enough audience
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  and are influential enough
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  and I guarantee you'll start seeing this the next days and weeks.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  If you call another talk radio shows
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  and if you share this live show today
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  in the archive of it later from Band-Aid video
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  where we lay this out,
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  you will see action in Congress.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  You know, back when the Democrats
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  didn't even have a majority they tried to impeach Trump
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  for things he didn't do
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  it was a way to politically wound him.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And they did it again when they had the majority
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  but didn't take it to the Senate.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  They just impeached him, didn't convict him
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  because they knew they didn't have the evidence.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  But we have the evidence
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  and we have it out of their own mouths.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  I could sit there with Senate investigators
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  or House investigators in an hour
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  and give them dozens of clips
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  of Democrat operative saying they're turning the power off
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  as part of a global debos group
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  great reset build back better program
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  to get rid of fossil fuels.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  And I likened it last hour
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  to we got this good ship in the middle of dangerous high seas
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  that we're all on and the deep state says
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  we're going to sink that ship for the environment.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  You can get in this new ship
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  and you look over the side of the ship
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  there is no ship, there's freezing 30 foot swells.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  There's nothing there but death.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  They never meant to replace it.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  They never meant to upgrade it.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  They've been blocking all the new technologies
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  and only giving us boondoggles that don't work
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  that enrich themselves with money laundering.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  And people say well we'll just get Harris
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  well we'll just get Pelosi
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  well we'll impeach them too
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  one after the other.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  Let's get this party started.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Well Republicans are going to win big in
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  180 days.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And then the Kevin McCarthy's and the Mitch McConnell's
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  will sit there and preside over deals
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  that continue America on its path to globalism.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Their rhetoric just won't be as cheerleading
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  of these events as the Democrats' is.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  I agree with Roger Stone.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  We need a cadre of new pro-America populist
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  cut from the same piece of cloth as MTG
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  and Matt Gaetz and other embattled members of Congress
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  and in Gozer and the rest of them.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  And Jim Jordan and others.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  That'll be a key voting block
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  that will force through a lot of important things
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  and get a lot of things done.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  That's step one.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  But the bigger thing that nobody's talking about
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  and that is not being pushed anywhere
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  is that we can't play politics with this
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  and go boy Biden's sure hurting the Democrats.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  Let's just let him sit there and
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  in fact get the clip of Senator Kennedy
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  and he ready we got it here.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  A clip eight, clip nine
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  where he says the Biden administration just keeps
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  kicking its own ass.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  So they're kicking our ass.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Suicide, drug overdose, crime, murder,
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  carjacking, bankruptcy, insolvency,
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  massive inflation, food shortages.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Everything I told you two years ago was coming
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  because it was in their plan.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  I harped and harped and harped and harped and harped
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  till people told me we're sick of hearing about
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  when the first world collapses and third world dies.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  Well now we're there.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Now people want to talk about it.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  Of course because it's too late now
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  but we can mitigate it.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  So it isn't a question of should we do this.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  We need Joe Rogan.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  We need Tucker Carlson and I'm sure they will
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  and we need everybody else including you
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  to start beating the drum of impeachment
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  and the Republican leadership will try to do it
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  for Hunter Biden's laptop or for foreign money
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  or something.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  That's side issues.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  People get, there's no baby formula,
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  they get five, six dollar gas.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  They get their power bill doubling.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  They get their not being food on the shelves.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  They get being mugged or carjacked
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  or their daughter raped or their son stabbed.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  They get illegals standing on every street corner
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  with no jobs in future.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  They get drag queen pedophile story time.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  They get the whole New World Order
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  build back better agenda and so forth.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Sabotaging the economy for cutting off the gas pipelines,
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  the oil pipelines, for shutting off the new leases,
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  for shutting off drilling in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  and killing the Keystone pipeline and all the rest of it
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  and draining the strategic oil reserves
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  and then buying the oil from Venezuela.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  We have to take action on the rolling blackouts
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  and the rest of the collapse of the US will only accelerate
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  because it's part of a plan to bring us to our knees.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  I don't think anybody disagrees with me on what I just said.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  So, the last thing they want is you to peacefully go to Congress
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  and knock on your congressman or women's door
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  and go in there and talk to them
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  or go to their meeting greets locally
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  or call in the talk radio or send an email
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  or take the archive of this live show today.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Once it's archived, hit man.video
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  and share the daylights out of it.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Or our review yesterday of 2,000 mules
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  that was very powerful that I'm going to give a headline to
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  and post on infowords.com here in the next hour.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  This is imperative.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  You want victory, you want success.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  We politically have them.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  But see, the Republican leadership doesn't want people
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  to impeach folks over economics and over inflation.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  They want to keep it political,
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  just like they did with the Clintons,
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  where they made it about travel futures
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  and the Rose Law Firm and old little or did Clinton
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  get a blow job or did he?
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Because they could isolate it down to that one little story
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  and not make it about the Republican leadership
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  that was going along with selling out all our missile-siggers
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  to the Chinese at the time in the mid-1990s.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  So that's why they want to compartmentalize things
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  down to Hunter Biden's laptop
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  or into abortion, which I think we should restricting it right up.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  But I'm saying they're using it as a football right now.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  No one can deny that.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  And not let them distract us with that
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  and realize we need to get populist Christians elected
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  and take the government over legally and lawfully
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  and put the brakes to everything that's happening
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  as we go over an edge of a cliff.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  So here's the bottom line.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  All these Republicans using distractions
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  and eating around the edges of censorship and surveillance
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  and the reeducation system with the Ministry of Truth.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  That is good cannon fodder.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  It's good red meat.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  But it's not the central issue of the energy being cut off
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  and the border being collapsed by design
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  and the end of Title 42 and allowing human smuggling to happen.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  So we need articles and impeachment on the economy,
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  on inflation, on cutting off the energy, and on the border.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  That will sink him, everyone will unify behind it
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  and we will take the country back.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Those are the issues.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  And I know I'm yelling because this is damn serious.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  We'll be right back to talk about it more.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  Stay with us.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  And we've been getting a lot of crypto donations
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  which is keeping us on here.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  I want to salute all those who know who you are
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  that have been giving the donations.

[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  or whatever it is, whether it's $1,000 or $1,000,000,
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  we will use it to fight the new world order.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  There's dozens of them there.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  infowarsstore.com.

[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  They're totally badass in total victory coming out next week.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  I'll tell you about that later.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  But right now, infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  The real revolution is happening now.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  And all of you that donated, we salute you and thank you.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  I want to thank all of you over the years

[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  with word of mouth and prayer.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  during their major takeover is because of you.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  I just want to thank you all for buying products

[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Don't bother, they're here.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? Isn't it queer?
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  Using my timing this late in my career.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  Send in the clowns. Where are the clowns?
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  There ought to be clowns.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Well, maybe next year.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  All right, my friends, here's what I want to do.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  We have a special guest joining us
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  with all the massive new COVID developments
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  that are so critical to stopping the next lockdown
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  and bringing these criminals to justice,
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Dr. Fleming, next hour.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  But I want to take six, seven, eight phone calls,
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  specifically on impeaching Joe Biden
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  and your ideas on it and what you think of what I've said here.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  So I'm going to give the number out.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  First six, seven, eight callers that get through.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  We'll put those on there and we'll take those calls
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  that are on the board, no more than those,
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  because I don't want to keep people sitting there on hold.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  And yes, people ask, Alex, why do you rant and rave?
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  Well, I mean, I'm pissed off.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  If I went to a football game and yelled and screamed
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  during different plays, people think that was completely normal.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  If I painted my face up and hyperventilated over a football game
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  that does not matter.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  But when we are watching the country by design be shut down
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  and we know what comes next and it's life and death,
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  I'll do anything I need to to get people motivated
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  and get them to awaken.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  But listen, I'm not having to make myself get angry.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  I'm legitimately yelling and screaming
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  because I don't know what else to do.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  You know, I was talking in the first hour
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  of you just joining us about the fact that I talked and belabored.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Yet at Nauseum last year that this is a design collapse
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  and that we would have food shortages.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  And I got up here on air and I told people,
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  you better get ready, this is a plan.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Now I also told you what comes next after that.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  War, cyber attacks, power outages, race wars,
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  martial law, mass arrest, gun confiscation, total destruction.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Because they've been wargaming that and they've been preparing that
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  and the CIA has been admitting that.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  So I'm sorry that the news is scary.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  I'm sorry it's horrifying.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  I'm not going to sit up here and go,
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  oh, look at what a bunch of idiots the Democrats are.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  Oh, we're kicking their butts.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  They're kicking their own ass.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  It's so funny and listeners would love that.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  It'd be a popular show.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  These are the evil puppets.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  These are the clowns that the controllers put in to take the blame.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  So them looking like idiots doesn't mean anything
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  because all they are are functionaries and ceremonial placeholders
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  of the globalist ruining my life and ruining your life
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  and killing hundreds of millions of people with starvation.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  And if we don't do something about it, it's on us.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  So I want to hear specifically from callers on this topic
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  and you agree with me, do you disagree
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  and what are you going to do, what should I do
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  to push this out there and make Republicans know
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  we hold you just as responsible
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  not just for the censorship and not just for the surveillance
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  and not the big things that everybody agrees on,
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  totally open borders, human trafficking by the millions,
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  kidnapped children, inflation and cutting the pipelines
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  and oil drilling off that is causing this.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  They are doing it directly with executive action,
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  haul his ass in there, indict him in the house,
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  try his ugly ass in the Senate
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  and throw his ass out on the street.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  Damn it.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Excuse me, I'm not trying to get...
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  You know what?
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  Listen, we are not going to let them do this anymore.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  It cannot stand, it cannot be allowed to do this.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  I got stacks of articles here from the new FBI whistleblower
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  all confirmed how they spy on the media
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  and are trying to indict all the Republican and conservative leaders
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  and the people in the media
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  and how they were spying and are spying
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  and labeling you as domestic terrorist if you protest critical race theory
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  and drag queen story time.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  That's treason, that's evil, that's wrong,
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  that's third world, that's North Korea, that's cancer,
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  that's despicable and illegal and must stop.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  They think doing all this is to make us roll over in fear.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  You know what? I already did.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  I'm way more scared of letting them win and totally take over.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  And what happens to me individually?
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  The globalists will always threaten us publicly and privately.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Oh, you know we can do this, we can do that.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  You don't think I don't know you're evil?
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  You don't think I don't know?
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Oh, you think I'm doing all this because I think I'm invincible
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  and I'm a narcissist and I'm arrogant like you people?
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  I'm not arrogant.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  I'm not on a power trip.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  This isn't confidence, this is desperation.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  This is duty, this is what I've got to do
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  and it's what I will do.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  But hey, none of you got much longer to wait now.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  You think war is bad, you think open borders is bad,
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  you think 11% inflation is bad a year?
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  You will wake up and you will stand up.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  The question is, will it be when it's too late?
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  Total free number to join is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  2539-877-789.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  Alex, oh and one more thing, first time callers.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Let's do some first time callers.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  First time callers, your chance to call in.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  I'd love to hear from you 877-789-2539.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  Please regular listeners, we love you to death,
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  but give new listeners a chance to chime in
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  and be involved in the broadcast.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  We've got a good chance of meeting us folks,
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  but this is not business as usual.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  So I mentioned how in the first hour,
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  thousands of times I said food shortages collapsed,
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  third world collapsing, flooding us.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  I said we should get the archive as a dig through to show that.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  I guess there was already a video from May 12th of this year,
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  going back over two years,
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  when the first world collapses and third world dies.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  It's on Band-Aid video.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  I'll have this added under the live show feed today,
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  dealing with all of this.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  If you look at the live show feed today,
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  we explained that the impeachment of Joe Biden must start.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  It must be done now.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  It won't make him politically stronger.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  It won't make people rally around him.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  It won't make America unified behind the fact
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  that we know they are deliberately sabotaging our economy
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  every way they can, and that it must stop.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  You will reopen the drilling in Alaska.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  You will reopen the Keystone Pipeline.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  You will reopen those thousands and thousands of leases
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  and other spurs of delivery systems.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  You will do it.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  You will open the gas pipelines.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  You will open the oil pipelines.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  You will do it.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  You understand you miserable piece of filth, Joe Biden.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Try not to blow up here, but these people are...
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  This is war.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  We have them attacking us economically,
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  culturally, attacking us with fentanyl,
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  attacking us with Hollywood evil,
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  and we've got to stand up and say,
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  we are done.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  We are through.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  We are not going to go along with this anymore.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  We're going to come back,
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  and I'm going to calmly take your phone calls
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  and go over more evidence of this.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  But if this doesn't get you to commit to take action
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  legally and lawfully and peacefully,
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  while you're being assaulted,
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  then you deserve what's happening to you.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  They're watching to see if they can get away with it.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Folks, right now they are just rubbing your face in it,
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  trying to bankrupt you and your economy
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  to take full control of you and your life.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12,
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  the highest quality B12 you're going to find on the market,

[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  but do your own research and realize,

[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  minerals and compounds so you don't absorb it
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  at all or fully.

[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  supply chain right downs, but despite that,

[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  than it goes back to full price.

[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  Our immune systems have always been critical,
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  but in this globalist era,
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  with all the criminal activity they're involved in,
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  it is more important than ever to take the tools
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  God gave us and supercharge our immune systems.

[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  So I did it.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be,
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  but thank goodness for prayer
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  Before I set out on a run,
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  I'm going to throw down some TurboForce
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  to give me that energy I need to get going.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  You know, besides the energy, TurboForce,
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  it is giving me the vitamins I need,
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  and the essential B vitamins,
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy,
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorylis.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  So this is great for giving my joints
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  the extra support they need right now,
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  so I can get back to the training.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon,
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  and clarity you need for every day
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  and Sorylis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  And we are back taking your phone calls right now.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  Let's put the full-show headline up there
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  from Infowars.com that says it all.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  We need all hands on deck.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  We need all Americans to, in one voice say,
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  we want Biden impeached for deliberately cutting off
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  the energy system and violating federal law
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  and dissolving the southern border.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  That's the unifier and that's critical to the country.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  Hunter, laptops, all that crap is side issues, okay?
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  Those are political footballs, the Durham investigation,
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  it's going nowhere.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  Thursday live, Republicans must file articles
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  of impeachment against Biden for cutting off
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  America's energy and obliterating our southern border.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  Or they themselves are guilty of treason.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  Period.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  No baby formula, 40 billion for Ukraine.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  Two hours to read the bill on Tuesday.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  It's a pack of criminals up there,
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  but you force Republicans to show that they're not
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  for control on the border and that they're not
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  for stopping inflation and they're not for turning back
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  on the gas and fuel drilling and pipelines.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  This is strategic, this is the heart of the nation.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  They already deindustrialized us, now they're taking
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  our energy away, now they're spying on us,
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  now they're censoring us and taking our speech away.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  And then they're coming for our guns and our children
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  with critical race theory and the transgender garbage
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  and all of it.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  And we have to say, our Declaration of Independence
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  is today, May 12th, 2022, we say no and we say,
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  listen up Republicans, you start the impeachment.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  All we need is good members like MTG and Gozer
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  and Jordan and others to start filing their own articles
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  that have the Senate and it will gain momentum
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  just like when Green out of Texas would file stuff on Trump.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Except here, they would always stop at the Senate
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  because they didn't have any evidence for the trial.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  We won't just indict Biden in the House,
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  we will convict him in the Senate.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  People say, well we don't have the votes.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Basically, Manchin would go with it.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  It's 50-50 in the Senate and it doesn't matter,
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  we will politically force these issues out
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  and get us on the offense.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  So I don't want to hear it from Mitch McConnell
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  and Kevin McCarthy and all those other pieces of filth.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  All right, we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  We're going to go to James in Oregon,
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  James on the impeachment of Obydon,
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  the impeachment of Obama's third term.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  Go ahead.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Hello, thank you for letting me on, Alex.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  I love you personally and I hope you the best.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  Thank you.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  I believe that you should present clips
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  that are under 20 megabytes
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  so that we can get recorded evidence to the Patriots
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  so that they can send them to their communities
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  and their councils and everyone else
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  who they can with time stamps of where they're from
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  so that we can hold them accountable.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  We should put together some 2-3-4-minute videos
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  showing them giggling, how they're cutting the energy off,
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  showing them brag how they would do it
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  and now how they're doing it
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  and now how there's massive inflation,
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  massive shortages, massive energy price increases,
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  massive rolling blackouts, baby formula shortages,
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  everything else.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  And it's only going to get worse in the next few years
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  so we're going to do this now or do this later.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  Yes, and just get those compressed down to 20 megabytes
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  and just spam email them to every member of our government
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  and get it drilled into their head
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  that this fan is committing open acts of treason
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  from bringing in terrorists
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  or siphoning off our energy supplies
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  that we're sitting on
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  and causing us misery and suffering
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  and the Declaration of Independence clearly states
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  that a series of usurpations
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  and powers that control us
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  are driving us to desperation and total despotism.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  It is our right and duty to do so.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Beautifully said, sir, thinking of the call.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  Sylvia is calling from Arkansas.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  She says, Biden impeachment push, everybody's upset.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Yes, he unifies the people to know who's behind it.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Biden is saying the Republicans
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  and that the make America great again crowd
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  are the reason he shut off all the oil drilling
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  and the pipelines.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  It's preposterous, but the media is going to gas like folks with that.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  We have to put his feet to the political fire
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  and his controllers.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  This is the obvious big move
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  on the energy being shut off and on the borders.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  We got them red handed on both.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  That's where we attack.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  That's what we move on, not the stupid laptop.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  Sylvia, go ahead and tell us what you think.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Hi, Sylvia. This is Sylvia, Alex.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  Hey, you stand like you're in full-blown panic vote
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  just like every other American.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  I went out to a local hairdresser
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  and dress shop yesterday locally.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  I'm retired, but I'm expecting a great grandbaby.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  The prices in the local dress shop,
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  they're going up a $4 necklace now is $12.99.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  But the main talk was the baby formula.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  We are all getting into full-blown panic mode
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  and we know, you know, it's the gas prices.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  It's everything.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  But when we hear babies crying,
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  you know, that puts us into panic mode
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  and we're all ready to do something now.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  And so you're on there
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  sounding like you're in full-blown panic mode.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  That's the way we feel out here.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  We're screaming with you.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Let's do something.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Absolutely.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  And I've got articles here even out of USA Today
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  admitting that a record number of Americans are going hungry.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Single parents are skipping meals.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  And again, we know it's designed to only get worse from here.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  It's a plan, so as bad as it is, the reason I'm upset is
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  it's going to get a lot worse
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  and this is being done deliberately
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  and we have to make the Republicans stop doing this
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  and stop being part of this, Sylvia.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  God bless you and thank you for the call.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  Let's take another call now.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Let's talk to Nick in New York.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  Nick, welcome to the Airwaves.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  Man, it's an honor to talk to you.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  Thank you for taking my call. Thank you.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Thank you for everything you and the crew do, man.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Love you. I really appreciate it.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  I love you too.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  We only have two members of Congress on the right
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  that have called out the World Economic Forum,
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Klaus Schwab, it's essentially Marjorie Taylor Greene
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  and Thomas Massey did on Twitter.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  They didn't even do it vocally.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  Nobody knows what's going on.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  We got candy asses all across the board
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  in the Republican Party.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  McCarthy, McConnell on down.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  McConnell just corrupts as they get.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  His wife works for the CCP.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  So we got to start protesting our own party
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  physically holding protests
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  on Donald D.C.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  and protesting our own party.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  We can go to D.C. or whatever.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  And let me back you up, Nick,
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  because you're making great points.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  In Europe, people like Orban went with
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  70-plus percent of the vote being anti-New World Order.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  Bolsonaro, same deal.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  It's true. It's real.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  It's the right thing to do to be an anti-globalist,
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  anti-great reset, build back better person.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  The Democrats all admit their build back better.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  All these other patriot leaders are getting elected
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  around the world fighting. It's popular.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  It's an idea.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  It's going to save hundreds of millions of lives
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  from starvation in the third world.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  It's going to save us from collapse,
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  but the Republicans are quietly on the payroll.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  They won't even address what we're under attack from.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  It's incredible.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  And that's why they hate this show so much,
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  why they hate you.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  It's because if we finally get this out there,
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  their attempted power grab will be their waterloo.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  It'll be their defeat.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Absolutely, man.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  It's a real problem again because we haven't fixed
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  the voter registration rules.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  They've got to be all clean. They're going to fix it again
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  and win it.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  The Trump could use his campaign to educate everyone
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  on the New World Order.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  He needs to call out the World Economic Forum,
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates,
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  all these people, and even Elon Musk.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  Because Elon Musk called for a one-world government
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  at the World Economic Forum this year,
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  according to medium.com or whatever.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  I don't know if that's true,
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  but Elon Musk is for everything there for.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  He's a smarter version, you know.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  Dude, Alex, I love you, man.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  And we're going to win this.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  We're going to win this. We're going to unite.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  The humanity is awakening right now.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  We will rise up and we will win this.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  We have to. Thank you so much for the call, sir.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Great points.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  Let me say this is going to break them up with more calls.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  Think of the arrogance of their just getting started.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  Look how horrible it is.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  But they've gotten away with it in Latin America
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  and Africa and the Middle East and areas of Asia.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And so, I mean, they're doing it.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  I mean, they are really doing it.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  And, again, if you're a new listener,
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  go back two years ago,
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  27 months ago, I laid all this out
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  and said exactly this will happen
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  and exactly this has happened,
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  and then it just gets worse from here.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  And ask yourself, how do I know that?
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  Because the globalists admit
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  their plan, and that's why
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  I keep hammering that
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  over and over and over
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  and over and over and over and over again.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  We're under attack.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  We have to know who is attacking us
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  and what their plan is, and their plan is public.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  To win a war, you have to know
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  who is attacking you and what their plan is.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  We have it. We have them.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  It's easy to defeat. Stay with us.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  The Eugenicists, over 100 years ago,
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  were very public about their plans.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  They financed them as universities.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  They ran full-page stories
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  of the New York Times, other major newspapers.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  That the family, as we know it,
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  is a bad thing and must be ended.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  And the first step in that
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  is getting women out of the household
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  and teaching women that cooking dinner
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  and taking care of their sons and daughters
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  And the first step in that
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  is getting women out of the household
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  and taking care of their sons and daughters
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  making dinner for my daughter,
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  my four-natural daughter.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  But I like to make it as well.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  I love to make breakfast.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  to make food for your family
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  and be nurturative
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  and then all sit down together
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  and have the communal event.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  Evil scientific cult of filth
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  that will domesticate us
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  and turn us into lab rats.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  We cannot let this continue.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  a lot more common these days
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  with everything that's going on
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  both at home and the world at large.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  If you're having trouble getting
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  our new sleep support formula
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  down and out is just the thing.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  liquid formula that is specifically
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  designed to help you get the shut-eye
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  you deserve.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  product knockout with down and out
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  inside are extracted directly
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  into the glycerin solution.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  into the formula before you even take it.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  included is the passion flower
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  which was traditionally used
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  by Native Americans like the Cherokees
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  Be sure to take this product
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  when you are completely ready for sleep

[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  We are sitting here watching
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  powerful economic forces
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  play God on us.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  We say we don't even have a right to live
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  that we are not essential.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  We are watching him starve
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  tens of millions of people
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  every few months to death around the world

[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  on top of normally who dies

[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  for old people and
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  sterilization of children.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  This is an evil cult we're facing
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  of transhumanists
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  and they're using economic warfare on us right now.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  If we don't raise the alarm
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  nobody will
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  and we are and that's why this broadcast is so special
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  that's why I thank you for always spreading the word

[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  but action is what's needed here.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  The world is on the verge of stopping this
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  but we've got to take action.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  We've got to raise the alarm.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  You are the hope.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  Hey, let's talk to Alex, Lewis and Cameron
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  in this segment and then Dr. Fleming
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  is going to join us with
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  massive COVID news
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  and the big developments that are coming out there
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  that are so important.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  They want us to go back to sleep while they ready the next attack.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  I've got Bill Gates on COVID.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  I don't want to be the voice of doom and gloom.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  Yeah, right.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  But the worst is still yet to come.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  That's coming up, breaking news next hour.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  But right now let's go to your calls.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Let's talk to Alex
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  in North Carolina, almost in California.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  Alex in North Carolina.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Go ahead.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Hey, Alex, nice to meet you.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  I've been watching you since
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  1999, kind of dropped off, come back
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  a couple of times.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  Anyway, I've been calling for a couple of weeks
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  and finally got a hold to you.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  I'm glad you got in, Alex. Thank you.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  Oh, right. Thanks.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  I wanted to let you guys know.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  I wanted to get it out there.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  There are some non-believers out there
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  of what's really going on.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  And we're getting hit with it
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  in so many different directions.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  It's hard for people to understand
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  because they can't wrap their head around
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  how many different levels
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  that this attack is coming in on.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  So I wanted to give out a website
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  and it's actually a website
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  that's tracking the food shortage.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  And it's actually
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  being funded
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  by a lot of the elite.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  This is one of them. And you can go on here
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  and actually look at the donors
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  who has actually funded this project.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  But anyway, let me give you the website.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  It's
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  I-F-P-R-I
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000] .org
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  and then COVID-19
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  This is
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  the actual name of the project.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  COVID-19
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Food Trade Policy Tracker.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  When you get on this website,
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  you can actually scroll all the way
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  to the very bottom.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  One, you can look at the donors
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  who has actually funded this project.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Now, what is
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  ironic about this
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  is they are tracking this
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  by K-calories
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  and also by US dollars
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  that's coming or actually being lost
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  in the United States of America.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  So on this front page,
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  one, you can scroll all the way to the bottom
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  and look at the donors and two,
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  at the very top it says to view
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  the tracker, please click here.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  And I don't know if you're following this.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  I can't see your, you know, I can't see your
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  website or not, but anyway.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  Yes, we have it on screen and yes, they admit
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  they use the COVID lockdowns
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  to destroy the world supply chain
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  and that's what they're doing and it's all about
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  the population and it's all about
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  policies in Europe that don't even let people
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  basically farm anymore and in the UK
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  they're paying people not to farm.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  It's about creating artificial
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  scarcity and basically planned obsolescence
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  into the human system
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  to collapse
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  the carrying capacity of the Earth.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  But yes, you're right on target
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  that the New World Order is corporate
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  global governance
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  that create policies that consolidate power
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  and control while they enslave us.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  That's the definition of their
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  New World Order as a corporate world government.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  So I want everybody to get this
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  out there and share it with other peoples
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  for one, for the non-believers
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  that can go here and see exactly
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  what countries are restricted and what
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  by calories and then you can go on
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  here and once you get to the tracker
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  page, you scroll over three
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  times and it says list of export restrictions
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  of food products and once you click
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  on that little tab or whatever
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  it is, you just scroll down
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  and it'll show you the countries that are
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  sitting there, what they've restricted
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  and you tell you the dates and there's been
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  a massive amount of countries restricted
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  since
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  last March of this year.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  So they've been tracking it this 2020.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  That's right. It has nothing to do with COVID.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  It's all the IMF and World Bank
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  of the State Department of Miranda 200
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  starving the world. It is an official plan.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  Thank you so much for the call.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  Powerful call bringing you right to the
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  documents. Thank you, Alex.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  Lewis in Texas, you're on the year.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  Hey, Alex, it's an honor.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  Honors on you.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  Thank you, sir.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  So one of your ads, you say that
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  you think of globalism will be the way to win
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  this info war. It is my opinion
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  that El Paso is the place to do so.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  El Paso in my opinion is ground
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  zero for the globalist takeover of America
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  and they have
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  codified their plans in something called
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  El Paso resilient plan.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Not a lot of people know this, but El Paso
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  was part of this 100 resilient cities
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  plan that ended just
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  days before the mass shooting that happened at
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Walmart. Now I had
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  a chance to interview County judge
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  Samaniego who is the highest
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  elected official here.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  He admitted to me that three years
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  ago before
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  the human care events had really
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  come to light, he was already
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  coordinating with the mayor
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  and the city of El Paso as well as
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  the Catholic Charities who are now
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  in charge of the logistics with
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  regards to this. Oh yeah, it's all
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  UN agreement, NGO controlled
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  all on record. I believe
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  that if people started getting arrested here
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  and there's plenty of reasons why they should
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  be arrested. That's the thing, I mean even
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  the conservative states just arrest the illegals
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  and turn them loose and then the organizations
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  involved in the human smuggling violating law including
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  unaccompanied small children being handed over
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  to random strangers, the FBI did their
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  jobs would be happening, but the law
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  is not being enforced and it is incredible.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  That's why public sentiment plays
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  a really big part in this and I think
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  nationally all eyes have to be on El Paso.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  It wasn't by accident that they sent
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Kamala Harris here to El Paso though
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  it wasn't the main place where
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  volume-wise where stuff was going on
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  there's the El Paso
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  Resilient Plan. It shows how
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  globalists have now been given
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  access to all of our infrastructure.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  The
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  Rockefeller actually integrated
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  a sea level position. It's called
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Chief Resiliency Officer.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  They have been
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  That's right, they call collapsing the border
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  and using your resources to further
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  bankrupt you at a resilience.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  When you hear something smart, it means
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  slavery. When you hear resilient, it means
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  you're not resilient. When you hear sustainable,
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  it means unsustainable. Everything means the opposite.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Lieutenant Governor of New York
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  was just arrested for
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  steering contracts COVID related
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  to people that
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  he had favored.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  That's right, but Biden is allowed to steer it all
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  to his friends. You're a really smart caller
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  these have been incredible calls. Thank you
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Lewis, I got to get to the next person. Powerful.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  Cameron in Texas, last caller
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  in the hour, go ahead.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  I'm a listener and
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  there's some caller.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  I'm a blood wash believer
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  ever since I was really little
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  and I work for
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  the county insurance department
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  and I'm seeing a lot
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  of terrible things regarding
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  with this whole
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  thing that Biden is doing
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  is it's affecting
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  what's happening in the jails as well.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  I mean these people are enticing
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  people with
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  honey buns just to get them to take these shots
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  and then on top of that
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  we have what's going on at the border. Our taxes are
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  funding what's going on. My mind is like
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  completely overloaded and blown regarding that.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  Then you have him in
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  what was it? August,
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  September, admitting
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  that they're going to completely
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  steal the election. So
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I think what we need to do,
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  we need to find some people
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  that have honor and they want to stand up
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  for justice that are left
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  and that's the question, where are they?
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  Who are these people that are going to actually
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  do their job and hold these people accountable
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  one by one? When they start
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  seeing them fall like dominoes, I think the rest
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  will fall in place. Well because
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  the Globalist Control and Justice Department, all this
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  crime is allowed to go on
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  and you're absolutely right. That's why we've got to have
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  state grand juries, other people take action
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  and it's going to happen because
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  we don't have a choice but that's why
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  Colorado has put in over 900
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  district attorneys and county attorneys.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  That's why it's put in 20 plus
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  state attorney generals so they are now
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  creating a totally lawless atmosphere
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  to collapse the country brother. It's very
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  very historic what's happening.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  We're in the middle of the takeover right now.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  It's really the moralizing
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  and as a believer you see
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  where do you go to find true believers
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  that are actually together, worshiping.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  What's happening is
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  not only are they dividing us
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  as a country but they're dividing us
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  spiritually because now they've
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  encroached this new
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  new world ecumenical movement.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  Absolutely
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  and they're just normalizing all of it. They bought
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  off the churches and this is their big move.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  They're making their move. We're living it right now. Thank you
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  so much Cameron. That's why this
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  is the main beacon. I wish we weren't.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  I wish more people were in this hardcore but
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  that's why they hate us the most is we've got their
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  number. We know how to stop them. We have the solution.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  You have the solution and I thank you all.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  Our number three with Dr. Fleming straight ahead.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  This is a
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  new technology that is
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  specifically designed for electronic devices
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  carried in unsecured locations
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  to instantly block all wireless signals
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  and protect them from remote
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  wiping, tracking and tampering.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Redux is dedicated
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  to producing and selling
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  cost effective signature
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  reduction products
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  for professionals needing to secure devices
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  from wireless threats
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  RFID, camera,
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  EMP, weather
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  and GPS today.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  We'll use it to fight the new world order.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP,
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Litecoin, there's dozens of them there.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  infowarstore.com
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  and by the way we've got our own
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  NFTs at Arnaudscam. They're totally badass
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  in total victory coming out next week.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  I'll tell you about that later.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  But right now infowarst.com.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  Ford slash crypto. The real revolution
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  is happening now.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  infowarst.com. Ford slash crypto.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  We salute you and thank you.
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:50.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  on the lies of the new world order.
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  Out of this.
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  In fact people thinking they go along
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  to get along is what has allowed us
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  to get in this position now.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  And the more you submit now
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  the more you're going to be enslaved
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  because this has been the plan stated
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  to cut off your carbon, to cut off
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  your life, to cut off your mobility
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  to absolutely bring you down
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  to a below a third world
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  status and then lower the third world
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  into total starvation.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  This is the globalist plan for total dependency.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  Now the good news is here most people
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  won't starve to death in the US.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  But in the third world it is a
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  sentence and so here's a headline
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  that really gave me an epiphany.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  One in guardian.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  Coronavirus pandemic
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  will cause a biblical
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  proportions
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  between 30
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  and 100 million set to starve to death
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  in the next 18 months.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  Now that's an incredibly
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  deceptive headline.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  The Coronavirus
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Lockdown
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  Coronavirus
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  Lock
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  D-O-W-N
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  I was close to kidding.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Coronavirus lockdown
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  will cause
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  famine a biblical
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  proportions.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Hundreds of millions will starve to death
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  if this global depression really gets kicking off.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  The UN now confirms
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  not 10 million set to starve to death this year
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  30 million
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  set to starve to death.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  But the people who are the saviors
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  that will collect the money and give none of it to the people.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  They'll have a few photo ops.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  I told you 2 million extra
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  were starving to death.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  Now they say it's 30 million.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  Probably more than that.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  But you're not going to have them humanized.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  We need the president to come out.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  We need the president to fly
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  on a jet tour to the
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  poorest area of Latin America and to Africa
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  and in an area of Asia.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  They're starving to death right now.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  It's just like, oh, it's a footnote.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  They say a couple million are starving.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  People die by the thousands every day, malnutrition.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  You just shrivel up and you get a cold and you die.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  And they add that to the coronavirus numbers.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  30 million people
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  are starving to death on top of those
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  who are already starving to death according to the UN.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  Those numbers are accurate.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  30 million people.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  How many have died worldwide from the virus?
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  20 million people on top of the 10 million
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  already starving to death
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  are dying right now.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  These are real people.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  These are little kids with ribs sticking out on them, okay?
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  And my God, the liberals are always like,
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  oh, let's go take abandoned dogs
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  and cats and let's take them in and take care of them.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Okay, great.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  How about we take care of some people?
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  They want you to believe if you leave your house,
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  you're going to die.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  The human civilization will end.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  Billions will start to death.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  33 million are set to starve to death this year.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  Not the 30 million.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  That was a UN release yesterday.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  So this is
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  escalating quickly.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  And on the Owen Shroyer war room yesterday,
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  they had a great graphic. I saw an info wars
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  of a big giant grim reaper
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  next to a baby grim reaper.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  And the baby grim reaper has covered 19.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  He says, hey, you haven't seen what poverty and starvation does.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  I'm the big daddy.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  That's the mission accomplished.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  That's been the globalist plan.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  So while we're losing our liberties and our future,
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  the Third World's losing their lives.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  So those that want to grandstand about,
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  we're saving lives by doing this.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  this is all part of the psychological warfare op.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  But this isn't
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  hydrogen bombs that are being dropped.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  This is cutting off the infrastructure
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  for us here in the First World
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  bringing us to Third World status
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  and bringing the Third World
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  to starvation
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  mass collapse death status.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  So these planes coming in
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  to drop hydrogen bombs are already
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  over the targets
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  and they're already killing
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  hundreds of thousands of people a week
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  are now starving to death
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  according to the UN themselves.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  And by the way, those numbers are accurate.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  But notice it's the UN launching this,
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  cutting off the economy,
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  directing it, our new boss,
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  the WHO, the gold standard.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  But with the other hand,
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  they've got David Beasley, a well-spoken American
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  who probably is a good person going,
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  please help us, we need hundreds of millions of dollars
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  donating right now, everybody's dying.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  So they create the problem
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  and then they have the solution.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  Then I said, well, fine.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  Once all the food runs out, I'll just eat my liberal neighbors.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Knowing they'd pick it up, but they edited it down
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  to one minute.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  I did it to draw attention to the starvation
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  because when the first world collapses,
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  the third world dies.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  And everyone's saying, be a hero.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  The medical workers are heroes.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  It is the purest, highest quality,
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  atomic iodine you're going to find.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  Most other iodine out there
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  is bound to other minerals
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  and compounds so you don't absorb it
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  at all or fully.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  and it's been sold out for months
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  because supply chain right downs.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25%
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  off for one more week
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  than it goes back to full price.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  Experience X2 for yourself today
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  at mfourstore.com.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  X2 at mfourstore.com.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  Take action now.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  There could be this level of corruption in government.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  You shouldn't listen to info wars
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  and bandod video
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  because that's all nonsense
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  and you shouldn't pay attention
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  to any of this stuff.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  It's been very evident
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  to me
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  that all of these people
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  who are being labeled as
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  misinformation spreaders,
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  they are the guys telling the truth.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  There are many thousands of physicians
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  who have been silenced
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  by telling the American people
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  the good news about the situation
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  that we can manage the virus.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  The true misinformation spreaders
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  are the CDC and the public health officials.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  This remains a pandemic
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  of the unvaccinated.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  They are the ones that are propagating this outbreak.
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  The only people you can blame.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  This is a shaming. This is the truth.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  Maybe they should be shamed
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  of the unvaccinated.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  This is the situation of an outbreak
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  and a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  Thisбufferoom combined.
[2:07:28.060 --> 2:07:30.060]  Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime
[2:07:30.060 --> 2:07:31.700]  to lie to Congress
[2:07:31.700 --> 2:07:34.000]  do you wish to retract your statement of may 11th
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  where you claim that the NIH
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  never funded Gaining Of Function research
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  in Wuhan? I totally resent
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  and if anybody is lying
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  here, Senator, it is you.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  We now know that Fauci funded
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  E Singing Health Alliance in New York
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  based in Kuwait headed by Peter Dasick
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:54.600]  engaged and gain a function research to make chimeric SARS-based coronaviruses
[2:07:54.600 --> 2:07:58.840]  which they confirmed could infect human cells. In the worst part all the people
[2:07:58.840 --> 2:08:03.320]  going along and being lab rats for these heartless mega corporations it is
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:08.520]  truly incredible. If only people had the entire story that the COVID shots are
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:12.320]  not conventional vaccines. There are plenty of examples of people that are
[2:08:12.320 --> 2:08:16.760]  having very serious medical conditions that result from the vaccination. When
[2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:22.120]  the convulsions started I knew it had to be from the vaccine. Due to this vaccine
[2:08:22.120 --> 2:08:26.720]  I don't even know if I'll gain full movement and feel like back. One of their
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:30.800]  high school football players died. He had two blood clots inside his brain,
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:34.680]  another on the outside of his brain. The hardest thing was I let him get that
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:49.880]  shot. They got the vaccine. We need help.
[2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:16.800]  Dr. Richard M. Fleming is our guest. He's a cardiologist, nuclear cardiologist,
[2:09:16.800 --> 2:09:21.960]  certified post-itron emission tomography, earth prudes, doctor, law researcher,
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:25.000]  inventor and author. I'm not going to go over all of his inventions or all the
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:28.360]  international programs in 2020 and everything else he's been on. He's a
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:33.240]  frequent guest here at FlemingMethod.com and we've got a lot of big breaking news
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:37.680]  in the month or two. It's been since he's been on. New information on spike proteins,
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:43.280]  covariance, 28 of them. More explanation about how spike protein is not snake
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:48.840]  venom. Excess deaths with and without COVID-19 and inviting Fauci for a
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:54.000]  discussion. And then these numbers out of Walgreens that people that are double and
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:58.400]  triple-vaxxed are way more likely to get COVID and numbers coming out of Europe
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:02.920]  and Israel way more likely to get sick from it and some of those other
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:08.200]  numbers that have come out from the insurance company. So Dr. Fleming joins
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:13.960]  us now to go over all of that data. We could start with Walgreens. We could
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:16.960]  start with the new variants. We could start with their plans for more
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:20.040]  lockdowns. They've already been telegraphing and admitting. Dr. Fleming,
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:24.280]  thank you so much for joining us. My pleasure to be here, Ellen. Thank you for
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:28.840]  the invitation. We need to get updates. This is important. These are crimes against
[2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:33.000]  humanity. It's ongoing and they're planning a second obvious operation. Where
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  do you want to go first? Well, the first place is to let people know that there's
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:45.960]  two basic needs right now. Information, clear, concise, proven information to
[2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:50.320]  which you've received many of the documents on. And the second is a plan
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:54.960]  of action to stop the problems that are currently going on. That is what the
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:59.440]  Crimes Against Humanity tour is about. This was a tour that was put together
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:05.160]  over the last year and a half. And my express goal here is to provide clean
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:11.360]  information that any grand jury, any person, but particularly any grand jury
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:17.480]  convened by a state governor can look at to know that charges should be filed
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:21.560]  against Anthony Fauci and a number of other individuals in the federal
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:28.080]  government for what are crimes against humanity. The gain of function research
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:32.560]  that has been going on for several decades have clearly violated the
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:36.800]  Biological Weapon Convention Treaty, the International Covenant on Civil
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:43.640]  Political Rights, the Helsinki Code, the Nuremberg Code. The federal judge in
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:51.080]  the southern district of Texas ruled in the Jennifer versus Houston case
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:57.520]  last year that Methodist hospital could not be held legally liable for these
[2:11:57.520 --> 2:12:02.040]  criminal actions because they're not a government. And in fact, those three
[2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:07.120]  words, not a government, are critical moving forward in federal court. That
[2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:12.400]  federal judge clearly then stated that a federal government or an individual
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:17.480]  working for the federal government who violates these Biological Weapons
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:21.560]  Convention treaties and informed consent and the rules that were established in
[2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:26.560]  1947 in Nuremberg can be held legally accountable and it's time to hold these
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:31.880]  individuals accountable. If Anthony Fauci and the rest want to provide evidence
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:36.800]  that this gain of function research was not somehow a biological weapon agent,
[2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:42.200]  that they weren't violating the US Constitution under Article 6 which states
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:47.080]  that treaty laws are the law of the land, then he has been given an opportunity
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:53.520]  to do that. I have sent emails to him and he and his office have responded back
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:58.360]  that they're way too busy to do this now on the 19th of June so I have sent emails
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:05.200]  offering the 11th of June or any other time during this tour or at
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:11.080]  any point in time that he wants to have a legitimate conversation because he
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:15.280]  works for the people of the United States and he has an obligation to provide
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:18.600]  evidence to the people of the United States that what is clearly gain of
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:23.400]  function research has not violated these treaties and is not an amount to
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:29.120]  treason. And that's what you professionally should do in
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:32.440]  journalistically and medically. You're reaching out and giving them a chance to
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:36.280]  respond. You'll go out there on these countless talk shows that are financed by
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:40.280]  Bill Gates and spout lies all day and they've now had to admit you so much
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:44.120]  what they said was a lie but the same time their answer is the censor you and
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:49.880]  I and silence the people. Absolutely and the people aren't having anything to do
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:55.480]  with it every time we have taken this information to a test group and ask the
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:14:00.440]  people is there enough information in the video deposition that I've given in
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:05.640]  the book is COVID-19 a bio weapon and in the complaint or affidavit that I have
[2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:10.480]  online is there enough information in here to indict these individuals
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:15.280]  including Anthony Fauci for crimes against humanity every single person has
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:20.320]  said yes now we're waiting for at this point in time is for a state attorney
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:25.080]  general to convene a grand jury to provide this information and to begin the
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:29.960]  indictment process. It's very clear and that decades of research has done
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:35.200]  nothing beneficial for mankind. If we look at the gain of function research
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:40.080]  for this coronavirus and we look at the fact that the vaccines are the same
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:45.200]  genetic code and as you said this isn't this isn't Cobra Venom or Freight Venom
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:49.720]  or anything else you know in the last presentation in Chicago I showed the
[2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:55.680]  the molecular structure of the spike protein and these and snake venom this
[2:14:55.680 --> 2:14:59.880]  is nothing more than smoke and mirrors being thrown out there to confuse people
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:05.040]  and that's that's a great way to cure the system apart and and get people
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:09.720]  confused and more confused meanwhile they're coming out with statement that
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:12.960]  there's going to be a million more cases and we're gonna have to consider
[2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:18.080]  remasking I listened to news media report in the Chicago area they went out to
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:22.680]  the people and said well would you mask back up and the people who a person said
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:27.000]  well of course if we need to do that we will remask up it doesn't take very much
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:30.840]  to manipulate the American people when you have them so stressed and so
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:34.520]  concerned and when you have massive surveillance and censorship of the real
[2:15:34.520 --> 2:15:38.880]  medical establishment warning this is all a giant fraud we've really seen tens
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:42.760]  of thousands of prominent doctors and scientists come out and and really tell
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:47.160]  the truth and be vindicated so now Bill Gates's answer is a censor you even more
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:50.520]  and they now have this new Ministry of Truth are establishing Dr. Fleming please
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:53.000]  stay with us

[2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:18.760]  Dr. Richard Fleming is our guest a renowned medical doctor he's with us
[2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:24.960]  here he's also doctor of medical law and we're talking about solutions we're
[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:29.240]  talking about how to take action to put these criminals on the hot seat they've
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:32.520]  been admitted they backed off their COVID tyranny for now because the
[2:20:32.520 --> 2:20:35.400]  opposition was mounting and they could see they were going to be brought to
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:38.680]  justice so they backed off a little bit but are planning to bring it back that's
[2:20:38.680 --> 2:20:44.640]  what we've got to press the attack bring them to justice be informed and now
[2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:49.800]  that we've had a couple years of these gene therapy injections taking place we
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:53.760]  see the aftermath it's just incredible and it becomes clear and clear what the
[2:20:53.760 --> 2:20:59.200]  larger plan was can you give us the 35,000 foot view here on now is more
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:03.400]  times gone on we're discovering exactly what's happening and then drill into the
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:06.880]  Walgreens data and some of this other just incredible insurance data that's
[2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:12.880]  coming up well the reality is that we just go to the CDC website we get a
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:17.360]  wealth of information back and you probably remember this I have been
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:22.800]  talking since 1994 explaining that when viruses come into the body they will
[2:21:22.800 --> 2:21:27.160]  produce an inflammation and blood clotting or inflammatory response and
[2:21:27.160 --> 2:21:32.160]  that's exactly what SARS-CoV-2 this virus does and when you have that
[2:21:32.160 --> 2:21:36.960]  inflammation of blood clotting and you don't treat it you end up with COVID-19
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:42.080]  now the CDC has done a great job of showing the excess deaths and it's one
[2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:47.320]  of the pieces of information we discuss in this crimes against humanity or if
[2:21:47.320 --> 2:21:52.840]  you look at when those excess deaths occurred due to inflammation blood
[2:21:52.840 --> 2:21:57.200]  clotting and prion diseases as we've talked about with this spike protein
[2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:02.480]  prion diseases like Alzheimer's and other neurologic diseases they are
[2:22:02.480 --> 2:22:06.320]  actually ahead of schedule and the excess deaths followed on the heels of
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:12.080]  masking and every one of the vaccines that has been given to people and if we
[2:22:12.080 --> 2:22:17.440]  look at the world data very clear that the variants there's 28 variants that
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:21.840]  yeah that's a good map if the Ukraine did nothing more for the American
[2:22:21.840 --> 2:22:26.720]  public it established that there's over 15 biological weapons lab in the
[2:22:26.720 --> 2:22:31.240]  Ukraine that the United States is helping to pay for eight of which are
[2:22:31.240 --> 2:22:36.200]  completely run by the US Department of Defense and as I've said before more
[2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:40.760]  than half of the funding for this gain-of-function research has been has
[2:22:40.760 --> 2:22:46.940]  come from the Department of Defense where they have provided experts to
[2:22:46.940 --> 2:22:51.960]  Dasek at EcoHealth and Ralph Beric and Cheez-Ing Lee and University of
[2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:57.280]  Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Texas all over the United States. To be
[2:22:57.280 --> 2:23:01.040]  clear it's not Russian propaganda you reported this I reported this long
[2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:04.120]  before the Russians did but I've seen the Russian reporting about their
[2:23:04.120 --> 2:23:07.520]  Ministry of Defense it's very accurate Ukraine bio lab update Russia
[2:23:07.520 --> 2:23:12.240]  implicates Pfizer, Moderna, Merck, Obama, Soros, the Clintons, the Bides, the
[2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:15.400]  Rockefellers and others from their own documents and then our media just calls
[2:23:15.400 --> 2:23:20.760]  it disinfo like they called the Hunter-Biden thing disinfo it's all
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:25.680]  just right here. If you look at when gain-of-function was clamped down in the
[2:23:25.680 --> 2:23:29.160]  United States that's the time that we really started to escalate it over in
[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:33.480]  the Ukraine it was just another way of continuing the research that they wanted
[2:23:33.480 --> 2:23:37.680]  to do outside of the purview of the American public and attempting to just
[2:23:37.680 --> 2:23:42.760]  circumvent the entire thing if you look at the development of this if you look
[2:23:42.760 --> 2:23:47.520]  at the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines which are not completely
[2:23:47.520 --> 2:23:52.720]  identical but what they do have that match is the prion domain of the
[2:23:52.720 --> 2:23:56.040]  regional binding site that's responsible for these prion diseases
[2:23:56.040 --> 2:23:59.920]  there's no snake venom in them and you don't need that there's enough harm
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:04.720]  being done by these vaccines in and of themselves and what they have done is
[2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:10.360]  they have put pressure on this virus to shift it away from the Wuhan HE1 and
[2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:15.920]  then we saw the alpha the beta the gamma we've seen lambda and mu and I know
[2:24:15.920 --> 2:24:19.440]  these are all Greek letters to people because they are Greek letters three
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:23.400]  delta variants and five amicron variants and we're going to continue to see
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:29.160]  these variants pop up as continued pressure gets placed on these by the
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:34.240]  vaccine if you really look at the world data not my data the world data as
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:37.520]  people are collecting and actually looking at who's been vaccinated who
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:43.680]  hasn't and who's getting thicker what we're seeing are the un unvaccinated
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:46.800]  having the least problems and the vaccinated people having the most
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:51.160]  problems and what we're not seeing is the unvaccinated come down now with these
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:56.280]  massive inflammation and blood clotting and and prion diseases what we're
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:25:01.920]  seeing are people that are by the by the greatest percentage over 45 white
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:05.640]  people coming down with these diseases it doesn't mean other people aren't being
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:09.880]  affected but if we really look at the data objectively this is what's
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:13.280]  happening people so it looks like the so-called vaccine is designed to get
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:18.320]  rid of the boomers before they collect your social security check and or or
[2:25:18.320 --> 2:25:21.640]  become competent enough in the information that they want to come back
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:25.720]  and say wait a minute this is not what I agreed to you know my parents and
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:29.560]  grandparents said we want they wanted a better life for their children
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:34.040]  including me and I've looked at my children and said I want a better life
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:37.840]  for you and the only way that happens is if the American public stands up look
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:42.600]  if Anthony Fauci and the rest of these people can go into a court of law
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:47.040]  and say we didn't do anything wrong then I'm all for that but the way that this
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:52.560]  work is that a grand jury convenes by a state attorney general and we the people
[2:25:52.560 --> 2:25:58.280]  then get to sit there and hear the explanation and this attitude that they
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:02.480]  don't have to take and be held accountable to the American people just
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:07.320]  doesn't cut it for the American people that are recognizing their
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:11.720]  responsibility to their children and their grandchildren it's time to have
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:16.560]  this out in force I totally agree a lot of people are coming to this tour how do
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:20.000]  folks find out about the tour and then just explain you guys using this as a
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  public place to put on the evidence that Fauci and others need to be indicted and
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.680]  then let's see if they can defend themselves in court but yeah I mean they
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:31.160]  brought out an illegal untested thing that they had secretly tested knew what
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:36.400]  it would do even the CDC's own document as you know in October of 2021 excuse me
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:41.000]  2000 said we know it's gonna cause thrombosis we're gonna cause blood
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:44.120]  clots we know it's gonna do this so they knew good and damn well what they were
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:51.720]  doing look the CDC had me over in Greece in 2005 specifically at their request
[2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:57.000]  for me to present a conference in 2005 in Greece on the theory that I laid out
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:00.440]  this inflammation of blood clotting and the way that this could be measured
[2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:05.000]  inside the body so the CDC was completely up to speed on this and they
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.040]  invited me to go over there and give this presentation they can't pretend
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:13.080]  they're unaware of it you know this stuff has been out you know that theory
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:19.520]  was presented originally in 1994 my work looking at this inflammation and heart
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:23.800]  disease was on the same receptor site that choosing Lee was working on with
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:29.360]  HIV glycoprotein 120 when she put that into SARS-CoV-1 to make it more
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:33.000]  infective these people have been working on this for decades they've been
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:36.160]  tracking those of us who've been working on it for decades although I
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:40.640]  certainly wasn't working on a virus I was working on these inflammation and
[2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:43.480]  blood clotting diseases like heart disease and high blood pressure and
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:49.160]  diabetes and cancer and strokes and and the rest of it but they know that this
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:53.000]  is a consequence of this type of infectious agent and they were they've
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.080]  been putting it into people they've been encouraging people to take vaccines
[2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:01.320]  that when you look at the emergency use authorization documents show no
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:05.880]  statistically significant benefit for the people being vaccinated that's right
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:08.600]  so stay there dr. Fleming we got longer segments coming up and I want to
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:11.480]  continue to walk through all this with you and I know you're a scientist you
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:15.440]  just stick with what you can prove now but just as a citizen as a person
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:18.680]  obviously the whole thing's premeditated in my view we can see that
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:24.040]  what's coming next if we extrapolate that out logically what do we expect in
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:28.800]  their plan how's their plan gone how big's the awakening they seem to be
[2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:33.000]  really freaked out right now seems like things didn't go too well for them am I
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:37.400]  being too hopeful there I want to ask your real expert opinion on all this but
[2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:42.720]  not just your medical opinion your legal opinion and your basic citizens
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:47.280]  opinion as a person as a private person what you really think's going on so your

[2:31:58.120 --> 2:32:02.360]  we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if
[2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:06.640]  you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the US government gain of
[2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:11.640]  function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain
[2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:15.080]  of function research involving influenza MERS and SARS virus there's
[2:32:15.080 --> 2:32:19.480]  nothing about SARS like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a
[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:23.360]  stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection
[2:32:23.360 --> 2:32:27.080]  there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:31.280]  it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function
[2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:35.240]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification
[2:32:35.240 --> 2:32:38.840]  research though you know Rand and others you know maybe Fauci was right they
[2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:41.600]  don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function you
[2:32:41.600 --> 2:32:44.720]  know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested
[2:32:44.720 --> 2:32:48.160]  because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the
[2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:52.240]  viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function you're
[2:32:52.240 --> 2:32:55.600]  making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you Mike we
[2:32:55.600 --> 2:33:03.400]  love you leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex
[2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:06.120]  Jones
[2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:24.240]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[2:33:24.240 --> 2:33:30.440]  Dr. Richard and Fleming of Fleming method comm what an illustrative article just
[2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:38.000]  came out from USA Today today North Korea confirms first COVID outbreak him
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:45.120]  orders lockdown so undoubtedly the worst dictator in the world following suit
[2:33:45.120 --> 2:33:49.120]  with the US and China and everybody in Australia and doing what they've done
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:55.720]  this is all a giant planetary martial law drill it's incredibly dangerous Dr.
[2:33:55.720 --> 2:34:00.520]  Fleming continuing here we'll get into all the latest science and the variants
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:05.120]  the numbers when people really need to know that's fact but just as a man not as
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:10.200]  a legal scholar or a medical doctor watching this whole thing witnessing
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:15.360]  the censorship witnessing them lying blocking therapeutics big picture is this
[2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:20.480]  not a giant power grab biomedical system is this not what they talk about with
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:24.920]  depopulation is this not in my view a beta test as Bill Gates is in the news
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:31.720]  saying for something far worse Bill Gates on COVID I don't want to be a voice
[2:34:31.720 --> 2:34:37.680]  of doom and gloom but the worst is coming it just goes on and on these
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:43.760]  people are very predictable and it's like for so long the public's been asleep
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:47.840]  or blind now I'm seeing awakening but is it enough and what do we need to do so
[2:34:47.840 --> 2:34:54.120]  just your 35,000 foot view on what's happening what you see coming look it's
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:57.920]  enough if the American public will actually take action you can't you can
[2:34:57.920 --> 2:35:03.920]  not just expect someone like you or myself to turn the tide on this this is
[2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:08.320]  a requirement of the American people to let their elected officials at this
[2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:12.200]  point in time particularly their state attorney generals know that they want
[2:35:12.200 --> 2:35:16.560]  action taken and they want indictments on these people anything else is not
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:21.080]  going to work if people are going to sit back and not participate in this we're
[2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:27.880]  going to get exactly what what what the lady was told when she approached
[2:35:27.880 --> 2:35:31.880]  Benjamin Franklin said what what form of government have you given us and he
[2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:36.400]  said a republic madam if you can keep it the question is if the people are
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:40.240]  willing to get up and keep it and it's really time the American citizens get
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:45.520]  up and start doing their job as American citizens and as parents you know you
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:48.760]  want to know my personal opinion my personal opinion comes to you as a
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:56.000]  father not not as an individual I have an obligation to my children and this
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:00.880]  entire episode of what we're dealing with with these individuals has to do
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:05.200]  with our children and our grandchildren that's who the commitment is because our
[2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:09.160]  children and our grandchildren are eventually going to judge us for what we
[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:13.800]  did or did not do during these times and Bill Gates has you know this nice
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:18.360]  vested interest now he's with the the World Health Organization and I we've
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:23.000]  gotten this question now asked at the conference of what about this World
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:26.640]  Health Organization and the US involvement with the treaty it's really
[2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:30.840]  important when when people look at that type of information that you go get your
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:36.040]  facts because when we originally signed that and it wasn't done by the entire
[2:36:36.040 --> 2:36:40.480]  it wasn't ratified by the entire covers that document when it was signed in the
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:45.840]  1940s under the last part of it I think it was article 6 of it specifically
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:50.000]  stated that nothing in the agreement to be part of the World Health Organization
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:55.920]  in any way gave the World Health Organization power over the American
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:00.040]  people so that's what was signed and they're going to try to manipulate this
[2:37:00.040 --> 2:37:05.120]  to allow the WHO to take over control of the American citizens that's one of
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:08.240]  the sorry interrupt that's my next question I forgot to get to that early
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:11.040]  on I should have right up front what do you make of this new treaty they're
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:16.360]  writing in secret when they're meeting from the 23rd of the 28th in Switzerland
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:20.600]  and then the leaks of it admit it's a total takeover with big pharma and
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:25.800]  control the UN and and nation-state seating any authority they had left to
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:30.880]  these people I am going to send you when we're done for you to link on your
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:34.840]  program the three pages not even a full three-page document that varies
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:39.280]  specifically states that nothing in the agreement of the United States before
[2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:43.840]  to the World Health Organization entitles the United the World Health
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:48.640]  Organization to take control of the United States they have no authority
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:53.440]  based upon this original document and it's never been relinquished to them
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:57.040]  absolutely let's see you see when it announced to control all rents in the
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:01.080]  country and the Supreme Court said no this is power grabbing at the federal
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:05.840]  level the international level it's all just a giant power grab yeah and and I
[2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:11.920]  guess we'll do constitutional law 101 here as as both a JD and a father the
[2:38:11.920 --> 2:38:16.400]  federal government of the United States is in an agreement with the states and
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:20.200]  that's called the United States Constitution an article 10 states that
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:24.600]  anything not specifically given to the power of the federal government in the
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:29.520]  U.S. Constitution belongs to the state and the people states cannot have
[2:38:29.520 --> 2:38:35.400]  authority that they don't get granted to them unless the people give them that
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:40.400]  power and nobody know the individual citizen of the United States has the
[2:38:40.400 --> 2:38:45.800]  power or authority to tell anybody else that they have to mask up that they
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:51.000]  have to be vaccinated that they can be individually locked down or anything else
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:54.480]  the people don't have that power they cannot give it to the state that the
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:57.840]  states don't have that power they cannot give it to the United States federal
[2:38:57.840 --> 2:39:02.680]  government it's in violation of the U.S. Constitution and that WHO 3D
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:09.040]  specifically states that we signed in the 1940s that it does not does not give
[2:39:09.040 --> 2:39:14.240]  authority to the WHO over the American people and Dr. Fleming should we expand
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:17.880]  on that we should expand on that and point out you're a lawyer but anybody
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:21.400]  can look this up the Tenth Amendment is what you're talking about where it
[2:39:21.400 --> 2:39:26.520]  states that that all powers reserved to the people and it just expands from
[2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:29.760]  there that we're a republic not a democracy and we have Elizabeth Warren
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:33.600]  saying we need the majority today she said to be able to make the minority do
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.080]  things no there's a codified group of rights and all their rights are reserved
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:42.760]  to us they're inalienable and and it's natural law it's it's common law and
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:47.760]  then this is just nothing but pure tyranny yeah it is if they power grab
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:52.920]  that that people in positions of they have forgotten that they are elected by
[2:39:52.920 --> 2:39:57.440]  the people to do the will of the people that's called a republic you know a
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:01.200]  democracy is where every individual is doing something and the American people
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:05.720]  have gotten so lax I know this sounds critical but they've gotten so lax on
[2:40:05.720 --> 2:40:08.880]  allowing the federal government and presuming that the federal government
[2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:12.560]  will just simply do with what's right well there are good people and there are
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:15.920]  bad people on this planet just like there's good politicians bad
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:19.920]  politicians there's good doctors there's bad doctors there's good lawyers there's
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:24.880]  bad lawyers there's good judges and there are crappy judges and what is
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:27.880]  globalism it's a bunch of corporate and governmental chiefs getting together and
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:32.720]  transferring national and independent and local and individual power unto
[2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:36.160]  themselves that that's what globalism of the new world order is is a giant
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:41.520]  transference of power to multinational corporations through the UN they do not
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:45.160]  have this authority I haven't granted them this authority the people that are
[2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:50.080]  picked off if you don't stand up and do something about it you are granting them
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:53.480]  this authority and your children and grandchildren are going to be the ones

[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:49.720]  got this coming Saturday in Phoenix on the 21st of May we're in Houston back
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:53.560]  where I trained as a cardiologist on the 28th of May we're in Minneapolis on the
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:58.120]  4th of June we're in Atlantic City on the 11th of June we're back home in
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:03.160]  Dallas my home and on the 19th of June we're in Tampa where I've encouraged
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:10.000]  dr. Anthony Fauci to come and do a live debate or discussion to defend what
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:15.200]  he's done with gain of function I front and center is getting people to these
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:20.040]  events to learn what they need to hear to give them the knowledge and
[2:50:20.040 --> 2:50:24.640]  information to move forward with this to encourage them to go to their state
[2:50:24.640 --> 2:50:29.840]  attorney generals it doesn't matter which state you're in these attorney generals
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:34.160]  need to be brought to task if there's enough telephone calls enough emails
[2:50:34.160 --> 2:50:38.080]  enough letters sent to them they'll turn it over to a grand jury and let the
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:41.520]  grand jury decide and I guarantee you every one of these attorney generals
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:45.520]  will be able to benefit from being able to look at people and say they were
[2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:50.680]  doing their job that they were elected to do or appointed to do and and that's
[2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:57.400]  part of being an American at this point in time I think it's really sad that we
[2:50:57.400 --> 2:51:03.040]  have better information coming from Walgreens right now than we do NIAID or
[2:51:03.040 --> 2:51:09.240]  the CDC or the FDA let's drill into that more because that mirrors the stuff
[2:51:09.240 --> 2:51:12.960]  out of Israel and out of Europe but they keep lying and saying oh no you get
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:16.240]  protection but from what I've been seeing and many statistics you have higher
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:20.680]  hospitalization death rates especially after a few months with all these
[2:51:20.680 --> 2:51:24.960]  different injections what's really happening dr. Fleming look we're showing
[2:51:24.960 --> 2:51:28.840]  it in in in the presentation that we're doing on the scams against humanity
[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:33.000]  or if you look at what happens to people when they receive the Pfizer and
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:38.560]  Moderna and Janssen vaccines their immune system is suppressed there is a
[2:51:38.560 --> 2:51:42.280]  reduction in the ability to make interferon which interferes with viruses
[2:51:42.280 --> 2:51:46.680]  there is a reduction in T lymphocytes which are the first part of your immune
[2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:51.400]  system that help fight off viruses or bacterial infection there is a reduction
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:56.360]  in T helper two cells which are critical for making antibiotic or
[2:51:56.360 --> 2:52:01.480]  antibodies by your body and when people are given these vaccine shots and then
[2:52:01.480 --> 2:52:07.880]  given another vaccine like influenza they cannot make the type of antibody
[2:52:07.880 --> 2:52:11.480]  response or T cell response that they need to you look at that paper there
[2:52:11.480 --> 2:52:18.880]  these viruses there's pressure on this virus to to mutate to change to get away
[2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:23.280]  you said that two years ago and even mainline scientists have said injecting
[2:52:23.280 --> 2:52:27.280]  people during a coronavirus outbreak with a vaccine is guaranteed to create a
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:31.040]  lot of stuff that's even worse whereas in natural behavior it would become less
[2:52:31.040 --> 2:52:36.280]  worse and the reality is that when you have natural person-to-person behavior
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:40.480]  you're making antibodies and T cell response to all of the virus and it
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:44.960]  turns out that our best immune response to the coronavirus is the nuclear
[2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:49.800]  capsid and what do we have in the vaccines not the nuclear capsid the
[2:52:49.800 --> 2:52:54.920]  spike protein and the spike protein of the original virus Wuhan H you what I
[2:52:54.920 --> 2:52:59.040]  mean this was the most as far as I'm concerned a poorly thought out there's
[2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:02.600]  that there's the chart where you can see when the masking began and the
[2:53:02.600 --> 2:53:07.280]  vaccines began that's when the excess death occurred it wasn't before that and
[2:53:07.280 --> 2:53:11.080]  their inflammation of blood clotting and they're talking about smoking on
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:14.320]  spend some more time on this for TV viewers radio listeners can find it
[2:53:14.320 --> 2:53:18.000]  at phlegmicmethod.com but this is from their own data this is smoking gun
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:23.920]  the yeah this is CDC data now all I did they the green part is the expected
[2:53:23.920 --> 2:53:27.800]  deaths that we see year after year after year and the blue bars or the excess
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:32.200]  deaths that have occurred over the course of time all I did was take their
[2:53:32.200 --> 2:53:36.760]  data and say well isn't it interesting this is when masking began this is when
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:41.440]  Pfizer and Moderna and Janssen and the boosters were started and when you look
[2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:45.680]  at this in every one of these instances with the exception possible exception
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:50.280]  Janssen which started see a slight decrease but we know it produces lots of
[2:53:50.280 --> 2:53:55.200]  blood clotting and with the boosters you see the excess death going up and when
[2:53:55.200 --> 2:53:59.520]  you go a few slides into the into the presentation that we're doing further
[2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:05.440]  these deaths are not due to a pneumonia which is what you would expect from SARS
[2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:10.760]  virus they are due to there you go those are the absolute numbers you see at the
[2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:16.200]  very top minuscule amounts of pneumonious but what you're seeing or the
[2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:22.200]  inflammatory disease is a heart disease high blood pressure diabetes cancer
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:27.280]  strokes and amazingly enough you see the neurologic diseases the prior diseases
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:32.440]  Alzheimer's these are the absolute numbers of excess deaths following on the
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:38.760]  heels of masking and these vaccines the vaccines show no statistical reduction
[2:54:38.760 --> 2:54:45.320]  the EUA document of reducing COVID and the absolute data now shows us that the
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:54:49.920]  consequence of this vaccine program has been the production of every one of these
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:55.720]  diseases these are the excess deaths being tallied by the CDC and I know they
[2:54:55.720 --> 2:54:59.840]  weren't trying to give me information to use in a presentation the keynote
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:03.880]  presentation like this but they did their job and they provided beautiful
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:08.840]  data that shows the consequence of these vaccines and the insurance companies are
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:13.120]  showing the same numbers it's coming out everywhere I mean are they just
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:15.160]  thinking this is going to be hidden in plain view they're never going to get
[2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:18.800]  brought to justice this is this is a giant crime against humanity this is
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:24.040]  Hitler level they have it this is worse than Hitler because Hitler had to
[2:55:24.040 --> 2:55:27.880]  relegate himself to the people that were in prisoner of war camp these folks got
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:32.000]  away with doing this on the entire bloody plan and now they're coming after
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:37.840]  under under five children oh and what about in closing what about all this so
[2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:43.480]  called acute hepatitis popping up in young people that have taken the shot
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:49.200]  and a lot of scientists pointing at the injections take a look and see what the
[2:55:49.200 --> 2:55:54.880]  virus is that causes this hepatitis it's adenovirus and what is the vector the
[2:55:54.880 --> 2:56:00.440]  virus vector being used for the Janssen you know that what people call Johnson
[2:56:00.440 --> 2:56:06.720]  Johnson and the AstraZeneca vaccines as adenovirus the very viral vector being
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:11.560]  used for the Janssen the AstraZeneca or is the virus that's causing these
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:15.840]  hepatitis and you've been vindicated again the warning of blood clots two years
[2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:20.120]  ago now J and J's been pulled for most people over blood clots so we have now
[2:56:20.120 --> 2:56:23.640]  been vindicated but we're censored because we're right and then Bill Gates
[2:56:23.640 --> 2:56:27.560]  is pushed because he's behind it all Dr. Fleming thank you so much one more
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:32.840]  time the website of people to come to this incredibly important tour crimes
[2:56:32.840 --> 2:56:39.640]  against humanity tour all one word dot com they can go there they can sign up
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:44.240]  for to come to an event they can donate if that's what they want to do and they
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:48.240]  can follow along as we give bits and pieces and the Tampa event will be
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:51.840]  livestreamed for people who can't get there otherwise and we're going to go
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:55.680]  beyond Tampa that's right and what you're doing is medical doctors to change
[2:56:55.680 --> 2:57:00.400]  the world thank you so much sir thank you folks we're swinging for the fences
[2:57:00.400 --> 2:57:03.160]  we're fighting as hard as we can taking on the most evil people on earth

[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:17.720]  is the time to not just say Alex Jones was right or you were right or Fleming
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:21.360]  was right but to spread the word like our lives depend on it this powerful
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:25.080]  interview that was just live we're still live we'll be archived at man dot video

[3:00:15.800 --> 3:00:22.760]  transmuting worldwide from the summit.new studios in the united kingdom you are
[3:00:22.760 --> 3:00:27.240]  listening to Paul Joseph Watson
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:33.800]  we're live it is the summit news hour for the 12th of May 22 ton of news to get
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:38.560]  into this hour I'm gonna go down the truth about Nina Jankiewicz this is the
[3:00:38.560 --> 3:00:43.160]  new Ministry of Truth offer the Biden administration there's a lot of
[3:00:43.160 --> 3:00:47.520]  information that's come out over the past week or two about her role about her
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:53.880]  history and even more has come out today forget her wanting to edit your
[3:00:53.880 --> 3:01:00.320]  tweets I've got new information on big sister coming up in the next segment
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:04.920]  also gonna talk about tiktok now censoring viral videos which are
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:10.280]  basically cat videos cat memes oh my god so dangerous which point out
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:16.640]  inconsistencies in the amber heard Johnny Depp trial testimony but of course
[3:01:16.640 --> 3:01:20.680]  why this happened is because Rolling Stone magazine an article saying that
[3:01:20.680 --> 3:01:25.000]  these cat memes were gross and demoralizing they wrote to tiktok and
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:29.360]  said you need to start censoring all this content and they doth the cap and
[3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:36.360]  immediately started deleting videos some of which had 14 million views and were
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:43.120]  removed at the behest of this legacy media outrage campaign of course the
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:47.960]  takeover of Twitter the purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk draws nearer I
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:52.080]  noticed today the mainstream media is panicking and saying oh he could still
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:56.760]  withdraw and pay a billion in compensation fees and it might not happen
[3:01:56.760 --> 3:02:01.880]  it's gonna happen that's still panicking and that's why literally days after they
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:06.680]  hired this Nina Jankiewicz disinformations are who has a history replete
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:11.960]  with pushing actual disinformation because they want to transfer out of
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:17.760]  social media companies being beholden to censoring content and put that power
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:24.000]  directly into the hands of government and in fact earlier today there were top
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:29.120]  people who have been with Twitter for seven years announcing on Twitter that
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:33.280]  they're going to be stepping down here shortly and when you look at the people
[3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:38.920]  who are replacing them they are to say for sure more pro-free speech so we're
[3:02:38.920 --> 3:02:44.760]  going to get into that as well we're going to get into a screeching pro
[3:02:44.760 --> 3:02:51.160]  mask run by a Broadway star Patty Lapone who launched an angry run an
[3:02:51.160 --> 3:02:55.960]  audience member during a Q&A session will point out the hypocrisy behind that
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:03:01.480]  the lockdown advocates the people who religiously pushed for lockdowns last
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:07.080]  summer last winter and now leaving the sinking ship the sinking ship that is the
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:12.760]  narrative of lockdowns being necessary and good for society we're also going to
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:17.360]  talk about this mysterious hepatitis outbreak in Ireland in England in
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:21.720]  numerous countries across the world and the mainstream media is just professing
[3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:26.720]  absolute ignorance as to the cause of it mystery hepatitis illness killing
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:31.640]  children requiring them to have urgent liver transplants and they just say we
[3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:35.360]  just don't know where it came from of course we know where it came from and
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:40.840]  we're going to tell you later on in the show of course Stephen Colbert became
[3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:45.920]  the latest celebrity to catch COVID once again after being at least triple
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:50.760]  vaxed maybe even quadruple vaxed just like Kamala Harris was we're going to get
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:54.800]  into that as well of course he thanked the vaccine for its beneficence and its
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:04:00.880]  great efficacy having caught COVID after being vaccinated huge comments as well
[3:04:00.880 --> 3:04:06.280]  out of Sweden where of course Donald Trump was ridiculed back in 2017 for
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:11.600]  warning other European countries that with the lack of integration of huge
[3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:16.360]  numbers of immigrants coming into Europe over the past 10 20 years there
[3:04:16.360 --> 3:04:21.880]  will be mass chaos riot civil war as we're seeing at least the start of in
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:26.360]  some European countries at the moment now we have the prime minister of Sweden
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:32.320]  coming out as Angela Merkel did back in 2010 and saying that mass immigration has
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:37.280]  failed pretty big comments from somebody who is to all intents and purposes a
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:43.040]  far left leader also going to get into Prince William praising television
[3:04:43.040 --> 3:04:48.000]  producers for inserting propaganda about climate change into their programs to

[3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:55.360]  back don't go away
[3:04:56.480 --> 3:05:03.600]  over the years info wars is produced more than 200 amazing patriot americana
[3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:09.920]  second amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts ball caps flags you name all of

[3:05:54.400 --> 3:05:58.000]  apparel now info or store.com
[3:05:58.000 --> 3:06:13.360]  live from the summit.news headquarters it's Paul Joseph Watson so in both the
[3:06:13.360 --> 3:06:18.440]  United States and the United Kingdom we see the regime the authorities segwaying
[3:06:18.440 --> 3:06:24.000]  their internet censorship agenda out of the actual social media platforms being
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:29.760]  responsible for enforcing that censorship and giving it back into the hands of
[3:06:29.760 --> 3:06:35.760]  government of course we have the online safety bill in the United Kingdom which
[3:06:35.760 --> 3:06:40.240]  would punish not just illegal information posted online but legal
[3:06:40.240 --> 3:06:45.840]  commentary that offends somebody that can be seen to cause quote potential harm
[3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:49.960]  and of course when all the people in control of defining what potential harm
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:56.080]  is think potential harm includes calling a man a man then we're going down a very
[3:06:56.080 --> 3:07:00.400]  slippery slope and we see a similar process in the United States as I said
[3:07:00.400 --> 3:07:06.080]  days after Elon Musk announced that he would be buying Twitter and of course at
[3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:10.320]  first they couldn't believe it they thought someone would intervene there
[3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:15.440]  was a raft of new investigations into Elon Musk's private business to try and
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:20.280]  derail him from doing that well now it is actually happening despite the fact
[3:07:20.280 --> 3:07:24.320]  they're still saying to this day I read an article earlier today oh Elon Musk
[3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:28.480]  could still back out of taking over Twitter purchasing Twitter you don't
[3:07:28.480 --> 3:07:32.920]  have to pay a billion dollars and that's a fraction of his wealth sounds like a
[3:07:32.920 --> 3:07:37.640]  big cope to me and it is actually going to happen despite all their
[3:07:37.640 --> 3:07:43.120]  provocations and their hand wringing Elon Musk is set to take over Twitter
[3:07:43.120 --> 3:07:47.680]  could happen in weeks could happen in months but it is happening and of course
[3:07:47.680 --> 3:07:54.800]  you saw yesterday many people commented on this on Twitter a new policy a new
[3:07:54.800 --> 3:07:59.000]  terms of service that Twitter put out saying that they're not responsible for
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:03.600]  offensive content posted on their platform that it's the sole responsibility
[3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:07.920]  of their users now of course the governments later going to come in if
[3:08:07.920 --> 3:08:12.600]  they get their way through this new disinformation framework and impose
[3:08:12.600 --> 3:08:18.240]  onerous fines on the likes of Twitter and Facebook for information posted by
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:22.600]  individual users which of course will only lead to the censorship ramping up
[3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:27.240]  even further that's their agenda and that's why they're hiring people like
[3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:34.000]  Nina Jankowitz this new disinformation units are under the auspices of the
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:39.880]  Department of Homeland Security now if you look into her history very
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:45.880]  interesting history she seems to have been a failed theatrical performer who
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:50.960]  up until about 2019 was basically going nowhere then she was plucked from
[3:08:50.960 --> 3:08:57.640]  obscurity by left-wing activist groups and was turned into this new disinformation
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:02.680]  czar of course recently in the past few weeks we have a headline here out of
[3:09:02.680 --> 3:09:06.880]  summit news head of Biden's Ministry of Truth previously
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:11.680]  compared free speech to quote fairy dust yes fairy dust
[3:09:11.680 --> 3:09:19.120]  fugazi fugazi fairy dust again what is fairy dust like fairies it's non-existent
[3:09:19.120 --> 3:09:24.440]  so she literally believes that free speech is non-existent and this was
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:29.520]  revealed during testimony about social media censorship in front of the UK
[3:09:29.520 --> 3:09:35.640]  parliament because again she's been this deep-state operative over in Ukraine
[3:09:35.640 --> 3:09:40.800]  pushing this geopolitical narrative for the regime for the past few years and
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:46.680]  she was cited heralded and called to testify by the UK parliament which is
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:51.240]  trying to push this online safety bill which again as I explained in the
[3:09:51.240 --> 3:09:57.080]  previous segment would ban content which quote has the potential to cause harm
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:10:01.880]  and of course the potential to cause harm is basically means the potential to
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:07.600]  cause offence just you know basically 75% of the people who use Twitter and all
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:13.080]  the blue checkmarks who organize the brigading the mob attacks the censorship
[3:10:13.080 --> 3:10:20.040]  are offended by literally everything including stating biological facts now
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:24.080]  during this testimony in front of the UK parliament which was back in September
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:28.080]  last year but nobody noticed it we've linked to the transcript in this
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:33.880]  article she agrees with the people pushing this online safety censorship
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:39.560]  bill that quote misogyny is a crime basically an online speech crime and
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:45.640]  that it should be banned entirely now of course that includes all kinds of
[3:10:45.640 --> 3:10:51.480]  categories not even to mention the fact that online misogyny directed against
[3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:57.240]  women studies have shown 50% of it is posted by other women but they tried
[3:10:57.240 --> 3:11:02.040]  to craft this narrative that there's this big patriarchal conspiracy abuse and
[3:11:02.040 --> 3:11:06.240]  harassment against women on social media including body shaming and everything
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:10.560]  like that so she agreed with the UK parliament people and said that that
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:16.120]  should be banned but she also blasted alternative social media platforms for
[3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:23.440]  supporting quote freedom of expression and fairy dust now in that context of
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:29.520]  course as I mentioned before fairy dust is non-existent it's not a thing it
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:34.960]  doesn't exist she's literally suggesting that not only does she does free speech
[3:11:34.960 --> 3:11:40.840]  made Nina Jankiewicz quote shoulder which also came out a few days ago she
[3:11:40.840 --> 3:11:47.200]  doesn't even believe that it should exist in any form on social media platforms
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:52.080]  just quite frightening given the fact that she's being given all this power to
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:58.080]  dictate what is offensive content on social media platforms as we segue out
[3:11:58.080 --> 3:12:02.920]  of the likes of Facebook and Twitter controlling what is determined to be
[3:12:02.920 --> 3:12:09.040]  offensive and into that being decided by authorities by government which can
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:13.760]  impose onerous fines on both social media networks and individuals and put
[3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:19.160]  individuals in prison for espousing views that they deem to be you know hate
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:23.880]  speech she also said that government connected communications regulators
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:28.760]  such as off-com should quote be able to establish the minimum standards that
[3:12:28.760 --> 3:12:34.280]  would be applied to all platforms and incur fines so again they're transferring
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:39.160]  out of social media platforms being liable and saying you are now liable
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:43.360]  they're basically ripping up section 230 which for a long time the right
[3:12:43.360 --> 3:12:47.480]  advocate had been reformed but in ripping that up and saying that now
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:52.520]  social media operations are not platforms they're actually publishers the
[3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:58.040]  kind of onerous fines which can amount to 10% of the worldwide gross income of
[3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:02.960]  these social media platforms those fines being levied against them or failing to
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:08.120]  remove offensive content quickly enough and of course we've already seen laws in
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:12.920]  Europe already sailed through on this subject now they want to get that
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:19.600]  codified and completely the norm for social media censorship so not it will
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:24.520]  go from people being banned people being censored people being down ranked
[3:13:24.520 --> 3:13:29.120]  ranked in the algorithm to people being directly fined and sent to prison for
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:33.480]  offensive contents posted on social media the censorship will only get worse
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:38.360]  because they'll be under threat of losing 10% of their gross income per year
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:44.360]  if they don't follow these mandates. Jankiewicz also endorsed empowering
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:49.280]  governments to demand data on individual users from social media sites for the
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:52.760]  purpose of implementing further censorship policies and of course
[3:13:52.760 --> 3:13:57.040]  identifying them and then having the police investigate their comments and
[3:13:57.040 --> 3:14:03.200]  of course destroying anonymity on social media she also asserted during this
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:09.040]  testament in front of parliament that social media platforms should utilize
[3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:12.720]  algorithms that would quote allow us to get around some of the free speech concerns
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:17.760]  again get around free speech concerns obliterate free speech by demoting
[3:14:17.760 --> 3:14:24.440]  content so fewer people saw it which again we knew we know happened immediately
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:28.440]  after the election Google Facebook they had all these panicky hand-wringing
[3:14:28.440 --> 3:14:32.200]  meetings where they said oh my god we allowed free speech and Donald Trump won
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:37.480]  we can't ever let this happen again which is then what happened with the
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:42.760]  ensuing social media ban wave and down-ranking shadow banning of people
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:48.280]  on Twitter on Facebook on these other sides now I'm gonna get into the next
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:52.760]  segment and go on to talk about Jankiewicz little bit about Jankiewicz's
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:58.640]  history which people might not know and the fact that she has made a career this
[3:14:58.640 --> 3:15:03.080]  czar of Ministry of Truth's different disinformation under the Department of
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:08.400]  Homeland Security this same woman has made a career out of pushing literal
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:14.240]  disinformation not only with the Hunter Biden laptop story but with a lot more
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:20.520]  which I'm gonna get on to then we're gonna talk about the lockdown agenda and
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:25.240]  how now the rats are indeed fleeing the sinking ship that is the narrative of the
[3:15:25.240 --> 3:15:30.080]  lockdown agenda they tried to reintroduce measures in England a few weeks ago
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:34.480]  they failed once again we've got new World Health Organization figures out of
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:39.840]  Sweden proving that their lockdown their refusal to enforce strict mask mandate
[3:15:39.840 --> 3:15:44.640]  policies was completely successful they have a lower death rate per capita than
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:48.880]  most other European countries I'm gonna play this video of this Broadway star
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:55.120]  engaged in a vitriolic pro mask grant summit.news we'll be back now go away the
[3:15:55.120 --> 3:15:58.440]  average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:04.000]  there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side and the
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:07.920]  globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post human
[3:16:07.920 --> 3:16:11.800]  world for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the Brexit the
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:15.840]  UK nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:19.960]  government that's why they launched their great reset and their program after
[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:25.920]  collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down
[3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:30.840]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:35.280]  guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this
[3:16:35.280 --> 3:16:40.080]  world government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon on us
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:45.320]  now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that
[3:16:45.320 --> 3:16:49.280]  simple they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:53.440]  corporate combine released over 19 and you know the rest of history expose this
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:57.440]  paradigm and we win I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported

[3:19:49.520 --> 3:19:53.320]  with infowar.com big on the back available now for a limited time
[3:19:53.320 --> 3:20:00.200]  infowarstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[3:20:00.200 --> 3:20:06.040]  order it's Alex Jones
[3:20:10.040 --> 3:20:16.040]  broadcasting internationally from the summit.news headquarters in the United
[3:20:16.040 --> 3:20:21.040]  Kingdom it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:20:21.360 --> 3:20:26.640]  now when we talk about this Nina Janko it's individual we have to remember this
[3:20:26.640 --> 3:20:32.800]  is the key point she's vitriolic she routinely pushes misinformation
[3:20:32.800 --> 3:20:38.480]  disinformation the likes of which has literally swung elections she said that
[3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:45.480]  free speech made her shudder she cited Christopher Steele the p-gate dossier
[3:20:45.480 --> 3:20:52.000]  author completely fake completely fraudulent as an expert on disinformation
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:57.120]  that's literally her disinformation hero and of course she called the hunter
[3:20:57.120 --> 3:21:03.440]  Biden laptop story the down ranking of which the censorship of which swung the
[3:21:03.440 --> 3:21:08.600]  election many people will argue because it was artificially buried by social
[3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:13.240]  media networks right before the election it was basically the WikiLeaks in
[3:21:13.240 --> 3:21:18.600]  waiting story if WikiLeaks had swung the 2016 election with their routine
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:23.280]  data dumps about Hillary Clinton this is what would have done the exact same
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:29.080]  thing for Donald Trump in 2020 if it wasn't censored by social media networks
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:32.880]  if major publications like the New York Post were locked out of their accounts
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:39.600]  simply for posting links to this story again now verified after the election
[3:21:39.600 --> 3:21:45.320]  after the damage can't be done by the New York Times she promoted the notion
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:50.880]  that the hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation which of course in
[3:21:50.880 --> 3:21:57.520]  and of itself that is disinformation and of course it came out yesterday we had
[3:21:57.520 --> 3:22:02.800]  the article she also appeared in a zoom call during which two of the
[3:22:02.800 --> 3:22:08.880]  participants I noted were wearing masks face masks in a zoom call again they're
[3:22:08.880 --> 3:22:14.680]  part of the cult that people like her verified trustworthy people with no
[3:22:14.680 --> 3:22:19.800]  agenda whatsoever honestly they're not hyper parties and hacks that have been
[3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:24.640]  proven wrong and bias on every single previous occasion should be given the
[3:22:24.640 --> 3:22:31.400]  power to edit your tweets we have the clip here let's roll it right now and I
[3:22:31.400 --> 3:22:35.080]  am eligible for it because I'm verified but there are a lot of people who
[3:22:35.080 --> 3:22:39.680]  shouldn't be verified who aren't you know legit in my opinion I mean they are
[3:22:39.680 --> 3:22:45.160]  real people but they're not trustworthy anyway so verified people can
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:51.120]  essentially start to edit Twitter the same sort of way that Wikipedia is so
[3:22:51.120 --> 3:22:58.400]  they can add context to certain tweets so just as a easy example not from any
[3:22:58.400 --> 3:23:02.440]  political standpoint if President Trump were still on Twitter and tweeted a
[3:23:02.440 --> 3:23:09.160]  claim about voter fraud someone could add context from one of the 60 lawsuits
[3:23:09.160 --> 3:23:15.120]  that went through the court or something that an election official in one of the
[3:23:15.120 --> 3:23:21.720]  states said perhaps your own Secretary of State and and his news conference was
[3:23:21.720 --> 3:23:28.200]  something like that adding context so that people have a fuller picture rather
[3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:35.280]  than just an individual claim on a tweet so they have it she literally wants to
[3:23:35.280 --> 3:23:40.240]  be given the power to edit your tweets this is somebody who as I will explain
[3:23:40.240 --> 3:23:45.720]  shortly is a narcissist and is a complete control freak which is why she
[3:23:45.720 --> 3:23:51.360]  was given this job of course Twitter already has the power to slap manipulated
[3:23:51.360 --> 3:23:56.880]  media or misinformation labels on tweets but apparently that's not enough she
[3:23:56.880 --> 3:24:00.840]  needs to be given the power personally because she's a trusted individual and
[3:24:00.840 --> 3:24:05.520]  she's totally neutral and not hyper-partisan hack at all to be given the
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:11.640]  power to edit your tweets this is control freak behavior there's another
[3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:18.240]  headline here daily mail Biden's new disinformation are not removed for
[3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:22.920]  apologizing about tweet tweets about masks Biden's new disinformation are
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:28.680]  shared misleading tweets about COVID masks now this was back in the day where
[3:24:28.680 --> 3:24:33.280]  they were telling everyone not to wear masks because they didn't stop COVID which
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:37.920]  was actually true they don't stop COVID there's no scientific study that says
[3:24:37.920 --> 3:24:43.400]  so the virus is five thousand times smaller than the holes in the frigging
[3:24:43.400 --> 3:24:51.280]  face masks but the key takeaway of this is that she is another acolyte of the
[3:24:51.280 --> 3:24:56.840]  regime in terms of the lockdown narrative she put out a tweet freaking out
[3:24:56.840 --> 3:25:02.560]  about the fact that a high school age couple were on a date and they weren't
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:08.000]  wearing face masks or they weren't near enough or far enough away from her she
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:13.120]  said quote they did not stay six feet away from me despite a wide path oh my
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:20.360]  god anyway long story short and this is key to her attitude and her belief
[3:25:20.360 --> 3:25:26.560]  system I think we as a country might be too mmm free spirited to put it
[3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:32.680]  diplomatically to comply with social distancing unless they're forced upon us
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:39.040]  and she goes on to say in this tweet so force away lockers down people are not
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:44.080]  taking this seriously again another insight into her control freak
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:50.880]  narcissistic mindset now there's a video and you can find it on YouTube from
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:59.320]  2015 headline Nina Jankiewicz my simple Christmas wish and again this is a woman
[3:25:59.320 --> 3:26:04.160]  who's basically a failed theatrical performer she got recruited by left-wing
[3:26:04.160 --> 3:26:09.920]  activist groups a few years ago to become this you know disinformations are
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:15.760]  specifically in terms of Ukraine she's in this bar somewhere performing this
[3:26:15.760 --> 3:26:23.400]  song called my simple
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:27:04.040]  if you had asked me all this stuff a year ago about the corruption that's
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:08.040]  going on I would have said you're crazy there's no way that there could be this
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:12.920]  level of corruption in government you shouldn't listen to info wars and band
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:17.600]  dot video because that's all nonsense and you know we shouldn't pay attention
[3:27:17.600 --> 3:27:26.280]  to any of this stuff I've it's been very evident to me that all these people who
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:30.280]  are who are being labeled as misinformation spreaders I mean they
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:34.440]  are the guys telling the truth there are many thousands of physicians who have
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:38.320]  been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:42.840]  this is news I'll briefly lost connection there but I was talking about Nina
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:47.480]  Jankiewicz again so she's putting out tweets complaining about high school
[3:27:47.480 --> 3:27:52.280]  children basically going out on a date and not being six feet away from her
[3:27:52.280 --> 3:27:56.960]  and she goes lock us down we need to lock down harder we need this to be
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:28:02.720]  enforced imposed on us even harder again this is a insight into the mindset of a
[3:28:02.720 --> 3:28:07.360]  narcissistic control free and again I'm gonna come back and talk about this
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:12.440]  YouTube video which again gives another crystal clear insight into her mindset
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:19.320]  and how she talked about other completely verifiable concerns being
[3:28:19.320 --> 3:28:24.720]  disinformation again who gets to decide what is disinformation people like her
[3:28:24.720 --> 3:28:30.480]  who are hyperpartisan hacks who think that any information which contradicts
[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:35.960]  or harms the regime's narrative is disinformation do you see the problem
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:40.240]  there do you see the slippery slope there so we're gonna come back and get into
[3:28:40.240 --> 3:28:46.160]  more explosive revelations about Nina Jankiewicz big sister Biden's Ministry

[3:33:15.080 --> 3:33:34.160]  live from London England it's Paul Joseph Watson with summit.news
[3:33:36.640 --> 3:33:40.720]  so we go back to talk about Nina Jankiewicz the Biden administration's
[3:33:40.720 --> 3:33:47.160]  Ministry of Truth czar big sister again freaking out on Twitter during the
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:54.400]  first lockdown I assume about two high schools on a date not being further from
[3:33:54.400 --> 3:34:00.160]  her demanding that lockdowns go forced upon us quote so force away lockers down
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:05.040]  people are not taking this seriously this woman is a complete control freak
[3:34:05.040 --> 3:34:09.320]  there's a video of her as I mentioned on YouTube Nina Jankiewicz my simple
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:15.040]  Christmas wish and basically it's a song about her wanting to be famous and
[3:34:15.040 --> 3:34:21.000]  powerful and to crush her enemies beneath her feet very revealing insight
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:26.960]  into her mindset and again she's come out with every single on every single
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:34.120]  topic embarrassing negative harmful to the regime's narrative whether it be on
[3:34:34.120 --> 3:34:39.080]  the Hunter Biden laptop story whether it be on COVID and whether it be on CR
[3:34:39.080 --> 3:34:45.520]  T and branded that disinformation as an excuse again to have it downranked by
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:50.640]  the algorithm and buried by social media platforms as a daily male headline
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:56.600]  Biden's new disinformation czar said fears about CRT in Lodone County schools
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:35:02.160]  are disinformation for profit again every single narrative harmful to the far
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:07.600]  left harmful to the Biden administration harmful to the regime is branded by her
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:15.080]  disinformation she's a hyper partisan hack she's not a neutral participant
[3:35:15.080 --> 3:35:19.560]  as Joe Biden's new disinformation czar dismissed concerns about critical race
[3:35:19.560 --> 3:35:24.160]  theory in schools as disinformation for profit despite parents across the
[3:35:24.160 --> 3:35:26.920]  country being worried about the teaching of the philosophy in their
[3:35:26.920 --> 3:35:31.920]  children's classrooms again they launched this offensive they launched the drag
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:38.880]  queen story time they launch all the LGBT grooming in schools in America they
[3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:43.280]  do it they throw it in your face then when you complain about it they say it
[3:35:43.280 --> 3:35:48.320]  doesn't exist meanwhile they're literally putting parents on DHS government
[3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:52.520]  threat level terror alert lists because they complained about this kind of
[3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:57.880]  thing while publicly in their media hit pieces and in the commentary saying none
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:04.240]  of it exists it's absolutely incredible this is the woman being given power to
[3:36:04.240 --> 3:36:09.280]  control free speech on social media in the aftermath of them freaking out about
[3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:15.720]  Elon Musk purchasing Twitter itself New York Post reports Stephen King blasted
[3:36:15.720 --> 3:36:20.240]  for supporting Biden disinformation czar Nina Jankiewicz now you know when
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:25.680]  somebody who has as vehement as Stephen King in being a mouthpiece an organ of
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:30.840]  propaganda for the regime comes out and defends her then you know that she's
[3:36:30.840 --> 3:36:35.640]  really getting some flack from the right people from the right direction and
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:40.000]  that they're panicking about it says master of horror Stephen King was
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:44.560]  blasted on social media over his support for new White House disinformation
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:48.160]  czar Nina Jankiewicz with one lawmaker calling it the scariest thing he's ever
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:54.440]  written he basically said quote I stand with Nina Jankiewicz very interesting
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:37:01.640]  commentary tweet from an author to publicly back the Ministry of Truth
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:07.920]  disinformation czar for the Department of Homeland Security doesn't really seem
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:13.160]  like a subject that an author should insert himself into seems a bit obscure
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:19.760]  doesn't it and yet he's doing it anyway one person responded says this was
[3:37:19.760 --> 3:37:23.360]  Carmen severe he said author stands against free speech but when a
[3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:26.840]  Republican becomes president and it will happen again then we will see where
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:30.680]  all these liberals stand on the disinformation governance board oh yeah
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:37.400]  I remember under Bush with the terror threat levels the color coding everything
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:40.760]  that the Department of Homeland Security did under the Bush administration
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:47.600]  was creepy was dystopian was Orwellian the left hated it and I supported them
[3:37:47.600 --> 3:37:52.920]  in hating it because it was but as soon as it's happening under Biden oh it's
[3:37:52.920 --> 3:37:59.200]  just content moderation that ridiculous euphemism they use over and over again
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:07.120]  when it's censorship brazen as winning journalist Glenn Greenwald also joined in
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:11.400]  on the criticism calling Jankiewicz a despotic imbecile a cartoon figure
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:17.720]  spouting non-stop lies and he also made the point that it's pretty creepy for
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:23.120]  Stephen King to insert himself into it he said but even if she weren't even if
[3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:26.960]  she were phenomenal what kind of person proudly stands with the head of a
[3:38:26.960 --> 3:38:30.960]  disinformation board inside the Department of Homeland Security yeah
[3:38:30.960 --> 3:38:37.480]  some what strange meanwhile FDA chief claims misinformation is the leading
[3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:41.920]  course of death in the United States forget about cancer forget about heart
[3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:48.320]  disease now it's somebody posting on Twitter about vaccines during an
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:53.120]  appearance on CNN FDA chief dr. Robert Califf asserted that the leading cause of
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:57.920]  death in the United States is online misinformation he didn't provide any
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:02.600]  evidence of that didn't give any examples didn't break down any statistics
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:10.240]  he just said it and it was repeated ad infinitum meanwhile tiktok sensors viral
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:14.880]  videos alleging inconsistencies in amber heard testimony basically what
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:21.920]  happened tiktok which is one of the fastest growing if not basically bigger
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:27.040]  than Twitter now from the last numbers I saw the most vehement in terms of
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:31.920]  censorship try starting a tiktok account as somebody on the right of
[3:39:31.920 --> 3:39:37.560]  politics you ain't gonna last very long they use the old system which some
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:42.360]  YouTube used back a few years ago basically means if a bunch if a mob mass
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:47.160]  reports a video it gets deleted immediately and now Rolling Stone wrote
[3:39:47.160 --> 3:39:52.800]  a whining hit piece trying to defend amber heard and it was headlined
[3:39:52.800 --> 3:39:57.800]  demoralizing and demeaning a gross tiktok trend mocking amber heard is going
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:03.200]  viral what was this demoralizing and demeaning gross tiktok trend well
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:08.680]  basically the biggest thing they were angry about is a cat meme video yes
[3:40:08.680 --> 3:40:14.120]  somebody created a cat meme video with one cat wearing a blonde wig performing
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:18.880]  the role of amber heard and another cat with a different wig performing the
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:24.240]  role of Johnny Depp they basically made out that the cats were saying what
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:28.880]  amber heard and Johnny Depp said during their testimonies in particular the part
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:33.520]  where she says she turned to look at Depp after he hit her the original videos
[3:40:33.520 --> 3:40:36.600]  caption read don't you have to be looking at someone in the face to be able to
[3:40:36.600 --> 3:40:41.560]  slap them across it so basically they're making fun of amber heard's dubious
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:47.440]  inconsistent testimony when it came to Johnny Depp's behavior via the medium of
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:52.120]  cat memes and apparently that upsets journalists who work for the Rolling
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:40:57.040]  Stone we immediately started a campaign to have tiktok remove the videos and they
[3:40:57.040 --> 3:41:01.680]  did remove the videos for quote violating policies of bullying and
[3:41:01.680 --> 3:41:06.480]  harassment which doesn't allow quote content that disparages victims of
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:12.080]  violent tragedies yes apparently what happened or what didn't happen to
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:17.960]  amber heard was a violent tragedy and Rolling Stone demanded the video be
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:23.280]  removed it was removed despite having 14 million views along with a bunch of
[3:41:23.280 --> 3:41:29.040]  others AP suggests Elon Musk is a hypocrite for supporting free speech but
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:34.440]  using it to quote attack his critics this is as dumb as the people who claim
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:39.840]  Elon Musk doesn't believe in free speech because he blocked them on Twitter
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:45.280]  no free speech doesn't include the necessity that anyone needs to listen
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:50.600]  to your free speech the Associated Press published a bizarre article suggesting
[3:41:50.600 --> 3:41:55.120]  Elon Musk is a hypocrite for supporting free speech on Twitter yet using the
[3:41:55.120 --> 3:41:59.840]  platform to attack his critics right so if you engage in free speech to respond
[3:41:59.840 --> 3:42:05.680]  to somebody else's free speech that makes you a hypocrite no that's dumb it
[3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:09.280]  says Elon Musk boasts that he's acquiring Twitter to defend freedom of
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:13.200]  speech but he has long used the platform to attack those who disagree with him
[3:42:13.200 --> 3:42:18.040]  yes he's responded to his critics oh my god the horror
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:22.560]  line Greenwell responded to this by saying Elon Musk claims to be in free
[3:42:22.560 --> 3:42:29.960]  speech it argues with those who disagree in attack him check mate and again your
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:34.320]  free speech doesn't compel others to listen to it the fact that this has to
[3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:39.280]  be explained to notable journalists who work for the Associated Press is pretty
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:46.120]  ironic given the fact that they literally accompanied SPU thugs in Ukraine as they
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:51.000]  are the critics of president Zelensky in house-to-house raids literally
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:55.520]  kidnapping them from their own homes summit.news will be back we are now

[3:46:00.320 --> 3:46:04.920]  I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show I wanted to
[3:46:04.920 --> 3:46:08.100]  hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted to really challenge the
[3:46:08.100 --> 3:46:12.200]  globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one mass murderers
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:16.960]  agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of

[3:47:04.480 --> 3:47:14.840]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:47:15.720 --> 3:47:20.240]  well finishing off with social media censorship news of course we have Elon
[3:47:20.240 --> 3:47:24.040]  Musk's purchase of Twitter about to go through here in the next couple of months
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:30.040]  hopefully zero hedge reports Twitter to freeze hiring cut costs as key employees
[3:47:30.040 --> 3:47:37.280]  fired or leaving could this be the woke exodus Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal
[3:47:37.280 --> 3:47:41.000]  announced a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting measures on Thursday as the
[3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:46.400]  company looks to refocus into the Elon Musk takeover one of these employees
[3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:52.160]  Bruce Falk tweeted that he was leaving the company after seven years he said
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:56.840]  the truth is this isn't how and when I imagined I'd be leaving Twitter and he's
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:48:02.640]  gonna replace by someone called Jay Sullivan who as recently as today in
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:08.160]  fact responder to Elon Musk's tweet and said quote yes algorithmic choice and
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:13.680]  transparency is the right direction and where we are headed so this guy seems
[3:48:13.680 --> 3:48:19.160]  pretty up on transparency and stopping algorithmic suppression of certain
[3:48:19.160 --> 3:48:23.080]  stories certain narratives and in support of free speech and he is the
[3:48:23.080 --> 3:48:28.640]  person who is replacing this other individual who seems to be shall we say
[3:48:28.640 --> 3:48:33.720]  on the woke side of the equation so we already see employees leaving new ones
[3:48:33.720 --> 3:48:38.720]  being hired before the purchase has even been rubber stamped which of course is a
[3:48:38.720 --> 3:48:45.320]  good sign now then Broadway star angrily lectures audience member for not
[3:48:45.320 --> 3:48:51.440]  wearing a mask well not wearing a mask this is Broadway star Patty Lapone who
[3:48:51.440 --> 3:48:55.960]  was taking part in a Q&A session so again this wasn't a theatrical performance
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:01.520]  if they're so keen on everyone wearing a frigging mask why weren't they wearing
[3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:05.960]  one she's surrounded by all her colleagues up on stage none of them
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:11.520]  wearing masks but that didn't stop her from screeching had an audience member
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:28.040]  for not wearing a mask properly here's the clip
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:58.280]  so again she's basically screeching at publicly humiliating an audience member
[3:49:58.280 --> 3:50:02.080]  because she's not wearing a mask over her nose someone who literally pays her
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:07.560]  way pays to for God knows what reason to see her show and again it was a Q&A
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:13.480]  session wasn't a theatrical performance why are you not wearing a mask she's
[3:50:13.480 --> 3:50:17.400]  made a previous appearance on the view where she demanded that mask mandates
[3:50:17.400 --> 3:50:21.920]  be kept in place for much longer the rest of Europe's basically got rid of
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:26.880]  them Sweden never had them in the first place at least not strictly enforced they
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:32.040]  had one of the lowest per capita death rates out of the entire continent and
[3:50:32.040 --> 3:50:37.920]  you're still carrying on with this mask theater I mean we don't I don't even see
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:42.720]  it in the UK anymore the only people wearing masks in the UK now by and large
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:47.640]  are American tourists because it's ingrained into the coding they just
[3:50:47.640 --> 3:50:53.960]  can't let it go again despite the fact that we pointed out no scientific
[3:50:53.960 --> 3:50:58.680]  evidence shows that masks have any measurable impact on stopping the spread
[3:50:58.680 --> 3:51:03.560]  of COVID-19 they have had a very successful impact in stunting the
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:08.440]  cognitive development of toddlers and babies that's a really good effect that
[3:51:08.440 --> 3:51:14.520]  they've had and I still see parents women with prams in the street wearing
[3:51:14.520 --> 3:51:21.520]  masks you're literally retarding your children you stupid morons the UK
[3:51:21.520 --> 3:51:25.720]  government's own investigation found the evidence for the efficacy of face masks
[3:51:25.720 --> 3:51:29.840]  stopping the spread of COVID-19 in schools was quote not conclusive but
[3:51:29.840 --> 3:51:34.080]  they went ahead and introduced them anyway University of Oxford professor Jim
[3:51:34.080 --> 3:51:39.440]  Naismith noted that when England dropped face mask mandates back in July and
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:43.720]  Scotland maintained them it made quote no meaningful difference to infection
[3:51:43.720 --> 3:51:48.760]  rates and in fact the next winter we saw the mask mandates in England be dropped
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:52.400]  permanently once again they haven't come back since they maintain them in
[3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:57.400]  Scotland and Wales their COVID cases continued going up it has no impact
[3:51:57.400 --> 3:52:02.240]  whatsoever some people say it makes even worse but it's part of the cult it's
[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:07.040]  part of the high-state assembling I'm a member of the mob and I'm gonna
[3:52:07.040 --> 3:52:12.480]  screech at you on my power trip we previously highlighted the comments of
[3:52:12.480 --> 3:52:18.440]  UK government sage advisor Dr Colin Axon who dismissed face masks as comfort
[3:52:18.440 --> 3:52:23.200]  blankets that do virtually nothing noting that the COVID-19 virus particle
[3:52:23.200 --> 3:52:28.040]  is up to 5,000 times smaller than the holes in the mask but if it makes you
[3:52:28.040 --> 3:52:34.080]  feel like you're a good person you go ahead he said the small sizes are not
[3:52:34.080 --> 3:52:38.320]  easily understood but an imperfect analogy will be to imagine marbles
[3:52:38.320 --> 3:52:42.360]  fired at builders scaffolding some might hit a pole and rebound but obviously
[3:52:42.360 --> 3:52:46.320]  most will fly through they don't care about that they don't care about the
[3:52:46.320 --> 3:52:50.760]  science it's about high-state assembling I'm part of the mob that has
[3:52:50.760 --> 3:52:55.680]  ascribed itself the power to screech at you for not properly displaying your
[3:52:55.680 --> 3:53:01.680]  obsequiousness to the dictates of the mob well now there are more lockdown
[3:53:01.680 --> 3:53:06.760]  advocates fleeing the sinking ship that is the pro lockdown narrative lockdown
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:12.160]  advocate amidst negative impacts were never considered this is Professor John
[3:53:12.160 --> 3:53:15.760]  Edmonds who was part of the sage team that told the government there would be
[3:53:15.760 --> 3:53:21.240]  6,000 Omicron deaths per day if they didn't lock down again this previous
[3:53:21.240 --> 3:53:25.760]  Christmas in the United Kingdom we didn't lock down again the deaths per day
[3:53:25.760 --> 3:53:29.640]  got nowhere near that because we knew the evidence out of South Africa said
[3:53:29.640 --> 3:53:35.000]  that it was a milder variant of the virus we were proven right once again
[3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:40.520]  they were on the wrong side of history once again and maybe it's a I don't know
[3:53:40.520 --> 3:53:45.680]  a pang of moral conscience or maybe it's just covering their behinds but many of
[3:53:45.680 --> 3:53:49.320]  them are slowly starting to trickle out and admit that yes they should have
[3:53:49.320 --> 3:53:56.580]  factored in the giant waiting lists the untreated serious diseases the massive
[3:53:56.580 --> 3:54:02.240]  mental health crisis the economic devastation that again pushed more
[3:54:02.240 --> 3:54:06.800]  people into poverty poverty causes death they're now saying oh maybe we
[3:54:06.800 --> 3:54:12.440]  should have thought about that well too little too late Sweden on the other hand
[3:54:12.440 --> 3:54:16.040]  suffered fewer deaths per capita than much of Europe despite refusing to
[3:54:16.040 --> 3:54:22.000]  enforce strict lockdowns new figures from the WHO show that Sweden had fewer
[3:54:22.000 --> 3:54:25.160]  COVID deaths per capita than much of Europe despite refusing to enforce
[3:54:25.160 --> 3:54:31.880]  strict lockdowns and mask mandates like numerous other nearby countries in 2020
[3:54:31.880 --> 3:54:38.600]  2021 country had an average excess death rate of 56 per 100,000 compared to 109
[3:54:38.600 --> 3:54:44.040]  in the UK which had strict lockdowns and mask mandates for much of that two-year
[3:54:44.040 --> 3:54:51.160]  period, 111 in Spain which had even strict to lockdowns, 133 in Italy which
[3:54:51.160 --> 3:54:57.240]  had even strict to lockdown still isn't that interesting the European countries
[3:54:57.240 --> 3:55:03.040]  that had strict to mask mandates strict to lockdowns had more deaths per
[3:55:03.040 --> 3:55:08.360]  capita again you were on the wrong side of history people need to remember this
[3:55:08.360 --> 3:55:13.120]  and not let them scuttle away with their tails between their legs
[3:55:13.120 --> 3:55:18.680]  meanwhile the media is confused about this new hepatitis outbreak Sky News
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:23.240]  reports hepatitis child dies in Ireland after being treated for mystery form of
[3:55:23.240 --> 3:55:29.080]  the disease the child treated for acute hepatitis at hospital in the Republic of
[3:55:29.080 --> 3:55:35.360]  Ireland has died Daily Mail reports 13 more children fall sick with mystery it's
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:41.440]  a mystery hepatitis bringing UK total to 176 as Ireland says no one child says
[3:55:41.440 --> 3:55:46.360]  one child has died from liver disease of unknown origin of course it's not a
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:52.720]  mystery we know why this is happening these cases are linked to adenoviruses
[3:55:52.720 --> 3:55:56.640]  which caused the common cold but because children haven't been socialized
[3:55:56.640 --> 3:56:00.400]  properly over the past two years because they've been locked down because they've
[3:56:00.400 --> 3:56:04.640]  been kept out of school because they've been kept out of birthday parties kept
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:10.160]  away from their friends their immune systems are completely weakened these
[3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:15.360]  adenoviruses normally develop into the common cold but if you have a weakened
[3:56:15.360 --> 3:56:20.920]  immune system as these kids do because of lockdown policies then they're unable
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:26.120]  to fight it off and it turns into the more serious disease of hepatitis which
[3:56:26.120 --> 3:56:31.520]  is now causing children needing to get liver transplants and in some cases
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:37.920]  across the world children dying of hepatitis so another great moral victory
[3:56:37.920 --> 3:56:44.800]  for the lockdown advocates and the mask freaks Stephen Colbert catches COVID for
[3:56:44.800 --> 3:56:50.240]  the second time in the space of three weeks after thanking vaccine efficacy the
