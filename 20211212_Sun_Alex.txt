[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:15.000 --> 00:30.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.000]  While George Soros has riddled the American justice system with open society funded district attorney anarchy,
[00:48.000 --> 01:01.000]  more than $340,000 in merchandise stolen in LA Smashing Grab thefts, 14 arrested but have bailed out or met the no bail criteria and LAPD chief Moore couldn't hide his frustration.
[01:01.000 --> 01:18.000]  You could be arrested for a crime of such as burglary, serious felony, a person coming into your home or business during hours of darkness or otherwise and that that's a zero bail meaning that we book and process identify you and then your arraignment date is three to four months from now.
[01:18.000 --> 01:28.000]  Klaus Schwab trained and strategically placed the minions of the great reset cancer within the policy machine of democracies worldwide.
[01:28.000 --> 01:53.000]  It's really an incredible opportunity to join a community of 800 leaders from over 80 countries all over the world who work in a number of different situations, whether it's in the news or in the media or with large corporates or entrepreneurs and startups who focus on public policy, but really going a lot deeper understanding the key issues that plague society today, the real potential for reform.
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.000]  The World Economic Forum's young global leaders program graduates include among them French President Emmanuel Macron.
[02:02.000 --> 02:21.000]  The economy of tomorrow is going to have to be an economy that thinks about innovation and humanity and it's going to have to build a competitiveness with the climate challenge, reducing CO2 emissions, adapting as a society, the biodiversity agenda.
[02:21.000 --> 02:35.000]  So it's an economy that will have to be more resilient, that will be better organized and will have to be including these elements of resistance in the supply chains.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  That's where I've said this, but it's not going to be an endpoint to this vaccination program.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  And US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.
[02:45.000 --> 02:53.000]  I think that shows a lot of promise. If we believe in that so-called user pays principle, the idea that part of how we pay for roads is you pay based on how much you drive.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  The gas tax used to be the obvious way to do it. It's not anymore, so a so-called vehicle miles traveled tax or mileage tax, whatever you want to call it, could be a way to do it.
[03:03.000 --> 03:12.000]  This tax would be on top of what you already pay, plus for every Joe Bagadonis that wants to take a road trip across America, they're now paying for that road trip.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  Does this pay for the infrastructure and how is this fair for someone in your line of work?
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  I don't think it's fair at all. I mean, we're the ones out here delivering goods and supplying America.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  Like I said, we pay enough tax already, thousands of dollars a year per truck.
[03:28.000 --> 03:37.000]  All of them implementing the directives of the great reset over the legislative will of their populace and their respective constitutional frameworks.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  I think there's this debate going on right now raging over whether you can be both patriotic and a global citizen.
[03:45.000 --> 03:55.000]  So yes, I believe that you can be both proud of who you are and where you're from, but some of that pride can come from what you do as an international citizen.
[03:55.000 --> 04:12.000]  Klaus Schwab's Young Global Leaders mission statement reads, Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, created the form of Young Global Leaders in 2004 to help the world meet increasingly complex and interdependent problems.
[04:12.000 --> 04:24.000]  His vision was to create a proactive multi-stakeholder community of the world's next generation leaders to inform and influence decision making and mobilize transformation.
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  Whether anyone asked for it or not, Schwab's megalomaniacal fourth industrial revolution nightmarish vision is well underway.
[04:33.000 --> 04:44.000]  Inhabiting positions within the democracies that were once duly elected seats of power, undermining national sovereignty and the future of individual freedom.
[04:45.000 --> 04:53.000]  A quiet declaration of war carried out by the infiltration of this forum of Young Global Leaders. John Bowne reporting.
[04:53.000 --> 05:03.000]  Once we're live, get ready for one hell of a transmission.
[05:23.000 --> 05:32.000]  As a founding member of a very exciting group of projects that we're going to be launching in the very new future, become a founding member today.
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  Learn more at 1776coin.com or call toll-free, triple-eight, two-five-three, three-one-three-nine.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle, continuing to fight against the globalist new world order.
[05:46.000 --> 05:59.000]  That's why you're called a founding member, because the funding from this is going to go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[06:16.000 --> 06:27.000]  It's Sunday, December 12th. The year is 2021.
[06:28.000 --> 06:42.000]  And we're always covering huge epic frontline information, but today there has just been a crescendo, a cascade, a landslide of truth against our enemies.
[06:42.000 --> 06:56.000]  We have had victory after victory after victory in the last week against their race crime hoaxes, against their poison injections, against their pedophile rings, and so much more.
[06:57.000 --> 07:05.000]  Again, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast.
[07:05.000 --> 07:13.000]  We're going to destroy the whole COVID-19 martial law medical attorney takeover. That's coming up next hour.
[07:14.000 --> 07:29.000]  We're going to get to the latest coming up at the bottom of the hour on Biden blaming tornadoes that have always hit states and always caused carnage at this level hundreds of times.
[07:29.000 --> 07:37.000]  It's still terrible. And blaming it on global warming, which again they admit now is a global warming. It's just climate change.
[07:38.000 --> 07:50.000]  And notice when we talk about government weather systems that don't completely control the weather, but they admit can cause floods, cause tornadoes, cause hurricanes, cause, I mean that was certified, declassified in the late 90s by the Pentagon.
[07:50.000 --> 08:00.000]  Pentagon, they go, oh no, that doesn't exist even though it does, but then they blame you and your car or a coal mine for what happened with no proof.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  Whereas we actually have weather weapon programs and things going on.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  So we'll hear from the former director of the CIA admitting they have weather weapons coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[08:11.000 --> 08:26.000]  But before I hit all of that, ladies and gentlemen, you talk about the wheels coming off the globalist operation, you talk about the engine blowing up, you talk about the house burning down.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  The globalists know their corrupt system is coming to an end.
[08:32.000 --> 08:44.000]  And they're trying to take capitalism with it when it's not capitalism that caused this, but crony capitalism and corrupt financiers working with the authoritarian regimes to create monopolies.
[08:45.000 --> 08:52.000]  So they know their monopolistic New World Order great reset is coming to an end.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  They understand that and they don't know what to do.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  And so they're going to engineer an artificial collapse so they can be the saviors of the collapse.
[09:02.000 --> 09:14.000]  So they have all the PR straight and all the propaganda straight so that as things disintegrate, they can pose as the saviors and hopefully stay in charge of this control demolition that they have executed.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  But it's not going the way tyrants always wanted to go.
[09:17.000 --> 09:26.000]  It's getting out of control so they're upping the level of control, they're accelerating the collapse and they've basically lost control now, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  Only a mass awakening of the public can get control of the train before it goes over the edge into the ravine.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  And we're very close to that point where we're at a point of return.
[09:38.000 --> 09:47.000]  But the masses having a giant epiphany, a giant chain reaction awakening can and will stop them.
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  That's why they want this show just as much as they wanted Trump destroyed because he was a populist, actually cared about the country and actually wanted us to be sovereign.
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  He had his own problems, but he believed the president should be president.
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.000]  He wasn't out to get the country.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  That's why the globalists hated him so much.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  Well, they hate us even more.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  That means all of you, not just me, I'm just a focal point of this.
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.000]  Because you have the solutions to stop what they're doing and you understand their program and their operation.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  Now, we can do a drum roll here, but this is actually very sad and disgusting.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  And I've explained this and I've told you that the majority of the high level producers at CNN are pedophiles.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  And I don't just get up here and say that for no reason.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  That's how these intelligence, private corporate intelligence operations of Jeffrey Epstein and others worked.
[10:36.000 --> 10:48.000]  Why do you think Jeffrey Epstein was recruiting hundreds of girls a month in Palm Beach alone, industrial level, having to exhaust himself, having sex with up to five young girls a day?
[10:48.000 --> 11:02.000]  Because they had so many men, they wanted to corrupt, so many men ready to sell out from police chiefs, to judges, to lawyers, to bankers, to academics, to scientists that in one area of Florida,
[11:03.000 --> 11:15.000]  he had thousands and thousands of girls as young as 11 years old just in the introductory level of the corruption and then even younger for the real sickos, the real demons.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  As if the ones having sex with 15 year olds weren't evil enough.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  So this is the out of control corruption of the forbidden fruit of that.
[11:25.000 --> 11:37.000]  And so you see another, how many have there been CNN high level head Cuomo, Chris Cuomo.
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  I mean, you don't think they just got rid of Cuomo because of his brother or because when he's their top show or because a woman might say he's sexually harassed him.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, his brother wears nipple rings on television.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  These are some freaks.
[11:54.000 --> 12:12.000]  And so now it comes out that this head producer for Chris Cuomo was organizing women bringing their daughters to him so that he would have sex with the mother and the daughter.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  And what did I tell you, these people want to get their kids into this cult.
[12:16.000 --> 12:23.000]  These mothers want to get assigned into the operation so their daughters can now recruit other women.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  Just like you want to get into Harvard or you want to get into Yale or you want to get into UT or wherever.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  Well, in the world today, you try to get in at CNN.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  The majority of the people at the top now, you wonder why they're so evil, why they follow orders.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  Because they think get out of jail free cards.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  And so that's who they are.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  That's what they're into.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  That's what they want.
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  They don't want to go eat a steak and drink a glass of wine and look at the sunset and every time it's just as good or better.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  They don't want their wife.
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  They want to screw little kids.
[13:00.000 --> 13:11.000]  And this guy has been indicted for raping a nine-year-old reportedly in front of the mother that brought the child there to be raped.
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.000]  Now, right as this comes out, the Atlantic Monthly, owned by the heiress of Apple, who hung out on Epstein Island.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  We'll show you photos and flight logs in a moment, said there's no such thing as pedophilia.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  Now, why the hell would you put something out like that?
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  I'm going to show it to you in a moment.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  Why would you do that?
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  Because that's gaslighting, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  And I've got other articles all over it.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[13:39.000 --> 13:48.000]  Oh, oh, remember the pizza gate where the internet said maybe something's happening in the basement of a pizza place, which it wasn't.
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  There was no basement.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  And so now there's no pedophilia on earth.
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  It doesn't exist.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  You know, that's a fraud.
[13:53.000 --> 13:54.000]  That's an attempt at a straw man.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  It doesn't work.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  So why are all these organizations and groups doing this?
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  And I'll tell you again, because, yeah, there's the heiress.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  She's worth like $50 million to Apple.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  She owns Apple, the controlling stock.
[14:10.000 --> 14:17.000]  And she literally basically just lived with the Epsteins in New York, in Paris, in London, and at Little St. John's.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  So that's who these people are.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  It's about their power, their control, their God.
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000]  They can do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  And I tell you, just like that woman ended up in prison, the Apple heiress needs to be heavily investigated.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  And she thinks she can fund these attacks on us.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  I am proud to have her and George Soros as my enemies.
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.000]  Not looking to get killed or put in prison, but if I got to do this to stop what you're doing, then do it.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  Fill your hand, because there's no backing down here, because I'm not with you.
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  And if I submit to you, and if I back down to you, then you have made me join your ranks.
[15:02.000 --> 15:14.000]  And death is a wonderful release at your filthy hands, at your minions' hands, compared to facing God and being a coward working with you.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  I will never do it.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  And the reckoning's coming.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  So you try to collapse society.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  You try to poison us with these shots.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  You pull all your crap, you attack us with everything you got, but it's coming out.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  So, rats leaving the sinking ship.
[15:29.000 --> 15:40.000]  You've got all these different globalists like Brian Williams leading it and leaving MSNBC.
[15:40.000 --> 15:50.000]  You've got about to be fired, Chris Wallace, when his contract's up, acting like he quit in face-saving measure, running to an internet show on the failing sinking ship of CNN.
[15:50.000 --> 15:58.000]  You've got all of this coming out, and we'll tell you the rest of the story straight ahead.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  I never...
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[16:08.000 --> 16:15.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really, they're just a commune.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  Like a Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  We had one.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[16:52.000 --> 17:08.000]  And if you don't find us, you don't want to share, that's fine.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  William in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  I agree.
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  Oh, hi, Alice.
[17:15.000 --> 17:16.000]  Thanks for taking my call.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  Can I plug, uh, Alex, real quick?
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[17:19.000 --> 17:25.000]  I'm in my 60s, and I did the work of 25, 30-year-olds, and I worked them into the ground, and you
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  wanted to know why.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  And I've tested this, and I've taken your B12, and let me tell you, when I don't take
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  it, I pay a price.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  I really do.
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  I take that B12, and I am electric, man.
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.000]  I can run 10 miles.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department, and my friends will attest to
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, and I'm not just blowing
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  smoke here.
[17:49.000 --> 17:59.000]  The B12 saves my life.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically, I was 275 pounds.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  I was overweight.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  I had brain fog, like you wouldn't believe.
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.000]  I was barely holding onto a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to it.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  So, the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with that shield.
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that,
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  so I took it.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  And, man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  enlightened.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  You know, I could think again.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  I could connect with people again.
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  took, basically, all of your supplements.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  It's amazing.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  It works.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.000]  Beautifully said, brother.
[18:55.000 --> 19:24.000]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[19:26.000 --> 19:51.000]  Thank you very much.
[19:51.000 --> 20:07.000]  Thank you very much.
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  There is no honor amongst thieves.
[20:25.000 --> 20:33.000]  And Hollywood has been a giant, private, corporate intelligence operation of MI6, the
[20:33.000 --> 20:42.000]  CIA, and the Mossad, setting up cults, setting up front groups to go out and then run intelligence
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  operations on companies and corporations to basically take over society.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  Then to demoralize the general public to break up our families and weaken us ahead of our
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  total enslavement by the big central banks who didn't want to depopulate us.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  So it's all been a Carnegie Rockefeller endowment operation.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  You now see it studying their own documents.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  That's how I know the future way out ahead of time.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  That's why you constantly see, like, a head of Homeland Security in the whole region,
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  how many times, caught having a mother flying in with a three-year-old to have sex with
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  her to rape them.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  You're like, what's going on?
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  Well, that's just because somebody good finally found out about it and a group of law enforcement,
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  they don't control, busted them.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  That's why they have the left taking over law enforcement.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  That's why George Soros is putting in the district attorneys and the attorney generals at the
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.000]  state level and why the left is trying to pack the whole FBI and the federal marshals
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  with their people, and they're very close to winning.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  But as they know the news comes out, that's why Nickelodeon and all the channels promote
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  pedophilia and now say it's actually okay.
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  Inoculating your child without your consent's okay.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  It's all about getting rid of the age of consent.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  But it's not just about blackmail.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  It's about the controls.
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  So DOJ says CNN producer raped nine-year-old while her mother watched solicited girls nine
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  to 16 for sex virtual training sessions with their parents.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  He was a Jeffrey Epstein.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.000]  He was recruiting.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  He was preparing his sex slave ops because that's how you get into the upper ranks of the system.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Here's a photo of him for TV viewers.
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.000]  Here is Chris Cuomo and the CNN senior producer who were just arrested for raping children.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  And believe me, what we know about is horrible.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  You can be assured it's bigger than Sandusky.
[22:38.000 --> 22:46.000]  CNN is a intelligence operation of the highest order.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  Absolutely disgusting, ladies and gentlemen, look at this guy.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  I mean, just look at what a predator he is.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  I mean, would you let that person anywhere near your children?
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.000]  You look at him and say absolutely not.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  But you have discernment.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  See, the general public that's held him as a satanic spell doesn't.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Ugh.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  He doesn't just want to rape your children, though, he wants to rape your mind and your freedom
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  and your body with the GMO death shots.
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  CNN producer arrested accused of raping children as young as nine.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Chris Cuomo's producer.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  Look at that maniac.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  He's in the club, he thought.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  Chris Cuomo's CNN producer charged with luring girls for sexual training.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  That's the New York Post.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  I know it's a lot worse than that.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  Oh, but here's CNN.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  A baseless conspiracy theory found a foothold in Europe.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  New research shows.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  CNN article attacks me.
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  There's no government or combines of pedophiles running secret networks.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  No.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  They put this out on CNN during the whole Epstein thing last year.
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  Oh, no.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  Oh, but oh, it gets better.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  Of all the words of tongue and pen, the truest are these.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  Alex Jones was right again.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  Jeff Pesovic puts it out. It's confirmed Queen of England there at the cabin.
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.000]  Shame cabin with Jeffrey Epstein and Gisela Maxwell, who are best friends with the Royal House,
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  helping frame and keep everybody under control with sex ops, which her father ran for MI six.
[24:10.000 --> 24:16.000]  And of course, OSS before that in World War Two, Gisela Maxwell, the spy master sex operative.
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  That's why Jeffrey Epstein again had to recruit hundreds of girls a week just in Palm Beach to supply
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  all the people that they were who were willingly coming and getting framed.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  They wanted to be in the club.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Who else was in the club?
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  Alex Jones is basically right.
[24:33.000 --> 24:40.000]  That America is run by evil people who want to molester kids and kill or imprison you if you try to stop them.
[24:40.000 --> 24:51.000]  Lawrence Powell jobs Steve Jobs widow and Gisela Maxwell having fun at the little pervert island and then the Atlantic that she owns running the headline,
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  The Great Fake Child Sex Trafficking Epidemic.
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  The Senate report confirms thousands of children trapped across the U.S. border under Obama who then authorized it given into sex slavery.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Many were disappeared or killed.
[25:04.000 --> 25:14.000]  That's U.S. Senate report confirms children trafficked across border under Obama were used in sex traffic.
[25:14.000 --> 25:23.000]  But it's okay that the Senate report confirms thousands of children that Obama allowed to be smuggled and brought in were sex trafficked
[25:23.000 --> 25:29.000]  because the Atlantic, the most evil publication in the world, literally owned by her.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  She spends billions of years attacking us, attacking free speech, attacking America.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  But it's okay because she's a woman.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  She's allowed to act like this.
[25:39.000 --> 25:47.000]  And oh, they had a Twitter that censors everybody. He's got brown skin, so it's okay too, right?
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.000]  CNN staff were charged with enticing moms, young daughters into sexual activity, quote, training them for missions.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  Said, I'm going to train you. I want to make you a secret agent.
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  Yeah, that's all coming out.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  And the women wanted to be recruited.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Oh my gosh, secret agent, man.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  You know, James Bond didn't have sex with hot chicks up in hotel rooms.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  James Bond's got lines of old men coming in to screw 10-year-old girls.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  That's what James Bond does.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  And hey, they're externalizing the method.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  Roger Stone's going to pop on.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  He's about to get on a plane, but he's going to pop on the next hour.
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  SNL jokes about gang raping Roger Stone's 75-year-old wife who has cancer.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  We have the video. We will be showing you that.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  Oh, but it gets better.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  SNL, hip-hop nativity, same shows, skit shows, baby Jesus twerking.
[26:41.000 --> 26:48.000]  Mary as a stripper and baby daddy Joseph with a pimp walk.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  Oh, the child shaking its ass.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  The newborn baby wants to be raped.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  I get it.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  It's a religion.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  You don't get in the club unless you got the dead eyes of these people.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  They look dead because they are dead.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  They've turned themselves over to absolute total evil and they think it's cute.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  They think it's funny.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  And what it really is is a message to all of us.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  They're coming for our children.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  We already know scumbags.
[27:16.000 --> 27:27.000]  Meanwhile, honored and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his great team.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  Chris Wallace will join CNN as anchor for CNN Plus because Fox was about to fire him
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  because he had the lowest ratings on their network.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  Their smallest shows have 2 million viewers.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  He had like a quarter million.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  Total joke. He's about to be fired.
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  That's coming out.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  And so what did he do?
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  He jumped to CNN Plus.
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  They always make fun of us.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  It's called Internet.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  We're more than that, but whatever Internet's great.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  Yeah, in the free market of ideas, we kick your ass.
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  But oh, now he'll be Internet only on CNN Plus and look what a deviant.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  I mean, look, I'm not saying Chris Wallace is a pedophile.
[28:00.000 --> 28:09.000]  But if I was going to cast somebody for a movie, you know, that, that, I mean, look how creepy he is.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  I mean, what a little conceited, self-centered, know-it-all piece of garbage.
[28:14.000 --> 28:25.000]  And there he is. He's honored and delighted, honored and delighted to be at CNN with John Griffin.
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  He wants to be colleagues with people like that over at CNN.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  Do an overhead shot for me, please.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  Here is Chris Cuomo.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Oh, out Chris Cuomo.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  In comes Chris Wallace and he's got a new friend.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  Oh, and it gets better.
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  Ryan Williams signs off from the MSNBC's 11th hour after lying and saying he was shot down in a helicopter.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  Only person worse than him, Senator Blumenthal, that says he was in combat in Vietnam and was never there.
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  Lying scum.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement to all of our listeners, viewers and supporters.
[29:04.000 --> 29:13.000]  We are attempting to develop and deploy systems that allow the American people, not just Info Wars, to get around corporate sensors
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  and get the truth out about the New World Order's agenda so we can stop it dead in its tracks.

[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  and to go to 1776coin.com.

[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[30:27.000 --> 30:34.000]  And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled,
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  20.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  And I know we're being fed into this global speak run and it's so incredibly sad,
[30:41.000 --> 30:49.000]  but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  and then coming back to life again.
[30:51.000 --> 30:57.000]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer control of this process of decadence and collapse
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  to actually end the species as we know it.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.000]  What are champions made of?
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[31:06.000 --> 31:16.000]  www.adventures.org
[31:36.000 --> 32:03.200]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in infowars live products and that's
[32:03.200 --> 32:07.320]  That's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could
[32:07.320 --> 32:12.240]  never get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just used
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.240]  the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[32:16.240 --> 32:20.040]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[32:20.040 --> 32:21.400]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[32:21.400 --> 32:26.440]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[32:26.440 --> 32:31.360]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[32:31.360 --> 32:35.960]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants and
[32:35.960 --> 32:39.320]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[32:39.320 --> 32:40.320]  added.
[32:40.320 --> 32:43.600]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes, it's got real organic
[32:43.600 --> 32:48.200]  cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt and it just
[32:48.200 --> 32:49.200]  goes on and on.
[32:49.200 --> 32:54.760]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[32:54.760 --> 33:00.560]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[33:00.560 --> 33:07.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.560 --> 33:56.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to do the tornadoes that hit and was it weather
[33:56.800 --> 34:02.600]  modification or control and I'm going to really give you the answers.
[34:02.600 --> 34:07.840]  Coming up next segment and then Roger Stone pops in with SNL joking about gang raping
[34:07.840 --> 34:12.080]  his wife dying of cancer and you're just like, well, why do they do that?
[34:12.080 --> 34:17.000]  It's just about searing your conscience, just getting you used to being raped with inflation
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.720]  and open borders and globalism and pedophilia.
[34:19.720 --> 34:20.840]  I mean, these are criminals.
[34:20.840 --> 34:23.760]  They get off on that they can get away with stuff.
[34:23.760 --> 34:28.080]  They'd show up at a beautiful Thanksgiving dinner at 4pm at Grandma's house and take
[34:28.080 --> 34:30.400]  a crap in the middle of the dressing.
[34:30.400 --> 34:33.600]  They'd get up in front of the whole family, pull their pants down and spray diarrhea all
[34:33.600 --> 34:34.600]  over the food.
[34:34.600 --> 34:38.640]  I don't mean to be gross about that, but you don't understand them till you get your
[34:38.640 --> 34:41.960]  mind wrapped around who they are.
[34:41.960 --> 34:47.480]  They are predators and they want to hurt good people.
[34:47.480 --> 34:48.920]  They want to lie.
[34:48.920 --> 34:53.720]  They want to hurt you and they've organized themselves into communities and organizations
[34:53.720 --> 35:00.960]  and CNN is a pedophilia mothership of evil and that leads us to the vaccines that aren't
[35:00.960 --> 35:04.440]  vaccines that are poison gene therapies and all the huge news there that I'm going to
[35:04.440 --> 35:10.520]  hit some now and then really get into after Roger leaves us brought him in the next hour.
[35:10.520 --> 35:17.400]  But just remember when you look at the face of this arrested charge, all the evidence
[35:17.400 --> 35:21.840]  says pedophile.
[35:21.840 --> 35:26.960]  Chris Cuomo's main producer, senior CNN producer, not just his show.
[35:26.960 --> 35:32.960]  And he's running rape operations training women for sex to be sex operatives in sex
[35:32.960 --> 35:33.960]  training.
[35:33.960 --> 35:36.080]  The general public reads that and doesn't know what they're seeing.
[35:36.080 --> 35:37.080]  That's what CNN does.
[35:37.080 --> 35:46.240]  I told you, industrial level sex operations with little girls to go recruit other people.
[35:46.240 --> 35:50.520]  And women, if they're alone and single mothers and don't have God, get approached by authority
[35:50.520 --> 35:52.080]  figures.
[35:52.080 --> 35:56.240]  Once they let their child be raped like this, now they're recruiters like Gisling Maxwell,
[35:56.240 --> 36:02.800]  who you know was raped from like age two on by her father and OSS and then MI6.
[36:02.800 --> 36:06.040]  And I'm sorry to tell you all this, it's in the MKUltra documents.
[36:06.040 --> 36:12.120]  It's in Reset Wars that, by the way, you'll be able to get tomorrow, launches at midnight
[36:12.120 --> 36:14.880]  tonight at resetwars.com.
[36:14.880 --> 36:16.200]  And I'm sorry to tell you all this.
[36:16.200 --> 36:19.880]  I know it sounds insane, but as it comes true and you see it, you learn how these intelligence
[36:19.880 --> 36:20.880]  operations work.
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.080]  I mean, my uncle was in Iran, Contra.
[36:24.080 --> 36:28.160]  He wouldn't tell me any of it, I don't have to say that he got out of it because they
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.560]  were trafficking children out of Central American orphanages.
[36:32.560 --> 36:36.840]  Okay, let's move on from there.
[36:36.840 --> 36:44.200]  So here is Chris Cuomo and the CNN senior producer who was just arrested for raping children
[36:44.200 --> 36:46.240]  in organized rape.
[36:46.240 --> 36:47.760]  But they want to rape your mind.
[36:47.760 --> 36:49.120]  They want to rape your soul.
[36:49.120 --> 36:55.800]  They want to rape everything that is decent and good because that gives them power over
[36:55.800 --> 36:56.800]  reality.
[36:56.800 --> 37:01.120]  So you ask yourself, why are the rats leaving the sinking ship?
[37:01.120 --> 37:07.520]  Well because the ship is sinking and that's who they are.
[37:07.520 --> 37:13.800]  Now let's move on to the rape with a genetically engineered gene therapy that erases your immune
[37:13.800 --> 37:20.480]  system is linked to massive cancer and blood clots and heart attacks.
[37:20.480 --> 37:28.120]  I have literally more than 30 incredible clips today of scientists and doctors and researchers
[37:28.120 --> 37:34.040]  and the CDC's own documents and the FDA's own documents that taking the Pfizer, Moderna
[37:34.040 --> 37:40.680]  and Johnson and Johnson shot gives you a negative immunity within eight months on average.
[37:40.680 --> 37:43.320]  Negative, meaning it's worse than before you took it.
[37:43.320 --> 37:44.840]  This is not a vaccine.
[37:44.840 --> 37:48.760]  I mean, a real inoculation gives you decades of immunity.
[37:48.760 --> 37:51.200]  That's not what this is.
[37:51.200 --> 37:55.000]  This goes in and programs your, so like, you have a light bulb that burns for 10 years,
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  they don't want that.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.960]  That's a regular vaccine, still could have problems.
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.160]  These are planned obsolescence where they work a few months but then get rid of your
[38:03.160 --> 38:05.480]  immune system.
[38:05.480 --> 38:08.880]  So it'd be like, oh, this light bulb works for a couple months, then it burns your house
[38:08.880 --> 38:09.880]  down.
[38:09.880 --> 38:14.680]  You don't know what that light bulb in or you've got this light bulb for a few months
[38:14.680 --> 38:16.600]  but then you can never have light in your house again.
[38:16.600 --> 38:22.760]  People are like, are you, that's not just a scam, that's criminal.
[38:22.760 --> 38:28.400]  So here is Laura Ingram who after Tucker Carlson has the most courage of anybody on national
[38:28.400 --> 38:39.400]  TV in this nation with Dr. Byron Riddle talking about the elephant in the room that it doesn't
[38:39.400 --> 38:40.400]  work.
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.520]  Not just that the Omnicron gets around it, that's their, that's their diversion.
[38:44.520 --> 38:48.720]  You've got the famous meme of Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark at the start
[38:48.720 --> 38:53.360]  of the movie where he's got the bag of sand and he's got the gold idol he's trying to
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.640]  get and, oh my God, the vaccine doesn't work, it's not a vaccine, it's a fraud, everybody's
[38:57.640 --> 39:01.360]  waking up to it, knowing it's a scam, what are we, okay, he's got to move the bag of
[39:01.360 --> 39:03.440]  sand onto the gold idol.
[39:03.440 --> 39:04.440]  It's Omnicron.
[39:04.440 --> 39:07.600]  Oh, it doesn't work now because of Omnicron.
[39:07.600 --> 39:08.600]  You're really sick.
[39:08.600 --> 39:10.480]  I'm calling it COVID because of Omnicron.
[39:10.480 --> 39:15.920]  I'm going to play clips for you next segment where I didn't just predict this year and
[39:15.920 --> 39:22.000]  a half ago, which you'll see as well, but I predicted it 12 years ago.
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  Exactly.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.760]  And by the way, I didn't predict it.
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.920]  I had their actual breakdown, ladies and gentlemen, their plans.
[39:30.920 --> 39:31.920]  These people are arrogant.
[39:31.920 --> 39:34.400]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, and guess what?
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.880]  The globalists have tipped their hand again, you ask, well, why do they do it?
[39:39.880 --> 39:46.200]  You ask, why don't they just shut up because they've got to tell all the agencies and groups
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.000]  and governments what's going to happen and the drill is how they test the policy and
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.040]  get them used to the drill so that when the actual system comes, they don't put it together,
[39:56.040 --> 39:59.600]  they just follow orders because they've done the drill 100 times, like Jim Jones giving
[39:59.600 --> 40:05.040]  people Kool-Aid that didn't have cyanide in it, and finally the day they done Kool-Aid
[40:05.040 --> 40:11.520]  drills hundreds of times, finally by the time he gave them the real Kool-Aid with the cyanide,
[40:11.520 --> 40:14.560]  they didn't understand and died.
[40:14.560 --> 40:17.240]  So we're going to show you all those documents.
[40:17.240 --> 40:21.520]  I shall get to the weather modification next hour, but I need to finish up with this.
[40:21.520 --> 40:28.720]  Here is the good doctor, Riddell, on Laura Ingram explaining, it doesn't work.
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.720]  It's a fraud.
[40:29.720 --> 40:30.720]  Here it is.
[40:30.720 --> 40:35.800]  Dr. Byron Bridal, who is an immunology professor at the University of Guelph in Canada, who
[40:35.800 --> 40:41.240]  is part of the group who studied the first mRNA COVID vaccines, Dr. Bridal, what's going
[40:41.240 --> 40:42.240]  on here?
[40:42.240 --> 40:44.840]  Hi, Laura, thanks for having me again.
[40:44.840 --> 40:48.800]  I have to say, I'll just be blunt, this is obviously ludicrous.
[40:48.800 --> 40:54.840]  This is a case of trying to take something that is completely ineffective and by administering
[40:54.840 --> 41:00.400]  endless doses, somehow it seems like health professionals think this is going to suddenly
[41:00.400 --> 41:01.400]  become effective.
[41:01.400 --> 41:06.360]  There's so much data showing now that these vaccines can never, ever achieve the goal
[41:06.360 --> 41:07.680]  of herd immunity.
[41:07.680 --> 41:11.920]  These are, first of all, what I want to point out is we have to keep in mind the very definition
[41:11.920 --> 41:18.520]  of vaccines was altered to allow that term to be applied to these current inoculations
[41:18.520 --> 41:19.840]  that we're giving to people.
[41:19.840 --> 41:28.920]  The duration of immunity is far too short, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been effectively
[41:28.920 --> 41:33.840]  developing new variants that can readily evade this immunity.
[41:33.840 --> 41:38.200]  The new Omicron variant has so many mutations in the spike protein, it's going to be able
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.480]  to even more effectively evade vaccine-induced immunity than the Delta variant did.
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.240]  The combination of all of these things, combined with the fact that there is, although people
[41:49.240 --> 41:53.560]  try and hide it as much as possible, it's becoming impossible to hide the harms that
[41:53.560 --> 41:55.800]  these vaccines are causing.
[41:55.800 --> 42:00.200]  There's no question now that the cost-benefit analysis makes no sense.
[42:00.200 --> 42:04.360]  People who are, quote, fully vaccinated, which is the two doses at the moment, they can still
[42:04.360 --> 42:09.280]  get infected, they can still get COVID, they can still get disease, they can still die
[42:09.280 --> 42:15.480]  from COVID, and they transmit the virus in at least equal proportion to equal quantities
[42:15.480 --> 42:17.560]  as those who have no immunity.
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.560]  Okay, so I told you all this with the experts 20-plus months ago, but you're not here to
[42:21.560 --> 42:25.120]  hear us spike the football, you're here to hear tomorrow's news today.
[42:25.120 --> 42:27.720]  So let me introduce something that nobody else introduced that I've been talking about
[42:27.720 --> 42:30.920]  for a year, Merix disease.
[42:30.920 --> 42:34.280]  Gates and them aren't dumb, they put this out, they act like it's a process, they let
[42:34.280 --> 42:41.440]  the vaccines create the mutations, which when they create all these shots that keep destroying
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.560]  spike protein, it's going to create a super spike protein that kills 100%.
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.360]  And that's what they're doing is using the public to create the ultimate weapon they've
[42:50.360 --> 42:55.280]  already tested in labs, but they're making us do it to ourselves via free will.
[42:55.280 --> 42:59.680]  Merix disease in humans.
[42:59.680 --> 43:04.960]  Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our amazing listeners and viewers.
[43:04.960 --> 43:10.280]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special.
[43:10.280 --> 43:14.120]  It's the 1776 founder coin.
[43:14.120 --> 43:21.280]  You've got to see this coin for yourself, it's at 1776coin.com and this coin makes you
[43:21.280 --> 43:27.520]  a founding member of a very exciting group of projects that we're going to be launching
[43:27.520 --> 43:29.320]  in the very new future.
[43:29.320 --> 43:31.560]  Become a founding member today.
[43:31.560 --> 43:38.240]  Learn more at 1776coin.com or call toll free triple eight two five three three one three
[43:38.240 --> 43:39.240]  nine.
[43:39.240 --> 43:43.880]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle continuing the fight against
[43:43.880 --> 43:46.080]  the globalist new world order.
[43:46.080 --> 43:50.080]  That's why you're called a founding member because the funding from this is going to
[43:50.080 --> 43:55.240]  go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people
[43:55.240 --> 43:59.760]  to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[43:59.760 --> 44:05.280]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[44:05.280 --> 44:10.960]  The population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[44:10.960 --> 44:15.160]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[44:15.160 --> 44:20.320]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[44:20.320 --> 44:25.160]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[44:25.160 --> 44:29.600]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[44:29.600 --> 44:34.480]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[44:34.480 --> 44:37.600]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[44:37.600 --> 44:40.960]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[44:40.960 --> 44:45.600]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[44:45.600 --> 44:46.600]  an end.
[44:46.600 --> 44:52.400]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[44:52.400 --> 44:59.600]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[44:59.600 --> 45:00.960]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[45:00.960 --> 45:03.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  Welcome.
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  All right.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.960]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.880]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[45:13.880 --> 45:16.640]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[45:16.640 --> 45:17.640]  Mix those two together.
[45:17.640 --> 45:19.280]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[45:19.280 --> 45:21.200]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[45:21.200 --> 45:26.120]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[45:26.120 --> 45:31.680]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[45:31.680 --> 45:32.680]  but just aren't as strong.
[45:32.680 --> 45:34.800]  This is like a very fine wine.
[45:34.800 --> 45:37.120]  In fact, each batch is different.
[45:37.120 --> 45:39.120]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[45:39.120 --> 45:42.640]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[45:42.640 --> 45:43.640]  That's just how it is.
[45:43.640 --> 45:45.140]  It's how it works.
[45:45.140 --> 45:46.760]  So it's always good.
[45:46.760 --> 45:48.920]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[45:48.920 --> 45:59.400]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[45:59.400 --> 46:03.960]  It's time to show them what a real AlphaMail looks like with one of our most powerful products
[46:03.960 --> 46:05.960]  ever made, AlphaPower.
[46:05.960 --> 46:09.480]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[46:14.200 --> 46:18.320]  in restoring that lost energy and groove that comes with time and age.
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.840]  AlphaPower's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sport performance or enhance
[46:22.840 --> 46:28.680]  your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance, perfect by itself or with
[46:28.680 --> 46:32.400]  super male vitality in the true AlphaMail path.

[46:37.560 --> 46:39.840]  healthy cholesterol and more.
[46:39.840 --> 46:43.360]  Let AlphaPower help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.

[46:50.640 --> 47:01.080]  Head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[47:01.080 --> 47:10.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:10.760 --> 47:21.440]  Welcome back, Roger Stone's going to pop in for one segment until about 15 after to talk
[47:21.440 --> 47:25.880]  about Saturday Night Live saying that they want his wife who's dying of cancer, hopefully
[47:25.880 --> 47:30.040]  she lives, she's got stage 4 cancer, that she's being gang raped.
[47:30.040 --> 47:33.800]  That's just about searing your mind, your conscience, it's about just training you to
[47:33.800 --> 47:34.800]  be a slave.
[47:34.800 --> 47:40.400]  He's going to pop in and then I'll get into the horrible tornado that is not the worst
[47:40.400 --> 47:41.400]  in U.S. history.
[47:41.400 --> 47:47.640]  They've had tornado groups that killed 300 people in one night, not 120 or 30.
[47:47.640 --> 47:48.760]  Still this is horrible.
[47:48.760 --> 47:52.520]  But to say that it's global warming doing it, why do we have all those tornado shelters?
[47:52.520 --> 47:57.280]  Why do people used to have that before they knew about radar and things before that was
[47:57.280 --> 48:02.320]  invented was because they knew that when there were storms they had to all go sleep in the
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.360]  cellar because sometimes it would come and kill you.
[48:06.360 --> 48:11.720]  My father saw the barn in East Texas where he grew up destroyed once by a tornado and
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.200]  then it went across the road and tore up one of the family's relatives' houses.
[48:16.200 --> 48:17.200]  Was that global warming?
[48:17.200 --> 48:18.200]  Was that man made?
[48:18.200 --> 48:22.200]  We'll talk about it bottom of the next hour after Roger Stone leaves us.
[48:22.200 --> 48:27.640]  But I noticed that on Instagram and Twitter a bunch of people sent me these.
[48:27.640 --> 48:33.480]  Some of these had 500 views, one of them had 100,000 views, one had 500,000 views just
[48:33.480 --> 48:37.320]  this weekend but the good news is people are taking these clips, they're finding these
[48:37.320 --> 48:42.200]  clips and they're sharing them because the public gets fascinated not by documents I
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.240]  show on air but by old videos of me saying what was going to happen.
[48:47.240 --> 48:52.320]  And then we can demystify and explain how I knew this so people can then discover how
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.400]  to learn this for themselves and not just listen to what I have to say because if I
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.480]  want to not get killed or put in prison and save the country and if you want to do the
[49:00.480 --> 49:05.000]  same thing with me, we can do it together, we've got to decentralize this.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.240]  I don't want to be the guy that understands all this.
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.200]  We can do this together but it's going to take people getting knowledge of how the globalist
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.320]  operate, how their mindset works and what their tricks are.
[49:15.320 --> 49:22.080]  So here's the clip of myself 12 years ago in 2010 or 11 and a half years ago with Mike
[49:22.080 --> 49:28.360]  Adams predicting what was going to be coming in the future and then there's clips from
[49:28.360 --> 49:34.800]  a year and a half ago and 21 months ago, I mean predicting that multiple inoculations,
[49:34.800 --> 49:39.480]  tracker passes, the vaccines wouldn't work, they'd claim that it was a variant but really
[49:39.480 --> 49:43.080]  it was something they were releasing or it was caused by the vaccine.
[49:43.080 --> 49:45.920]  100%, what's happened 20 months later?
[49:45.920 --> 49:48.600]  How do I nail it 100%?
[49:48.600 --> 49:52.560]  It's like if I go see Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, doesn't matter if it's a high
[49:52.560 --> 49:55.840]  school doing it, doesn't matter if it's a college doing it, doesn't matter if it's a
[49:55.840 --> 50:03.560]  professional theater doing it, if it says classic Shakespeare, Romeo, Juliet, I know
[50:03.560 --> 50:09.280]  it will be word for word in the old English Shakespeare.
[50:09.280 --> 50:14.320]  It's a program, it's a blueprint, it's an operation and that's my great frustration
[50:14.320 --> 50:21.080]  is yes the blueprint's very scary, yes it's horrible, yes it ends with 90% of us depopulated,
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.920]  collapse of civilization by design, by a breakaway civilization absorbing us.
[50:25.920 --> 50:30.280]  But if we know the blueprint, we can stop it but you've got to have the courage to admit
[50:30.280 --> 50:33.920]  you're in trouble.
[50:33.920 --> 50:37.560]  It's like most women when a thug pulls a gun out and says get in the van, they get
[50:37.560 --> 50:40.960]  in the van, they get raped and killed but some women fight back, hit, run, whatever
[50:40.960 --> 50:46.120]  and most of the time they live but most people especially women will Stockholm syndrome and
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.760]  well I guess he'll be nice, no he's not going to be nice when you're tied up in that basement.
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.560]  So you might as well just slap the gun out of the hand, run away, zigzag, attack them,
[50:55.560 --> 51:00.300]  whatever it is you decide to do but don't just give in and follow orders, stop acting
[51:00.300 --> 51:01.300]  like a jellyfish.
[51:01.300 --> 51:07.360]  So here's myself and Mike Adams in 2010 and then clips from 2020, here it is.
[51:07.360 --> 51:11.440]  That during the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, number 2002 they wanted to have
[51:11.440 --> 51:18.320]  forced inoculation nationwide for smallpox and it came out in news articles that oh yeah,
[51:18.320 --> 51:23.960]  the feds are going to use sports stadiums and postal offices as the centers where if
[51:23.960 --> 51:29.640]  you refuse to be inoculated you'll be taken and be held but will also forcibly inoculate
[51:29.640 --> 51:33.160]  if we're given the orders at these injection facilities.
[51:33.160 --> 51:37.720]  You have to be able to track people so they have to have a tracking technology in place
[51:37.720 --> 51:42.480]  now whether that's an RFID chip which they're calling now electronic tattoos or whether
[51:42.480 --> 51:47.880]  that is a vaccine bracelet or some kind of paperwork that you have to carry around.
[51:47.880 --> 51:52.720]  I'm not sure yet but that's step one so they got to have a vaccine tracking technology.
[51:52.720 --> 51:56.400]  I think that's where some of the military defense contractors are coming into play
[51:56.400 --> 51:59.920]  but then secondly you got to look at the quarantines.
[51:59.920 --> 52:05.560]  If they mandate vaccines, those who refuse to be vaccinated are very likely to be quarantined
[52:05.560 --> 52:12.080]  which means perhaps the CDC would be leasing camps or facilities like FEMA camps from
[52:12.080 --> 52:19.280]  FEMA just as an example and then making those quarantine camps where they throw you in with
[52:19.280 --> 52:22.280]  all the other people who have refused the vaccines.
[52:22.280 --> 52:26.040]  Go up to the front, I say to the guy behind the counter to show him where you're massing
[52:26.040 --> 52:32.080]  he goes now it's all BS and I said I'll tell you what's BS brother, horse inoculations
[52:32.080 --> 52:33.080]  next year.
[52:33.080 --> 52:36.640]  They're trying to make us take tracker wraps in our phones that are already been activated
[52:36.640 --> 52:40.400]  whether you want them or not but make you accept it, be able to travel around and live
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.760]  your life, this is their full revolution against us, this is the globalist move.
[52:45.760 --> 52:49.920]  We're going to see people getting in folks' faces and they leave their houses and say
[52:49.920 --> 52:53.720]  let me see your phone app and your phone will have a government app or through a corporate
[52:53.720 --> 52:59.040]  app that you're authorized and they'll scan it and go and it's going to be every season
[52:59.040 --> 53:03.040]  and every oh new viruses and oh you had your inoculation even though it doesn't cover you
[53:03.040 --> 53:07.320]  and if you say hey the inoculation doesn't cover you they'll go you're arrested that's
[53:07.320 --> 53:14.720]  disinformation Oliver Darcy says so but remember when they forcibly inoculate you and your
[53:14.720 --> 53:22.720]  child has a convulsion and dies they killed your child and that was twenty months ago
[53:22.720 --> 53:26.360]  show let me let me show you know what I mean do you want to see these current headlines
[53:26.360 --> 53:30.000]  because everything I just said a year and a half ago two years ago ten years ago twelve
[53:30.000 --> 53:38.480]  years ago it's all right here Dr. Fauci Americans will just have to deal with yearly booster
[53:38.480 --> 53:43.680]  shots if they become necessary they were always planned.
[53:43.680 --> 53:49.800]  Study shows Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness declines after six months to almost zero MSM
[53:49.800 --> 53:53.640]  but that was months ago now they're saying it's Omnicron so you're not supposed to say
[53:53.640 --> 54:00.280]  that the thing never worked. COVID-19 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine effectiveness wanes to forty
[54:00.280 --> 54:06.040]  seven percent that's in six months now we know a year later to almost zero. Pfizer vaccine
[54:06.040 --> 54:13.560]  protection wanes after six months study finds. WebMD and now today Twitter will now ban users
[54:13.560 --> 54:18.320]  that repeatedly claim vaccinated people can spread COVID. In fact you're more likely to
[54:18.320 --> 54:25.880]  do but it's okay you'll just be banned if you talk about it. Fauci says Omnicron can
[54:25.880 --> 54:30.400]  evade vaccine protection but boosters help so see first they're like okay the vaccine
[54:30.400 --> 54:34.520]  didn't work oh it's Omnicron don't you don't say it was always a fraud you need new shots
[54:34.520 --> 54:39.920]  because Omnicron. How Alex Jones say twenty months ago this was coming. Spill Gates put
[54:39.920 --> 54:45.720]  out a prospectus to shareholders that this would be shots seven to ten times a year.
[54:45.720 --> 54:49.560]  Your jab is only twenty three percent effective against Omnicron. South African studies says
[54:49.560 --> 54:55.440]  but you're not allowed to say that. I mean Twitter said so. Omnicron can strike within
[54:55.440 --> 54:59.600]  four months of vaccination seniors all the African doctors said oh you gotta get every
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.960]  four months now and it goes on and on and on. We got so much more having to hit on that
[55:04.960 --> 55:09.040]  front and people paralyzed and being killed and admitting it and their families speak
[55:09.040 --> 55:13.080]  out they get banned or arrested in Australia. Oh and they're now arresting members of the
[55:13.080 --> 55:17.160]  government randomly senators in Australia that are against the lockdowns and taking
[55:17.160 --> 55:20.720]  them to facilities saying we're just going to see if you're sick and when they test not
[55:20.720 --> 55:25.160]  positive they say we don't care you're locked up now. I mean it's all just to pretend oh
[55:25.160 --> 55:28.440]  we're not rounding up and arresting you because we don't like your politics. No no no it's
[55:28.440 --> 55:32.720]  build back better wink wink you and takeover but we're locking you up that's all coming
[55:32.720 --> 55:38.920]  up next hour as well and oh they're now handing out over schools around the western world
[55:38.920 --> 55:46.000]  heart attack kits because they say the new normals lots of heart attacks in small children.
[55:46.000 --> 55:54.520]  So that's coming up next hour as well. But Roger Stone you know has the comics you know
[55:54.520 --> 55:58.880]  the comics that have Joe Biden on the comics that say world government's good. The comics
[55:58.880 --> 56:05.320]  like Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live. Well the comics say gang raping his wife is a good
[56:05.320 --> 56:09.200]  thing. That's their little message will gang rape your wife that's got stage 4 cancer.
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.080]  You're just like why would they do that because it's about them being the villains and getting
[56:13.080 --> 56:19.200]  away with it trying to invoke Stockholm syndrome. All right we're going to go to break. This
[56:19.200 --> 56:23.760]  audience of badasses of every race, color and creed that love God and love justice don't

[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:33.080]  in twenty fifteen agriculture distribution giant Cargill sponsored the food reaction
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:39.160]  game a simulation that would end with a global carbon tax game itself it is an opportunity
[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:44.160]  to live into the future it cause people to put the possibilities are and in that process
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:48.640]  I think they realize what they have to start to do today to prepare for the future according
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:54.880]  to the Cargill website sixty five international policy makers academics business and thought
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:01:00.280]  leaders gathered at the world wildlife funds headquarters in Washington DC to simulate how
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:06.440]  the world would respond to a future food crisis the game took the players from the year twenty
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:12.520]  twenty two twenty thirty as it was projected the decade brought two major food crisis with
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:18.360]  prices approaching four hundred percent of the long term average a raft of climate related
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:24.520]  extreme weather events governments toppling in Pakistan and Ukraine and famine and refugee
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:31.320]  crisis in Bangladesh Myanmar Chad and Sudan the challenges and crisis that we were assigned
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:36.360]  are exactly what we expect to see in the future so you've got famine you've got increased
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:40.880]  pests you've got the role of climate change in the world the most eye catching result
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:47.360]  however was a deal between the US the EU India and China standing in for the top twenty
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:54.920]  greenhouse gas emitters to institute a global carbon tax and cap co2 emissions in twenty
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:02:00.760]  thirty situation got so dire that they were forced into bilateral and even trilateral
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.720]  negotiations and meetings and we were able to get all the other major parties to greet
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:09.160]  up a price on carbon and then to immediately start moving towards trading years later Cargill
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:15.240]  would come to be known as the worst company in the world regarding environmental conservation
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:20.400]  accountability while the food game itself would prove to be a big corporation global
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:29.000]  carbon tax plan directive today with partners like the IMF World Bank and the World Trade
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:36.080]  Organization we're calling to bringing in carbon pricing to triple it on emissions up
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:39.840]  from about twenty one percent of emissions covered by a price on pollution around the
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:47.680]  world to get to sixty percent covered by a price on pollution by twenty thirty the carbon
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:56.240]  carbon tax has what is called a regressive impact in the sense that it's paid by everybody
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:01.200]  whether you earn fifty thousand francs a year or a hundred thousand francs or two hundred
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:07.040]  thousand francs you pay just based upon your consumption of the poor and anybody and for
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:12.920]  people at the bottom of the wage scale it's a death sentence a big problem the impact
[1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:19.080]  of corporate manipulation via the plan demics tyrannical impact on third world countries
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:24.960]  has already created a famine affecting sixty eight million people proving there is nothing
[1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:30.600]  organic about the state of the geopolitical landscape corporations and their lackeys inhabiting
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:37.480]  the corporateocracy in washington dc are waging a covert war on western civilization in order
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:44.360]  to manifest the trillion dollar tyrannical windfall of global carbon taxes and the implementation
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:51.000]  of great reset totalitarianism as the greatest transfer of wealth and world history continues
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:59.120]  on its course of human enslavement john bound reporting what you just saw is everything
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:06.400]  this is an organized elite war on the general public to consolidate power control and starve
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:11.960]  us while they go all the earth collapsing we're saving you from it when their lockdowns
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:16.920]  and their policies created and it's in all the war games so look at this article we're
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:22.080]  going to cover it up roger stone leaves us imf ten countries simulate cyber attack on
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:26.200]  global financial system and they admit it's coming it's imminent they're going to launch
[1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:30.920]  it and use it to further devastate economies and consolidate control just like they wore
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:35.320]  game with event two oh one right before covid they've already told their people who are
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:40.240]  all in on it at every level get ready the next agenda build back better is to collapse
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:44.680]  civilization their environmental terrorist it has nothing to do with the environment
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:50.280]  it's about total control this is imminent imminent massive cyber attacks that are going
[1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:54.560]  to make the covid lockdowns look pale and significance stay with us roger stone straight
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:05:02.720]  ahead for a fraction of the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:09.120]  unaware that there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:14.960]  on the other who are literally trying to create a post human world for the united states of
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:18.760]  brazil and of course triggered by the briggs in the uk nations were pulling out of the
[1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:23.360]  private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched their great reset
[1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:30.240]  and their program after collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:36.160]  down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:40.960]  we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this world government system
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:47.840]  could win they released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned
[1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:52.240]  about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't meet us because of our free speech
[1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:56.920]  and our guns so the global corporate combine released covid-19 and you know the rest is
[1:05:56.920 --> 1:06:09.600]  free expose this paradigm and we win
[1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:19.920]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones well it came
[1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:26.920]  out three years ago that chuckie schumer in a consortium of democrats work with abc nbc
[1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:34.800]  cbs cn and msnbc and others to literally write the programming but particularly in late night
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:41.840]  comedy that's now the main voice the main propaganda with joe biden just on jimmy fowlin
[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:47.080]  reading off a teleprompter reading off q cards and bumbling all over himself and so when you
[1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:55.480]  hear things come out of saturday night live making jokes about gang raping somebody's
[1:06:55.480 --> 1:07:00.720]  wife who's fighting for their lives with cancer that's a threat ladies and gentlemen you had
[1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:04.840]  to everything that's been done to roger stone and now myself and some of the stuff i can't
[1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:08.960]  tell you on air yet but if you think what you've heard on the news is bad it's very bad and
[1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:16.040]  when i am persecuted behind the scenes they don't mean to talk about it yet there's there's
[1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:21.320]  reasons not to but i'm not worried about myself or roger being in our tech we're tough guys
[1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:26.600]  we can handle it i mean certainly we signed on for this but america's children america's
[1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:30.280]  women all of our innocent people are under attack and as trump always said they're not
[1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:35.960]  coming after me because they want me i'm standing in the way for you and it's totally true so
[1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:41.080]  when they come out and do this it's totally and completely a threat and it's disgusting
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:46.400]  and they also attacked jesus and said the baby jesus is basically a prostitute being pimped
[1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:52.400]  out by his father i mean this is all a pedophile culture as you now see coming out with chris
[1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:57.320]  qualmo's producer doing the sex training of little children i guess for sex ops i mean
[1:07:57.320 --> 1:08:02.400]  it's all coming out these are some monstrous people roger stone i know you're on the road
[1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:06.320]  in tulsa oklahoma and other big speaking engagement thanks for getting back to your hotel room
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:11.200]  even though you're busy to pop in and address the situation i want to play the clip though
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:16.000]  so people have it in context and we'll get your take on people talking about gang raping
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  your wife who's fighting for her life here it is
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:29.880]  from advisor roger stone who dressed his glasses on with the sharpie refused to cooperate
[1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:35.000]  with the committee investigating the january 6 attacks those stones said he would be open
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:42.480]  to sitting in the corner watching the committee take turns on his wife are you fucking kidding
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:47.040]  me okay guys you're supposed to delay that out there we got some cussing there at the
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:57.040]  end so roger again this is this is so sick and it just goes to the the system collapsing
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:03.760]  what do you make of this well it's it's uh it's disgusting i mean it's repugnant last
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:09.000]  night around 11 o'clock my phone started ringing off the hook with people outraged about this
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.880]  i just took a call from general michael flan who is furious is dressed it on his telegram
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:20.760]  a social media uh attacking a 75 year old woman who's struggling with stage 4 cancer
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:25.160]  and winning her battle with cancer by the way if you understand cancer you understand
[1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:31.280]  that stress is the worst thing that drama is the worst thing who would attack a 75 year
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:35.720]  old woman struggling for cancer you don't like me attack me make fun of my glasses help
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:42.360]  yourself but this is the lowest of the low i mean it really you can hear the can to laugh
[1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:47.840]  track there's nobody laughing at this because it's not funny gang rape is not funny there's
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:54.240]  nothing funny about it i'm disgust it is just beyond belief but i think it really shows
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:58.800]  the desperation you've got qualmo in deep trouble you've got his producer running reported
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:03.040]  pedophile ops training children for sex ops raping children to train them like epstein
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:08.920]  dead you've got chris wallace leaving you've got brian williams leaving because of no ratings
[1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:14.280]  i mean this really is a zombie media and and now it's it's it's it's running to the life
[1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:19.040]  boat of comedy shows but that's destroyed the ratings of those as well and it's now made
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:25.280]  them one of the most hated groups anywhere here's the most amazing thing else as of this
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:31.200]  thursday the doctors say my wife is cancer free whoa which means one this epic struggle
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:38.280]  with cancer and she's done it using a homeopathic holistic and all natural uh uh programs and
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:44.280]  therapies certain drugs the fda will never approve for use against cancer so god has
[1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:49.120]  answered our prayers god has answered the prayers of people around the globe now the
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:55.280]  key is her for her to stay cancer free uh and one of the things is a minimum of stress
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:01.600]  of certain tranquility so uh in the wake of this good news in the wake of this miracle
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:07.880]  by jesus christ and it is a miracle because they told us she had little chance of survival
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:12.320]  and i am grateful to the lord for deliver healing my life i have to put up with this
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:19.440]  crap uh now the key is to remain cancer free which means she has to stay on this all natural
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:24.680]  regimen we're talking about massive vitamin infusion and i want to talk about that with
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:29.720]  you in a moment but let's just go back to this attack who brings somebody's wife into
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:34.560]  it and the committee with you and i is talking about once they testify we're gonna arrest
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:38.920]  them for lying as if we're gonna lie why do we go into a political thing where the head
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:42.560]  of the committee suing trump and where they say we're gonna give them this information
[1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:46.680]  for a criminal indictment when they're saying we're guilty up front that's not how american
[1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:50.760]  justice works if it was a real committee that had real republicans on it wasn't illegal
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:54.480]  committee which they on record admit it's not it's not constituted properly i would
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:59.880]  go testify we have nothing to hide january six but this is just outrageous yeah look
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:04.880]  i've already been down this road they would they hope to fact frame me in some new fabricated
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:10.080]  process crime which is why i will invoke my fifth amendment rights no one in the right
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:14.960]  line would go answer questions from this partisan witch hunt the chairman of the committee has
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:20.600]  already sued donald trump proving that he is not uh this is not an honest fair fact
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:25.600]  finding mission adam schiff we already know the story about him believe me i've been down
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:31.400]  this road i'm going to invoke my fifth amendment rights not to be framed which is what this
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:37.680]  is really all about now again roger stone did nothing wrong your point is and i'm in
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:41.520]  the same boat i think the listeners for being my life we're fighting for them they're fighting

[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:16.520]  world for the united states to brazil and of course triggered by the briggs in the uk
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:21.200]  nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched

[1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:33.840]  nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't

[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:19.280]  the same episode they talk about gang raping of Roger Stone's wife who I knew had stage
[1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:22.760]  forward he was really worried about even a month ago that she wouldn't make it privately
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:30.080]  and now they say that it's the cancer is in remission so that's super wonderful news in
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:35.240]  the same show about raping her last night they had a hip hop nativity skit that I'm
[1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:41.600]  not even going to show you a baby Jesus twerking shaking his butt wanting to have sex with adults
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:46.520]  and his father selling him into sex slavery and then of course during the real world over
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:50.840]  at CNN with Cuomo who you know help cover up sending 20,000 people their deaths and nursing
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:56.880]  homes giving him no treatment this monster pig with a individual now indicted with witnesses
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:00.760]  of getting women to train their nine-year-old daughters that he would have sex with for
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:07.240]  sex training to serve the elite so the burgeoning Jeffrey Epstein probably trained by people
[1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:13.320]  should look into all that Brian Williams signs off on MSNBC's 11th hour the last time I'll
[1:24:13.320 --> 1:24:20.120]  show myself out he got caught saying five years ago he was shot down in a helicopter
[1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:25.720]  by an RPG turned out none of it was true no all of it was alive just like Senator Blumenthal
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:31.960]  Mr. Stolen Valor and then he goes on to say but America's so evil Republicans are so bad
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:37.440]  he says I'm a conservative and and and America's bad and Trump's bad and the conspiracy terrorists
[1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:45.200]  are bad you're a piece of filth all you do is lie another piece of filth lowest ratings
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:50.360]  in the whole 24 hours on Fox News couple hundred thousand viewers other smallest shows that
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:56.040]  over a million a half Chris Wallace the toady of the establishment saying that oh Biden gives
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:00.560]  incredible speeches and Biden's so smart and the vaccine works so well I mean whatever
[1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:05.280]  he says is the opposite if he tells you it's midnight it's high noon if he tells you it's
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:10.360]  you know blue sky outside you better believe it's the end of the world he's delighted honored
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:16.360]  and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his big pedophile team over at CNN the actual quote
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:22.680]  was honored and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his great team yes it's a perfect place
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:27.320]  for you never trumpet Chris Wallace announces he's leaving Fox News because I guess they're
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:34.040]  not friendly so his way of things so Chris Wallace quits Fox this is my final Fox Sunday
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:41.520]  show there you go and he'll be going over to CNN where there's just such wonderful wonderful
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:48.080]  people that reportedly run sex training dungeons where the mothers introduced their children
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:55.080]  to sex ops for the group that runs the CIA a CNN runs the CIA I mean let's be clear the
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:26:00.920]  CNN is the highest level of filth in America it's an intelligence agency in and of itself
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:07.240]  dedicated to evil dedicated to murder dedicated to the Georgia guide stones dedicated to destruction
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:13.200]  of this country and the highest rating of evil I would give any public organization I mean
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:21.400]  it is it is it is Satan's armpit to say the least and just an absolute enemy of the people
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:26.560]  and just remember you've got there's Gisling Maxwell the Queen's cabin with Jeffrey Epstein
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:32.360]  well trained by MI six in sex ops and then you've got Gisling Maxwell with the Steve Jobs
[1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:37.400]  wife who funds most liberal organizations here she is saying the great fake child sex
[1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:41.280]  trafficking epidemic she heard publication just says there's no sex trafficking nobody's
[1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:44.720]  hurting children everything's fine that's who they are just remember that but they're
[1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:52.280]  liberal so it's okay so I thought I would just spend a few minutes on that and then
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:55.200]  we come back in a few minutes because I want to just really have plenty of time to get
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:00.880]  to this liberals use deadly tornadoes to attack Republicans on climate change Biden calls
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:06.160]  on EPA to investigate role of climate crisis in deadly tornadoes FEMA administrator says
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:10.240]  extreme weather going to be our new normal because of climate change oh yeah tornadoes
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:17.000]  are new now also Biden delivers global warming word salad and remarks on deadly Kentucky
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:22.960]  twisters all of oh and Jesse small I mean excuse me not just a small representative
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:28.640]  swallows well has come out and blamed Rand Paul for the tornadoes so all of that's coming
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:34.480]  up over a hundred feared dead in Kentucky alone tornadoes ripped through the heartland
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:40.200]  we've got all of that but these tornadoes really happened unlike the attack on Jesse
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:48.120]  small it or small a as some of the comedians have called him so we're going to go to break
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.840]  and we're going to come back and we're going to look at this fraud we're going to hear
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:56.560]  from the CIA director about the tornadoes and on whether the CIA create tornadoes not
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:28:04.720]  from Alex Jones but I'm gonna tie this whole paradox together when we return so again this
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:12.300]  is not a spectator sport this is a war the propaganda wouldn't be necessary if a situation
[1:28:12.300 --> 1:28:18.880]  was hopeless you are the resistance you are the answer so start your own show go talk
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:23.520]  to Congress go talk to your local city council run for school board run for Congress run for
[1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:29.360]  governor doesn't matter get involved educate people speak up stand up against them and
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:34.560]  share info wars dot com news wars dot com and banned on video that's why we're still
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:38.800]  on air that's why we're still fighting and now we're entering the time when everything
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:44.720]  we said is coming true and our credibility goes up like a spacex rocket so we're going
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:51.120]  to cover it all on the other side info wars dot com tomorrow's news today but the people
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:29:02.560]  won't be warned if you don't share the word I want to explain something that is absolutely
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:07.000]  key to understanding our world it's very very simple but the most of all don't know the
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:13.640]  privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:20.200]  of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:27.640]  property energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created
[1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:32.200]  thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed
[1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:37.480]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:42.400]  gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:48.080]  everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force the
[1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:52.840]  collapse of civilization making the companies they do find the only things left standing
[1:29:52.840 --> 1:29:57.280]  this is the great reset this is what's happening now warn everyone it's the only way to stop
[1:29:57.280 --> 1:30:03.240]  it so when I first started taking survival shield basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight
[1:30:03.240 --> 1:30:08.160]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard
[1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:12.320]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:16.400]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with
[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:19.840]  that shield you had you know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:26.040]  that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:30.760]  was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and over
[1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:35.680]  the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically
[1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:40.160]  all of your supplements they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently
[1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:44.560]  is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but
[1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:49.120]  anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist
[1:30:49.120 --> 1:30:53.560]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully
[1:30:53.560 --> 1:31:00.160]  said brother I thank you so much for calling godspeed in late August in full war saw an

[1:32:10.360 --> 1:32:15.680]  to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly
[1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:21.280]  stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive
[1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:26.600]  mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:31.560]  is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things
[1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:37.160]  to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:42.680]  from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of
[1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:47.640]  convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a years worth

[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:57.160]  how about got Christ nothing else like it they don't want you to have it all right let's
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:06.760]  get into the serious news here did you ever think about how when there's an earthquake
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:16.760]  or a volcano or a tornado or a major storm dust storm you name it wildfires you're told
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:21.640]  without any evidence that it's your fault because you're not paying enough taxes because
[1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:25.800]  you've got a car because you've got a swimming pool because you flew an airplane because
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:37.680]  you had children because you drank a coffee out of a plastic cup and you know some of
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:40.800]  that's true things we do are bad for the earth that we should make things cleaner and we've
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:49.360]  done that but hijacking that 30 years ago was in Ron back in the 90s early 90s coming
[1:35:49.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  up with the plan is was late 80s so it's over 30 years ago wow to put a carbon tax monitoring
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:36:00.920]  system on all human activity to control everybody and it's a very destructive tax because it
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:09.280]  hurts the poorest people and so as soon as I saw yesterday they said this is the worst
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:17.080]  tornado in U.S. history I noticed the article on CNN total liars literally run by pedophiles
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:21.280]  wasn't giving any proof so it looked up the history of storms it turns out they had one
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:26.400]  in what was it 1914 it killed 200 plus people and they had a bunch of others that killed
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:31.360]  over 100 but this is in the top 10 number of people ever killed by tornado group of
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:37.320]  10 or tornadoes and when our populations double what it was 100 years ago it's surprising
[1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:44.760]  it hasn't been 300 I mean if they had 200 dying 100 years ago in a storm this is 130
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:49.040]  140 we're not sure yet it's still terrible well then there's more people there's more
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:54.840]  spots when a storm forms now to hit it so a hundred and something people is not the record
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:59.040]  storm it's a lie so it shows you the whole premise of what they're saying is a lie and
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:06.000]  they're saying you are to blame the president has socky has come out I've got the stacks
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.840]  here I've got the clips you've already seen it you don't need me to make you subject you
[1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:14.760]  to the puppet president that stole the election we're not supposed to say that obviously he
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:20.740]  stole it so now liberals are not liberals they're leftist control freak corporate minion
[1:37:20.740 --> 1:37:26.840]  criminals liberals use deadly tornadoes to attack republicans on climate change I thought
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:33.400]  it was warming Biden calls on EPA to investigate role of climate crisis in deadly tornadoes
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:38.120]  london guardian FEMA administrator says extreme weather going to be our new normal because
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:43.000]  of climate change that's right people are starving to death they say in Africa because
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  of climate change no it's because there's been years of lockdown starving in the death
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:54.520]  that's actually what's happening Biden delivers global warming word salad in bizarre remarks
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:59.920]  but don't worry disgusting California representative and Chinese communist agent Eric Swallows well
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:03.920]  takes opportunity after more than 70 dead in Friday's tornadoes slam Kentucky Senator
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:10.760]  Rand Paul that's right it's his fault when he came on the show about that he just said
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:16.560]  Rand Paul doesn't care what the hell does that mean so this is all voodoo this is all
[1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:24.600]  mumbo jumbo but let's talk about reality when they try to say that you having a car
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:28.680]  having a house having an air conditioners bad they want you to tax you and track you
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:32.920]  and control you and they put in the new infrastructure bill that within three years you'll be tracked
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:37.480]  in live time in your car with a tracker chip that watches and listens to you and breathalyses
[1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:43.200]  you this is part of the technocracy they admit for the carbon tax tied to the vaccine passport
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:49.880]  this is this is admitted this isn't me 20 years ago telling you now this is all confirmed
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:55.640]  but of course when a cow passes gas or a human does it changes the climate and methane is
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.960]  part of our atmosphere a good part of it and so is carbon dioxide and so is oxygen and
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:04.800]  so is water and so is sunlight those are the four ingredients of the carbon cycle and if
[1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:10.800]  they can list that as bad and say that's evil well literally they'll tax you to breathe
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:18.480]  so we know that they there was a Nobel Prize won in 1992 for sprayed aerosolize out of chemicals
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:22.800]  added to jet fuel to create nuclei to block the sun and bounce it back into space but
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:26.480]  you can also spray other nuclei that make the ultra violent radiation come through and
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:30.400]  stay in the earth and greenhouse and they admit tens of billions of years spent by
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:35.920]  the department of energy and others in classified programs manipulating the earth's weather
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:40.840]  so when we say hey you're weather controlling maybe what you did contributed to this they
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:47.760]  say we're conspiracy theorist when it's a fact but what they do is secret but then when
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:51.200]  they just pointed us and say it's your fault we're supposed to accept that and if you say
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:55.200]  it wasn't man made global warming cause of tornadoes you get censored on the internet
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:40:03.480]  now official but I could play you a hour long lecture by John Brennan when he was CIA director
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:07.400]  six years ago you're about to see part of it admitting that oh other governments don't
[1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:11.520]  like what we're doing it could cause weather problems weather weapons that were developed
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:18.160]  in the fifties I had the father weather weapons on captain Livingston so they just think you're
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:22.360]  stupid and they don't want you knowing they're doing all this and they've got carbon systems
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:29.920]  they're putting in that big huge geo engineering systems terraforming systems that are sucking
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:34.840]  carbon dioxide out of the air when it's a trace gas that we need and was hundreds of
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:38.920]  times higher millions of years ago than it is now that's why plants and animals were
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:44.800]  so much bigger and healthier that we've adapt the live in less air this is insane ladies
[1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:51.240]  and gentlemen here is Brennan talking about weather modification here it is another example
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:56.960]  is the array of technologies often referred to collectively as geo engineering that potentially
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:01.360]  could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change one that has gained
[1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:07.960]  my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or s a i a method of seeding the
[1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:12.240]  stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:19.120]  that volcanic eruptions do in s a i program could limit global temperature increases reducing
[1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:23.440]  some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:29.560]  time to transition from fossil fuels this process is also relatively inexpensive the
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:33.720]  national resource research council estimates that a fully deployed s a i program would
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:40.240]  cost about ten billion dollars yearly as promising as it may be moving forward on s a i would
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:44.800]  also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:49.120]  on the technical side greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany s
[1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:55.320]  a i to address other climate change effects such as ocean acidification because s a i
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:42:01.120]  alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on the geopolitical side the
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.840]  technologies potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:13.160]  the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations others might
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:18.920]  seize on s a i's benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:23.400]  and as with other breakthrough technologies global norms and standards are lacking to
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:28.760]  guide the deployment and implementation of s a i and other geo engineering initiatives
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:35.400]  and i could go on and on and on and on about the things that fascinate me but rather than
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:41.920]  talk about them i thought it stopped here okay so the question is did biden last february
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:46.200]  this year order the power turned off in texas they did officially they wouldn't let them
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:52.920]  up the power now we know that so the question is did they use weather weapons to cause the
[1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:58.560]  tornadoes that's a legitimate question to ask alex jones alex jones here to make a
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:04.440]  very important announcement to our amazing listeners and viewers we have produced a limited

[1:46:58.940 --> 1:47:03.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:47:03.500 --> 1:47:04.740]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:04.740 --> 1:47:20.740]  All pirates, yes they rob I, sold I to the merchant ships, minutes of the day to guy,
[1:47:20.740 --> 1:47:28.740]  from the bottom list it's show, but my hand was made.
[1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:32.740]  There is a ten billion dollar a year program, Brennan admits it, it's already deployed,
[1:47:32.740 --> 1:47:36.740]  so when he talks to the public about oh we could deploy it, it's already deployed.
[1:47:36.740 --> 1:47:41.740]  That they used even very primitive versions of against the North Vietnamese that would cause tornadoes,
[1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:44.740]  that would cause up to ten feet of rain on the Ho Chi Minh trail,
[1:47:44.740 --> 1:47:52.740]  and we know that the Air Force was doing weather modification in 1998 in South Texas and killed more than 30 people.
[1:47:52.740 --> 1:47:54.740]  It was even on the news that the Air Force was involved.
[1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:57.740]  They even throw it in our face.
[1:47:57.740 --> 1:48:01.740]  So you just heard Brennan last segment here on the Alex Jones show, former director of CIA
[1:48:01.740 --> 1:48:03.740]  at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:48:03.740 --> 1:48:08.740]  You can just type in councilonfarnrelations.org, geoengineering.
[1:48:08.740 --> 1:48:17.740]  Just type that into a search engine, councilonfarnrelations.org, cfr.org, geoengineering.
[1:48:17.740 --> 1:48:23.740]  And you'll see dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens.
[1:48:23.740 --> 1:48:27.740]  You just type it in, just type it right in right there.
[1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:35.740]  You just type it in cfr.org, geoengineering, geoengineering, geoengineering.
[1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:41.740]  And you can read that for yourself.
[1:48:41.740 --> 1:48:48.740]  And they talk about the aerosolized programs and all the things they're doing.
[1:48:48.740 --> 1:48:50.740]  And here's another one.
[1:48:50.740 --> 1:48:54.740]  Then we see all these disasters and all these problems and they say it's our fault.
[1:48:54.740 --> 1:48:57.740]  Well, they're up there messing with the weather.
[1:48:57.740 --> 1:49:01.740]  You know, I was told this by engineers, one of which I knew that took me to dinner with more engineers
[1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:09.740]  and he thought I thought he was crazy, 25 years ago.
[1:49:09.740 --> 1:49:16.740]  And they said, listen, we're engineers and these were, you know, the green engineers, successful people.
[1:49:16.740 --> 1:49:21.740]  They said they're putting in Doppler radar, federally funded, at all these cities and towns.
[1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:26.740]  They said, listen, they're putting power in 5, 10, 20 times, being on the unit, what is needed for that.
[1:49:26.740 --> 1:49:33.740]  And we've been told that it's really to be able to ionize particulate in the air for weather control.
[1:49:33.740 --> 1:49:39.740]  And then years later, I saw it in mainline news out of Dubai and out of China that they were putting up Doppler radar.
[1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:48.740]  And it said it doubles as Doppler radar, but it also can be powered up to control the weather.
[1:49:48.740 --> 1:49:53.740]  And the U.N. and all of them are developing it, setting it up.
[1:49:53.740 --> 1:49:57.740]  And then they treat you like an animal, like a dumb idiot.
[1:49:57.740 --> 1:50:01.740]  And Fauci tells you Santa Claus is real, he got a shot, that's not true.
[1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:04.740]  He also tells you the shot protects you, that's not true.
[1:50:04.740 --> 1:50:10.740]  Just as fake as Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy.
[1:50:10.740 --> 1:50:15.740]  And then when you say, hey, I'm to blame for the tornado, but you're actually doing weather modification.
[1:50:15.740 --> 1:50:21.740]  They attack us and say, Jones says Obama sent a tornado to attack Oklahoma City.
[1:50:21.740 --> 1:50:23.740]  Remember that one that killed a bunch of people?
[1:50:23.740 --> 1:50:27.740]  Brett had just given a speech six years ago, the tornado hit.
[1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:29.740]  I said, I wonder if that was a weather weapon.
[1:50:29.740 --> 1:50:31.740]  We should have a debate about that.
[1:50:31.740 --> 1:50:34.740]  Because they blame global warming again, they blame you.
[1:50:34.740 --> 1:50:37.740]  And I just said, hey, probably that happened naturally.
[1:50:37.740 --> 1:50:40.740]  That's tornado alley, but they're the ones running around with weather weapons.
[1:50:40.740 --> 1:50:43.740]  They're the ones saying they've got all this and proving they do.
[1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:45.740]  Shouldn't we talk to them?
[1:50:45.740 --> 1:50:50.740]  Oh, Alex Jones claimed Obama sent the tornadoes.
[1:50:50.740 --> 1:50:54.740]  Oh, no, your CIA director just gave speeches about how you can control tornadoes.
[1:50:54.740 --> 1:50:58.740]  And I interviewed experts that were involved in all of it, it's true.
[1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:03.740]  So that's where they are, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what they're doing.
[1:51:03.740 --> 1:51:06.740]  And what they can do is take two weather systems that are already coming together
[1:51:06.740 --> 1:51:08.740]  and make it way more deadly.
[1:51:08.740 --> 1:51:12.740]  Or they could use these technologies to knock out hurricanes
[1:51:12.740 --> 1:51:14.740]  that they can see coming from a long way away.
[1:51:14.740 --> 1:51:16.740]  It's really hard to deal with things like tornadoes, it's too volatile,
[1:51:16.740 --> 1:51:18.740]  but that's why they study it and test it.
[1:51:18.740 --> 1:51:22.740]  But the point is that's all going on and the breakaway civilization of the globalist
[1:51:22.740 --> 1:51:25.740]  doesn't want us to have an adult discussion about the weather modification
[1:51:25.740 --> 1:51:28.740]  or the global treaties or the UN laws
[1:51:28.740 --> 1:51:31.740]  or how they've announced global government weather control systems.
[1:51:31.740 --> 1:51:34.740]  If you're a radio listener, you're thinking, wow, that sounds crazy.
[1:51:34.740 --> 1:51:40.740]  TV viewers saw the crew put the CFR documents on television.
[1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:43.740]  They're on the screen for you to go look it up yourself,
[1:51:43.740 --> 1:51:48.740]  just like animal-human hybrids, just like the pedophile ranks.
[1:51:48.740 --> 1:51:52.740]  These people are in charge, they're playing God,
[1:51:52.740 --> 1:51:56.740]  and their sacrament is raping children.
[1:51:56.740 --> 1:51:58.740]  They're the last people that should be in charge,
[1:51:58.740 --> 1:52:01.740]  but because they're so evil, they have a drive to be in power
[1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:05.740]  so they can play God and do whatever they want to you and your family.
[1:52:05.740 --> 1:52:10.740]  Here's this article from Zero Hedge. It links to local news and more.
[1:52:10.740 --> 1:52:14.740]  California has $300 billion in secret money a year.
[1:52:14.740 --> 1:52:17.740]  Now you know why they're so crazy. They've bought the government off.
[1:52:17.740 --> 1:52:20.740]  That's why even low-level bureaucrats are making $2 million a year.
[1:52:20.740 --> 1:52:23.740]  Even in small towns, city managers, $2 million a year.
[1:52:23.740 --> 1:52:26.740]  Suddenly, people that are making a million a year living in $5 million houses,
[1:52:26.740 --> 1:52:32.740]  no one knows why. It's a criminal mafia takeover, pedophile storytime,
[1:52:32.740 --> 1:52:37.740]  forced inoculations. All of it is about them putting their dirty hands on you
[1:52:37.740 --> 1:52:39.740]  and playing God.
[1:52:39.740 --> 1:52:44.740]  And this article breaks down how people do four-year requests,
[1:52:44.740 --> 1:52:47.740]  and they're told there's $300 billion a year you don't get to know.
[1:52:47.740 --> 1:52:52.740]  They actually said in the four-year deal where they charged them $1,250 even asked the question.
[1:52:52.740 --> 1:52:55.740]  They opened a records request that it's best you don't know,
[1:52:55.740 --> 1:53:01.740]  it's, quote, for your own good to not know where the $300 billion of your money goes.
[1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:05.740]  And that's not enough for these globalists. They don't want to just steal the money.
[1:53:05.740 --> 1:53:08.740]  They want to devalue it all to plunge things even further
[1:53:08.740 --> 1:53:14.740]  because they're going to manage that whole collapse.
[1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:17.740]  Yeah, these people are terrorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:53:17.740 --> 1:53:20.740]  They're a big corporate terrorist group with all their aiders and the betters
[1:53:20.740 --> 1:53:22.740]  that are in on it and know what happens.
[1:53:22.740 --> 1:53:25.740]  And I learned something years ago that really upset me.
[1:53:25.740 --> 1:53:29.740]  I learned a lot of people that were good-tuned and didn't believe this show.
[1:53:29.740 --> 1:53:32.740]  And a lot of people actually were evil-tuned and learned how stuff worked
[1:53:32.740 --> 1:53:35.740]  and used this show to join the globalist.
[1:53:35.740 --> 1:53:38.740]  That's how, wow, you imagine you put the blueprints out of this evil
[1:53:38.740 --> 1:53:41.740]  and how they're doing it, and a bunch of people have used the show
[1:53:41.740 --> 1:53:45.740]  to discover this exist to try to go join it.
[1:53:45.740 --> 1:53:50.740]  My broadcast has been a college for criminals and globalist scum
[1:53:50.740 --> 1:53:55.740]  who aspire to higher levels.
[1:53:55.740 --> 1:53:59.740]  They're not the dare program. They thought it would help kids not use drugs.
[1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:01.740]  Turned out it actually made them use drugs.
[1:54:01.740 --> 1:54:03.740]  And now, overall, we've done good.
[1:54:03.740 --> 1:54:05.740]  Overall, justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[1:54:05.740 --> 1:54:09.740]  Tell the truth. And if somebody uses the truth, you know, of,
[1:54:09.740 --> 1:54:11.740]  hey, we got to call the police.
[1:54:11.740 --> 1:54:13.740]  We got to go help somebody.
[1:54:13.740 --> 1:54:16.740]  A car turned over on the road and it's crazy.
[1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:18.740]  There's like gold bars on the ground.
[1:54:18.740 --> 1:54:20.740]  And then your neighbor conks you on the head
[1:54:20.740 --> 1:54:23.740]  because they don't want to go save the people and not have the gold bars for themselves.
[1:54:23.740 --> 1:54:25.740]  That's not my problem.
[1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:28.740]  But what's crazy is good people can't believe all this evil.
[1:54:28.740 --> 1:54:34.740]  Criminals hear it and go out and find out it's true and join with it.
[1:54:34.740 --> 1:54:39.740]  And now the whole thing's coming to an end.
[1:54:39.740 --> 1:54:43.740]  And these psychos have created a collapse they're never going to get out of.
[1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:46.740]  You know, I forgot to ask, who's hosted Sunday Live Good Night?
[1:54:46.740 --> 1:54:50.740]  I know that Owen was up in Dallas at that big event.
[1:54:50.740 --> 1:54:52.740]  I apologize. I had so much family stuff come up.
[1:54:52.740 --> 1:54:54.740]  I didn't go. Over 10,000 people were there.
[1:54:54.740 --> 1:54:56.740]  I heard it was just incredible.
[1:54:56.740 --> 1:54:59.740]  But Owen's going to be, and I'll go to some more of those big events.
[1:54:59.740 --> 1:55:01.740]  I went to one in San Antonio a month ago.
[1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:03.740]  It was amazing. 5,000 people.
[1:55:03.740 --> 1:55:05.740]  But I just was unable to go.
[1:55:05.740 --> 1:55:09.740]  But I apologize. All the listeners that went up there.
[1:55:09.740 --> 1:55:12.740]  So here's Smith, host of American Journal.
[1:55:12.740 --> 1:55:15.740]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m. at infowars.com
[1:55:15.740 --> 1:55:17.740]  on radio stations and TV stations across the country to pick it up.
[1:55:17.740 --> 1:55:20.740]  He's going to be hosting two hours of Sunday Live.
[1:55:20.740 --> 1:55:23.740]  It only has six minutes of ads an hour for local stations.
[1:55:23.740 --> 1:55:26.740]  No network ads.
[1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:31.740]  Six minutes an hour for local stations that want a really powerful Sunday night show,
[1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:37.740]  hosted by Owen Schreuer, myself, and sometimes Christy Lee and Harrison Smith.
[1:55:37.740 --> 1:55:43.740]  We all rotate through that show because it's important to be here seven days a week.
[1:55:43.740 --> 1:55:45.740]  I was here, of course, on Saturday as well.
[1:55:45.740 --> 1:55:49.740]  And I'm not bragging. I'm just saying I'm committed and I'm in this fight.
[1:55:49.740 --> 1:55:53.740]  And in the new year, I'm going to start weeknight shows.
[1:55:53.740 --> 1:55:55.740]  And I'm going to do so much more.
[1:55:55.740 --> 1:55:57.740]  And the more they try to silence us, the more I'm going to fight back.
[1:55:57.740 --> 1:55:59.740]  But that's not the main reason I fight so hard.
[1:55:59.740 --> 1:56:01.740]  We're being vindicated. This is our time.
[1:56:01.740 --> 1:56:03.740]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:06.740]  Everything we did was to get us to this point.
[1:56:06.740 --> 1:56:09.740]  And like any long 12-round heavyweight boxing match,
[1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:12.740]  it's those last few rounds where you got to just turn it on.
[1:56:12.740 --> 1:56:16.740]  You got to dig down there to the energy you didn't know you had and just turn it loose.
[1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:19.740]  And you know, instead, I've hit my second wind.
[1:56:19.740 --> 1:56:24.740]  I feel energized and just absolutely empowered because of your prayer.
[1:56:24.740 --> 1:56:27.740]  So out of everything you do, please continue to pray for M4 Wars.
[1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:29.740]  Please continue to spread the word about the links.

[1:56:33.740 --> 1:56:35.740]  And whenever you do, share the articles and videos,
[1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:38.740]  because that's how we reach all these new people that are so hungry for the truth.
[1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:40.740]  And then tell them, if you found this to be informative,
[1:56:40.740 --> 1:56:43.740]  share it with others and then tell them to share it with others
[1:56:43.740 --> 1:56:45.740]  and tell them to share it with others passing on.
[1:56:45.740 --> 1:56:48.740]  Hey, here's the link passing on. Let's save the country.
[1:56:48.740 --> 1:56:51.740]  Let's save the world. This guy was way ahead of the curve.
[1:56:51.740 --> 1:56:55.740]  And we can get ahead of the curve. We can beat this together.
