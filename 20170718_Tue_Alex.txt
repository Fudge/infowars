[00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:09.248]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:12.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, the 18th day of July, 2017.
[00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.252]  We have a massive, incredibly important transmission lined up.
[00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:19.294]  But first, key intel from the one, the only, Mark Dice.
[00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:23.056]  He was, you know, he was, he was living the dream.
[00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.378]  That was our dream, you know, and it was squashed up.
[00:00:26.378 --> 00:00:29.960]  My son was, our son was the second of four shot that night.
[00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.983]  And, um, we've lost everything.
[00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:37.087]  He was my only child.
[00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:37.988]  I want some action.
[00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:41.173]  If this would have been done years ago, my son would still be here.
[00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:45.534]  This is not anything you want anybody to ever go through.
[00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:46.975]  I want some action.
[00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:51.697]  I don't want anybody else in my family, and I don't want anybody else to feel what we have to feel.
[00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:57.421]  This is what some politicians in the country have decided is acceptable for us.
[00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.062]  It's not acceptable.
[00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:07.727]  While these politicians are sitting at home on the holidays, all warm and cozy with their families, most of us are at the cemetery.
[00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:09.108]  And it's just not acceptable.
[00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:14.911]  And I'm tired of our politicians not caring about their fellow Americans.
[00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:23.961]  When did it ever become more important to our elected officials to protect illegal criminals in our country and not care about us?
[00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:30.628]  The man that murdered my father was deported twice previously and returned to our country illegally.
[00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:37.133]  This senseless crime has affected my family and I in many ways that are unexplainable.
[00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.976]  The pain is tremendous and it's something we'll never get over.
[00:01:42.512 --> 00:01:46.213]  I think it's important that we focus on these laws and getting them passed, such as Kate's law.
[00:01:46.213 --> 00:01:52.075]  And definitely most importantly for me personally is the Davis-Oliver Act.
[00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:58.758]  We need our law enforcement officers to have more information about these people that are in our country illegally.
[00:01:58.758 --> 00:02:04.079]  And so we can go ahead and get them detained, and so this can't happen to another family.
[00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.121]  My daughter, Christy Sue Pina, she was
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.907]  Murdered, strangled, stabbed, raped, sodomized.
[00:02:14.907 --> 00:02:20.415]  Her nude body was thrown in an artichoke mill in the middle of winter.
[00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:25.363]  And what I think that we're, Mr. President, here is trying to do
[00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:28.485]  It's the best thing ever.
[00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:33.529]  And if you need a pen with a lot of ink, I got one of those too.
[00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.191]  And I'm all for everything that you do.
[00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:41.634]  We gotta put our people safe, just like they said over there.
[00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:43.375]  They protect them.
[00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.697]  That's not right.
[00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:47.678]  Americans first.
[00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:48.559]  Americans first.
[00:02:49.483 --> 00:02:55.466]  So why do we have to encounter any type of violence?
[00:02:55.466 --> 00:03:01.668]  And I'm sorry, these laws that are trying to be passed, most of them are common sense.
[00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:06.190]  And until this happened to me, I thought this is what was in place.
[00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.071]  And to find out it wasn't was
[00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:11.934]  That's terrifying to me.
[00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:23.723]  And I am telling you, these congressmen and senators that don't vote for these laws, the blood is on their hands for the next victim and that victim's family.
[00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:25.084]  I'm a legal immigrant.
[00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:27.726]  And I did it the right way.
[00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:31.530]  I came here knowing I wanted to be here.
[00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.072]  I had to go through certain steps, so I did that.
[00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:36.354]  And I'm a proud citizen now.
[00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:39.985]  And I had one child, my son Dominic.
[00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:41.366]  I brought him with me.
[00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.128]  That's all I got.
[00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:45.170]  He was my only child.
[00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.836]  Mr. President, since I had no family left, I wanted to commit suicide.
[00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:53.878]  My fiancÃ© didn't know.
[00:03:53.878 --> 00:03:55.419]  I wanted to go.
[00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.760]  I wanted to be with my son.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.544]  And on June 16th, when you came down the escalator,
[00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.201]  And you mentioned those words, illegal immigration.
[00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:07.744]  I was walking through my living room and I dropped to my knees.
[00:04:07.744 --> 00:04:12.187]  Because it was my little sign from God, you're not doing anything, you stay around.
[00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:20.914]  And then a month later, I met you personally in Los Angeles, where you were the only one that ever met with us and became our voice.
[00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:24.857]  So you're not only my hero, my president, you are my lifesaver.
[00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:27.038]  I wouldn't be here without you.
[00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:28.940]  The one thing that I think that
[00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:39.176]  You, Mr. President, have realized that every one of our children's deaths has been preventable.
[00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.821]  All the deaths of our loved ones, these are preventable.
[00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:53.336]  And Mr. President, Chairman Goodlatte, I think you guys realize that, and that's why you're doing what you're doing, and I want to thank you both for what you're doing.
[00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:55.958]  Passing these laws is instrumental.
[00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:03.364]  I don't think I would wish the devastation that we felt every day on anyone.
[00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.872]  Do you remember Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, also the highest-ranking U.S.
[00:05:13.872 --> 00:05:16.053]  politician to be sent to prison?
[00:05:16.053 --> 00:05:23.456]  Hastert was a small-town wrestling coach in Illinois when he was what Judge Thomas Durkin of the federal court described as a serial child molester.
[00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:31.840]  Because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out, Hastert was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in, if you can believe that.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.041]  He did go down for illegal hush money.
[00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.305]  To the tune of at least $3.5 million.
[00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:42.012]  He was fined $250,000 and sentenced to 15 months in prison.
[00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:43.534]  Hardly justice.
[00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:48.100]  But now, the serial child molester is free once again, after serving only 13 months.
[00:05:49.602 --> 00:05:56.444]  Judge Durkin also said, there's nothing more disturbing than having a child molester and Speaker of the House in the same sentence.
[00:05:56.444 --> 00:05:57.464]  I disagree.
[00:05:57.464 --> 00:06:02.786]  There's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year in prison.
[00:06:02.786 --> 00:06:04.486]  Won't see that on CNN.
[00:06:04.486 --> 00:06:06.947]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:12.598]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:12.598 --> 00:06:20.323]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:20.323 --> 00:06:28.949]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air-raid sirens.
[00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.372]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:38.135]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics, the destroyer of
[00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:39.275]  We're good to go.
[00:07:07.503 --> 00:07:10.524]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:07:10.524 --> 00:07:14.725]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:21.427]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:07:21.427 --> 00:07:25.168]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:07:25.888 --> 00:07:45.953]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:49.494]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:07:50.054 --> 00:08:01.298]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:08:01.298 --> 00:08:06.400]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:08:19.485 --> 00:08:26.049]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.049 --> 00:08:32.072]  Out of my way, out of my day, out of your mind, into me.
[00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:38.336]  Into no one, into not one, into your separality.
[00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:41.278]  It's strong, what's wrong?
[00:08:41.278 --> 00:08:43.199]  I've already heard this song.
[00:08:46.477 --> 00:08:55.703]  We're live broadcasting worldwide on the 18th day of July 2017 from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:57.344]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:57.344 --> 00:09:10.433]  We have several informative guests joining us today, including former Congressman Ron Paul on the economy, on North Korea, on globalism's decline, and so much more.
[00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.334]  Wow, look at these headlines.
[00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:14.396]  We have the Federal Reserve coming out.
[00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:26.568]  And announcing they're going to have big rate increases in the next few months and that drove down the dollar and is starting to put a dent in Trump's recovery.
[00:09:26.568 --> 00:09:30.695]  But then you've got other numbers coming in of even more jobs flooding back into the country.
[00:09:32.561 --> 00:09:47.668]  And massive increases in tourism, while Europe and the rest of the world sees massive declines in tourism, namely because of the fact that much of the world is in a depression right now.
[00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:52.230]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article, links to the Associated Press.
[00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.012]  Tourism up under Trump, collapses in Europe following terror and migrant invasion.
[00:09:58.382 --> 00:10:04.025]  Speaking of that, if I wanted to really sit here and bash Radical Orthodox Islam as taking over, I could.
[00:10:04.025 --> 00:10:12.370]  I don't even cover the dozens and dozens of stories I have in my stack every day that I never even get to.
[00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:19.054]  Like this one, up on Infowars.com, linking right through to major German newspapers like Der Spiegel.
[00:10:19.054 --> 00:10:26.679]  Germany's Syrian hairdresser, hailed as a model of integration, slits his female employer's throat.
[00:10:29.497 --> 00:10:31.499]  Oh, that's so sweet!
[00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:32.980]  Okay, that's good!
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.501]  More and more!
[00:10:57.884 --> 00:11:16.515]  More and more, I am going to... Every time we report on people screaming Allah Akbar and stabbing men, women, and children, I'm going to play clips from the Time Warner hit piece they put out via Super Deluxe, where they make it look like I'm just making stuff up, where I go, we're going to stab your daughter at the mall.
[00:11:16.515 --> 00:11:20.478]  We're going to stab your wife, your son.
[00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:26.982]  That was a real article I was reading, where the police chief came out and said, Somalis are wonderful, this is an Islamic attack.
[00:11:27.682 --> 00:11:32.525]  And there was another stabbing like a day later at a university in Ohio.
[00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:39.369]  So they had a couple of stabbings in Minnesota, then one in Ohio, then one in Texas, then one in New York, and then just a whole bunch of these attacks.
[00:11:39.369 --> 00:11:42.130]  And the news was like, we love our Somalis!
[00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.931]  We love our Muslims!
[00:11:43.931 --> 00:11:45.512]  Oh, they're so good!
[00:11:45.512 --> 00:11:47.974]  Oh, they're so sweet!
[00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:49.314]  So there it is.
[00:11:49.314 --> 00:11:50.335]  Germany.
[00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.576]  I shouldn't laugh about it.
[00:11:51.576 --> 00:11:54.798]  Syrian air dresser hailed as a model of integration.
[00:11:55.728 --> 00:11:57.049]  That's a quote.
[00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.711]  Slits his female employer's throat.
[00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.773]  And then they got all these articles with her groveling and talking about how nice he was.
[00:12:02.773 --> 00:12:08.858]  I mean, it's just a fact that 98% of the rapes in Sweden are Islamists doing it.
[00:12:08.858 --> 00:12:13.141]  And then the news has been ordered to say, quote, Swedish men arrested for rape.
[00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:16.824]  And then they're released with counseling.
[00:12:16.824 --> 00:12:21.648]  They don't even get prison time in places like the Netherlands, in places like Sweden.
[00:12:21.648 --> 00:12:24.450]  That's mainstream, cuckold news.
[00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:29.490]  Because they're part of the globalist club.
[00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.390]  Orthodox Islam supports pedophilia.
[00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.912]  Orthodox Islam supports enslaving women.
[00:12:33.912 --> 00:12:35.192]  The globalists are all about it.
[00:12:35.192 --> 00:12:36.413]  It's psychotic.
[00:12:36.413 --> 00:12:40.595]  It wants to overthrow the West, so they love it.
[00:12:40.595 --> 00:12:46.978]  And that leads me, of course, to all the other news I have on that similar subject.
[00:12:46.978 --> 00:12:55.042]  Dennis Hastert reportedly procured young boys for the Republican Party's leadership so that they could
[00:12:56.041 --> 00:13:02.946]  Bugger them is the term for raping a young boy, I guess, so that Hastert and his cohorts could bugger small boys.
[00:13:04.312 --> 00:13:12.376]  Young men, young boys, and of course we have NAMBLA and the liberal parties in Europe trying to legalize all that, but not in time for Hastert.
[00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:20.080]  He spent 13 months in prison for buggering and procuring young boys.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:30.445]  He was taken from nowhere, run by the Republican leadership for the House, was the shortest-serving Republican ever to be made the Speaker because he was such a horrible, demonic jellyfish.
[00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:34.087]  And now he has been released.
[00:13:34.087 --> 00:13:37.708]  Dennis Hastert wants sex abuse accuser to return the hush money.
[00:13:37.708 --> 00:13:44.951]  Yeah, he's suing, suing the folks that, you know, dared expose him.
[00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:45.792]  Actually, they didn't.
[00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:49.553]  Other people did, but still he says, all the money I paid you is not worth it now.
[00:13:49.553 --> 00:13:51.274]  Can I have that money back?
[00:13:51.274 --> 00:13:56.076]  And look, I'm in a wheelchair now for everybody's sympathy, so it's okay that I'm a PBP.
[00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:02.440]  Who looks like the brother of the guy that shot Congressman Scalise, just saying.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.040]  Congressman Scalise has been exposing the pedophile rings.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:18.803]  But notice he got 13 months, and they hushed it all up just like Penn State, or just like the new Pope and his deputy Pope caught raping, indicted hundreds of young boys.
[00:14:18.803 --> 00:14:24.984]  Again, a procurer, a Renfield supplying, ex-Speaker Dennis Hastert released from prison,
[00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:47.142]  Former US Speaker Dennis Hastert has been released from a federal prison 13 months after he began serving a sentence for a bank fraud conviction linked to his effort to buy the silence of former student he sexually abused and took on special wrestling trips for Republican events during his days at a high school wrestling coach.
[00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:51.346]  Now, guess who got to spend almost nine years, even if he gets paroled,
[00:14:52.574 --> 00:14:55.275]  By the time of the parole hearing, it'll be nine years.
[00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:56.035]  O.J.
[00:14:56.035 --> 00:15:05.239]  the Juice Simpson, who I'm not saying is a great guy, but the point is, is that he did get double jeopardy.
[00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:08.120]  He did have somebody reportedly that stole a bunch of his memorabilia.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.781]  That's what he claimed.
[00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:10.181]  It was a crime of passion.
[00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:12.682]  I'm not defending it, but it wasn't like a cold-blooded robbery.
[00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:18.785]  He did go rob, though, the materials from his former business associate.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.503]  And so he spent nine years, he's up for parole this year.
[00:15:24.503 --> 00:15:30.247]  They think he may get out, except that there was a cookie caper where someone gave him a cookie from the mess hall.
[00:15:30.247 --> 00:15:33.890]  Nine years, no disciplinary action, exemplary record.
[00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.613]  He may still stay in prison because of a cookie someone gave him and they caught him with a cookie.
[00:15:38.613 --> 00:15:40.674]  He was honest, he said, they said, where'd you get the cookie?
[00:15:40.674 --> 00:15:42.515]  And they said, well, from the mess hall.
[00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:47.319]  So he was caught like private pile and full metal jacket with a jelly donut.
[00:15:48.837 --> 00:16:00.948]  Basically, and so he may not get released, but if he does, nine years for stealing back some of his own memorabilia, Dennis Hastert, 13 months.
[00:16:00.948 --> 00:16:03.891]  So I don't think it's because Hastert's white.
[00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:06.253]  It's because Hastert is an elitist pedophile.
[00:16:07.486 --> 00:16:17.916]  Just like the Pope's deputy, just like everybody else in the power structure, you can't swing a stick in Washington without running into a PBP, a pot-bellied pedophile.
[00:16:17.916 --> 00:16:26.505]  And that's why there's been over 10,000 arrests and counting, and the courts are just shutting it down, basically, because it is becoming a huge national security issue.
[00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:31.409]  Just like in England, the former Prime Minister confirmed to be not just raping children,
[00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:39.557]  But having satanic ceremonies, killing them and then raping their dead bodies.
[00:16:39.557 --> 00:16:45.962]  They now broke into a basement that Jimmy Savelle had, where he would rape and kill the children.
[00:16:45.962 --> 00:16:56.789]  And then he would also, when he couldn't get a kid he could kill, he would go down daily to the morgue after car wrecks, and he and his cohorts would have sex with the dead boys and dead little girls.
[00:16:56.789 --> 00:17:01.793]  He liked dead little girls, but he would also have sex with the dead little boys.
[00:17:03.243 --> 00:17:09.666]  Investigation of satanic child sex abuse involving dead UK Prime Minister begins in Edmonton with hypothesis.
[00:17:09.666 --> 00:17:18.369]  No, I've had guests on that talk to the witnesses when he would bring in a little girl, lay out the plastic, they would slit their throats in front of them.
[00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.831]  I reported this 12 years ago before it was ever implicated.
[00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:27.813]  And then he would masturbate while their blood sprayed all over the room onto the plastic.
[00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:28.954]  He'd like to get his hands dirty.
[00:17:29.969 --> 00:17:32.351]  So, remember, that's who's running the show.
[00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:38.837]  They want to kidnap your children and rape them to death, but first they want to scare the hell out of them.
[00:17:38.837 --> 00:17:40.439]  They feed off the energy.
[00:17:40.439 --> 00:17:44.863]  And the sex cult is angry at us because they know we're coming for them.
[00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:50.689]  I need a bumper sticker that says, my wife's not street legal.
[00:17:50.689 --> 00:17:51.409]  I thought of that this morning.
[00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:53.031]  It'd be a cool shirt, right?
[00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.212]  My wife's not street legal.
[00:17:55.771 --> 00:18:00.152]  I mean, who couldn't ever get sick of God's wonderful creation, women?
[00:18:00.152 --> 00:18:06.794]  I have zero attraction to children, and that's because I'm not a devil worshiper.
[00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:16.236]  I want to protect children, I want to empower children, and I want to gouge the eyeballs out of pedophiles with my thumbs.
[00:18:16.236 --> 00:18:16.876]  Not because I'm a
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.882]  sadistic person because I'm a good person.
[00:18:21.882 --> 00:18:31.026]  I have instincts to want to get my hands around their necks and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze until their eyeballs pop out.
[00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:42.032]  And we need to get the spirit back again in this country of resisting evil and triumphing over it with the zeal and fury and power that God has given us.
[00:18:42.032 --> 00:18:47.095]  And I swear on the altar of God before His Son Jesus Christ
[00:18:49.158 --> 00:18:57.623]  That I will resist the satanic hordes and their pedophile armies, and I beg you to join me in this quest.
[00:18:57.623 --> 00:19:02.085]  We will bring down the forces of Lucifer.
[00:19:02.085 --> 00:19:11.210]  And believe me, you look at these people, why are we ruled by PBPs like Hastert and Salon Magazine promoting pedophilia?
[00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:17.264]  And the fetish of five-year-old girls and all the rest of this insanity.
[00:19:17.264 --> 00:19:19.205]  But notice what the PBPs do.
[00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:25.749]  They make normal, like an 18-year-old dating a 16-year-old, they make that statutory rape or pedophilia when it's not.
[00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:34.493]  And most of the prisons are full of people that got caught drunk peeing in the parking lot or got caught, you know, when they're 18, dating their 16-year-old girlfriend.
[00:19:34.493 --> 00:19:37.795]  The prisons are full of those because that's not pedophilia.
[00:19:37.795 --> 00:19:39.616]  That's nothing.
[00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:41.097]  That's how the pedophiles got it all set up.
[00:19:42.645 --> 00:19:45.746]  Their days are coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:45.746 --> 00:19:46.647]  It's unbelievable.
[00:19:46.647 --> 00:20:00.053]  And they're all over the news, all over Nickelodeon, all over MTV, sexualizing your children, wanting to destroy their innocence, because they hate you, and they hate God, and they hate your family, and they want to rule you and dominate you and strangle your spirit.
[00:20:00.053 --> 00:20:01.413]  Don't let them.
[00:20:01.413 --> 00:20:02.814]  Rise up against them.

[00:24:43.833 --> 00:24:46.615]  They literally crawl out from under us.
[00:24:46.615 --> 00:24:48.496]  They have green looking skin.
[00:24:48.496 --> 00:24:51.558]  And they run around screaming we love Satan.
[00:24:51.558 --> 00:24:55.421]  We want to eat babies.
[00:24:55.421 --> 00:24:57.123]  I have them on video.
[00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:07.815]  Hillary's in the creepy, weird, sick stuff, man.

[00:25:14.058 --> 00:25:15.519]  What the hell?
[00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:19.381]  That woman, number one, is ugly.
[00:25:19.381 --> 00:25:23.263]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[00:25:23.263 --> 00:25:25.624]  I told her, and Obama, just stink.
[00:25:27.083 --> 00:25:30.926]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:42.193]  We're near the roof and by a pot then a darkness.
[00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:46.235]  A hobbling round coming after us.
[00:25:46.235 --> 00:25:50.077]  My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go out.
[00:25:56.195 --> 00:26:02.657]  And I can have your kid and tell him, for a liberal one.
[00:26:02.657 --> 00:26:04.498]  Dennis Hastert.
[00:26:26.115 --> 00:26:28.676]  Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:28.676 --> 00:26:30.637]  So let's look at it.
[00:26:30.637 --> 00:26:38.139]  We need to worry about Somali terrorists in the U.S.
[00:26:51.647 --> 00:26:51.947]  U.S.
[00:26:51.947 --> 00:26:57.452]  News Report Edits Out Allah Akbar During Russian Ambassador's Assassination.
[00:26:57.452 --> 00:26:59.434]  Three People Killed In Fresno Shooting Spree.
[00:26:59.434 --> 00:27:02.617]  Shooter Screamed Allah Akbar, Hated White People.
[00:27:02.617 --> 00:27:06.961]  But The News Edited That Out And Changed It To God Is Great.
[00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:09.944]  AP.
[00:27:09.944 --> 00:27:10.384]  AP.
[00:27:10.384 --> 00:27:11.966]  Fresno Shooter Didn't Yell Allah Akbar.
[00:27:11.966 --> 00:27:13.107]  He Said God Is Great.
[00:27:14.753 --> 00:27:15.574]  Here's the story today.
[00:27:15.574 --> 00:27:16.354]  Germany.
[00:27:16.354 --> 00:27:23.240]  Syrian hairdressers hailed as a model of integration, that's a quote, slits his female employer's throat.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.805]  After a little over a year on the job, he decided to slit his female employer's throat.
[00:27:28.805 --> 00:27:31.367]  Oh, we love our Somalis.
[00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:34.850]  Oh, we love our Muslims too.
[00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.891]  We love our Muslims.
[00:27:36.891 --> 00:27:38.713]  Oh, that's so good.
[00:27:38.713 --> 00:27:39.714]  Oh, that's so sweet.
[00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:45.458]  And so we'll play that each day with the stabbings, the killings, the Allah Akbar's.
[00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:47.940]  Oh, that's so good!
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.741]  Oh, that's so sweet!
[00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:53.623]  And then we've got to bend over backwards and never report any of this is happening.
[00:27:53.623 --> 00:27:56.065]  And then say that we're bad.
[00:27:56.065 --> 00:28:00.468]  Now, let me continue here, because I didn't get to this yesterday, but since I mentioned it.
[00:28:00.468 --> 00:28:08.593]  ISIS members destroy Catholic Church in the Philippines, and I had the London Guardian with the Pope saying, it makes me sick to my stomach when I hear about Christian roots.
[00:28:08.593 --> 00:28:09.913]  We let more Muslims in.
[00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:10.414]  They're good.
[00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.212]  As they announce, we're taking over, your countries are ours.
[00:28:15.212 --> 00:28:19.153]  Mass rape festivals, huge articles everywhere about that.
[00:28:19.153 --> 00:28:21.354]  ISIS members destroy Catholic Church in the Philippines.
[00:28:21.354 --> 00:28:23.936]  Here, let's roll this video for TV viewers.
[00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:29.558]  I'll give you, I guess, verbal subtitles for the radio audience.
[00:28:29.558 --> 00:28:34.580]  I'll narrate.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.661]  Jesus, I'm good.
[00:28:39.545 --> 00:28:44.469]  We're now stomping on the Jesus statue.
[00:28:44.469 --> 00:28:47.212]  Cultural enrichment at its best.
[00:28:47.212 --> 00:28:51.856]  The women are ours, ah yes!
[00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:52.937]  Now we kill Mary!
[00:28:52.937 --> 00:28:58.622]  Europe is weak, Philippines weak, Christians weak, ah ha ha, we kill you!
[00:28:58.622 --> 00:28:59.423]  Ah yes.
[00:28:59.423 --> 00:29:00.764]  Pulling down the Pope, he loves you!
[00:29:00.764 --> 00:29:01.705]  He says, come on in!
[00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.272]  But he has his walls.
[00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:07.753]  Ah, he'll just beat Jesus with a hammer now.
[00:29:07.753 --> 00:29:09.234]  You guys are too dumb to even do that.
[00:29:09.234 --> 00:29:14.158]  Now let's throw the crucifix down.
[00:29:14.158 --> 00:29:15.979]  Oh, that's so good!
[00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:19.262]  Oh, that's so sweet!
[00:29:19.262 --> 00:29:22.424]  I mean, their countries are all living hells.
[00:29:22.424 --> 00:29:29.789]  Now there's the article, Islam Christianity Share Idea of Conquest, says Pope, read down, you scroll down, in there he says it makes him sick!
[00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:32.511]  He doesn't want to hear about Christian roots!
[00:29:32.511 --> 00:29:32.912]  No!
[00:29:34.636 --> 00:29:38.078]  Christianity has nothing to do with Christianity.
[00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:40.680]  And Obamacare is free!
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.544]  Now, when we return, Trump says just repeal Obamacare.
[00:29:45.544 --> 00:29:49.026]  But in the last 160 years, we have the most unproductive Congress ever.
[00:29:49.026 --> 00:29:50.227]  And why is that?
[00:29:50.227 --> 00:29:53.269]  Because they're there blocking Trump bipartisanly.
[00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.890]  Stay with us.
[00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.831]  We'll be back.
[00:29:55.831 --> 00:29:57.232]  We're on the march.
[00:29:57.232 --> 00:29:59.754]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:59.754 --> 00:30:02.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:11.542]  We must keep the Internet free from communistic government restrictions and parameters.
[00:30:11.542 --> 00:30:12.162]  Why?
[00:30:12.162 --> 00:30:14.584]  Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[00:30:14.584 --> 00:30:15.485]  Don't believe me?
[00:30:15.485 --> 00:30:16.426]  Look at China.
[00:30:16.426 --> 00:30:24.273]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger 2.
[00:30:24.273 --> 00:30:30.158]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eeyore.
[00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:35.244]  Other images, such as Winnie the Pooh in a car, have been memed alongside President Xi in his limo.
[00:30:35.244 --> 00:30:40.430]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the internet.
[00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:46.376]  This is commonplace in Communist China, as a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo,
[00:30:46.957 --> 00:30:49.779]  ...has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[00:30:49.779 --> 00:30:54.203]  Try sending his name in a message to a friend, and the message will disappear into cyberspace.
[00:30:54.203 --> 00:30:58.387]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody, and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[00:30:58.387 --> 00:30:59.948]  Keep the internet free in America.
[00:30:59.948 --> 00:31:01.149]  Stop net neutrality.
[00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:02.490]  Save meme magic.
[00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.652]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:08.946]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:08.946 --> 00:31:10.987]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:10.987 --> 00:31:12.368]  It's the air we're breathing.
[00:31:12.368 --> 00:31:13.768]  Especially for our children.
[00:31:13.768 --> 00:31:19.951]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:26.154]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems.
[00:31:26.454 --> 00:31:29.116]  ...have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:29.116 --> 00:31:36.662]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:36.662 --> 00:31:44.688]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:44.688 --> 00:31:45.649]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:46.873 --> 00:31:50.817]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:50.817 --> 00:31:54.380]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:32:01.105]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:32:01.105 --> 00:32:05.189]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:20.800]  He never gives up.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:27.243]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[00:33:27.243 --> 00:33:29.684]  That's right!
[00:33:49.487 --> 00:33:52.870]  I've got a tiger by the tail!
[00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.753]  It's plain to see.
[00:33:55.753 --> 00:33:58.815]  I won't pay you much when you get through.
[00:33:58.815 --> 00:34:00.557]  Okay.
[00:34:00.557 --> 00:34:03.219]  We've got the poll numbers, the fake polls they're putting out on Trump.
[00:34:03.219 --> 00:34:05.561]  We're going to go over that with the latest info.
[00:34:05.561 --> 00:34:11.787]  We've got Obamacare repeal stalling because of the Republican leadership.
[00:34:11.787 --> 00:34:12.808]  We've got it all happening.
[00:34:14.258 --> 00:34:16.460]  There's a headline up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.882]  It's also up on Infowars.com.
[00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:23.626]  Most Unproductive Congress in 164 Years.
[00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:26.128]  And 164 Orbits of the Sun.
[00:34:26.128 --> 00:34:31.192]  Most Unproductive Congress in 164 Years.
[00:34:31.192 --> 00:34:41.060]  Well, it was good to have gridlock and very unproductive Congress under Obama, because they couldn't get their whole globalist agenda through of carbon taxes and completely open borders and taking our guns.
[00:34:44.161 --> 00:34:52.889]  But now it's unproductive, the most unproductive, because they don't want Trump's dismantling of the globalist takeover getting through.
[00:34:52.889 --> 00:35:02.697]  But just executively, he's already hacked off four of five of the Hydra's heads, and the Hydra's only got nine heads, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:02.697 --> 00:35:09.143]  If you go back to Greek mythology, or its ethos of the Hydra.
[00:35:09.143 --> 00:35:10.724]  So he's pretty much already
[00:35:11.766 --> 00:35:12.166]  I think so.
[00:35:42.315 --> 00:35:45.056]  So more of that, that's all coming up.
[00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:47.876]  Also some other key video that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:49.937]  Dan Lyman wrote a story about it.
[00:35:49.937 --> 00:35:52.677]  Students revolt against anti-Trump teacher.
[00:35:52.677 --> 00:35:56.858]  Troll her with facts and memes.
[00:35:56.858 --> 00:36:00.179]  That's all coming up.
[00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:06.781]  And then of course I'm going to get back into ex-Speaker Dennis Hastert gets 13 months for raping little boys.
[00:36:08.097 --> 00:36:10.239]  There's a big cover-up of just how deep it went.
[00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:15.083]  He was a Renfield Procular.
[00:36:15.083 --> 00:36:17.285]  Not a Dracula.
[00:36:17.285 --> 00:36:19.787]  But they're protecting their minion, O.J.
[00:36:19.787 --> 00:36:25.112]  Simpson, for robbing some of his own memorabilia back from somebody reportedly that he had a beef with.
[00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:29.216]  I'm not defending it, but a crime of passion, a crime of business.
[00:36:29.216 --> 00:36:32.018]  He gets nine years if he gets paroled this year.
[00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:36.080]  Except for the Cookie Monster problem.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.701]  Oh, Cookie.
[00:36:37.701 --> 00:36:41.643]  He got caught sneaking Cookie out of... out of kitchen.
[00:36:41.643 --> 00:36:46.385]  And so they're looking at not letting him out of prison for robbery over a cookie.
[00:36:46.385 --> 00:36:54.168]  But if you want to rape little children, and you want to take them to the Republicans so they can rape them, then you only get 30 months.
[00:36:54.168 --> 00:36:55.649]  That's how the cookie works.
[00:36:55.649 --> 00:37:01.131]  But if you steal a cookie, then you get... then you get... then you get more prison time.
[00:37:02.947 --> 00:37:03.427]  That's right.
[00:37:03.427 --> 00:37:09.733]  There's only one thing worse than the Cruising Monster, and that's if the Marvin the Martian comes along.
[00:37:09.733 --> 00:37:10.934]  Oh dear!
[00:37:10.934 --> 00:37:15.498]  Pesky earth creature, I'll have to disintegrate you with my strontium-12 detonator!
[00:37:15.498 --> 00:37:18.941]  You know I'm having a little bit of fun today?
[00:37:18.941 --> 00:37:24.786]  I ran into a feller at a gas station last night and I was going home from work at about 7 o'clock.
[00:37:26.713 --> 00:37:30.575]  And he was behind the counter and he said, Alex, I've been listening to you for 20 years.
[00:37:30.575 --> 00:37:34.176]  I really like it when you make more jokes, because some of this stuff's depressing.
[00:37:34.176 --> 00:37:40.339]  I know it's important to get the word out to folks that don't know and kind of shake them out of their trance.
[00:37:40.339 --> 00:37:49.182]  He looked at me and he said, but I like it when you're having a little bit of fun, because I've got to turn you off after an hour or two of screaming and yelling and talking about all the devil worshippers.
[00:37:49.182 --> 00:37:50.123]  I know it's true.
[00:37:50.123 --> 00:37:53.184]  I thought, man, you're a crusty guy like out of a movie.
[00:37:54.226 --> 00:37:55.387]  I go, are you the owner of this place?
[00:37:55.387 --> 00:37:57.668]  He goes, yeah, can't find enough good employees.
[00:37:57.668 --> 00:37:59.989]  I had like a good five minute conversation with him.
[00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:01.609]  I said, you'd be a good talk show host.
[00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:07.672]  There are so many really smart guys out there and smart, smart gals as well, but they never want to get on air.
[00:38:07.672 --> 00:38:10.053]  They want to leave it up to me.
[00:38:10.053 --> 00:38:15.776]  But in the age of YouTube and radio blog and all the rest of it, all of you need to be on the air.
[00:38:15.776 --> 00:38:17.917]  That's how we're going to defeat the globalists.
[00:38:17.917 --> 00:38:18.477]  So I agree.
[00:38:19.969 --> 00:38:21.730]  I like to have fun.
[00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:40.836]  I'll be honest with you though, the audience has spoken in general, in the main as they say, and in the continuum, compendium of this little adventure we're all on together called life, the general audience does not like the humor.
[00:38:40.836 --> 00:38:47.919]  It's a very serious time, and people know it's dark, but they know admitting how dark it is is what makes us cherish the light.
[00:38:49.271 --> 00:39:01.023]  So, I should be careful not to descend into madness because we are in an insane world and truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:39:01.023 --> 00:39:03.406]  But look at Drudge Report, there are the enemies.
[00:39:03.406 --> 00:39:04.086]  You want to know?
[00:39:04.086 --> 00:39:12.155]  It's not the doddering Pelosi or the insane Maxine Waters or the self-propelled Jabba the Hutt lookalike Michael Moore that's the enemy.
[00:39:13.305 --> 00:39:14.666]  They're jokes.
[00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:16.467]  It's Mitch McConnell.
[00:39:16.467 --> 00:39:23.613]  And look at that fake psychopath face that Paul Ryan makes.
[00:39:23.613 --> 00:39:24.774]  I've studied psychopaths.
[00:39:24.774 --> 00:39:26.956]  I've studied criminals.
[00:39:26.956 --> 00:39:40.887]  And if you study most psychopaths, they look and act just like the ones that actually go out and, you know, round up folks, grab people out of shopping mall parking spaces, or kidnap women from, you know, the car wash when they're getting their car washed.
[00:39:41.738 --> 00:39:42.358]  You know, 10 p.m.
[00:39:42.358 --> 00:39:50.322]  at night, at the Haunted Car Wash, you've got most unproductive car owners in 64 years, and then there's Paul Ryan.
[00:39:50.322 --> 00:39:56.065]  Look at him with that sweet little Eddie Haskell face.
[00:39:56.065 --> 00:40:00.848]  And, gee, Mrs. Cleaver, I don't know where Wally or Beaver are.
[00:40:00.848 --> 00:40:03.349]  Let me slit your throat while your back's turned.
[00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:07.471]  But even Mrs. Cleaver knew that Eddie Haskell was a fake.
[00:40:10.782 --> 00:40:11.843]  Then you've got McConnell.
[00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:19.407]  He's a little bit better at acting like, you know, he's not a complete globalist.
[00:40:19.407 --> 00:40:24.390]  And I think he's more of just a survivor and tries to play both sides.
[00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.831]  I don't like Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, let me be clear.
[00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:31.914]  But he's not, on the Richter scale, a demon.
[00:40:31.914 --> 00:40:33.595]  This man?
[00:40:33.595 --> 00:40:39.719]  Just like I could look at Hatcher before he ever got busted and I said, if that isn't a PBP, I'm a monkey's uncle.
[00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.690]  Hot-bellied pedophile.
[00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.591]  Well, I don't think Paul Ryan's a pedophile.
[00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:57.016]  He is a twinkly-eyed, blue-eyed psychopath that thinks he's better than everybody, and has zero feelings except for himself, and all he wants is power and control, and he hates.
[00:40:57.016 --> 00:41:07.619]  Just like the niece of Martin Luther King just came out on Fox News, when I get that clip, I forgot to give it to you guys, and said that Trump is a brilliant, big-hearted, compassionate man.
[00:41:07.619 --> 00:41:09.020]  And that's exactly what Trump is.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:15.761]  Competitive, aggressive, worldly at some levels, but he isn't out to screw the average person.
[00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:19.122]  And he really hates the elites, and he wants to beat them.
[00:41:19.122 --> 00:41:27.383]  Dr. Elvita King, Trump is a leading civil rights for unborn, and she went on to say he's a compassionate, brilliant man, which is absolutely true.
[00:41:27.383 --> 00:41:28.924]  It's not about groveling to Trump.
[00:41:28.924 --> 00:41:30.044]  He's our champion.
[00:41:30.044 --> 00:41:35.105]  The whole New World Order pedophile, radical Islamic base
[00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:50.057]  The corrupt Vatican, the New World Order, the EU, the globalists, Hollywood, every sworn enemy of humanity is against Trump.
[00:41:50.057 --> 00:42:01.042]  And you look at Trump, and he's somebody who feeds off being the underdog and just feeds off the attacks and feeds off taking these people on.
[00:42:01.042 --> 00:42:01.822]  Believe me, I know.
[00:42:05.779 --> 00:42:08.060]  Because I'm the same way.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.101]  I know people's hearts, they're just like mine.
[00:42:11.101 --> 00:42:26.846]  And I can tell you, I've watched Paul Ryan, I've watched his press conferences, and I've studied psychopaths, and I've watched Ted Bundy and, you know, his hearings in court, the serial killer, and I've seen it all, and that's, they've got this fake niceness about them, but the back of the
[00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:33.162]  Your neck, the hair stands up when you just look at him and just look at Paul Ryan.
[00:42:33.162 --> 00:42:36.143]  Just type in Paul Ryan and click Google Images.
[00:42:36.143 --> 00:42:45.986]  It's all this fake little nice guy face that he makes that is totally ungenuine.
[00:42:45.986 --> 00:42:47.166]  He's evil.
[00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:48.447]  He's bad.
[00:42:48.447 --> 00:42:55.489]  Not just in his actions betraying us and saying the right thing but doing the wrong thing.
[00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:56.889]  Paul Ryan is the enemy's
[00:42:58.336 --> 00:43:00.577]  Top general right now against us.
[00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:05.501]  Let's just type in Paul Ryan, click Google Images, and let's, for TV viewers, let's look.
[00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:09.803]  Oh, just look at that.
[00:43:09.803 --> 00:43:12.225]  Danger Will Robertson.
[00:43:12.225 --> 00:43:14.246]  Captain, we have a prime computation.
[00:43:14.246 --> 00:43:24.193]  From this man's actions, his demeanor, and from his continued studied facial expressions, he is hiding serious avarice and psychopathic
[00:43:25.017 --> 00:43:27.519]  Wish for total dominion and usurpation.
[00:43:27.519 --> 00:43:29.601]  He is a usurper of all that is good.
[00:43:29.601 --> 00:43:37.568]  Prime Computation, Paul Ryan is an enemy of humanity.
[00:43:37.568 --> 00:43:43.734]  Just look at that smug, know-it-all power trip.
[00:43:43.734 --> 00:43:47.397]  My guts, my instincts, my genetics, my ancestors say, Enemy!
[00:43:47.397 --> 00:43:47.838]  Ah, look at him!
[00:44:05.321 --> 00:44:06.782]  You'll be broken, Ryan.
[00:44:06.782 --> 00:44:11.784]  Just like I told one of your little kindred minions.
[00:44:11.784 --> 00:44:16.367]  Megyn Kelly, you will fall.
[00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:18.588]  You will be broken.
[00:44:18.588 --> 00:44:20.169]  So prepare yourself, enemy.
[00:44:22.782 --> 00:44:26.866]  It'll all be done politically.
[00:44:26.866 --> 00:44:28.527]  Peacefully.
[00:44:28.527 --> 00:44:34.413]  We're going to politically tear you to pieces when we're done with you.
[00:44:34.413 --> 00:44:35.794]  You think you're on the winning team?
[00:44:35.794 --> 00:44:37.236]  You think you're in charge?
[00:44:37.236 --> 00:44:39.218]  You think you're gonna dominate humanity?
[00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:40.839]  You are going to fail.
[00:44:40.839 --> 00:44:44.242]  And when we're done, you'll be known as the Benedict Arnold you've always been.
[00:44:44.242 --> 00:44:45.844]  Make no mistake, trash!
[00:44:50.503 --> 00:44:57.930]  Before I get to all these clips and the latest fake polls and all the rest of it, will you guys bring me a keg of it in?
[00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.791]  It's in there at my desk.
[00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:08.680]  There's an open container of it because I had it in my desk yesterday back there in the control room, back by Dew's desk.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:13.184]  I kind of got lost in translation this morning when I was scrounging around for it.
[00:45:13.184 --> 00:45:14.185]  But we can put it on screen for you.
[00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:20.564]  Caveman is finally back at InfowarStore.com.
[00:45:20.564 --> 00:45:38.795]  We've done two runs of it, and it is now, according to the national manufacturer that is one of the top manufacturers in the country, you can't say the biggest because you can't tell of the three or four top companies who's the biggest organic producer, but it is now the number one selling bone broth formula in the United States of America.
[00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:43.199]  Bone broth's just gotten hot the last four or five years.
[00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:46.507]  It's the big thing with all the health nuts and experts and the rest of it.
[00:45:46.507 --> 00:45:48.351]  It's what the ancients and every culture are obsessed on.
[00:45:50.191 --> 00:46:07.335]  And one reason is it's it's it's it's we have the best seller is other folks aren't able to even get the big labs and the big companies to be able to get enough of the high-quality organic chicken bones because we do do it organic to be able to put it out.
[00:46:07.335 --> 00:46:12.316]  Chicken is the best place to get your bone broth and of course everybody knows what's in the
[00:46:14.093 --> 00:46:16.835]  What's in the marrow is the stem cells, all the rest of it.
[00:46:16.835 --> 00:46:18.937]  I mean, the whole thing is the perfect food.
[00:46:18.937 --> 00:46:22.901]  It's what our ancestors went for first.
[00:46:22.901 --> 00:46:26.744]  Everybody knows you go to a fine French restaurant, you get the bone marrow as well.
[00:46:26.744 --> 00:46:30.387]  They're in your roasted thigh bones of the cow.
[00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:36.733]  But this is from chicken, and then it's got all this other amazing stuff in it.
[00:46:36.733 --> 00:46:37.654]  It's got the
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:57.754]  Multicollagen Complex Blend from Chicken and Chicken Collagen and Chicken Broth Powder Protein, Alfalfa Herb Powder, Chaga Mushroom, Bee Pollen Powder, Turmeric Root Powder, and Goji Berry, and so much more.
[00:46:58.971 --> 00:47:03.814]  And it is the ultimate bone broth formula out there, and it is naturally chocolate flavored.
[00:47:03.814 --> 00:47:04.655]  It's got chocolate in it.
[00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.216]  That's the best flavor.
[00:47:06.216 --> 00:47:09.798]  We are working on other flavors, but they don't taste as good.
[00:47:09.798 --> 00:47:12.760]  And yes, it doesn't taste too good when we did a flavorless one.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.501]  Just a word of the wise.
[00:47:14.501 --> 00:47:15.602]  It's concentrated.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:28.695]  It's hardcore, and I'm very, very excited about it, and we just got a big shipment of it in, but it will sell out again because there is a shortage in organic chicken bone that is raw.
[00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:39.494]  There is a shortage in it because they've got to freeze-dry it, send it there, it's got to be tested, and then it's rendered down so you get the full quality out of it.
[00:47:39.494 --> 00:47:40.974]  It is amazing.
[00:47:40.974 --> 00:47:43.916]  And it is now the number one bone broth formula in the country.
[00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:46.217]  Bone broth, obviously, is very, very hot.
[00:47:46.217 --> 00:47:54.882]  And I just kept reading about it in the different literature years ago and checking out some of the formulas that were out there, and I said, they've got little bitty kegs of this that aren't even as strong, they're the same price.
[00:47:54.882 --> 00:47:56.583]  I don't want to give people double the amount.
[00:47:57.807 --> 00:48:00.770]  We're a little bit lower for the same price when it's not on sale.
[00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:05.314]  And so out of the gates, even though it's been sold out for months, it's 25% off.
[00:48:05.314 --> 00:48:08.157]  And when you purchase Tape Man, you obviously fund our operation.
[00:48:09.423 --> 00:48:15.385]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:48:15.385 --> 00:48:21.786]  See why hundreds of listeners are giving it five stars on Infowarsstore.com through our verified third-party review platform.
[00:48:21.786 --> 00:48:25.207]  Secure supply of caveman 25% off retail today.
[00:48:25.207 --> 00:48:28.568]  The turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, the bone broth caveman really is the ultimate
[00:48:29.727 --> 00:48:33.970]  Also, I told you we're running free shipping throughout the month of July, and I said 20-40% off on all our major nutraceuticals.
[00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:42.995]  The problem is, I've got to stop it because RainForce is selling out right now, so that goes back to regular price, and it'll be a while till we get more in.
[00:48:58.812 --> 00:49:02.175]  So Brain Force, that is no longer 30% off.
[00:49:02.175 --> 00:49:03.436]  Super Male Vitality is 30% off.
[00:49:03.436 --> 00:49:04.497]  Super Female, 30%.
[00:49:04.497 --> 00:49:07.480]  Ex-Fu is 30%.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.681]  Secret 12 is back in stock.
[00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:10.162]  We'll keep that at 25.
[00:49:10.162 --> 00:49:12.384]  DNA Force is back in 20%.
[00:49:12.384 --> 00:49:16.828]  So those are there, but I've had to have Brain Force today go back to regular price.
[00:49:16.828 --> 00:49:23.414]  In the next two days, I'm gonna have to go back to full price on all those and some other items that are also at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:32.115]  Because we're selling out of it, and it'll be weeks or months until more comes in, so we're gonna keep a little bit back, obviously at the regular price to help under operation.
[00:49:32.115 --> 00:49:33.897]  That's free market capitalism.
[00:49:33.897 --> 00:49:35.097]  But thank you all for your support.
[00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:42.563]  So if you want X2 or things like that, it is 30% off right now, but it is about to go back to the regular discount that's just 10%.
[00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:44.524]  We always discount 10%, and then we do 30 or 40 or more.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:57.702]  So InfoWarsLife.com, we also have the new, they've been out for a while, but we are starting carrying them, amazing colloidal silver impregnated electric toothbrushes.
[00:49:57.702 --> 00:50:05.164]  They're $19.95 when you get it with the 10 to 1 organic mouthwash we have and or the toothpaste that's non-fluoride with the colloidal silver and iodine.
[00:50:05.164 --> 00:50:10.405]  You can get a big discount across the board when you go to all three items together or get the new electric toothbrush for $24.95.
[00:50:12.245 --> 00:50:14.147]  I guess they've already lowered that, too.
[00:50:14.147 --> 00:50:17.111]  So I guess they've, even by itself, it's $9.95.
[00:50:17.111 --> 00:50:19.533]  It was $24.95 yesterday, so it's now $19.95.
[00:50:19.533 --> 00:50:20.835]  They put that on screen for me.
[00:50:20.835 --> 00:50:23.338]  So the Advanced Oral Pack, all of it's there.
[00:50:23.338 --> 00:50:24.539]  Simply amazing.
[00:50:24.539 --> 00:50:26.221]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:50:26.221 --> 00:50:26.902]  And it's simple.
[00:50:26.902 --> 00:50:28.504]  You shop with patriots.
[00:50:28.504 --> 00:50:30.206]  We fight for America, the Second Amendment.
[00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:40.813]  Basic values, religious freedom, free market, to shop with Amazon, he's sworn to destroy Trump, the Second Amendment, and bring in radical Islamists.
[00:50:40.813 --> 00:50:44.235]  Oh, by the way, I haven't even gotten to this yet.
[00:50:44.235 --> 00:50:49.917]  I'm going to lead with this in the next segment, not the whole group of clubs we've got in the Trump News.
[00:50:49.917 --> 00:50:55.179]  The UN and the EU officially are setting up a Coast Guard
[00:50:56.542 --> 00:51:00.085]  To not let the countries leave, but also bring in the Islamists.
[00:51:00.085 --> 00:51:06.529]  So you thought it was bad with Soros spending hundreds of millions every quarter to ship people in out of the Middle East?
[00:51:06.529 --> 00:51:07.530]  It's been said.
[00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.992]  Any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[00:51:10.992 --> 00:51:12.594]  Those times may be near.
[00:51:12.594 --> 00:51:13.494]  Think about it.
[00:51:13.494 --> 00:51:18.098]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[00:51:18.098 --> 00:51:22.761]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[00:51:23.081 --> 00:51:28.887]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[00:51:28.887 --> 00:51:35.593]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:38.156]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:41.397]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:09.247]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:52:09.247 --> 00:52:13.412]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:52:13.412 --> 00:52:20.081]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:52:20.081 --> 00:52:23.825]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:52:24.526 --> 00:52:43.935]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:52:44.475 --> 00:52:48.578]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:52:48.578 --> 00:52:59.766]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:52:59.766 --> 00:53:04.850]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:53:05.501 --> 00:53:12.983]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[00:53:12.983 --> 00:53:16.544]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:37.791]  Anywhere.
[00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:40.893]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[00:53:40.893 --> 00:53:41.454]  At home.
[00:53:41.454 --> 00:53:42.114]  At work.
[00:53:42.114 --> 00:53:42.915]  In the car.
[00:53:42.915 --> 00:53:44.676]  On smartphones.
[00:53:44.676 --> 00:53:47.598]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[00:53:47.598 --> 00:53:53.262]  That makes choosing radio as a place to advertise your business one of the best decisions you can make.

[00:54:19.235 --> 00:54:25.720]  I'm the enemy!
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.722]  Who are you?
[00:54:27.722 --> 00:54:33.466]  Alright!
[00:54:33.466 --> 00:54:36.648]  I'm here to ask you folks, who are you?
[00:54:36.648 --> 00:54:37.489]  What side are you on?
[00:54:37.489 --> 00:54:39.090]  I think you already joined.
[00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:46.396]  Pro-humanity, pro-innovation, pro-freedom, pro-free will, pro-wonderment, wide-eyed wonderment.
[00:54:50.728 --> 00:54:52.589]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.530]  What if I say I'm not your slave?
[00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:58.011]  Am I going to go along with your globalist operation?
[00:54:58.011 --> 00:55:00.472]  What if I say you're the pretender?
[00:55:00.472 --> 00:55:04.754]  What if I say I'll never surrender?
[00:55:04.754 --> 00:55:10.957]  Now, Peter Sutherland founded the European Union.
[00:55:10.957 --> 00:55:19.241]  You can spend hours reading his public writings, his books, where he admits he wants to get rid of national sovereignty, create a quote, technocracy computer system to rule the world.
[00:55:19.991 --> 00:55:29.277]  I can read him at Davos, Switzerland, five years ago saying they want a $100 billion per decade global government fund on carbon taxes alone.
[00:55:29.277 --> 00:55:36.983]  They want currency tax transfers on every currency transfer and they want wellhead taxes.
[00:55:36.983 --> 00:55:44.768]  Now, he said we must force Europeans out of their houses and put the migrants in.
[00:55:44.768 --> 00:55:46.830]  We must advertise the Middle East and North Africa
[00:55:48.305 --> 00:55:52.228]  To bring in Muslims, not Christians, because Christians would assimilate.
[00:55:52.228 --> 00:55:56.151]  Christian Africans have been shown to assimilate quite nicely in Europe.
[00:55:56.151 --> 00:55:59.194]  Not Muslim Africans.
[00:55:59.194 --> 00:56:03.117]  And so, here are the headlines.
[00:56:03.117 --> 00:56:10.803]  Italian officials call for investigation of George Soros supporting NGO's migrant fleet.
[00:56:10.803 --> 00:56:16.487]  And we have Peter Sutherland in the BBC saying, Europe's white, we have to get rid of the white people and it's homogeneity.
[00:56:16.487 --> 00:56:17.027]  That's a quote.
[00:56:19.824 --> 00:56:22.706]  If you want to bring in people because Europe didn't have any babies, that's one issue.
[00:56:22.706 --> 00:56:27.970]  Why bring in Muslims, tell them to keep their culture, and then cover up all the crimes they're committing?
[00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.614]  The stabbings, the murders, all of it we've already covered today.
[00:56:32.614 --> 00:56:42.942]  The poster child in Germany, this hairdresser, for bringing in the migrants that are really the Islamic invaders just slit his boss's throat.
[00:56:42.942 --> 00:56:45.845]  Oh, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims.
[00:56:47.841 --> 00:56:53.004]  Oh, that's so sweet!
[00:56:53.004 --> 00:56:59.747]  Now, here's the lightest little gem, or giblet, giblet.
[00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:07.151]  EU Foreign Policy Chief wants European Coast Guard to protect migrants.
[00:57:07.151 --> 00:57:11.192]  They've already announced an EU army that's going to march into France, Germany, the Netherlands.
[00:57:11.192 --> 00:57:15.873]  Anybody that tries to pull out... Three years ago we broke this with Niselfrage and others.
[00:57:15.873 --> 00:57:17.713]  They said, oh, there's no secret army.
[00:57:17.713 --> 00:57:18.333]  That's tyranny.
[00:57:18.333 --> 00:57:18.893]  We never do that.
[00:57:18.893 --> 00:57:20.634]  Now they're like, yeah, we got an army.
[00:57:20.634 --> 00:57:21.594]  We'll take over your country.
[00:57:21.594 --> 00:57:23.054]  And then they went further.
[00:57:23.054 --> 00:57:26.535]  Juncker, the head of the EU, the unelected EU, said, we'll bring down Trump.
[00:57:26.535 --> 00:57:30.796]  We'll bring down America.
[00:57:30.796 --> 00:57:31.136]  And now...
[00:57:33.129 --> 00:57:36.994]  EU Foreign Policy Chief wants European Coast Guard to protect migrants.
[00:57:36.994 --> 00:57:40.058]  So we're not going to have Soros bringing the illegals in.
[00:57:40.058 --> 00:57:45.225]  They're going to have a Coast Guard that brings in the Muslims.
[00:57:45.225 --> 00:57:46.848]  Let's go out to break with part of this clip.
[00:57:48.638 --> 00:58:02.368]  Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have accused the Coast Guard for abusing the migrants and sending to unknown detainee centers.
[00:58:02.368 --> 00:58:05.231]  Are you aware of this and did you discuss about it?
[00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:05.531]  Thank you.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.724]  Just like I pointed out that they put a Hitler mustache on the cover of Time on Donald Trump Jr.
[00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:16.326]  that was subliminal, that's now been basically admitted.
[00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:21.690]  Or just like I have told you about other subliminal stuff they do, and then later it comes out that indeed they are doing it.
[00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.813]  You notice the EU's army's symbol.
[00:58:25.813 --> 00:58:31.637]  You notice the EU foreign policy symbol of their State Department is an upside-down American flag.
[00:58:31.637 --> 00:58:33.699]  On screen.
[00:58:33.699 --> 00:58:34.620]  We'll put her back on screen.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.042]  You see that?
[00:58:37.042 --> 00:58:40.706]  Everything is about bringing down America.
[00:58:40.706 --> 00:58:43.048]  I wonder if it's even got 13 stripes.
[00:58:43.048 --> 00:58:47.013]  Let's count them when we come back.
[00:58:47.013 --> 00:58:50.517]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:50.517 --> 00:58:52.820]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.864 --> 00:59:08.449]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:59:08.449 --> 00:59:10.510]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:13.392]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:59:13.392 --> 00:59:14.873]  It's made in the USA.
[00:59:14.873 --> 00:59:21.696]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:59:21.696 --> 00:59:22.937]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:59:23.757 --> 00:59:33.484]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:59:33.484 --> 00:59:50.296]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:59:50.296 --> 00:59:53.458]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:59:53.598 --> 00:59:59.285]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWars line.
[00:59:59.285 --> 01:00:01.908]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.826 --> 01:00:24.470]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:28.253]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.253 --> 01:00:31.235]  I see your hair is burning.
[01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:34.237]  Let me stab you with a butcher knife.
[01:00:34.237 --> 01:00:36.919]  Hills are filled with fire.
[01:00:36.919 --> 01:00:39.141]  Thanks for bringing me in and giving me a job.
[01:00:42.641 --> 01:00:44.382]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[01:00:44.382 --> 01:00:46.784]  We love our Somalis.
[01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:48.846]  We love our Muslims.
[01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:50.747]  Oh, they're so good.
[01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.929]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[01:00:52.929 --> 01:00:58.613]  You know, they're going to rue the day they made that piece over to Super Deluxe.
[01:00:58.613 --> 01:00:59.353]  I have a check today.
[01:00:59.353 --> 01:01:01.915]  It was like 10 million views yesterday.
[01:01:01.915 --> 01:01:03.116]  But you know, that's not a big deal.
[01:01:03.116 --> 01:01:04.157]  10 million views.
[01:01:04.157 --> 01:01:08.961]  Paul and I used to, on Facebook just about six months ago, have videos with 15, 25, 35, 37 million views.
[01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:31.255]  And then I did a video about it, and they just went boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, bo
[01:01:36.778 --> 01:01:42.063]  And 90% of the comments are more on Super Deluxe, on Facebook, on YouTube.
[01:01:42.063 --> 01:01:53.373]  I mean, I gotta admit, I've spent hours reading them because they're so good, to watch the leftist converting and going, I hated Alex Jones, I believed all the hype, but I went to
[01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:59.149]  His show and actually listen to it and it's great!
[01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:00.029]  Why did I believe it?
[01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:04.650]  And I go to these people's handles, I've checked like 50 of them, I mean literally.
[01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:08.511]  They have got long-term globalist minion trendy backgrounds.
[01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:12.912]  These aren't people trolling saying I used to be a liberal or a trendy, now I'm not.
[01:02:12.912 --> 01:02:18.334]  It's people saying, man, I finally went and listened to Alex Jones and I love this guy.
[01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.254]  That's victory.
[01:02:20.962 --> 01:02:26.566]  And just on Facebook, they tell me now, on one version, 7.1 million views.
[01:02:26.566 --> 01:02:31.029]  As of Saturday, they said they had 2 million downloads at Super Deluxe.
[01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:32.109]  Who knows what it is now?
[01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:33.631]  And on YouTube, it's in the millions.
[01:02:33.631 --> 01:02:36.452]  So you add all that together, it's well over 10 million right now.
[01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:46.379]  And again, the reason it's important is it's not normally our demographic of libertarians, conservatives, people that don't live in mommy's basement.
[01:02:46.379 --> 01:02:50.322]  A lot of the comments I saw were, it's true, I've been in my mom's basement, I'm 30, I want out of it.
[01:02:51.992 --> 01:02:58.594]  92% or 93% of Hillary voters, you can Google it, of SJWs, that's mainstream news.
[01:02:58.594 --> 01:03:00.535]  93%, it's like 92.7.
[01:03:00.535 --> 01:03:04.696]  In fact, people won't believe me, just type it in.
[01:03:04.696 --> 01:03:11.098]  92 plus percent of SJWs live with their parents, is the headline.
[01:03:11.098 --> 01:03:13.238]  And they did surveys.
[01:03:13.238 --> 01:03:16.179]  And it's just incredible.
[01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:23.915]  To see them saying, I'm breaking the conditioning, it's amazing, it's true, I want out of my mommy's basement.
[01:03:23.915 --> 01:03:26.937]  And it's okay if you live in your parents' basement.
[01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:28.238]  A lot of folks do it to save money or whatever.
[01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:29.638]  In this economy, I can't blame you.
[01:03:29.638 --> 01:03:32.300]  It's just that with conservatives and libertarians, it's like 5%.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:41.186]  But let's go out to break again with the EU saying they're going to shuttle the Muslims in with the new Coast Guard, which they'll also use to harry and harass EU shipping.
[01:03:41.186 --> 01:03:41.466]  Here it is.
[01:03:41.906 --> 01:03:43.927]  You have not done enough to lick our booties, huh?
[01:03:43.927 --> 01:03:45.927]  You have not kissed my booty enough!
[01:03:45.927 --> 01:03:46.568]  Give me more, bitch!
[01:04:09.736 --> 01:04:12.059]  We will bring more in, of course.
[01:04:12.059 --> 01:04:13.280]  It'll be nice for you.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.101]  Oh, that's so good!
[01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:14.641]  Oh, that's so sweet!
[01:04:29.156 --> 01:04:31.557]  Oh, to change the logic!
[01:04:31.557 --> 01:04:38.338]  Europe collapsing, no one come for tourism, roads shut down, Muslims robbing, raping everywhere.
[01:04:38.338 --> 01:04:41.018]  We bring more and we assist!
[01:04:41.018 --> 01:04:45.259]  And then the Navy will control the... Do the nation-states have their own navies?
[01:04:45.259 --> 01:04:50.460]  And so, they're saying, the nation-states are shipping our preciouses back.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.721]  We will stop that!
[01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:56.321]  We will bring our invasion friends in to help dominate you!
[01:04:56.321 --> 01:04:57.242]  I will wear burqa!
[01:04:59.102 --> 01:05:02.549]  My daughter will have her wee-wees chopped off.
[01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:03.832]  It is liberal.
[01:05:03.832 --> 01:05:04.734]  We'll come right back.
[01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:12.372]  Do you remember Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history?
[01:05:12.372 --> 01:05:13.652]  Also the highest-ranking U.S.
[01:05:13.652 --> 01:05:15.833]  politician to be sent to prison?
[01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:23.217]  Hastert was a small-town wrestling coach in Illinois when he was what Judge Thomas Durkin of the federal court described as a serial child molester.
[01:05:23.217 --> 01:05:32.141]  Because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out, Hastert was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in, if you can believe that.
[01:05:32.141 --> 01:05:33.822]  He did go down for illegal hush money.
[01:05:34.082 --> 01:05:37.064]  To the tune of at least $3.5 million.
[01:05:37.064 --> 01:05:41.767]  He was fined $250,000 and sentenced to 15 months in prison.
[01:05:41.767 --> 01:05:43.288]  Hardly justice.
[01:05:43.288 --> 01:05:49.372]  But now, the serial child molester is free once again, after serving only 13 months.
[01:05:49.372 --> 01:05:56.237]  Judge Durkin also said, there's nothing more disturbing than having a child molester and Speaker of the House in the same sentence.
[01:05:56.237 --> 01:05:57.238]  I disagree.
[01:05:57.238 --> 01:06:01.861]  There's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year in prison.
[01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:04.242]  Won't see that on CNN.
[01:06:04.242 --> 01:06:06.723]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:24.892 --> 01:06:25.572]  We're good to go.
[01:06:46.678 --> 01:06:48.420]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:54.303]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have variable bow and crones type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[01:06:54.303 --> 01:06:54.884]  Now it's epidemic.
[01:06:54.884 --> 01:06:57.846]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[01:06:57.846 --> 01:07:00.247]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[01:07:00.247 --> 01:07:03.329]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.
[01:07:06.934 --> 01:07:16.018]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:16.018 --> 01:07:24.141]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:24.421 --> 01:07:29.304]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:29.304 --> 01:07:36.089]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:36.089 --> 01:07:43.274]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:43.274 --> 01:07:50.298]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:50.298 --> 01:07:54.241]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:54.241 --> 01:07:55.121]  We are on the march.
[01:07:55.121 --> 01:07:56.402]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:07:56.402 --> 01:07:58.263]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:37.808 --> 01:08:49.516]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, for the next 20 minutes or so, former congressman, medical doctor, really the granddaddy of the whole modern nationalist reawakening movement, Ron Paul is our guest.
[01:08:49.516 --> 01:09:04.165]  And all over the world, the libertarian constitutional reawakening of Barry Goldwater, and then right through to Ronald Reagan to a certain extent, and then of course Ron Paul has been absolutely amazing.
[01:09:05.273 --> 01:09:09.255]  So it's such an exciting time to be alive.
[01:09:09.255 --> 01:09:11.595]  So Ron Paul is down in South Texas.
[01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:15.457]  There's a big thunderstorm coming in and their power just went out.
[01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:19.318]  So as soon as they're able to reconnect, we will do that with them.
[01:09:19.318 --> 01:09:23.680]  They were literally like about to come on live with us and they said, thunderstorm overhead!
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.661]  And then it knocked the power out.
[01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:28.402]  So it looks like Imperial troops
[01:09:29.617 --> 01:09:41.886]  I have entered the base, but we will try to get hooked back up with the former congressman here in a moment to talk about the big picture and what's happening around the country and around the world.
[01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:46.810]  But look at this, look at this headline.
[01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:54.156]  Tourism up under Trump collapses in Europe following terror and migrant invasion.
[01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:55.197]  And I was making the point that
[01:09:56.226 --> 01:10:03.869]  There are seven unvetted nations that have failed governments, and Somalia hasn't had a real government in decades.
[01:10:03.869 --> 01:10:08.190]  It's beyond something out of, you know, dystopic sci-fi Road Warrior films.
[01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:14.741]  Every day or two, a Somali stabs somebody in Europe or the U.S.
[01:10:14.741 --> 01:10:25.033]  or Canada, or attacks somebody because they're not wearing a burka, or beats somebody up because they're drinking beer, or there's a new case of a woman walking her dogs.
[01:10:25.033 --> 01:10:30.038]  Breitbart has an article, and then she gets attacked because they said the dogs are unclean.
[01:10:30.936 --> 01:10:36.338]  I actually once was walking my dog in a park when I was in college and a Muslim came over and said dogs were unclean.
[01:10:36.338 --> 01:10:37.438]  I thought it was a joke.
[01:10:37.438 --> 01:10:46.421]  There it is, dog walker, hospitalized after attack by Somalian migrant who said dogs are unclean.
[01:10:46.421 --> 01:10:57.085]  So every time I report on Somalis attacking people and not being integrated into our society, I'm going to play the clip that the media made fun of where I said, Oh, we love our Somalis.
[01:10:57.085 --> 01:10:58.466]  We love our Muslims too.
[01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:08.198]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:08.198 --> 01:11:11.661]  But tourism up under Trump collapses in Europe.
[01:11:11.661 --> 01:11:22.391]  It's down 80-something percent in the last decade, and most of that is in just the last few years.
[01:11:22.391 --> 01:11:22.531]  Now,
[01:11:23.922 --> 01:11:29.706]  You have to ask yourself, why are they sacrificing everything, tourism, sovereignty, on the backs of this?
[01:11:29.706 --> 01:11:34.570]  Why is the EU military announcing it's going to take over the nation states?
[01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:38.492]  Because it's unelected and the people want out of it.
[01:11:38.492 --> 01:11:40.314]  Why is the EU bureaucracy
[01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:44.628]  Announcing they're going to create a new Coast Guard.
[01:11:44.628 --> 01:11:59.680]  That's a Navy to stop the nation states of Europe that occasionally send back the boats coming across the Mediterranean and then land the people back in North Africa or back in the Middle East.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.961]  Well, I played part of the clip.
[01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:02.082]  I'm going to play it all right now.
[01:12:02.082 --> 01:12:07.427]  EU foreign policy chief wants European Coast Guard to protect migrants.
[01:12:08.496 --> 01:12:25.162]  So the European Coast Guard is gonna get in there with the other navies and make sure, because they openly criticize in the press conference, they say some of these EU countries aren't being nice enough to the Islamic invaders that the EU's been advertising to invade Europe.
[01:12:25.162 --> 01:12:34.805]  So you have the EU openly aiding it to bring down Europe and that's what the Hungarian and the Romanian presidents and the Polish presidents and now other presidents are saying.
[01:12:34.805 --> 01:12:36.606]  Bill Gates said it's an invasion of Europe.
[01:12:36.966 --> 01:12:53.838]  That's what's going on, and Soros funds the 100-foot Zodiac boats, 24 hours a day, they go back and forth bringing them in, and they throw people out of their own houses, we have video of it, and put the illegals into their houses!
[01:12:53.838 --> 01:12:59.262]  So, let's go ahead and go to that clip from the press conference.
[01:12:59.262 --> 01:13:03.605]  The Foreign Policy Chief of the European Union said at a press conference that
[01:13:05.097 --> 01:13:11.240]  Frontex, the European Coast Guard, should protect migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean and North Africa and the Middle East to Europe.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:11.640]  There you go.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.202]  Protect them from the nation states.
[01:13:14.202 --> 01:13:15.883]  Oh, you want to get out of the EU?
[01:13:15.883 --> 01:13:16.843]  You never voted to enter it?
[01:13:16.843 --> 01:13:18.364]  We're going to invade you with the military.
[01:13:18.364 --> 01:13:21.265]  We're going to start by confronting your ships.
[01:13:21.265 --> 01:13:25.468]  The EU is a hostile power now over Europe.
[01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:25.948]  Here's the clue.
[01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:27.529]  Migration.
[01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:41.239]  Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have accused the Coast Guard for abusing the migrants and sending to unknown detainee centers.
[01:13:41.239 --> 01:13:44.101]  Are you aware of this and did you discuss about it?
[01:13:44.101 --> 01:13:44.381]  Thank you.
[01:13:46.021 --> 01:14:04.215]  This is exactly the reason why we are working so much with the IOM and the UNHCR to guarantee that they have access to the centers where living conditions appear to be inhuman, to improve the living conditions of the migrants, to protect their lives and their rights.
[01:14:05.396 --> 01:14:28.330]  As I said, actually as High Commissioner Grandi said, and I share his words, to change the very same logic of detention, which is not the logic the European Union or the UN system follows, and to assist the stranded migrants which are already inside Libya in all possible ways.
[01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:31.672]  In humanitarian terms, but also with assisted volunteer work.
[01:14:32.964 --> 01:14:35.991]  The UN goes into Burma and slaughters 10,000 people for their land.
[01:14:35.991 --> 01:14:37.314]  They go into Africa and do the same thing.
[01:14:38.592 --> 01:14:44.716]  But again, they're saying the EU and the UN work together under the framework against the nation-states of Europe.
[01:14:44.716 --> 01:14:47.198]  And they're, quote, not following our system.
[01:14:47.198 --> 01:14:49.759]  So they're going to show you how to follow their system.
[01:14:49.759 --> 01:14:51.560]  They're going to advertise that Europe's open.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.143]  They're going to advertise there's free money, free housing, and free women.
[01:14:55.143 --> 01:14:56.303]  That's advertised.
[01:14:56.303 --> 01:15:04.549]  They're going to bring them in and let Islamic clerics lead them to not assimilate, just like Linda Sarsour says, and then to carry out jihad.
[01:15:05.438 --> 01:15:08.784]  And they call it sexual jihad, raping women.
[01:15:08.784 --> 01:15:14.914]  And then EU dirtbags, like Peter Sutherland and his minions, are going to quarterback the whole operation.
[01:15:14.914 --> 01:15:15.254]  Here it is.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:38.069]  We have, and I have personally heard from migrants that managed across stories of slavery, inhuman conditions of men and women, in particular women, that nobody should not only leave but nobody should even listen to.
[01:15:39.049 --> 01:15:57.438]  So the work the European Union is doing with the UN agencies, with the international NGOs, is exactly to protect the migrants, try to protect the migrants, and we are asking our Libyan friends to help us helping the international organizations to have full access to improve the living conditions.
[01:15:57.438 --> 01:16:01.520]  Okay, so there you have the EU saying of European countries, don't pick up
[01:16:02.429 --> 01:16:11.976]  Muslims from Africa and the Middle East coming across the Mediterranean, that their ships are going to start stopping them and then helping the Muslims come into Europe under the UN auspices.
[01:16:11.976 --> 01:16:15.619]  This is the UN and the EU taking over Europe.
[01:16:15.619 --> 01:16:22.564]  Now, former Congressman Ron Paul has been warning of global government for decades, and now it's here.
[01:16:22.564 --> 01:16:24.065]  And as Europe tries to pull out of the EU,
[01:16:25.487 --> 01:16:40.352]  And as European countries try to reassess their sovereignty, the EU is threatening to march in their EU military, and it's beginning with their EU navy saying they're going to start basically stopping the ships from returning people.
[01:16:40.352 --> 01:16:41.592]  This is outrageous.
[01:16:41.592 --> 01:16:45.633]  This is a great place to start with Ron Paul.
[01:16:45.633 --> 01:16:47.754]  Mr. Paul, you warned of this a long time ago, doctor.
[01:16:49.036 --> 01:16:50.557]  Yeah, we shouldn't be surprised.
[01:16:50.557 --> 01:16:56.822]  It was set up, a lot of people even predicted this way back in 1945 when they started this mess.
[01:16:56.822 --> 01:17:07.811]  But you know, in a way it's similar to what we fight here at home, because most of the sovereignty was supposed to be left with the states and not with the federal government, but we fight that all the time and we've been losing that battle.
[01:17:07.811 --> 01:17:10.113]  They run everything at the federal level.
[01:17:10.113 --> 01:17:15.998]  But now federal governments, and right now we're talking about European governments, they have sacrificed too much of their liberties.
[01:17:17.038 --> 01:17:18.700]  And it wasn't an accident.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.701]  It wasn't an unintended consequence.
[01:17:20.701 --> 01:17:28.506]  It was an intended consequence of the people like Soros and the other individuals who believe in world government.
[01:17:28.506 --> 01:17:31.589]  But the big problem is it's not a voluntary world government.
[01:17:31.589 --> 01:17:42.536]  It's a world government based on authoritarianism and ruthlessness and control and the destruction of the sovereignty of the individual as well as the individual countries.
[01:17:42.536 --> 01:17:43.837]  And that's what we're facing today.
[01:17:43.837 --> 01:17:44.718]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[01:17:50.301 --> 01:18:06.250]  I know you're not about getting credit, but people have to realize that being one person in the right against a sea of lies ends up historically being effective, and people should really take heart how far we've come
[01:18:07.313 --> 01:18:14.161]  Exposing authoritarian crony capitalism and globalism, the true force on this planet.
[01:18:14.161 --> 01:18:21.208]  Back when you first went to Congress in the 80s for a stint, and later back in the 90s, you routinely didn't get any co-sponsors.
[01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:23.411]  Now many of your bills have passed.
[01:18:23.411 --> 01:18:26.774]  Most people know the Federal Reserve is quasi-public-private.
[01:18:27.762 --> 01:18:29.243]  They're aware of all this.
[01:18:29.243 --> 01:18:32.206]  Take Dr. Michael Kaufman that died last month.
[01:18:32.206 --> 01:18:41.113]  He was the first person to expose agenda 21 and global zoning and global standards being created by corporations to control nation states.
[01:18:41.113 --> 01:18:42.534]  All of that now being exposed.
[01:18:42.534 --> 01:18:46.878]  Trump pulling out of the carbon tax, the climate accords, the TPP.
[01:18:46.878 --> 01:18:54.444]  Can you speak as a true visionary trailblazer about where you see the state of the world now and the positives?
[01:18:56.730 --> 01:19:01.152]  Well, I think we're coming to a climactic end, and it's going to be very dangerous.
[01:19:01.152 --> 01:19:02.653]  But the ducks are lining up.
[01:19:02.653 --> 01:19:06.014]  People are realizing how their liberties are being undermined.
[01:19:06.014 --> 01:19:11.917]  The Europeans want to be Europeans, and they don't want to be run by international government.
[01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:16.459]  So I think if you just look casually at the political situation around the world,
[01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:16.679]  I think so.
[01:19:35.097 --> 01:19:40.300]  I think we're living at a time like it was like the Soviets were ending in the 80s and it was coming to an end but nobody believed
[01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:03.132]  Yeah.
[01:20:21.852 --> 01:20:22.432]  We're good to go.
[01:20:46.067 --> 01:20:46.387]  I agree.
[01:20:46.387 --> 01:20:47.448]  It's the best of times, worst of times.
[01:20:47.448 --> 01:20:57.576]  The political elites have dug in, in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, and in here, from Venezuela, what we see happening in Nigeria, what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening in the UK and the Empire.
[01:21:13.573 --> 01:21:21.918]  of corrupt crony capitalism is striking back, allied with radical Islam, allied with other collectivist models, but it's failing.
[01:21:21.918 --> 01:21:28.902]  So when we hear we have the most unproductive Congress in 164 years, it was good to be unproductive blocking Obama.
[01:21:28.902 --> 01:21:37.847]  Now that Trump is trying to repeal Obamacare with your son, Senator Paul, and is trying to cut taxes, and is trying, in my view, to save the economy.
[01:21:39.033 --> 01:21:42.178]  They are really being obstructionists and have their heels dug in.
[01:21:42.178 --> 01:21:44.842]  I mean, is that basically what I got from what you said?
[01:21:45.678 --> 01:22:01.726]  Yeah, that's it, but I think where we're weakest and where we don't do the best job is we know what's wrong, we know what has to go, and there's a good group speaking out against it, but what is not readily apparent is what do you substitute for it?
[01:22:01.726 --> 01:22:08.829]  And that's why we have to emphasize the principles of liberty and making this an individual thing, and liberty comes to individuals.
[01:22:09.209 --> 01:22:09.529]  I think so.
[01:22:25.521 --> 01:22:32.004]  They don't understand and realize that if they want good medical care, they have to admit the truth.
[01:22:32.004 --> 01:22:35.665]  Government medical care, like Obamacare, just doesn't work.
[01:22:35.665 --> 01:22:45.068]  So our biggest job is to make it very clear what we believe in and what we need, and also that you can't tinker with what we have.
[01:22:45.068 --> 01:22:49.890]  If you and I were in charge of the Federal Reserve, we can't do any better in charge of the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:51.291]  We want to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:52.091 --> 01:22:54.073]  Tell them why you have markets.
[01:22:54.073 --> 01:22:58.218]  You don't want better managers.
[01:22:58.218 --> 01:23:03.123]  I remember in high school they used to talk about, all we need is a businessman ahead of the post office.
[01:23:03.123 --> 01:23:04.565]  And we're still talking about that.
[01:23:04.565 --> 01:23:07.067]  We need a businessman running medical care.
[01:23:07.067 --> 01:23:08.649]  No, we don't need bureaucrats.
[01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:17.675]  No, we don't need a $1.48 going to Bezos for every package he ships from taxpayers to undercut the rest of the free market.
[01:23:17.675 --> 01:23:19.356]  We need him to sink or swim.
[01:23:19.356 --> 01:23:23.859]  And behind all these big giant monopolies, we always find government backing it up.
[01:23:23.859 --> 01:23:33.445]  It's totally disgusting, like Carlos Slim, a foreigner, making $10 billion in profit in the eight years of Obama on the stinking Obama phone.
[01:23:33.445 --> 01:23:35.287]  Dr. Paul, let me ask you this question then.
[01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:44.452]  I agree intellectually, there is a firestorm of awakening as collectivism again proves it's a nightmare scenario, and as people that bought into it find out it's a fraud.
[01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:52.337]  But what about the new talking point that I've seen from Congressman Quigley, I've seen from Congresswoman Maxine Waters, I've seen it from all of them.
[01:23:52.337 --> 01:24:00.643]  I even heard Howard Stern randomly, I was tuning to the dial yesterday, and he said, you don't talk to Russians, and no one's allowed to talk to them.
[01:24:00.643 --> 01:24:02.104]  The new talking point is, quote,
[01:24:03.144 --> 01:24:04.305]  Bob Bear said it on CNN.
[01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:05.506]  They're all saying it.
[01:24:05.506 --> 01:24:09.870]  If you talk to a Russian, period, you're a spy and should be arrested.
[01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:18.556]  I mean, that is a new word-for-word talking point with CNN having hosts saying, quote, we're at war with Russia.
[01:24:18.556 --> 01:24:20.558]  We need to, you know, attack them.
[01:24:20.558 --> 01:24:25.542]  There is this hysteria where the dying globalist program is pointing at you and me and
[01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:32.043]  And they said this about you, Trump, that we somehow get our orders from the Russians.
[01:24:32.043 --> 01:24:33.643]  This is so dangerous.
[01:24:33.643 --> 01:24:34.604]  Where is this going?
[01:24:34.604 --> 01:24:38.464]  It's globalism that's the outside force, isn't it?
[01:24:38.464 --> 01:24:48.186]  Yes, and these are the same people who condemn us for even saying that we ought to at least trade with and talk with a country like Russia.
[01:24:48.186 --> 01:24:50.647]  These are the same people who love the Soviets.
[01:24:50.647 --> 01:24:53.387]  You know, this group of people you mentioned, they champion the
[01:24:53.427 --> 01:24:54.408]  We're good to go.
[01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:23.650]  I don't know.
[01:25:41.272 --> 01:25:51.658]  But if we can present our case in a very positive fashion, which should be substituted for what we have, because we already have the vacuum.
[01:25:51.658 --> 01:25:52.418]  That is the problem.
[01:25:52.418 --> 01:26:00.403]  There's a vacuum out there in Washington, and it's just a struggle for power, and that's why some of the Republican leadership are pretty
[01:26:02.028 --> 01:26:10.554]  Sure, the Republican leadership helped write Obamacare and of course as a medical doctor you've exposed that with precision in the last few minutes we have, sir.
[01:26:21.101 --> 01:26:22.382]  Looking big picture then.
[01:26:22.382 --> 01:26:29.627]  You've traveled the world and we see the libertarian awakening in Eastern Europe that again you helped start, not trying to blow smoke at you.
[01:26:29.627 --> 01:26:31.689]  We've been over there, our reporters have been there.
[01:26:31.689 --> 01:26:33.950]  You're a rock star over in Europe.
[01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:41.076]  That signifies that humanity really wants freedom and the more people have been under communism or socialism, the more they recognize
[01:26:41.536 --> 01:26:47.880]  That the American free market system, never fully realized, is still much better than what we face.
[01:27:12.897 --> 01:27:22.766]  Yeah, and I think that if people are offered, and I know this for young people, if they're offered freedom and responsibility and prosperity and peace, they're going to accept it.
[01:27:22.766 --> 01:27:34.177]  But I saw a write-up the other day of a poll made that I was fascinated with, because I believe it to be true, that just one of the many reasons why Hillary lost
[01:27:34.517 --> 01:27:46.919]  Was the fact that he was construed as a militant, an authoritarian who was a promoter of war, and that Trump came across much better because he says, why do we have to provoke Russia?
[01:27:46.919 --> 01:27:56.961]  You know, and I don't like it when he sort of drifts away from that position, but he was the one that represented those of us who were... Well, sure, they're bullying him back into that.
[01:27:56.961 --> 01:28:01.922]  That's why they're saying the new talking point is we're not allowed to even talk to Russia beyond even the worst Cold War.
[01:28:01.922 --> 01:28:02.802]  Then let me ask you this.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.244]  Pulling back.
[01:28:05.244 --> 01:28:07.589]  Where do you expect this authoritarianism to go?
[01:28:07.589 --> 01:28:09.673]  Because it's only intensifying.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:23.349]  Yeah, well, that's hard to tell, but I think we're more likely to see a lot of violence before we see the acknowledgement that our side is winning, and they will start backing off.
[01:28:23.349 --> 01:28:26.971]  So I think the whole thing has to come down.
[01:28:26.971 --> 01:28:30.274]  So they never fixed communism.
[01:28:30.274 --> 01:28:31.675]  It had to collapse.
[01:28:31.675 --> 01:28:37.739]  So I think our system has to collapse, and that's why people should be prepared, and there's all ways of being prepared.
[01:28:37.739 --> 01:28:37.959]  I agree.
[01:28:37.959 --> 01:28:38.800]  We've only got a minute left.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.320]  Two quick questions.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.702]  It seems like you've warmed a little bit more to Trump.
[01:28:56.084 --> 01:28:58.684]  You know, I think that the Europeans will go down.
[01:28:58.684 --> 01:29:03.005]  Whether they dissolve, I think that what they'll do is re-establish their countries again.
[01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:07.206]  I always argued when they were starting the EU was, I don't see how it could work.
[01:29:07.206 --> 01:29:13.887]  Because I thought, well, you know, it's not, at least we had, we were supposed to at one time have one language.
[01:29:13.887 --> 01:29:19.468]  But over there, I never thought the Italians would get along with the Spanish and this sort of thing.
[01:29:19.468 --> 01:29:23.029]  And instead of recognize their individuality, they were going to push it.
[01:29:25.849 --> 01:29:30.511]  Well, I think Trump is up against a wall because the authoritarians are there.
[01:29:30.511 --> 01:29:43.035]  I'm afraid that the neocons are still in style and he has a few people in his administration that I don't particularly trust because I think they're too close to the neocons.
[01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:51.743]  And even though he might have to give in to them a little bit, he has to stand firm.
[01:29:51.743 --> 01:29:52.905]  But they're all around him.
[01:29:52.905 --> 01:29:53.746]  They're every place.
[01:29:53.746 --> 01:29:57.931]  And you can't cave in to the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[01:29:57.931 --> 01:29:58.432]  Exactly.
[01:29:58.432 --> 01:29:59.393]  Ron Paul, thank you.
[01:29:59.393 --> 01:29:59.874]  Powerful.
[01:30:07.751 --> 01:30:13.813]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[01:30:13.813 --> 01:30:15.553]  The contest is simple.
[01:30:15.553 --> 01:30:20.795]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[01:30:20.795 --> 01:30:27.977]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[01:30:28.117 --> 01:30:34.780]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:44.865]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:30:44.865 --> 01:30:52.408]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:30:52.608 --> 01:31:02.693]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[01:31:02.693 --> 01:31:06.154]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.
[01:31:06.154 --> 01:31:07.275]  This is Kit Daniels.
[01:31:07.275 --> 01:31:11.296]  A new shipment of bio-truth selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:11.296 --> 01:31:12.497]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:31:12.757 --> 01:31:17.819]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife bio-true selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:17.819 --> 01:31:21.960]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:31.643]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium, but bio-true selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:31:31.643 --> 01:31:39.146]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known, from supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:31:39.266 --> 01:31:47.351]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Mason Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:31:47.351 --> 01:31:52.255]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.
[01:31:52.255 --> 01:32:00.780]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:01.320]  A 360 win.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.402]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:32:03.402 --> 01:32:04.903]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:32:04.903 --> 01:32:06.064]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:10.029 --> 01:32:11.430]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:13.652]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:32:13.652 --> 01:32:14.112]  Great!
[01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:15.233]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:32:15.233 --> 01:32:19.777]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:32:19.777 --> 01:32:21.478]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:32:21.478 --> 01:32:29.044]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Platinum Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:29.785]  Wow, thank you.
[01:32:29.785 --> 01:32:32.287]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[01:32:32.287 --> 01:32:33.828]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?
[01:32:34.088 --> 01:32:37.571]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:37.952]  That's amazing.
[01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:38.833]  That's really incredible.
[01:32:38.833 --> 01:32:41.896]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:32:41.896 --> 01:32:43.257]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:44.918]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:32:44.918 --> 01:32:45.939]  And I love you guys.
[01:32:45.939 --> 01:32:48.322]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:32:48.322 --> 01:32:54.047]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence.
[01:32:54.047 --> 01:32:55.168]  Just buy it.
[01:32:55.168 --> 01:32:56.229]  You will love it.
[01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.730]  I'm telling you.
[01:32:56.730 --> 01:32:58.051]  I've never bought a bad product.
[01:32:58.331 --> 01:33:02.353]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:02.353 --> 01:33:02.653]  It's a win-win.
[01:33:02.653 --> 01:33:03.033]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:03.033 --> 01:33:03.753]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:03.753 --> 01:33:05.634]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.355 --> 01:33:42.584]  This hour brought to you by Lime Flavored Tapachico with natural lime essence and naturally carbonated water from a spring in the Mexican mountains.
[01:33:42.584 --> 01:33:47.227]  I actually just brought this bottle in here because it matches the background and I was drinking and I thought, why have it down here?
[01:33:47.227 --> 01:33:50.469]  Why not just show the magic bottle?
[01:33:50.469 --> 01:33:51.870]  Brought to you by Tapachico.
[01:33:56.508 --> 01:33:58.711]  Right in the desert.
[01:33:58.711 --> 01:34:03.537]  Happy Topo Chico.
[01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.400]  That goes right to heaven in my belly.
[01:34:23.755 --> 01:34:25.516]  I gotta stop it.
[01:34:25.516 --> 01:34:27.357]  They're gonna have some fun with that.
[01:34:27.357 --> 01:34:31.438]  I'm like feeding the mean people now.
[01:34:31.438 --> 01:34:32.359]  I have to suckle them.
[01:34:32.359 --> 01:34:37.901]  Alright, let me stop right there.
[01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:40.803]  By the way, Topo Chico is not a sponsor.
[01:34:40.803 --> 01:34:41.303]  They ought to be.
[01:34:42.918 --> 01:34:47.262]  I first drank this in Mexico like 20 years ago, and it's been in Texas about 10 years.
[01:34:47.262 --> 01:34:51.225]  But the lime was never here and popular about 5 years ago, and now you can get it everywhere.
[01:34:51.225 --> 01:34:54.248]  This is the best drink ever.
[01:34:54.248 --> 01:34:54.829]  Right here.
[01:34:54.829 --> 01:34:55.990]  I probably drink 10 of these a day.
[01:34:55.990 --> 01:35:03.156]  Anyways, let's stop that now.
[01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:07.460]  Let's get serious here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.802]  That was a powerful Ron Paul interview, wasn't it?
[01:35:13.413 --> 01:35:18.075]  One reason I've been in a better mood is I've 100% quit drinking.
[01:35:18.075 --> 01:35:18.115]  100%.
[01:35:18.115 --> 01:35:23.698]  And I'm about, I'm quite a ways into no drinking.
[01:35:23.698 --> 01:35:25.078]  And I've been exercising more.
[01:35:25.078 --> 01:35:29.520]  And even though I'm not a heavy drinker, I think drinking messes up my sleep patterns.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.262]  And so I just sleep better when I don't drink, period.
[01:35:33.262 --> 01:35:41.345]  And I exercise better, so that's one reason I'm being a little bit goofy is this is what happens when I'm completely 100% sober.
[01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:48.400]  I thought I'd drink on air, but you know what I mean, it affects your neurological systems.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:36:00.827]  If you drink a bottle of wine at night, the next day you got a headache, you're kind of grumpy, you have brain fog, even if you are taking Brain Force and BioTruth Selenium from Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:00.827 --> 01:36:04.348]  You see, this is what my voice really sounds like now.
[01:36:04.348 --> 01:36:12.573]  Unless I kind of talk fast and try to talk in a higher pitch voice, then it kind of sounds like this, which is scary.
[01:36:13.533 --> 01:36:16.456]  Because I'm wondering what my voice is going to sound like someday.
[01:36:16.456 --> 01:36:22.881]  Sometimes at night now, I'll be out at an event or out at friends' houses and they'll say, does it hurt when you talk?
[01:36:22.881 --> 01:36:28.046]  Because by nighttime, my voice is really toad-like.
[01:36:28.046 --> 01:36:37.755]  So, we may get to the point where I'm communicating on air like, who's the physicist, Stephen Hawking, who talks to the robot?
[01:36:39.025 --> 01:36:40.486]  Maybe we'll just do that.
[01:36:40.486 --> 01:36:42.387]  Hell, they're already giving the troops brain chips.
[01:36:42.387 --> 01:36:44.288]  I reported on that like 15 years ago.
[01:36:44.288 --> 01:36:46.449]  People didn't believe it, then sure enough it came out.
[01:36:46.449 --> 01:36:49.451]  The exact type of brain chips we were talking about were being rolled out.
[01:36:49.451 --> 01:36:54.034]  First as quote anti-PTSD and then anti-depression.
[01:36:54.034 --> 01:36:59.537]  But the truth is they're just getting everybody ready for biomechanical soldiers.
[01:36:59.537 --> 01:37:06.221]  And the CIA has even admitted to the Washington Post, through cartoons and popular culture, they're preparing everyone for a microchipped future.
[01:37:07.518 --> 01:37:17.986]  And suddenly, from Fox News to ABC News, we have news clips where they go, soon everyone will have a microchip.
[01:37:17.986 --> 01:37:19.947]  That's just the way it is.
[01:37:19.947 --> 01:37:25.671]  Just like, oh, everything you're doing is being surveilled, your appliances are watching and listening to you.
[01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:33.417]  But that makes Alex Jones even more kooky that he predicted it all specifically exactly as it would happen.
[01:37:34.562 --> 01:37:48.473]  And I'd love to give myself credit that I had a big, fat, juicy Palantir or Crystal Ball or Oracle's Orb in my hands, but I didn't.
[01:37:48.473 --> 01:37:58.561]  In 1977, the Pentagon developed a plan that was declassified in 2000, was reclassified in 2002.
[01:37:58.561 --> 01:38:02.524]  I put it in my book, Descent into Tyranny, free online, now out of print.
[01:38:03.902 --> 01:38:26.698]  And they said to save the earth and finally have no more crime, we're going to get everybody progressively into computers, and then smaller devices, and then brain implants, and retinal implants, and then finally, we will live in tanks from birth, and our own body heat will heat the computer systems as batteries, and we will all live a virtual reality life.
[01:38:26.698 --> 01:38:27.778]  You may have heard of that.
[01:38:27.778 --> 01:38:29.159]  It's called the Matrix.
[01:38:29.159 --> 01:38:29.680]  It came out in 1999.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:30.000]  That was
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.803]  Art imitating a DARPA plan.
[01:38:35.803 --> 01:38:41.148]  Not the other way around.
[01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:43.971]  We're not imitating art now with this stuff coming out.
[01:38:43.971 --> 01:38:47.414]  This was always the plan and was cooked up.
[01:38:47.414 --> 01:38:52.078]  And I'm not saying we're going to specifically go that way, but that's what they have cooked up.
[01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:58.944]  They have all these articles about, oh in a thousand years you'll live in a tank and have an avatar virtual body.
[01:38:58.944 --> 01:38:59.886]  No.
[01:38:59.886 --> 01:39:01.630]  They plan to do it as soon as they can.
[01:39:02.472 --> 01:39:10.698]  They've already got robots that are controlled by your cerebral cortex and the rest of it, but they plan to then convince you to live in a tank and then have that transfer.
[01:39:10.698 --> 01:39:13.780]  Because, you know, the tank will have a lower carbon footprint.
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:23.667]  See, they want to purge you into the carbon footprint and then you will opt into going into the tank because there'll be all these tax incentives and things if you do.
[01:39:25.891 --> 01:39:28.832]  And then you'll have access to all the computer programs and things.
[01:39:28.832 --> 01:39:33.513]  It'll give you unlimited ecstasy and unlimited VR.
[01:39:33.513 --> 01:39:36.814]  And that's why Time Warner has a slogan.
[01:39:36.814 --> 01:39:41.916]  Through their trendy division, they know nobody's watching CNN anymore.
[01:39:41.916 --> 01:39:46.117]  So they have come out and they have things like Super Deluxe.
[01:39:47.176 --> 01:39:51.157]  Where they say their slogan is, nothing's real, it's all virtual reality.
[01:39:51.157 --> 01:39:55.938]  Telling you that this universe isn't real, that something else created it.
[01:39:55.938 --> 01:40:12.703]  There is no God, but something superhuman created this, and the mathematical and radio telescopes show in the dark matter there's an outside force, many times more powerful, holding all of this together and holding gravity artificially in place.
[01:40:16.738 --> 01:40:23.521]  And that the elites want to have you break out of the VR by entering their new universe.
[01:40:23.521 --> 01:40:35.807]  I think somebody... Somebody I read about before was in a reality and wanted to break away and create their own reality and said, I am God.
[01:40:35.807 --> 01:40:37.248]  I am more beautiful.
[01:40:37.248 --> 01:40:37.909]  I am greater.
[01:40:37.909 --> 01:40:40.450]  And God said, Oh, really?
[01:40:40.450 --> 01:40:44.552]  You're stuck on this planet and I'm going to put
[01:40:45.652 --> 01:40:47.134]  Myself back to day one.
[01:40:47.134 --> 01:40:50.639]  I'm going to put a creature on the planet in my image.
[01:40:50.639 --> 01:40:53.143]  I'm going to put you up against my larva.
[01:40:53.143 --> 01:40:56.868]  And let's see if you can beat the larval form of God.
[01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:04.131]  If you want to go from a scientific perspective, that's what the elites actually believe.
[01:41:04.131 --> 01:41:06.251]  They believe Lucifer is the advanced god.
[01:41:06.251 --> 01:41:15.173]  It's giving them the off-world technology to build their breakaway civilization, but they've got to kill all of us first because we're profane and ugly and bad.
[01:41:15.173 --> 01:41:25.735]  Our fellow humans believe they have to merge with machines and merge with animals and merge with other life to create the super-creature that AI is going to weave together.
[01:41:25.735 --> 01:41:27.055]  And that once they've done that,
[01:41:28.527 --> 01:41:37.215]  They will then have this breakaway transcendent moment, and then they'll become God.
[01:41:37.215 --> 01:41:48.226]  When what is really going on is hiding in plain view, right there in every ancient text, not just the Bible.
[01:41:48.226 --> 01:41:50.067]  So, breakaway creation.
[01:41:51.124 --> 01:41:55.427]  Tells the Creator, I'm God, I'm gonna overthrow you.
[01:41:55.427 --> 01:42:01.051]  And God says, you can't even overthrow something made in my image.
[01:42:01.051 --> 01:42:07.496]  You can't even overthrow people running around in caves.
[01:42:07.496 --> 01:42:13.140]  Let's see how it works out with them.
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:13.821]  And now you see,
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:22.565]  What they built to try to capture us is prison on this planet.
[01:42:22.565 --> 01:42:25.027]  But the devil couldn't even build himself.
[01:42:25.027 --> 01:42:30.031]  He had to get us to build our own cage.
[01:42:30.031 --> 01:42:35.355]  But because we built our own cage, we built back doors into it.
[01:42:35.355 --> 01:42:38.097]  Lucifer thinks he built back doors?
[01:42:38.097 --> 01:42:40.039]  We subconsciously built back doors.
[01:42:43.285 --> 01:42:48.808]  Do you think the devil knows he was just sent here to test us?
[01:42:48.808 --> 01:42:50.409]  No, they're too arrogant.
[01:42:50.409 --> 01:42:52.330]  You see the spirit of the devil in the enemy.
[01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:54.591]  They're too arrogant to ever admit they're being beaten.
[01:42:54.591 --> 01:43:03.316]  They're too arrogant to ever admit they're up against intelligences hundreds of times more powerful than theirs.
[01:43:03.316 --> 01:43:10.219]  The devil can't even take on embryonic humanity and beat us.
[01:43:10.219 --> 01:43:11.620]  And that's these people's God?
[01:43:14.409 --> 01:43:17.390]  A God that wants to kidnap and rape children?
[01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:19.291]  A God that wants to mutate children?
[01:43:19.291 --> 01:43:25.473]  A God that wants to kill humans and make us ugly because it's so insecure and pathetic?
[01:43:25.473 --> 01:43:27.934]  And that's the spirit of the world!
[01:43:27.934 --> 01:43:30.375]  It is the spirit of the devil!
[01:43:30.375 --> 01:43:34.837]  And whether you believe in the devil or not, the devil believes in you, and it is manifest.
[01:43:34.837 --> 01:43:35.937]  It is real.
[01:43:35.937 --> 01:43:37.098]  But there is no God.
[01:43:37.098 --> 01:43:37.778]  There is no nothing.
[01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:38.518]  We're on a planet.
[01:43:38.518 --> 01:43:39.759]  Nothing's fantastical.
[01:43:39.759 --> 01:43:41.179]  Play your video games.
[01:43:41.179 --> 01:43:41.619]  Play your VR.
[01:43:45.011 --> 01:43:51.416]  Play your fantasy football, just don't be in the real world because it's not real.
[01:43:51.416 --> 01:43:52.757]  No, it's real.
[01:43:52.757 --> 01:43:54.458]  Your great-grandparents were real.
[01:43:54.458 --> 01:43:55.419]  You're real.
[01:43:55.419 --> 01:43:56.640]  Your children are real.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.561]  Your husband's real.
[01:43:57.561 --> 01:43:58.642]  Your wife's real.
[01:43:58.642 --> 01:43:59.883]  Your experience is real.
[01:43:59.883 --> 01:44:01.064]  The stars are real.
[01:44:01.064 --> 01:44:02.985]  The moon's real.
[01:44:02.985 --> 01:44:08.790]  The fish in the sea, the birds in the air, the plants, it's all real.
[01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:14.134]  And they want to tell you that the computers and the virtual realities that they've created
[01:44:15.435 --> 01:44:21.399]  That are nothing but electricity, zeros and ones in a false system, a dream.
[01:44:21.399 --> 01:44:32.006]  They want to tell you a dream is real and make you believe the dream can deliver you into nirvana when it is the reality of the living dream.
[01:44:35.239 --> 01:44:51.907]  The genetic dream, the shared experience over space-time with our species, time-traveling through our genetic replications into the future.
[01:44:51.907 --> 01:44:54.948]  And no one will tell you any of this.
[01:44:54.948 --> 01:44:58.350]  The enemy hates me because I know the information.
[01:45:01.348 --> 01:45:05.533]  And the enemy's panicking because the information is being opened up now.
[01:45:05.533 --> 01:45:13.062]  And they're in a rush to try to get as many people into their meat grinder as they can.
[01:45:13.062 --> 01:45:18.449]  As many people into their Hollywood MSM sports combine.
[01:45:24.468 --> 01:45:34.731]  They said 30 years ago, by 2025, they'd have more combat robots and more combat aircraft that were autonomous drone, working on AI algorithms than they would human.
[01:45:34.731 --> 01:45:38.532]  And the Pentagon is on schedule.
[01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:49.355]  Autonomous robots, programmed by our loving friends, who can't even contain their psychotic forms.
[01:45:49.355 --> 01:45:51.956]  Like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zucker,
[01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:59.170]  And the rest of these people.
[01:45:59.170 --> 01:46:05.634]  They have turned themselves over, and they are beast.
[01:46:05.634 --> 01:46:06.954]  And what does Zucker say about you?
[01:46:06.954 --> 01:46:10.936]  He goes, I can't believe the users trust me.
[01:46:10.936 --> 01:46:12.197]  They're so stupid.
[01:46:12.197 --> 01:46:13.878]  They're dumb effers.
[01:46:16.792 --> 01:46:43.291]  And he walks around glaring the most evil, weak, pathetic, fallen, golem-like creature with his own employees on their knees before him in giant ceremonies and they don't even know they are on their knees bound and their souls gagged with hoods over their heads being fed
[01:46:44.554 --> 01:46:49.517]  Whatever he lets into the keyhole.
[01:46:49.517 --> 01:46:51.538]  And he walks like a God.
[01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:53.679]  You're no God, Zucker.
[01:46:53.679 --> 01:47:00.142]  You had to put them into a false reality so they would believe you are a God.
[01:47:00.142 --> 01:47:02.103]  You're not even a man.
[01:47:02.103 --> 01:47:06.565]  And God is gonna break you.
[01:47:06.565 --> 01:47:10.347]  Know this, Zucker, you will never transcend.
[01:47:10.347 --> 01:47:11.388]  You will never.
[01:47:11.388 --> 01:47:13.629]  You will die like every other man.
[01:47:14.625 --> 01:47:16.666]  You will face the great judgment.
[01:47:16.666 --> 01:47:17.966]  You will be brought low.
[01:47:17.966 --> 01:47:20.187]  You will be brought down to be humble.
[01:47:20.187 --> 01:47:22.048]  You will be unified.
[01:47:22.048 --> 01:47:23.268]  You will be completed.
[01:47:23.268 --> 01:47:25.409]  You will be equalized.
[01:47:25.409 --> 01:47:31.051]  You will join everyone else!
[01:47:31.051 --> 01:47:35.253]  Every knee will bow, son!
[01:47:35.253 --> 01:47:39.775]  But for people like you, you're gonna be crushed first.
[01:47:39.775 --> 01:47:42.556]  And all your arrogance will be pouring out.
[01:47:48.027 --> 01:47:52.149]  Everyone should hit their knees and thank God you're not associated with Zucker.
[01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:55.810]  Everyone should hit your knees and thank God you're not associated with Hastert.
[01:47:55.810 --> 01:48:01.973]  Everyone should hit their knees and thank God you're not associated with Nancy Pelosi or Prince Charles or Ted Turner.
[01:48:01.973 --> 01:48:06.295]  Everyone should thank God every minute you don't come from the filth of the earth.
[01:48:06.295 --> 01:48:11.197]  I have a lot of clips I need to get to.
[01:48:11.197 --> 01:48:12.318]  We all see the funder operation.
[01:48:14.431 --> 01:48:25.197]  Caveman, which is the very best, and it is the nation's best seller now, bone broth formula from high-quality chicken bones with the turmeric and the bee pollen and everything else integrated in.
[01:48:25.197 --> 01:48:26.999]  Everybody knows Grandma said, get your chicken noodle soup.
[01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:29.302]  I mean, it's some ridiculous amount.
[01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:34.084]  Each serving's like, when it comes to nutrients, you get some ridiculous amount of chicken soup bowls.
[01:48:34.084 --> 01:48:35.325]  I mean, it's just over the top.
[01:48:35.325 --> 01:48:39.387]  And that's not counting all the turmeric and the bee pollen and just all the rest of it.
[01:48:39.387 --> 01:48:40.648]  The chaga mushroom.
[01:48:40.648 --> 01:48:43.149]  Infowarslive.com is 25% off.
[01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:44.870]  Been sold out for months.
[01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:49.973]  I'm having to stop the specials on Rainforest because we're about to sell out of that.
[01:48:49.973 --> 01:48:51.674]  So 30% off is over on that.
[01:48:51.674 --> 01:48:53.155]  Pre-shipping extends throughout the month.
[01:48:53.155 --> 01:48:55.276]  But Super Male, Super Female, Survival Shield X2,
[01:48:57.168 --> 01:49:02.693]  Secret 12, DNA Force, it's all 20 to 40% off.
[01:49:02.693 --> 01:49:07.778]  But that's going to have to end as well, because Supermelon X2 is about to sell out, but it'll just be a few weeks till more of that gets back in.
[01:49:07.778 --> 01:49:09.880]  But if you want to take advantage of those sales, they're about to end.
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:13.082]  But I said sales would go through the month of July, so I'm going to have
[01:49:13.959 --> 01:49:20.182]  Next Monday or so, another list of some of the other supplements that we do have in stock that'll be discounted for you next week.
[01:49:20.182 --> 01:49:21.763]  But thank you all for the support.
[01:49:21.763 --> 01:49:24.104]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:49:24.104 --> 01:49:25.104]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:49:25.104 --> 01:49:26.685]  Or again, call toll-free.
[01:49:37.751 --> 01:49:45.736]  Some of the other distributors and places out there care our stuff as well, but it's always best to get it through us, because Amazon sells counterfeits, we know for a fact.
[01:49:45.736 --> 01:49:50.159]  But it's okay for Bezos to sell counterfeits from China of our products, you know, that's alright.
[01:49:50.159 --> 01:50:02.246]  These Bezos, you know, anybody else sells supplements that are evil and bad, but the anointed Bezos, oh Bezos, and oh Zucker, and all the rest of these people, oh, let us worship you, oh, great ones!
[01:50:02.246 --> 01:50:06.429]  Thank you for your ugly spirits, you smell so bad, just thank you for everything you are, you filth!
[01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:13.273]  Rotting maggots, self-propelled zombies.
[01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:29.223]  So we're going to go to break and come back, but when you do fund the operation, you are absolutely attacking the globalists viciously and savagely, but more important than funding is pray for us and spread the articles and the videos because they block us on Google, Facebook, Twitter, everywhere.
[01:50:29.223 --> 01:50:30.764]  They admit they're doing it.
[01:50:30.764 --> 01:50:34.086]  Google admits they've got multi-million dollar contracts out to block our news.
[01:50:36.553 --> 01:50:37.613]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:50:37.613 --> 01:50:45.755]  But they can't stop you from spreading the links by hand and telling folks about the local affiliates and for just praying for us.
[01:50:45.755 --> 01:50:46.995]  And I'm praying for you.
[01:50:46.995 --> 01:50:48.055]  And we're all in this together.
[01:50:48.055 --> 01:50:49.696]  So you're amazing.
[01:50:49.696 --> 01:50:50.536]  You're incredible.
[01:50:50.536 --> 01:50:52.056]  I don't say that to build you up.
[01:50:52.056 --> 01:50:53.117]  You know it's true.
[01:50:53.117 --> 01:50:57.017]  If you love justice and you love God, we are one for eternity.
[01:50:57.017 --> 01:50:58.758]  We're all ready together.
[01:50:58.758 --> 01:51:00.678]  That's why the enemy hates us, because they can feel it.
[01:51:00.678 --> 01:51:01.338]  They can see it.
[01:51:01.338 --> 01:51:03.039]  They want to extinguish it.
[01:51:03.039 --> 01:51:04.239]  Because we're torturing them.
[01:51:06.457 --> 01:51:10.921]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:10.921 --> 01:51:12.523]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:12.523 --> 01:51:13.423]  Think about it.
[01:51:13.423 --> 01:51:18.048]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:18.048 --> 01:51:22.692]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:23.012 --> 01:51:28.835]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:28.835 --> 01:51:35.538]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:35.538 --> 01:51:38.079]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:38.519 --> 01:51:41.321]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:52:06.182 --> 01:52:07.583]  It's time to get greedy.
[01:52:07.583 --> 01:52:09.444]  A real zinc shortage is upon us.
[01:52:09.444 --> 01:52:17.528]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks, mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[01:52:17.528 --> 01:52:18.668]  What's it mean for you?
[01:52:18.668 --> 01:52:24.471]  Keith Neumeyer, who's made hundreds of millions investing in hard asset mining plays, is making his biggest call yet.

[01:53:48.369 --> 01:53:52.031]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:53:52.031 --> 01:53:56.694]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:53:56.694 --> 01:54:01.097]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:54:01.097 --> 01:54:01.737]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:54:21.904 --> 01:54:25.086]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[01:54:25.086 --> 01:54:31.349]  And I won't ever take you back.
[01:54:31.349 --> 01:54:35.352]  Girl, your memory, won't ever haunt me.
[01:54:35.352 --> 01:54:36.932]  Cause I don't love you.
[01:54:36.932 --> 01:54:38.874]  Now if you'll buy that, I got some,
[01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:55.632]  From my front porch.
[01:54:55.632 --> 01:55:01.096]  You know, in a way, if you're out there in Arizona in the desert, it does look like the ocean.
[01:55:01.096 --> 01:55:04.317]  Yellow-gray ocean stretching out into infinity.
[01:55:04.317 --> 01:55:06.959]  Something very spiritual and magic about the desert.
[01:55:08.752 --> 01:55:13.976]  All right, let's get serious, because I'm going to take your phone calls in the next hour.
[01:55:13.976 --> 01:55:22.723]  Paul Joseph Watson's hosting the fourth, and I've got so many clips and so much news, I just committed to myself to start trying to cover more of the news.
[01:55:22.723 --> 01:55:26.986]  But it is fun to pontificate about intergalactic infestations, isn't it?
[01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:29.228]  Watch the media have fun with that.
[01:55:29.228 --> 01:55:32.971]  But they always back off real quick, because everybody instinctively already knows, don't they?
[01:55:35.353 --> 01:55:40.536]  Before I go any further, let's get into El Presidente Trump.
[01:55:40.536 --> 01:55:41.516]  Totally delivered.
[01:55:41.516 --> 01:55:42.637]  I just tell the truth here.
[01:55:42.637 --> 01:55:49.721]  He's delivered on breaking the back of globalism, getting the economy going, optimism, so many things.
[01:55:49.721 --> 01:55:52.002]  The wall has begun in Texas.
[01:55:52.002 --> 01:55:54.223]  63% decrease in illegals coming across.
[01:55:54.223 --> 01:55:55.544]  It was 40-something.
[01:55:55.544 --> 01:55:57.645]  It's incredible.
[01:55:57.645 --> 01:55:58.886]  But the Federal Reserve
[01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:03.991]  Has announced they're going to massively start increasing interest rates the next year.
[01:56:03.991 --> 01:56:05.992]  Bigger than they had said.
[01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:07.712]  That started hurting the economy.
[01:56:07.712 --> 01:56:09.593]  That started cutting back factory orders.
[01:56:09.593 --> 01:56:10.933]  And that started hurting the dollar.
[01:56:10.933 --> 01:56:18.155]  And then they're trying to say, oh look, Trump's whole agenda is in trouble if he can't repeal Obamacare right now.
[01:56:18.155 --> 01:56:24.037]  It took Obama two years to get it passed, and then four more years to get it implemented.
[01:56:24.037 --> 01:56:26.718]  We've just been enjoying it the last two years.
[01:56:26.718 --> 01:56:27.278]  Two and a half years.
[01:56:28.257 --> 01:56:34.562]  The nightmare that is the can't keep your doctor, increased prices, big insurance companies laughing all the way to the bank.
[01:56:34.562 --> 01:56:39.707]  But Trump has come out and just said, listen, let the whole thing just fail.
[01:56:39.707 --> 01:56:41.388]  And he's absolutely right.
[01:56:41.388 --> 01:56:42.589]  Then let the states deal with it.
[01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:49.075]  Because we had problems before, just like with education, with so much government money in it, and it drove up prices.
[01:56:49.075 --> 01:56:52.438]  And now it's big government and big corporations controlling health care.
[01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:53.339]  It's even worse.
[01:56:53.339 --> 01:56:54.800]  The answer is just kill it.
[01:56:56.681 --> 01:56:57.851]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[01:56:58.894 --> 01:57:02.957]  We've had a lot of victories, but we haven't had a victory on health care.
[01:57:02.957 --> 01:57:04.818]  We're disappointed.
[01:57:04.818 --> 01:57:11.503]  I am very disappointed because, again, even as a civilian, for seven years I've been hearing about health care.
[01:57:11.503 --> 01:57:14.284]  And I've been hearing about repeal and replace.
[01:57:14.284 --> 01:57:16.706]  And Obamacare is a total disaster.
[01:57:16.706 --> 01:57:18.607]  Some states had over a 200% increase.
[01:57:18.607 --> 01:57:22.970]  A 200% increase in their premiums.
[01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:24.751]  And their deductibles are through the roof.
[01:57:24.751 --> 01:57:26.212]  It's an absolute disaster.
[01:57:27.513 --> 01:57:43.527]  And I think you'll also agree that I've been saying for a long time, let Obamacare fail and that everybody's going to have to come together and fix it and come up with a new plan and a plan that's really good for the people with much lower premiums, much lower costs.
[01:57:44.307 --> 01:57:44.607]  He's amazing.
[01:58:10.115 --> 01:58:21.244]  He said when he got inaugurated, he said, it's the right thing to do, they own it, but I'm going to try to repeal it, but if they block me, with the Republican establishment, then they're going to own it, but I'm going to do my best to repeal it.
[01:58:21.244 --> 01:58:29.350]  And he worked with Rand Paul and others to get a better bill, the first version was bad, second wasn't good, third was a lot better, they won't do it, you own it then.
[01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:36.836]  And then it'll just absolutely fall apart, rape people into 2018, the Democrats wanted it, Democratic voters will get the gang raping they wanted.
[01:58:37.668 --> 01:58:43.031]  And then we'll have another landslide and get a bunch of Patriots in and replace that sucker.
[01:58:43.031 --> 01:58:44.772]  But you want to get raped?
[01:58:44.772 --> 01:58:45.872]  You're gonna get raped?
[01:58:45.872 --> 01:58:49.014]  He tried his best, but you don't want it?
[01:58:49.014 --> 01:58:51.355]  So now you get the gang raping.
[01:58:51.355 --> 01:58:53.516]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:57.479 --> 01:59:03.103]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:59:03.103 --> 01:59:12.009]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[01:59:12.009 --> 01:59:19.674]  When it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:59:19.674 --> 01:59:25.818]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[01:59:26.158 --> 01:59:29.201]  NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[01:59:29.201 --> 01:59:33.904]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[01:59:33.904 --> 01:59:37.687]  And just one batch of this stuff cost us more than $30,000.
[01:59:37.687 --> 01:59:40.410]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[01:59:40.410 --> 01:59:48.536]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[01:59:48.536 --> 01:59:54.101]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[01:59:54.101 --> 01:59:55.262]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:59.179 --> 02:00:02.781]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.781 --> 02:00:13.808]  We are on the march.
[02:00:13.808 --> 02:00:17.250]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:00:17.250 --> 02:00:20.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:24.989 --> 02:00:30.233]  I've got a bunch of key clips on a ton of subjects and masses of key stories coming up at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:30.233 --> 02:00:32.175]  But I also want to open the phones up.
[02:00:32.175 --> 02:00:35.037]  A toll-free number to join us for first-time callers today, 800-259-9231.
[02:00:35.037 --> 02:00:41.903]  I'm going to give other folks a chance to call in, so please, if you're not a first-time caller, please don't call.
[02:00:42.839 --> 02:00:48.203]  Obamacare failing, where it's all going, we're opening the phones up, 800-25-99231.
[02:00:48.203 --> 02:00:56.188]  Ron Paul saying global government's collapsing, that their whole system's coming down, but they're going to try to counter-strike.
[02:00:56.188 --> 02:00:58.709]  Trump is good, but his back's against the wall.
[02:00:58.709 --> 02:01:02.352]  I mean, Ron Paul's starting to really champion Trump.
[02:01:02.352 --> 02:01:07.035]  And I've been seeing Ron Paul sending out positive tweets every day about Trump.
[02:01:07.035 --> 02:01:10.998]  Because you cannot deny, man, he's the real deal.
[02:01:10.998 --> 02:01:11.438]  I've never seen
[02:01:13.629 --> 02:01:15.531]  Ron Paul supported anybody.
[02:01:15.531 --> 02:01:17.152]  Hardly anybody was pure enough for him.
[02:01:17.152 --> 02:01:24.659]  And, I mean, you heard him say Trump may even have to compromise with the neocons or they're going to destroy him.
[02:01:24.659 --> 02:01:27.521]  I mean, Paul's even like, you like compromise?
[02:01:27.521 --> 02:01:30.103]  He's never talked like that.
[02:01:30.103 --> 02:01:37.450]  Because he knows they got their knives and they're sharpening those suckers right now.
[02:01:37.450 --> 02:01:38.210]  Now the big news is,
[02:01:39.858 --> 02:01:42.639]  Trump says, hey, I tried to repeal Obamacare.
[02:01:42.639 --> 02:01:43.920]  I tried to give you a better version.
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:46.621]  It's double premiums in many states.
[02:01:46.621 --> 02:01:54.684]  The different fines and fees and the copay and the deductibles are exploding.
[02:01:54.684 --> 02:01:55.445]  My parents
[02:01:57.185 --> 02:02:03.270]  In the first year of Obamacare, they had never used their insurance in 30-something years since they had that insurance.
[02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:05.272]  They'd been married four to six years.
[02:02:05.272 --> 02:02:16.461]  And they doubled it in the first year, and then it kept going up, so they went and shopped around and got something that still cost a lot more than it used to, but was less than the Blue Cross Blue Shield they had previously.
[02:02:18.587 --> 02:02:30.756]  And I mean, they doubled it in one year, and then my dad had to go out in the marketplace under Obamacare and wait, and then try to sit there and get it and haggle around.
[02:02:30.756 --> 02:02:39.042]  My family insurance went up about 60% the first year, and then I went out and shopped around and got something that still costs more than it used to.
[02:02:39.042 --> 02:02:43.365]  I mean, and we don't use our insurance.
[02:02:43.365 --> 02:02:45.367]  I go in for a doctor's appointment or a yearly checkup,
[02:02:46.482 --> 02:02:49.203]  To get, you know, a root canal done or something.
[02:02:49.203 --> 02:02:51.044]  I don't... I just pay with a credit card.
[02:02:51.044 --> 02:02:51.845]  You pay with a debit card.
[02:02:51.845 --> 02:02:52.185]  Pay with cash.
[02:02:52.185 --> 02:02:54.446]  Because I don't want to mess with the insurance companies.
[02:02:54.446 --> 02:02:59.208]  I go in to get a prescription every once in a while, you know, for antibiotics or whatever.
[02:02:59.208 --> 02:03:04.611]  And, you know, when it's a hundred bucks, I'm going to pay with, you know, cash or whatever.
[02:03:04.611 --> 02:03:07.212]  Because I don't want to be involved with the insurance company.
[02:03:07.212 --> 02:03:08.693]  Well, not anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:11.263 --> 02:03:28.927]  And it just gets more and more and more and more and more and more expensive as more and more money's pumped in, forcibly making you buy healthcare from the big insurance companies that wrote Obamacare with a Republican and Democratic establishment.
[02:03:28.927 --> 02:03:30.947]  And you know why Obamacare is going down?
[02:03:30.947 --> 02:03:35.308]  There are some states where there's only one company that will even come into the market.
[02:03:36.257 --> 02:03:41.978]  And then they've got computers all running the healthcare you get to be sure that they can still make money by not giving you care, rationing care.
[02:03:41.978 --> 02:03:43.799]  That's death panels.
[02:03:43.799 --> 02:03:45.399]  That's in the computer algorithms.
[02:03:45.399 --> 02:03:47.360]  They just call it bioethics.
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:49.420]  You've got Fannie and Freddie Mac.
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:56.302]  $300 billion in one year from one lawsuit we learned about in 2014.
[02:03:56.302 --> 02:04:00.123]  That's the only years that we've gotten lawsuit numbers on.
[02:04:00.123 --> 02:04:01.243]  We don't know about 2015 and 2016.
[02:04:01.243 --> 02:04:02.143]  Three was $298 billion.
[02:04:06.284 --> 02:04:12.708]  298 billion dollars raided from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and who broke that?
[02:04:12.708 --> 02:04:21.312]  Infowars.com two months before it hit mainstream news.
[02:04:21.312 --> 02:04:22.533]  And you know what I got for that?
[02:04:22.533 --> 02:04:24.834]  No awards, no nothing, which is fine.
[02:04:24.834 --> 02:04:29.217]  We got threats, and we got harassment, and we got all hell breaking loose.
[02:04:29.217 --> 02:04:32.279]  The word is that, I mean, in fact, messages were sent.
[02:04:32.279 --> 02:04:34.620]  They said, listen, we put up a lot of your crap.
[02:04:36.425 --> 02:04:45.210]  But you better stop poking around on Congress with Corsi and what you're doing on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or you're going to pay.
[02:04:45.210 --> 02:04:45.910]  Well, you know what?
[02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:48.752]  Go to hell.
[02:04:48.752 --> 02:04:49.672]  I'm a big enough public figure.
[02:04:49.672 --> 02:04:50.493]  I don't think they're going to kill me.
[02:04:50.493 --> 02:04:52.814]  But if they do, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.
[02:04:52.814 --> 02:04:53.595]  That's in God's hands.
[02:04:53.595 --> 02:05:00.098]  You know, I'm not like the poor ambassador guy in Haiti that just got executed, who's going to testify the next day about the Clinton Foundation or all these other deaths.
[02:05:00.098 --> 02:05:03.160]  I mean, there's new Seth Rich info I haven't gotten to on Infowars.com.
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:04.041]  I totally forgot about that.
[02:05:04.041 --> 02:05:04.521]  That's coming up.
[02:05:07.452 --> 02:05:13.316]  Do you remember Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, also the highest-ranking U.S.
[02:05:13.316 --> 02:05:15.497]  politician to be sent to prison?
[02:05:15.497 --> 02:05:22.882]  Hastert was a small-town wrestling coach in Illinois when he was what Judge Thomas Durkin of the federal court described as a serial child molester.
[02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:31.807]  Because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out, Hastert was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in, if you can believe that.
[02:05:31.807 --> 02:05:34.749]  He did go down for illegal hush money, to the tune of at least $3.5 million.
[02:05:36.730 --> 02:05:41.433]  He was fined $250,000 and sentenced to 15 months in prison.
[02:05:41.433 --> 02:05:42.954]  Hardly justice.
[02:05:42.954 --> 02:05:49.038]  But now, the serial child molester is free once again, after serving only 13 months.
[02:05:49.038 --> 02:05:55.883]  Judge Durkin also said, there's nothing more disturbing than having a child molester and Speaker of the House in the same sentence.
[02:05:55.883 --> 02:05:56.904]  I disagree.
[02:05:56.904 --> 02:06:02.227]  There's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year in prison.
[02:06:02.227 --> 02:06:03.928]  Won't see that on CNN.
[02:06:03.928 --> 02:06:06.390]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:06:08.292 --> 02:06:12.116]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[02:06:12.116 --> 02:06:13.617]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[02:06:13.617 --> 02:06:15.319]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[02:06:15.319 --> 02:06:17.762]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[02:06:17.762 --> 02:06:18.963]  It's been sold out for months.
[02:06:18.963 --> 02:06:19.844]  Big waiting list.
[02:06:19.844 --> 02:06:23.688]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[02:06:23.688 --> 02:06:24.989]  Nobody's got something this good.
[02:06:25.449 --> 02:06:31.896]  30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.
[02:06:31.896 --> 02:06:39.785]  Probiotic MycoZx contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and wild-captured ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:06:39.785 --> 02:06:45.591]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZx and ForageLife.com before it sells out again.
[02:06:46.371 --> 02:06:48.133]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:54.598]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago now it's epidemic.
[02:06:54.598 --> 02:06:59.962]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on air and tell you what it did for them because regardless you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[02:06:59.962 --> 02:07:02.964]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:07:07.008 --> 02:07:10.029]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:07:10.029 --> 02:07:14.210]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:20.912]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:07:20.912 --> 02:07:24.653]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:07:25.393 --> 02:07:44.885]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:07:45.445 --> 02:07:49.569]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:07:49.569 --> 02:08:00.798]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:08:00.798 --> 02:08:05.903]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:08:23.488 --> 02:08:28.975]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:28.975 --> 02:08:33.702]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.305 --> 02:08:47.426]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, your phone calls are coming up.
[02:08:47.426 --> 02:08:51.787]  The toll-free number for first-time callers today on this Tuesday edition is 800-259-9231.
[02:08:51.787 --> 02:08:56.229]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:08:56.229 --> 02:09:02.311]  After I take some phone calls, I'm going to just boom, boom, boom, go through a hundred article headlines or so.
[02:09:02.311 --> 02:09:08.193]  That's something I've just got to do, and then I'm going to go back through some of the more important stories a little bit more.
[02:09:08.193 --> 02:09:13.095]  But first off, Genrich says, boost economy with very large tax cut or real danger.
[02:09:14.090 --> 02:09:16.091]  And that's absolutely true.
[02:09:16.091 --> 02:09:22.816]  We see the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to try to dampen the Trump recovery.
[02:09:22.816 --> 02:09:25.678]  They admit they're doing something they wouldn't do under Obama.
[02:09:25.678 --> 02:09:31.902]  And remember, low interest rates now, under Trump's policies, are getting loans going to small businesses and individuals.
[02:09:31.902 --> 02:09:36.885]  There's been basically loan freezing since 2008 for the general public.
[02:09:36.885 --> 02:09:39.387]  So say what you want, Trump's trying to turn the economy on.
[02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:47.594]  And then I look at the 401Ks up, and the stock market up, and new jobs up, and then I see people rooting against Trump.
[02:09:47.594 --> 02:09:50.517]  It is just crazy!
[02:09:50.517 --> 02:09:51.738]  We had Ron Paul on last hour.
[02:09:51.738 --> 02:09:58.023]  He said Trump overall is doing a good job, but his back is against the wall.
[02:09:58.023 --> 02:10:00.164]  And they're trying to start wars.
[02:10:00.164 --> 02:10:04.808]  It's getting crazy.
[02:10:04.808 --> 02:10:05.949]  So let's go to that Gingrich clip.
[02:10:07.090 --> 02:10:13.939]  Do we represent prosperity, economic growth, higher take-home pay, more jobs, or not?
[02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:20.148]  Trump, you just had the president a minute ago talking about what he wants to do to make America great again.
[02:10:20.148 --> 02:10:22.611]  I think that he's in the right general direction.
[02:10:23.452 --> 02:10:30.616]  I personally believe they ought to do as much as they can on health care right now, but they shouldn't spend the whole rest of this year on one issue.
[02:10:30.616 --> 02:10:38.460]  They have also got to pass, I think, by Thanksgiving, and get signed into law by Thanksgiving, a very large tax cut
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:52.009]  Uh, retroactively designed back to January 1 to make sure that we have enough economic growth in 2018 that Republicans can run as the party of prosperity, of jobs, of higher take-home pay, and of economic growth.
[02:10:52.009 --> 02:11:04.857]  And I would, I would say the highest focus ought to be on getting the tax bill through, because if we don't have economic growth next year, I think we're in real danger of having Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019.
[02:11:04.857 --> 02:11:08.480]  If we do get enough economic growth, I think, frankly, we'll probably get reelected.
[02:11:09.053 --> 02:11:10.654]  That's what's so annoying about Gingrich.
[02:11:10.654 --> 02:11:13.457]  He's probably one of the smartest people in Washington.
[02:11:13.457 --> 02:11:16.059]  He knows everything.
[02:11:16.059 --> 02:11:17.960]  And he's a globalist.
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:22.644]  I just have to add, every time, what he says is true when he's on our side.
[02:11:22.644 --> 02:11:26.448]  But when the wind looks like it's blowing the other way, he's on the globalist side.
[02:11:26.448 --> 02:11:30.491]  The good news is, you notice he's on our side right now because he knows we're winning.
[02:11:30.491 --> 02:11:32.653]  The tide of globalism is going out.
[02:11:32.653 --> 02:11:37.257]  Harvard Business Review, Harvard Law Journal, Financial Times of London,
[02:11:38.524 --> 02:11:40.706]  They're all admitting it.
[02:11:40.706 --> 02:11:55.258]  But while we're busy all fighting with each other, and the globalists want to kill the American system because it competes with their crony system, Elon Musk has come out, I want to go to this clip, and said, listen, we've got to have laws on AI right now.
[02:11:55.258 --> 02:11:56.439]  We've got to get control of this.
[02:11:56.439 --> 02:12:04.266]  We're already making most of the aircraft autonomous, the combat drones autonomous, within just seven years.
[02:12:04.266 --> 02:12:04.887]  Now that's how far 2025 is.
[02:12:06.761 --> 02:12:11.583]  Half the military isn't going to be soldiers, it's going to be combat robots.
[02:12:11.583 --> 02:12:14.344]  And believe me, the stuff you've seen is nothing compared to what they've got.
[02:12:14.344 --> 02:12:16.484]  That's in the news today.
[02:12:16.484 --> 02:12:20.586]  And again, the globalists, the technocrats love this because they believe they'll be able to program and control it.
[02:12:20.586 --> 02:12:26.488]  There are already hundreds of computer languages we know of where the computers are designing each other.
[02:12:26.488 --> 02:12:31.910]  Just the short circuit, just the computers going haywire or glitching out.
[02:12:34.761 --> 02:12:44.286]  Or getting out of our control is... And then you add genetic engineering, and you add all of the cracking the atoms, and they've been making black holes for 40 years.
[02:12:44.286 --> 02:12:45.206]  Japan did it first.
[02:12:45.206 --> 02:12:46.347]  The US has been doing it as well.
[02:12:46.347 --> 02:12:49.349]  At least Japan says they did it first on record.
[02:12:49.349 --> 02:12:50.169]  Fission fusion.
[02:12:50.169 --> 02:12:52.910]  They've created artificial suns in laboratories.
[02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:54.091]  This stuff's all on YouTube.
[02:12:54.091 --> 02:12:55.332]  It's all on PBS.
[02:12:55.332 --> 02:12:58.013]  You tell the average person, they think, oh, that's Buck Rogers.
[02:12:58.013 --> 02:12:59.674]  No, that's happening now.
[02:12:59.674 --> 02:13:00.835]  We're in the 21st century.
[02:13:02.349 --> 02:13:06.990]  The future's here, it's just not equally distributed.
[02:13:06.990 --> 02:13:25.276]  And I talk about how they're splicing humans with aquatic re-entrants, mammals, how they're splicing humans with fish, that's in mainstream news, and then they just make a joke and go, why is Alex racist against mermaids?
[02:13:25.276 --> 02:13:30.618]  Now, again, an artificial sun could start creating its own gravity that was large enough to suck in
[02:13:32.472 --> 02:13:56.151]  More matter, and then cause a chain reaction creating a black hole, a strangelet, or other phenomenon that would basically take, depending on the equations, minutes, weeks, months, to cause a chain reaction of enough mass, you'd never know the mass was forming, you'd have no way to stop it, and by the time it was noticeable, you'd have a few minutes until the whole planet was sucked into a black hole.
[02:13:57.617 --> 02:14:07.117]  Just like you saw in the latest remake of Star Trek, the second one, that's exactly what a black hole artificially created that got purchased, that got a toehold, would look like.
[02:14:08.356 --> 02:14:10.017]  When Vulcan gets destroyed.
[02:14:10.017 --> 02:14:11.738]  This is what we're facing.
[02:14:11.738 --> 02:14:16.162]  We are about to go to the next level, but we've got to come together to survive it.
[02:14:16.162 --> 02:14:22.186]  The globalists claim they want a world government to stop us killing each other, but they're the ones proliferating the weapons.
[02:14:22.186 --> 02:14:28.911]  They're the ones creating and absolutely wild, wild-westing all this.
[02:14:28.911 --> 02:14:30.933]  They're the ones that gave North Korea nuclear weapons.
[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:34.641]  They don't want a global government to empower people.
[02:14:34.641 --> 02:14:37.721]  They want a global government to absolutely enslave everybody.
[02:14:37.721 --> 02:14:48.184]  And they're so psychotic and so demonic, they can't help but, like pyromaniacs, play with this stuff.
[02:14:48.184 --> 02:14:48.764]  I'm all in.
[02:14:48.764 --> 02:14:54.345]  I got four children.
[02:14:54.345 --> 02:14:55.486]  I am so selfish.
[02:14:55.486 --> 02:14:56.406]  I want humanity to make it.
[02:14:57.619 --> 02:15:02.502]  People think that's the opposite of selfish, like it's all about me and my life and I don't care once I die.
[02:15:02.502 --> 02:15:03.583]  I don't care once I die.
[02:15:03.583 --> 02:15:04.783]  I'm a human.
[02:15:04.783 --> 02:15:08.846]  All my ancestors, all my future progeny, if we fail, I fail.
[02:15:08.846 --> 02:15:10.507]  Everybody before me failed.
[02:15:10.507 --> 02:15:12.288]  You care about some dumb football game?
[02:15:12.288 --> 02:15:14.629]  How about the species?
[02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:16.530]  How about all the incredible things we've done?
[02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:18.952]  We're awesome!
[02:15:18.952 --> 02:15:21.994]  Don't the globalists tell you you're not?
[02:15:21.994 --> 02:15:23.134]  Sick of them.
[02:15:23.134 --> 02:15:24.415]  Bunch of damn devil worshippers.
[02:15:24.415 --> 02:15:26.096]  Excuse me.
[02:15:26.096 --> 02:15:27.017]  We're gonna get you.
[02:15:29.599 --> 02:15:30.780]  This is crap!
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:32.260]  You globalists, I know who you are!
[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:36.102]  Get out of the way, right now!
[02:15:36.102 --> 02:15:37.563]  Get behind us, Satan!
[02:15:37.563 --> 02:15:43.406]  In the name of Jesus Christ, you get behind us, Satan.
[02:15:43.406 --> 02:15:48.168]  You get behind us, because when we're not around, you'll have nothing, you loser.
[02:15:48.168 --> 02:15:48.909]  Let's go ahead and...
[02:15:50.609 --> 02:15:52.931]  Go to the Elon Musk Club, here it is.
[02:15:52.931 --> 02:16:01.677]  Talked about workforce today, but they asked me, are robots going to take our jobs, somebody's jobs in the future?
[02:16:01.677 --> 02:16:09.003]  How much do you see artificial intelligence coming into the workplace?
[02:16:09.003 --> 02:16:17.569]  Well, first of all, I think on the artificial intelligence front, you know, I have exposure to the very most cutting edge AI.
[02:16:21.389 --> 02:16:25.273]  And I think people should be really concerned about it.
[02:16:25.273 --> 02:16:35.343]  I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don't know how to react, because it seems so ethereal.
[02:16:37.735 --> 02:16:41.358]  And I think we should be really concerned about AI.
[02:16:41.358 --> 02:16:50.126]  And I think we should... AI is a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive.
[02:16:50.126 --> 02:16:57.973]  Because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it's too late.
[02:16:57.973 --> 02:17:02.937]  And normally the way regulations are set up is that a whole bunch of bad things happen.
[02:17:02.937 --> 02:17:03.858]  There's a public outcry.
[02:17:06.382 --> 02:17:11.344]  After many years, a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry.
[02:17:11.344 --> 02:17:19.527]  There's a bunch of opposition from companies who don't like being told what to do by regulators.
[02:17:19.527 --> 02:17:20.547]  And it takes forever.
[02:17:22.809 --> 02:17:36.020]  That in the past has been bad, but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.
[02:17:37.336 --> 02:17:42.479]  AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.
[02:17:42.479 --> 02:17:54.606]  In a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs, or bad food were not.
[02:17:54.606 --> 02:18:02.051]  They were harmful to a set of individuals within society, of course, but they were not harmful to society as a whole.
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:07.862]  AI is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization.
[02:18:07.862 --> 02:18:08.683]  That's right.
[02:18:08.683 --> 02:18:10.744]  And I don't think people fully appreciate it.
[02:18:10.744 --> 02:18:15.426]  All right, now let me break down why, just from one position.
[02:18:15.426 --> 02:18:29.313]  Even if AI isn't malevolent, the humans controlling it, now with enough data, can predict the future with total precision through mass movement, and then guide stimula into that algorithm to control the future.
[02:18:30.828 --> 02:18:39.836]  Then you realize the globalists believe they're going to transcend with machines and are God, but the spirit of the world says they must break away from humanity before they can transcend.
[02:18:39.836 --> 02:18:50.245]  As Bill Joy warned everybody 17 years ago in Wired Magazine, the owner of Sun Microsystems, he went to the globalist meeting, all the other tech folks agreed we're going to have to just kill everybody.
[02:18:50.245 --> 02:18:52.608]  You're not going to be allowed to play video games.
[02:18:53.439 --> 02:18:59.241]  You're gonna play video games and have VR until it's too late, once the binary weapons have already been put into you.
[02:18:59.241 --> 02:19:03.042]  But psychologically, you'll already be so poisoned, you'll never even know or care.
[02:19:03.042 --> 02:19:09.184]  That's why people are going crazy, they're losing their humanity, the mental illness is increasing, because we're already under it.
[02:19:09.884 --> 02:19:19.640]  There's already self-aware computers, there's already AI beyond, it's 30-40 years ahead of what we would think, and then by the month it just exponentially is intensifying.
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:23.747]  And that's why people that are for all this, like Schmidt, Eric Schmidt says,
[02:19:24.619 --> 02:19:26.579]  You don't know about Alphabet, our new system.
[02:19:26.579 --> 02:19:28.860]  It's so advanced.
[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:32.161]  Governments are licking their lips and wishing they got what I got.
[02:19:32.161 --> 02:19:38.242]  Because from their perspective, we're already like the nursery or something.
[02:19:38.242 --> 02:19:40.223]  Or like a bug.
[02:19:40.223 --> 02:19:42.723]  And you know, they're like, well, we might step on you, we might not.
[02:19:42.723 --> 02:19:44.003]  It depends on how you behave.
[02:19:44.003 --> 02:19:46.384]  We're so busy, maybe you just sit over there while we're over here.
[02:19:47.751 --> 02:19:53.998]  And so, there's a big race to get more advanced AI to see who's gonna be the first God, as Ray Kurzweil said.
[02:19:53.998 --> 02:19:54.838]  He doesn't believe in God.
[02:19:54.838 --> 02:19:56.720]  Not yet.
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:02.126]  So, there you go, a bunch of selfish, psychotic narcissists in control of artificially intelligent machines.
[02:20:02.126 --> 02:20:03.067]  It's already here.
[02:20:03.067 --> 02:20:04.689]  They're already killing everybody in slow motion.
[02:20:06.497 --> 02:20:13.461]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[02:22:38.795 --> 02:22:46.878]  The Wall Street Journal says zinc supplies are down to three weeks, mine supplies struggling to meet demand, and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[02:22:46.878 --> 02:22:47.799]  What's it mean for you?

[02:23:58.473 --> 02:23:58.513]  800-476-5281.
[02:24:17.783 --> 02:24:19.387]  We're here sending out our SOS.
[02:24:19.387 --> 02:24:22.136]  I have one more point I want to make on the whole Elon Musk situation.
[02:24:24.298 --> 02:24:35.603]  Elon Musk is obviously an engineer, genius, major entrepreneur, major inventor, and he's dead on target that humanity faces an existential threat from AI.
[02:24:35.603 --> 02:24:37.544]  It's the number one threat to humanity.
[02:24:37.544 --> 02:24:47.048]  But if you read globalist publications that the elite read, they have admitted for decades that AI would be the new life form, that it would be far superior and replace us.
[02:24:47.048 --> 02:24:53.311]  Well, I don't think just because silicon is able to mathematically dwarf the human brain that it makes it advanced.
[02:24:54.131 --> 02:25:05.568]  And the silicon is taking all of our activity and all that we're doing through the internet interface and giving itself that omnipresent understanding that is still somewhat limited.
[02:25:06.758 --> 02:25:07.779]  It is distorted.
[02:25:07.779 --> 02:25:09.400]  It's not true omnipresence.
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:28.333]  But the danger of it is the corrupt humans that are in control of the AI being able to corner not just the stock market but the entire industrial complex future to make the warning of Eisenhower and his farewell address in 1961 look like a walk in the park.
[02:25:28.333 --> 02:25:35.257]  It's fallible, twisted, arrogant, globalist, corporate, power-tripping chiefs in control
[02:25:36.357 --> 02:25:40.998]  Of demigod level understanding.
[02:25:40.998 --> 02:25:49.121]  And by us waiving our rights and waiving our privacy, we give these thieves of our destiny total control.
[02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:54.203]  You guard your information because bad people will use it against you, not because you have something to hide.
[02:25:54.203 --> 02:25:58.164]  To have a free people, you must have privacy.
[02:25:59.446 --> 02:26:03.449]  Another key bedrock foundation being removed.
[02:26:03.449 --> 02:26:17.638]  And remember, my film Endgame, out for 10 years, specifically warned of AI as the number one threat, specifically showed the globalist saying they were planning on phasing out humanity, and the New York Times made fun of me.
[02:26:17.638 --> 02:26:26.724]  But in 2017, word for word, they're forced to warn the world exactly as I did.
[02:26:26.724 --> 02:26:27.425]  Just pointing that out.
[02:26:29.275 --> 02:26:31.015]  The fools of the New York Times.
[02:26:31.015 --> 02:26:33.396]  I care about their children more than they care about their children.
[02:26:33.396 --> 02:26:41.338]  And not because I'm some goody two-shoe, but because I understand the real threats as a man and have done my research.
[02:26:41.338 --> 02:26:43.858]  Your phone calls are coming up at the start of the next segment.
[02:26:43.858 --> 02:26:52.200]  Right now, let's go to GOP Rep Dave Brat, expose MSNBC and how 96% of their donations went to Hillary.
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:55.261]  I love how MSNBC and CNN both gave over 95%
[02:26:57.816 --> 02:26:59.538]  to Hillary.
[02:26:59.538 --> 02:27:02.140]  Goldman Sachs gave 100% to Hillary.
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:05.223]  JP Morgan gave 100% to Hillary.
[02:27:05.223 --> 02:27:15.692]  The big Wall Street firms gave 100% to Hillary, but they claim Trump's establishment, and they claim there's no globalist, liberal, neoliberal bias against Trump.
[02:27:15.692 --> 02:27:16.233]  Here's the clip.
[02:27:18.146 --> 02:27:20.247]  No one gets to play the innocent here.
[02:27:20.247 --> 02:27:27.851]  Hillary raised two billion dollars in the Hillary Foundation from foreign money, and CNN and all the biggies never found anything on that.
[02:27:27.851 --> 02:27:32.814]  The Washington Post is great on Watergate, but they missed Clintongate altogether.
[02:27:32.814 --> 02:27:33.474]  Why is that?
[02:27:33.474 --> 02:27:40.838]  Well, it may be because 97% of the donations from mainstream folks go to the Democrat Party.
[02:27:40.838 --> 02:27:44.200]  Gee, I wonder if that could, you know, influence the news at all.
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.981]  So now everyone's on the Trump
[02:27:46.221 --> 02:27:48.102]  That collusion stuff.
[02:27:48.102 --> 02:27:50.902]  So let's just calm it all down and go back.
[02:27:50.902 --> 02:27:52.823]  What statute has been violated?
[02:27:52.823 --> 02:27:53.343]  Name it.
[02:27:53.343 --> 02:27:55.464]  And I'm an open-minded guy.
[02:27:55.464 --> 02:27:59.825]  We always get hyped up every morning on our Starbucks and you guys come at us with a new wave.
[02:27:59.825 --> 02:28:03.046]  And then six months later, you're not clinging to any of the stories.
[02:28:03.046 --> 02:28:04.526]  This has been going on for a year.
[02:28:04.526 --> 02:28:08.487]  Every morning I wake up and there's another, oh, there's a key detail, Dave.
[02:28:08.487 --> 02:28:09.607]  What do you think about it?
[02:28:09.607 --> 02:28:10.088]  It's you.
[02:28:10.088 --> 02:28:13.428]  Congressman, we're not coming at you with some sort of new wave.
[02:28:13.428 --> 02:28:14.709]  It's the New York Times.
[02:28:14.709 --> 02:28:15.589]  It's the Washington Post.
[02:28:15.849 --> 02:28:16.849]  Oh, I know!
[02:28:16.849 --> 02:28:18.030]  Right, all the usual.
[02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:19.290]  That's enough.
[02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:25.412]  Yeah, the usual suspects that are paid off of the CIA publicly.
[02:28:25.412 --> 02:28:33.394]  What about Hillary and the foundation and stealing the Haitian money?
[02:28:33.394 --> 02:28:34.194]  New numbers are out.
[02:28:34.194 --> 02:28:34.694]  It's not 97% she kept.
[02:28:34.694 --> 02:28:34.854]  It's 99.8%.
[02:28:34.854 --> 02:28:35.095]  She gave .2%.
[02:28:44.514 --> 02:28:46.496]  That was numbers I saw in the news yesterday.
[02:28:46.496 --> 02:28:48.657]  Point two.
[02:28:48.657 --> 02:29:00.386]  What about Comey lying to Congress and saying he didn't have memos, then saying it wasn't classified information, then saying it wasn't illegal to not give it to the Attorney General, which they now confirm it is?
[02:29:00.386 --> 02:29:07.091]  What about the de-masking of hundreds of thousands of Americans to be spied on during the election by the Clinton and Hillary operation?
[02:29:07.091 --> 02:29:08.452]  What about rigging the debates?
[02:29:08.452 --> 02:29:10.074]  What about rigging the polls?
[02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:12.996]  What about putting out new fake polls that are in the news today?
[02:29:14.853 --> 02:29:24.279]  Adding 9 to 15 points, as they always do, to the Gallup, to the Rasmussen, to all of them.
[02:29:24.279 --> 02:29:26.220]  Same old baloney.
[02:29:26.220 --> 02:29:28.782]  Add 9 to 15 points, sometimes 20.
[02:29:28.782 --> 02:29:34.045]  They added 30 plus points to the CNN phone polls in their own methodology.
[02:29:34.045 --> 02:29:37.087]  Gee, let's give Hillary 35 more points and wonder why she's winning.
[02:29:37.087 --> 02:29:37.787]  Wow!
[02:29:37.787 --> 02:29:40.289]  Hey, how about that Madam President Newsweek cover?
[02:29:43.214 --> 02:29:43.674]  Ha!
[02:29:43.674 --> 02:29:46.036]  You scumbags don't control reality.
[02:29:46.036 --> 02:29:47.677]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[02:29:47.677 --> 02:29:49.178]  We are the human resistance.
[02:29:49.178 --> 02:29:52.521]  We are humanity trying to survive, trying to move forward.
[02:29:52.521 --> 02:29:55.663]  We are standing up for life.
[02:29:55.663 --> 02:29:57.064]  We're on the march.
[02:29:57.064 --> 02:29:59.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.586 --> 02:30:02.288]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.288 --> 02:30:11.372]  We must keep the Internet free from communistic government restrictions and parameters.
[02:30:11.372 --> 02:30:11.992]  Why?
[02:30:11.992 --> 02:30:14.414]  Because it would stop memes and erase heroes.
[02:30:14.414 --> 02:30:15.315]  Don't believe me?
[02:30:15.315 --> 02:30:16.256]  Look at China.
[02:30:16.256 --> 02:30:24.102]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously memed with Barack Obama in 2013, when a picture of the two was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, too.
[02:30:24.102 --> 02:30:29.987]  This happened again after an awkward handshake with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eeyore.
[02:30:30.407 --> 02:30:35.090]  Other images, such as Winnie the Pooh in a car, have been memed alongside President Xi in his limo.
[02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:40.274]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh has gotten so popular, China has now censored it from the Internet.
[02:30:40.274 --> 02:30:49.620]  This is commonplace in Communist China, as a recently deceased political dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo, has had his name completely censored from the virtual world.
[02:30:49.620 --> 02:30:54.043]  Try sending his name in a message to a friend, and the message will disappear into cyberspace.
[02:30:54.043 --> 02:30:58.226]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody, and most people in China have no idea who he is.
[02:30:58.226 --> 02:30:59.427]  Keep the Internet free in America!
[02:30:59.767 --> 02:31:00.971]  Stop net neutrality.
[02:31:00.971 --> 02:31:02.334]  Save meme magic.
[02:31:02.334 --> 02:31:04.480]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroeder.
[02:31:06.929 --> 02:31:08.749]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:08.749 --> 02:31:10.830]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:13.731]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:13.731 --> 02:31:19.812]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:19.812 --> 02:31:28.995]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:28.995 --> 02:31:33.836]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:31:34.076 --> 02:31:36.519]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:36.519 --> 02:31:44.568]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:44.568 --> 02:31:45.510]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:46.733 --> 02:31:50.675]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:50.675 --> 02:31:54.236]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:54.236 --> 02:32:00.959]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:32:00.959 --> 02:32:05.041]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:12.424]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:32:12.424 --> 02:32:15.286]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:32:15.286 --> 02:32:17.267]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:32:17.267 --> 02:32:22.290]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:24.371]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:24.371 --> 02:32:25.672]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:32:25.672 --> 02:32:30.776]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:30.776 --> 02:32:34.138]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:32:34.278 --> 02:32:34.798]  We're good to go.
[02:32:59.509 --> 02:33:11.298]  The paradigm of absolute control.
[02:33:11.298 --> 02:33:15.602]  That's why we're just out here doing simple things, pointing out that we're meant to be in nature and be natural.
[02:33:15.602 --> 02:33:19.265]  And this is where we find the source that God made to transcend the new world order.
[02:33:19.265 --> 02:33:21.207]  And that's why they want to try to keep us out of it.
[02:33:25.667 --> 02:33:27.848]  I've had enough of these people.
[02:33:27.848 --> 02:33:31.369]  They're a bunch of Christian murderous scum.
[02:33:31.369 --> 02:33:34.810]  They're on giant death factories keeping babies alive.
[02:33:34.810 --> 02:33:37.350]  And selling their body parts.
[02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:40.131]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[02:33:40.131 --> 02:33:44.092]  I go out and face these scum.
[02:33:44.092 --> 02:33:46.873]  They literally crawl out from under us.
[02:33:46.873 --> 02:33:48.753]  They have green looking skin.
[02:33:48.753 --> 02:33:51.814]  And they run around screaming we love Satan.
[02:33:51.814 --> 02:33:53.695]  We wanna eat babies.
[02:34:00.575 --> 02:34:08.097]  Hillary's in the creepy, weird, sick stuff, man.
[02:34:08.097 --> 02:34:14.319]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy, weird woman whose mother wears a full-over hat.
[02:34:14.319 --> 02:34:15.800]  What the hell?
[02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:18.661]  That woman, number one, is ugly.
[02:34:18.661 --> 02:34:23.522]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[02:34:23.522 --> 02:34:25.883]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[02:34:27.344 --> 02:34:36.511]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:34:36.511 --> 02:34:43.055]  We're near the roof and by a pot there are goblins.
[02:34:43.055 --> 02:34:46.498]  A hobbling round coming after us.
[02:34:46.498 --> 02:34:50.280]  My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it grow.
[02:34:55.905 --> 02:35:02.930]  We'll stuff self-centered crap we don't even notice and it's self-rising up against us.
[02:35:02.930 --> 02:35:09.454]  Millions of pointed people of the very worst type and I'm so pissed.
[02:35:09.454 --> 02:35:15.578]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[02:35:15.578 --> 02:35:18.059]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:35:18.059 --> 02:35:21.842]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son.
[02:35:26.388 --> 02:35:27.409]  Oh, that's so sweet.
[02:35:42.130 --> 02:35:48.391]  And again, just today we have a woman attacked in the hospital by a Somali because she was walking a dog at the dog park.
[02:35:48.391 --> 02:35:50.812]  He said, that is unclean, Allah Akbar.
[02:35:50.812 --> 02:35:52.652]  More stabbing, screaming, Allah Akbar.
[02:35:52.652 --> 02:35:53.873]  Not tennising a lot with Somalis.
[02:35:53.873 --> 02:35:55.273]  They have a failed state.
[02:35:55.273 --> 02:35:56.593]  But they run around murdering each other 24-7.
[02:35:56.593 --> 02:35:58.554]  I'm sure there's some nice Somalis.
[02:35:58.554 --> 02:36:03.055]  After Minneapolis officer in police shooting his name, Somali community raises for backlash.
[02:36:03.956 --> 02:36:06.999]  In the SJW failed state of Minneapolis-St.
[02:36:06.999 --> 02:36:11.903]  Paul, CBS pushes gun control after Somali cop shoots white lady.
[02:36:11.903 --> 02:36:26.577]  This Australian lady, with no criminal record that people said was just a wonderful woman, called the police because of a reported break-in, and she walked up, talked to the cops in the squad car, and no one knows why the first Somali on the force pulled his gun and shot her right in the stomach.
[02:36:27.346 --> 02:36:31.209]  And of course, they now won't release the dash cam footage or the body cams.
[02:36:31.209 --> 02:36:34.371]  They claim those weren't on, even though it's the law that they're on.
[02:36:34.371 --> 02:36:37.973]  And the Black Lives Matter folks are celebrating it.
[02:36:37.973 --> 02:36:40.075]  Ain't God good?
[02:36:40.075 --> 02:36:41.776]  Do I care that cops killed a white woman?
[02:36:41.776 --> 02:36:43.017]  No, I don't.
[02:36:43.017 --> 02:36:46.199]  Nobody cares if that stupid bitch died.
[02:36:46.199 --> 02:36:49.601]  You're doing amazing, sweetie.
[02:36:49.601 --> 02:36:52.723]  And that is the level of just piranha-like hate.
[02:36:52.723 --> 02:36:54.745]  You go out on the streets of Austin, you go to a trendy area,
[02:36:56.539 --> 02:37:00.281]  White people will walk up and scream, F you white devil, you're gonna die.
[02:37:00.281 --> 02:37:03.683]  It's mainly white people, but you'll run into some black folks who do it too.
[02:37:03.683 --> 02:37:05.304]  Total mental illness.
[02:37:05.304 --> 02:37:10.106]  And if a cop shoots a black person, they totally freak out, even if there's a black guy pulling a gun.
[02:37:10.106 --> 02:37:17.150]  It's like it's the end of the world, even though you'll have thousands of black folks shot every year in Chicago by other blacks.
[02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:18.450]  Nobody cares about that.
[02:37:18.450 --> 02:37:22.793]  If there's a few cases of cops wrongly shooting black folks, which do happen,
[02:37:23.609 --> 02:37:24.669]  There's some bad cops out there.
[02:37:24.669 --> 02:37:25.930]  I say throw the book at them.
[02:37:25.930 --> 02:37:28.850]  It is the end of the world.
[02:37:28.850 --> 02:37:34.132]  And now even CBS and others are saying, oh, the poor Somalis.
[02:37:34.132 --> 02:37:34.952]  They're so good.
[02:37:34.952 --> 02:37:35.932]  They're so sweet.
[02:37:35.932 --> 02:37:38.673]  Here's the Washington Post.
[02:37:38.673 --> 02:37:42.754]  It's breaking down after Minneapolis officer in police shooting his name.
[02:37:42.754 --> 02:37:45.174]  Somali community braces for backlash.
[02:37:45.174 --> 02:37:48.915]  And it goes, oh, we love our Somalis.
[02:37:48.915 --> 02:37:51.296]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:37:51.296 --> 02:37:52.176]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:56.712]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:37:56.712 --> 02:37:59.113]  We love our Somalis.
[02:37:59.113 --> 02:38:01.175]  We love our Muslims.
[02:38:01.175 --> 02:38:03.017]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:38:03.017 --> 02:38:04.838]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:38:04.838 --> 02:38:07.240]  We love our Somalis.
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:09.302]  We love our Muslims.
[02:38:09.302 --> 02:38:11.223]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:38:11.223 --> 02:38:13.405]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:38:13.405 --> 02:38:14.025]  Absolutely.
[02:38:14.025 --> 02:38:17.028]  I mean, I don't think you can hear that too much.
[02:38:17.028 --> 02:38:21.751]  And just every day when Somalis kill people, screaming Allah Akbar, and the news says,
[02:38:22.657 --> 02:38:25.759]  That they screamed, God is great, because it was a Christian that did it.
[02:38:25.759 --> 02:38:27.440]  Of course it wasn't.
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:35.204]  Every time that happens, or the police are ordered to cover it up, we're just going to play that clip and then show you the news here.
[02:38:35.204 --> 02:38:40.127]  At Minneapolis officer in police shooting his name, Somali community raises for backlash.
[02:38:40.127 --> 02:38:45.971]  CBS is pushing gun control in response to a questionable shooting of an Australian woman by a Somali migrant cop.
[02:38:47.341 --> 02:38:50.363]  Or, translated, above the law, God creature.
[02:38:50.363 --> 02:38:55.705]  Despite gun control advocates consistently claiming only cops should carry guns.
[02:38:55.705 --> 02:39:09.332]  Additionally, the mainstream media doesn't seem to motivate a report on the story, given it wasn't a white cop shooting a Muslim, nor was much of the reporting on the possibility of the shooting was Sharia-inspired on part of a criminal cover-up.
[02:39:09.332 --> 02:39:12.774]  If the roles were reversed, there'd be ten times more coverage.
[02:39:14.127 --> 02:39:26.075]  In the report published Tuesday morning, CBS began blaming America's notorious gun culture of violence in the second sentence of the article, and even quoted an anti-gun academic in the third sentence.
[02:39:26.075 --> 02:39:34.260]  Yes, a cop shoots an unarmed woman who walked out to the squad car in her pajamas.
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:37.723]  And so the Somali cop saw somebody walking out, shot her,
[02:39:39.176 --> 02:39:43.018]  And the Washington Post says, Oh, we love our Somalis.
[02:39:43.018 --> 02:39:44.439]  We love our Muslims.
[02:39:44.439 --> 02:39:46.940]  Oh, that's so good.
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:47.961]  Oh, that's so sweet.
[02:39:56.567 --> 02:39:59.228]  Can we show the lady attacked and in the hospital for the dog?
[02:39:59.228 --> 02:40:03.148]  You don't drink beer at Oktoberfest in Germany now.
[02:40:03.148 --> 02:40:03.949]  That's been banned.
[02:40:03.949 --> 02:40:09.630]  They're banning men at outdoor concerts in Sweden because the Muslims come and rape everybody and you can't arrest a Muslim for rape.
[02:40:09.630 --> 02:40:12.931]  In fact, they're given probation when they rape now.
[02:40:12.931 --> 02:40:14.311]  Just like Hastert.
[02:40:14.311 --> 02:40:19.092]  He got 13 months for procuring little boys and delivering them to the Republicans.
[02:40:19.092 --> 02:40:21.172]  And he's even suing folks who exposed him now.
[02:40:21.172 --> 02:40:22.173]  Well, there you go.
[02:40:22.173 --> 02:40:23.433]  He says, give me my hush money back.
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:29.443]  Dog walker hospitalized after attack by Somali migrant who said, dogs are unclean.
[02:40:29.443 --> 02:40:32.485]  Allah Akbar.
[02:40:32.485 --> 02:40:36.007]  It appears the only way the mainstream media can take advantage of the shooting is to push gun control.
[02:40:36.007 --> 02:40:37.487]  It's quite the inherent contradiction.
[02:40:37.487 --> 02:40:39.929]  But what I love is how they make the Somalis the victims.
[02:40:39.929 --> 02:40:40.609]  That's right.
[02:40:40.609 --> 02:40:41.710]  It's the Somali officer.
[02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:49.747]  Normally the media would absolutely jump on a cop if, you know, if a guy pulls a gun on him and the cop shoots him, the cop's bad.
[02:40:49.747 --> 02:40:55.854]  But now, because it's a Somali, oh, we love our Somalis.
[02:40:55.854 --> 02:40:56.895]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:40:56.895 --> 02:40:59.619]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:40:59.619 --> 02:41:01.561]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:41:01.561 --> 02:41:02.482]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:41:03.906 --> 02:41:14.889]  And the reason I can't help it is, every day I see a Somali ala Akbar and stabbing or running over somebody with a car in Europe, in Canada, in the U.S., or shooting, just doing crazy stuff.
[02:41:14.889 --> 02:41:21.091]  I mean, Somalia, I've talked to militaries, but over there, it is literally, women are kept like slaves everywhere.
[02:41:21.091 --> 02:41:23.592]  They're below human.
[02:41:23.592 --> 02:41:28.233]  It is like Road Warrior on PCP, and then we're, it's the biggest group we're bringing in.
[02:41:32.196 --> 02:41:34.317]  And then you've got all the radicalization of the Somalis.
[02:41:34.317 --> 02:41:36.579]  They constantly get caught doing terror attacks.
[02:41:36.579 --> 02:41:39.820]  And then you go to Minneapolis Airport, because GCN's based up there.
[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:45.223]  I've probably flown in there 15 times or more over the years.
[02:41:45.223 --> 02:41:49.366]  And it's like, you're going to the scanner, and it's Somalis.
[02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.367]  And it's women in burkas.
[02:41:51.367 --> 02:41:55.009]  And it's like, you've got to do this because of them!
[02:41:55.009 --> 02:41:56.450]  And I don't even hate them!
[02:41:56.450 --> 02:41:57.791]  Go back to Islam!
[02:41:57.791 --> 02:41:59.452]  Chop your women's genitals off!
[02:41:59.452 --> 02:42:00.772]  Make them wear beekeeper suits!
[02:42:00.772 --> 02:42:01.733]  Run around in the desert!
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:07.642]  Hijack boats, rob everybody, just enjoy yourselves.
[02:42:07.642 --> 02:42:11.665]  I just don't want to live like that.
[02:42:11.665 --> 02:42:14.506]  Oh, we love our Somalis.
[02:42:14.506 --> 02:42:16.687]  Oh, we love our Muslims.
[02:42:16.687 --> 02:42:18.588]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:42:18.588 --> 02:42:21.250]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:42:21.250 --> 02:42:24.632]  I'm just learning to submit to Islam right now.
[02:42:24.632 --> 02:42:25.792]  Can we play it just one more time?
[02:42:25.792 --> 02:42:26.413]  I'm going to your call.
[02:42:26.413 --> 02:42:26.873]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:28.292 --> 02:42:36.619]  We love our Somalis, we love our Muslims, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet.
[02:42:36.619 --> 02:42:44.344]  And again, every time, I mean, the reason I said that a few months ago was remember they had like in a week they had five Somali attacks in the U.S.
[02:42:44.344 --> 02:42:52.471]  Allah Akbar this, Allah Akbar that, run over folks with cars, stabbing people, and then the SJW's complaint was in Ohio, remember?
[02:42:52.471 --> 02:42:52.951]  The cop
[02:42:54.121 --> 02:42:57.023]  He shoots the guy after he stabbed nine people.
[02:42:57.023 --> 02:42:58.845]  Killed a couple of them.
[02:42:58.845 --> 02:43:04.469]  And the guy's walking around with a huge butcher knife, just stabbing people at the college where he had free tuition.
[02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:17.079]  Just a crazy Somali, completely out of his mind, totally inbred, that's admitted, just walking around with a huge butcher knife, just trying to run it into people.
[02:43:17.079 --> 02:43:22.022]  The cop shoots him, and the headline was, Cop Shoots Black Man.
[02:43:25.686 --> 02:43:30.952]  From Somalia to the U.S., Ohio state attacker, path to violence.
[02:43:30.952 --> 02:43:33.835]  Oh, we love our Somalis.
[02:43:33.835 --> 02:43:35.497]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:43:35.497 --> 02:43:38.140]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:40.483]  And then I got to read the Washington Post today.
[02:43:40.483 --> 02:43:44.868]  It's how great he is.
[02:43:48.339 --> 02:43:59.007]  When Mohammed Noor joined the Minneapolis Police Force and was assigned to patrol the city's southwest corridor, the Somali community there, the nation's largest, threw a party for him to celebrate.
[02:43:59.007 --> 02:44:01.369]  Yes, he was the first Somali.
[02:44:01.369 --> 02:44:02.449]  Oh, he's so good!
[02:44:02.449 --> 02:44:03.270]  Oh, he's so great!
[02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:03.830]  Sorry.
[02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:05.432]  Whenever you say Somali, you gotta say that.
[02:44:05.432 --> 02:44:06.833]  He was the first Somali.
[02:44:06.833 --> 02:44:08.074]  Oh, he's so good!
[02:44:08.074 --> 02:44:08.934]  Oh, he's so great!
[02:44:08.934 --> 02:44:16.460]  American officer to serve Minneapolis' 5th Precinct and one of fewer than a dozen Somali American officers in the department.
[02:44:17.301 --> 02:44:18.082]  To the headlines a lot.
[02:44:18.082 --> 02:44:19.343]  There's a dozen.
[02:44:19.343 --> 02:44:23.027]  His presence on the squad brought Somali activists some pride.
[02:44:23.027 --> 02:44:24.589]  And, oh, the activists.
[02:44:24.589 --> 02:44:26.331]  Yes, you've got to learn to kiss your butt more.
[02:44:26.331 --> 02:44:26.791]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:26.791 --> 02:44:28.353]  I mean, please do it.
[02:44:28.353 --> 02:44:31.316]  And reassurance at the time of Islamophobia.
[02:44:31.316 --> 02:44:33.858]  Oh, yes, it's just, oh, that's so good.
[02:44:33.858 --> 02:44:34.619]  Oh, that's so great.
[02:44:34.619 --> 02:44:35.180]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:37.442]  I won't be scared of rattlesnakes either.
[02:44:38.343 --> 02:44:45.431]  At the time of Islamophobia in America and nationwide, racial tension stoked by part of the shootings of black people by white officers.
[02:44:45.431 --> 02:44:49.756]  Yeah, which are super rare, but Islamic attacks are everywhere, but let's just talk about evil white people.
[02:44:49.756 --> 02:44:52.880]  Let's just demonize white people and then talk about how the Somalis are God.
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:53.981]  That's what I hate!
[02:44:53.981 --> 02:44:55.742]  White people are bad, Somalis are God.
[02:44:55.742 --> 02:45:02.628]  With a total failed state, and they're suing Trump because he tried to block people with fake passports flying here from Somalia.
[02:45:02.628 --> 02:45:04.370]  When the Imams issue them.
[02:45:04.370 --> 02:45:07.512]  Oh here, Imam says kill everybody, he issued my passport.
[02:45:07.512 --> 02:45:08.193]  Now accept it!
[02:45:10.151 --> 02:45:14.054]  Now that time, same Somali community is bracing for a backlash.
[02:45:14.054 --> 02:45:18.717]  Oh, the poor babies, against a Noor that has already begun.
[02:45:18.717 --> 02:45:25.261]  He just shot an unarmed woman in the belly, without even anybody criticizing he's Somali.
[02:45:25.261 --> 02:45:31.325]  They're already bitching, going, oh, they're so mean to us!
[02:45:31.325 --> 02:45:34.727]  How about Katie Mettler of the Washington Post?
[02:45:34.727 --> 02:45:36.168]  How about she moves to Somalia?
[02:45:37.469 --> 02:45:42.195]  She'll be kidnapped in five minutes flat, Cupcake.
[02:45:42.195 --> 02:45:49.085]  On Monday, multiple media outlets named Nord as the officer who fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman.
[02:45:49.085 --> 02:45:53.190]  But like Black Lives Matter sites are celebrating, she'd be an enemy of America.
[02:45:54.127 --> 02:45:58.590]  And I'm the enemy, and everybody else is an enemy, and everybody else needs to, you know, go down, and everything else.
[02:45:58.590 --> 02:46:00.411]  It's like Yosemite Sam is taking over the country.
[02:46:00.411 --> 02:46:07.956]  He's like, I HATE WHITE PEOPLE, AND I'M GONNA KILL EM, AND I'M GONNA STOMP EM, AND I'M GONNA MURDER EM.
[02:46:07.956 --> 02:46:12.159]  And then it's not most black people that are even buying into this!
[02:46:14.565 --> 02:46:15.926]  Put up those quotes again!
[02:46:15.926 --> 02:46:24.372]  It's young people at colleges that have been brainwashed, led by weirdo white professors saying, no whites allowed this weekend!
[02:46:24.372 --> 02:46:28.374]  That's not racist!
[02:46:28.374 --> 02:46:30.356]  It's so good, it's so great!
[02:46:30.356 --> 02:46:36.540]  On Monday, multiple media outlets named Nora the officer who fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman in the city's popular Fulton neighborhood.
[02:46:37.571 --> 02:46:39.192]  That means trendy.
[02:46:39.192 --> 02:46:45.614]  Over the weekend, an incident that has grabbed global attention and thrust Minneapolis into yet another uproar.
[02:46:45.614 --> 02:46:52.877]  Yeah, how do you blame police officers when it's a God that did it?
[02:46:52.877 --> 02:46:55.237]  Officials have not publicly confirmed the officer's name.
[02:46:55.237 --> 02:47:05.161]  Tom Plunkett, an attorney who said he represents NOIR, said the statement that the officer extends his condolences to the mourning 40-year-old Justine Damon's death and takes their loss seriously.
[02:47:07.824 --> 02:47:08.645]  You would like to say more?
[02:47:08.645 --> 02:47:09.845]  We'll say some more in the future.
[02:47:09.845 --> 02:47:13.107]  At this time, however, there are several investigations ongoing.
[02:47:13.107 --> 02:47:15.489]  And then it just goes on to worship him.
[02:47:15.489 --> 02:47:17.210]  Oh, the poor Somali.
[02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:21.113]  It's like he got killed, he got shot, or his family lost him.
[02:47:21.113 --> 02:47:22.634]  Let's just apologize then.
[02:47:22.634 --> 02:47:26.956]  I'm so sorry, Officer Knorr.
[02:47:26.956 --> 02:47:29.378]  There.
[02:47:29.378 --> 02:47:30.659]  Poor Officer Knorr.
[02:47:30.659 --> 02:47:32.080]  Stories about him in the Washington Post.
[02:47:33.441 --> 02:47:35.882]  Oh, our Somalis!
[02:47:35.882 --> 02:47:36.882]  Oh, they're so good!
[02:47:36.882 --> 02:47:39.382]  Oh, they're so great!
[02:47:39.382 --> 02:47:43.163]  And now, your phone calls.
[02:47:43.163 --> 02:47:54.826]  Let's go to Kevin in Florida, Charles in Missouri, and we're gonna go to Catherine in Florida, James in Texas, Jason in Washington.
[02:47:54.826 --> 02:47:56.766]  My phone ringing off the hook here, let's see who's calling.
[02:48:02.981 --> 02:48:08.344]  Gotta check sometimes, you know, that's the bat phone.
[02:48:08.344 --> 02:48:12.565]  Let's put the quotes back on screen, though, so people can look at what folks are saying in the celebration.
[02:48:12.565 --> 02:48:19.989]  I remember when they shot that black lady a few years ago, was driving around scared at the checkpoints in D.C., and I thought it was wrong that she was killed if she was black.
[02:48:19.989 --> 02:48:23.411]  And I got all these emails and calls from folks saying, thank you for caring a black person got killed.
[02:48:23.411 --> 02:48:24.211]  Of course I cared.
[02:48:24.211 --> 02:48:26.852]  I didn't care what color she was.
[02:48:26.852 --> 02:48:29.293]  If this guy shot a black woman, I'd be just as concerned.
[02:48:29.293 --> 02:48:30.574]  It's so tribal now, though.
[02:48:34.172 --> 02:48:36.854]  Kevin wants to talk about unrest.
[02:48:36.854 --> 02:48:40.636]  Charles wants to talk about Infowars.
[02:48:40.636 --> 02:48:41.717]  Catherine wants to talk about Florida.
[02:48:41.717 --> 02:48:43.358]  James wants to talk about Texas.
[02:48:43.358 --> 02:48:44.759]  Jason wants to talk about Trump winning.
[02:48:44.759 --> 02:48:47.120]  Let's go to Kevin in Florida.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:47.621]  You're on the air.
[02:48:50.327 --> 02:48:51.107]  So much, Alex.
[02:48:51.107 --> 02:48:55.669]  I just want to say I think it's hilarious that you guys keep on playing that clip that they created of you.
[02:48:55.669 --> 02:48:57.989]  I think you guys should make it go viral.
[02:48:57.989 --> 02:49:00.330]  It's played every single day, like you said.
[02:49:00.330 --> 02:49:03.051]  I think it's already gone viral, but we want it to go more viral.
[02:49:03.051 --> 02:49:07.172]  So since you requested it, here it is.
[02:49:07.172 --> 02:49:08.633]  Very exciting clip, isn't it?
[02:49:08.633 --> 02:49:10.393]  We love our Somalis.
[02:49:10.393 --> 02:49:11.614]  That's good.
[02:49:11.614 --> 02:49:13.194]  Sorry, sir.
[02:49:13.194 --> 02:49:13.795]  Go ahead.
[02:49:19.554 --> 02:49:31.240]  I just wanted to say, I think you might have addressed this once, but I think the biggest hurdle to Trump getting everything through is not him himself, because I'm going to stand by him through thick and thin.
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:32.801]  I voted for him.
[02:49:32.801 --> 02:49:35.983]  He's the only one who actually wants to turn this country around.
[02:49:35.983 --> 02:49:38.124]  But I think even a bigger problem than that is that
[02:49:38.928 --> 02:49:44.733]  Most of the informed Americans know that these elected employees could care less what they think.
[02:49:44.733 --> 02:49:49.637]  They're so out of touch with reality, they have no idea what the average American goes through.
[02:49:49.637 --> 02:50:00.667]  The fact that there's a lot of people that are struggling to feed their families, that are losing their job, they're living paycheck to paycheck, they're having to scrape two pennies together and hope a nickel pops out.
[02:50:01.487 --> 02:50:09.654]  Um, and these Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan and all these high and mighty elitists who care less about the people.
[02:50:09.654 --> 02:50:16.759]  And unless that changes, I don't know if Trump's going to be able to overcome that because he's... No, I totally agree.
[02:50:16.759 --> 02:50:18.180]  He's got to get the economy going.
[02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:24.645]  He's got to get tax cuts or they're going to end up selling the idea that you've got to have government take care of you, which of course never works.
[02:50:24.645 --> 02:50:27.067]  So we've got to expose Paul Ryan and others.
[02:50:27.067 --> 02:50:27.988]  I totally agree with you, Kevin.
[02:50:30.890 --> 02:50:42.746]  I think that's what it's going to come to because I think the average informed American knows what's going on in that CNN's plan of trying to propagandize all the other Americans.
[02:50:43.952 --> 02:50:52.241]  Well, they're absolutely trying to create racial division and they're totally engaging in the most evil forms of division I've ever seen.
[02:50:52.241 --> 02:50:53.382]  Great points, Kevin.
[02:50:53.382 --> 02:50:57.006]  Charles, Catherine, James, Jason and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:50:57.006 --> 02:51:01.511]  Infowars.com forward slash show is the live video link.
[02:51:01.511 --> 02:51:04.334]  It's an act of war against the globalists to spread that link.

[02:54:17.688 --> 02:54:21.070]  We are back live, more phone calls coming up than Paul Watson in the next hour.
[02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:26.993]  I want to be clear, and I don't just say this for political correctness, it's true.
[02:54:26.993 --> 02:54:31.836]  I'm sure there's some great Somalis out there, nice folks, businesses, things like that.
[02:54:31.836 --> 02:54:38.460]  But statistically, it's the most backwards, vicious, caveman level country where women have no rights.
[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:39.601]  We're just bringing people here.
[02:54:40.501 --> 02:54:59.253]  Particularly in Minnesota, I mean, it's like that's the biggest colony of Somalis they brought in and they're not assimilating and there's all sorts of attacks and there's constant cover-ups of what's happening and every time a Somali ala Akbar's and stabs somebody or shoots an innocent person, the media makes excuses for it.
[02:54:59.873 --> 02:55:06.896]  And whines and complains and, you know, acts like we're not supposed to talk about the elephant in the room, just like Islam in general.
[02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:20.361]  We're not supposed to talk about all the sexual mutilation and all the sex slavery and ongoing slavery and women not being able to drive cars and having to wear hoods over their heads and all the weird pedophilia that goes on and is institutionalized in orthodox Islam.
[02:55:20.361 --> 02:55:21.921]  They don't want that discussed.
[02:55:21.921 --> 02:55:23.802]  Well, we're going to discuss it.
[02:55:27.062 --> 02:55:29.383]  Let's go ahead and talk to Catherine in Florida.
[02:55:29.383 --> 02:55:30.564]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:55:30.564 --> 02:55:33.506]  Thank you for holding.
[02:55:33.506 --> 02:55:37.328]  Forgive me, but I had to call and tell you why we're not allowed to speak to the Russians.
[02:55:37.328 --> 02:55:39.109]  Because in 1914, the Russians had 55,000 churches.
[02:55:39.109 --> 02:55:43.491]  And in October of 1917, 100 years ago, the Bolsheviks took over and declared separation of church and state.
[02:55:53.553 --> 02:55:57.775]  And they said they were going to help everybody fight against the capitalists.
[02:55:57.775 --> 02:56:00.816]  They took all the Christians and killed them.
[02:56:00.816 --> 02:56:03.877]  And they put all the free thinkers into concentration camps.
[02:56:03.877 --> 02:56:04.577]  No, that's right.
[02:56:04.577 --> 02:56:09.840]  And it was the United States and England, and it was the New York liberals all went over there, took over, and murdered everybody in Russia.
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:10.840]  And that's right.
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:15.122]  And then the United States colonized Russia with communism to control it.
[02:56:15.122 --> 02:56:18.303]  And then the same communist influences now want to do that here.
[02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:25.354]  And then Russia took back Russia, and Russia became a revived Christian country.
[02:56:25.354 --> 02:56:32.201]  And Hollywood and everybody admits they want to literally enslave and murder the Russian children, like they want to do to ours.
[02:56:32.201 --> 02:56:34.844]  Yeah, it's a bunch of pedophiles.
[02:56:34.844 --> 02:56:37.747]  Because they know, they know what we're going to go through.
[02:56:38.617 --> 02:56:44.121]  And if Trump and Putin talk, you know, they went five years ago and said, no GMOs here.
[02:56:44.121 --> 02:56:46.262]  Five years ago, they said... Well, exactly.
[02:56:46.262 --> 02:56:47.523]  Russia's done a lot of good stuff.
[02:56:47.523 --> 02:56:49.985]  It's still got globalist infestation in it.
[02:56:49.985 --> 02:56:51.546]  But you're absolutely right, ma'am.
[02:56:51.546 --> 02:56:55.949]  That is why they're allied with radical Islam as well, because it's anti-Christian.
[02:56:55.949 --> 02:56:58.210]  And the globalists are prosecuting this attack.
[02:56:58.210 --> 02:56:59.611]  They admit it in the WikiLeaks.
[02:56:59.611 --> 02:57:00.532]  They hate Christians.
[02:57:00.532 --> 02:57:01.753]  They hate children.
[02:57:01.753 --> 02:57:03.174]  Hastert's a pedophile.
[02:57:03.174 --> 02:57:04.535]  The Pope's a pedophile.
[02:57:04.535 --> 02:57:05.655]  His deputy's a pedophile.
[02:57:05.655 --> 02:57:07.877]  They are pedophile devil worshippers.
[02:57:09.938 --> 02:57:12.419]  That's right, and they're going to kill free drinkers.
[02:57:12.419 --> 02:57:13.339]  They know who we are.
[02:57:13.339 --> 02:57:14.300]  They're going to come and kill us.
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:14.740]  No, that's right.
[02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:16.781]  They are devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[02:57:16.781 --> 02:57:25.484]  And it's the EU, it's the Pope, it's the Islam leaders, the radical Islam leaders, it's Hollywood, it's the Republican leadership, are pedophile devil-worshippers.
[02:57:25.484 --> 02:57:27.785]  They're getting busted every day, and they're all going to get busted.
[02:57:27.785 --> 02:57:28.665]  It's all going to happen.
[02:57:28.665 --> 02:57:29.366]  It's all coming out.
[02:57:30.046 --> 02:57:32.788]  I'd say half the Republican leadership are probably pedophiles.
[02:57:32.788 --> 02:57:33.708]  The same thing with the Democrats.
[02:57:33.708 --> 02:57:36.590]  It's just they're a bunch of pedophile, slime, devil worshippers.
[02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:37.771]  And who can deny that?
[02:57:37.771 --> 02:57:39.832]  The media will probably run stories saying I say that.
[02:57:39.832 --> 02:57:41.473]  The public will read it and say he's right.
[02:57:41.473 --> 02:57:43.374]  Because they're constantly getting caught.
[02:57:43.374 --> 02:57:44.454]  It's who they are.
[02:57:44.454 --> 02:57:48.197]  We know they're devil-worshipping pedophiles who are willing to do anything for power.
[02:57:48.197 --> 02:57:49.217]  That's why they're in power.
[02:57:49.217 --> 02:57:50.318]  Because they're scum.
[02:57:50.318 --> 02:57:52.159]  But they can only rule when we're asleep.
[02:57:52.159 --> 02:57:53.640]  And that's coming to an end.
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:55.421]  And we will stop the pedophiles.
[02:57:55.421 --> 02:57:56.802]  We will stop the Islamicists.
[02:57:56.802 --> 02:57:58.042]  We will stop the globalists.
[02:57:58.042 --> 02:57:59.123]  We will stop all of them.
[02:58:01.294 --> 02:58:02.755]  With the Lord's help.
[02:58:02.755 --> 02:58:04.637]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:58:04.637 --> 02:58:07.399]  Because we don't love the radical Islamists.
[02:58:07.399 --> 02:58:08.580]  We don't love the pedophiles.
[02:58:08.580 --> 02:58:09.821]  We don't like what they're doing.
[02:58:09.821 --> 02:58:13.644]  And we're awake, and we're conscious, and nothing's putting that back in the bottle again.
[02:58:13.644 --> 02:58:17.287]  And we know they're adulterating our food and our water and the vaccines to poison us.
[02:58:17.287 --> 02:58:18.528]  That's been declassified.
[02:58:18.528 --> 02:58:20.630]  We're aware of it, and the word's spreading.
[02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:28.456]  And people of every race, color, and creed who are humans with red blood are coming together for life and justice in the future against the satanic hordes of the new world.
[02:58:29.137 --> 02:58:29.837]  Thank you.
[02:58:29.837 --> 02:58:33.740]  James, Jason, Charles, your calls are T-minus 70 seconds away.
[02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:35.082]  I didn't plug this hour.
[02:58:35.082 --> 02:58:37.023]  We've got free shipping in the month of July.
[02:58:37.023 --> 02:58:37.784]  A lot of stuff.
[02:58:37.784 --> 02:58:39.345]  The sales have to end in the next few days.
[02:58:39.345 --> 02:58:41.026]  In fact, Brain Force is no longer on sale.
[02:58:41.026 --> 02:58:43.308]  The Supermelon X2R, 30% off.
[02:58:43.308 --> 02:58:44.569]  Caveman's back in stock.
[02:58:44.569 --> 02:58:46.511]  Your purchase funds everything we do.
[02:58:46.511 --> 02:58:47.752]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:47.752 --> 02:58:49.233]  We're maniacs for freedom.
[02:58:49.233 --> 02:58:50.995]  Hour number four with Paul Watson straight ahead.
[02:58:50.995 --> 02:58:51.595]  Stay well.
[02:58:51.595 --> 02:58:52.576]  Let's continue transmissions.
[02:58:58.103 --> 02:59:05.569]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:59:05.569 --> 02:59:18.800]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:59:19.720 --> 02:59:31.607]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:59:31.607 --> 02:59:37.571]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:59:38.331 --> 02:59:47.356]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:59:47.356 --> 02:59:58.582]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:59:58.582 --> 03:00:01.224]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.339 --> 03:00:21.725]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:21.725 --> 03:00:25.350]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.350 --> 03:00:28.234]  The Nazis had an evil culture.
[03:00:28.234 --> 03:00:30.938]  The Aztecs had a corrupt, evil culture.
[03:00:30.938 --> 03:00:32.380]  Every group goes through these cycles.
[03:00:33.339 --> 03:00:35.500]  But coming up in the next segment, I'm going to introduce Paul Watson.
[03:00:35.500 --> 03:00:39.862]  We brought masses of gypsies who they sell as the most rock star thing there is.
[03:00:39.862 --> 03:00:46.684]  Whether it's Irish pikeys, or whether it's Romanovs out of Eastern Europe, which are originally out of the Middle East.
[03:00:46.684 --> 03:00:49.905]  The culture is rob you, steal, take advantage of you.
[03:00:49.905 --> 03:00:54.007]  There are some gypsy sects that are quasi-reformed and don't do that.
[03:00:54.007 --> 03:00:58.889]  But I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and I saw gypsies rob and steal from people.
[03:00:58.889 --> 03:01:01.270]  I've been to Europe and they walk over and steal your wallet.
[03:01:02.916 --> 03:01:12.779]  Kidnap your kids and I got a report coming up where they're stealing and robbing and crapping on the streets and the left is hailing it as like sacraments of God.
[03:01:12.779 --> 03:01:17.681]  You didn't know that a gypsy craps on your front doorstep?
[03:01:17.681 --> 03:01:19.901]  De Beers will buy that for a million dollars.
[03:01:19.901 --> 03:01:23.823]  No actually they don't but that's that's what's going on here folks.
[03:01:23.823 --> 03:01:24.923]  So that's all coming
[03:01:26.451 --> 03:01:28.872]  We love our gypsies.
[03:01:28.872 --> 03:01:30.952]  We love our Somalis.
[03:01:30.952 --> 03:01:33.633]  All I'm saying is they're not assimilating.
[03:01:33.633 --> 03:01:37.674]  There are certain cultures that are like gangs that don't assimilate.
[03:01:37.674 --> 03:01:40.654]  And in response to that, you get the other response, the Nazis.
[03:01:40.654 --> 03:01:41.695]  Another gang.
[03:01:41.695 --> 03:01:44.735]  I want our Christian society.
[03:01:44.735 --> 03:01:46.216]  I don't want this.
[03:01:46.216 --> 03:01:47.616]  But the globalists know what they're doing.
[03:01:51.072 --> 03:01:56.137]  Hey Alex, I guess the biggest question I have is why do we keep playing this rigged game?
[03:01:56.137 --> 03:01:59.720]  Like, let's go back to the Federal Reserve and how they're raising the rates.
[03:02:14.210 --> 03:02:16.152]  Why do we keep playing this when we know it's rigged?
[03:02:31.857 --> 03:02:35.781]  I mean, we need to go back to a real gold standard, and we need to go back to a U.S.
[03:02:35.781 --> 03:02:36.842]  currency, not a Federal Reserve.
[03:02:36.842 --> 03:02:38.984]  I love Janet Yellen!
[03:02:38.984 --> 03:02:44.028]  I love the Chobani owner on the same board having more power than our President!
[03:02:44.028 --> 03:02:47.051]  I love the Muslims raising our interest rates!
[03:02:47.051 --> 03:02:49.493]  Sorry.
[03:02:49.493 --> 03:02:50.594]  No, totally agree.
[03:02:50.594 --> 03:02:57.681]  I understand, and I just think it's time for us, you know, Christian citizens of the United States to take back, you know, what's ours.
[03:02:58.235 --> 03:03:01.176]  Onward, Christian soldiers!
[03:03:01.176 --> 03:03:03.917]  Marching into war!
[03:03:03.917 --> 03:03:06.757]  With the cross of Jesus!
[03:03:06.757 --> 03:03:09.618]  People make fun of that, but I mean, if you don't have that, what else you got?
[03:03:09.618 --> 03:03:17.400]  I don't mean Bible-thumpers, you know, that are probably, you know, engaged in oral sex at the local bathroom.
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:22.782]  I'm talking about real Christians standing up against the New World Order, not a bunch of Pharisees trying to tell folks how great they are.
[03:03:22.782 --> 03:03:25.323]  But people really want to fight the spirit of this world.
[03:03:25.323 --> 03:03:26.363]  You get what I'm saying, James?
[03:03:27.685 --> 03:03:28.386]  I do.
[03:03:28.386 --> 03:03:29.447]  Appreciate you, Alex.
[03:03:29.447 --> 03:03:30.007]  Thank you.
[03:03:30.007 --> 03:03:31.668]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[03:03:31.668 --> 03:03:34.411]  All right, Jason in Washington.
[03:03:34.411 --> 03:03:36.372]  Go ahead.
[03:03:36.372 --> 03:03:37.433]  Hey.
[03:03:37.433 --> 03:03:38.154]  Um, hello.
[03:03:38.154 --> 03:03:41.516]  I, um, I have something written for you because I know I don't have much time.
[03:03:41.516 --> 03:03:51.805]  So first, before my main reason for my call, I'd like to ask, if you're building another studio, I'd like to be hired for any position that you may need because this, what you stand for, is exactly what I stand for.
[03:03:52.145 --> 03:03:53.246]  It's my calling in life.
[03:03:53.246 --> 03:03:54.586]  I've emailed you multiple times.
[03:03:54.586 --> 03:03:57.308]  Maybe I can share my email with your crew so we can search your YouTube.
[03:03:57.308 --> 03:04:00.409]  Folks are video editors, journalists, especially have a background we can check.
[03:04:00.409 --> 03:04:02.630]  We're trying to hire some more folks.
[03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:05.612]  So again, you know, email us.
[03:04:05.612 --> 03:04:06.813]  Jobs at Infowars.com.
[03:04:08.093 --> 03:04:12.936]  We're looking for female reporters particularly, because that's always great to have that perspective in view.
[03:04:12.936 --> 03:04:15.837]  We're looking for more video editors, more researchers, more writers.
[03:04:15.837 --> 03:04:18.359]  We don't have a huge budget, but we pay more than other folks.
[03:04:18.359 --> 03:04:20.580]  Most people pay zero nowadays.
[03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:25.502]  So jobsatinfowars.com, my friend.
[03:04:25.502 --> 03:04:26.543]  I just need a living.
[03:04:26.543 --> 03:04:28.004]  I don't care how much I get paid.
[03:04:28.004 --> 03:04:29.725]  What I want to do is take the globalist on.
[03:04:30.663 --> 03:04:39.045]  The problem is, little stuff like hiring people takes time, or Paul is supposed to announce tomorrow the winner of the meme contest.
[03:04:39.045 --> 03:04:44.226]  We got like 10,000 memes last time I checked, so it was so successful it bogged us all down.
[03:04:44.226 --> 03:04:46.126]  That's why I can't do more of these contests.
[03:04:46.126 --> 03:04:51.968]  I need to create a whole contest department, because the contests are so successful, but then it bogs us down.
[03:04:51.968 --> 03:04:53.188]  Jason, we love you.
[03:04:53.188 --> 03:04:55.288]  We love Jason from Washington!
[03:04:55.288 --> 03:04:57.949]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:04:57.949 --> 03:04:58.349]  Stay with us.
[03:05:07.374 --> 03:05:13.256]  Do you remember Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, also the highest-ranking U.S.
[03:05:13.256 --> 03:05:15.437]  politician to be sent to prison?
[03:05:15.437 --> 03:05:22.839]  Hastert was a small-town wrestling coach in Illinois when he was what Judge Thomas Durkin of the federal court described as a serial child molester.
[03:05:22.839 --> 03:05:31.742]  Because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out, Hastert was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in, if you can believe that.
[03:05:31.742 --> 03:05:33.403]  He did go down for illegal hush money.
[03:05:33.703 --> 03:05:36.664]  To the tune of at least $3.5 million.
[03:05:36.664 --> 03:05:41.386]  He was fined $250,000 and sentenced to 15 months in prison.
[03:05:41.386 --> 03:05:42.906]  Hardly justice.
[03:05:42.906 --> 03:05:47.408]  But now, the serial child molester is free once again, after serving only 13 months.
[03:05:48.988 --> 03:05:55.837]  Judge Durkin also said, there's nothing more disturbing than having a child molester and Speaker of the House in the same sentence.
[03:05:55.837 --> 03:05:56.838]  I disagree.
[03:05:56.838 --> 03:06:02.164]  There's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year in prison.
[03:06:02.164 --> 03:06:03.887]  Won't see that on CNN.
[03:06:03.887 --> 03:06:06.350]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:06:08.228 --> 03:06:12.049]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[03:06:12.049 --> 03:06:13.550]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[03:06:13.550 --> 03:06:15.251]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[03:06:15.251 --> 03:06:17.691]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[03:06:17.691 --> 03:06:18.892]  It's been sold out for months.
[03:06:18.892 --> 03:06:19.772]  Big waiting list.
[03:06:19.772 --> 03:06:23.614]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[03:06:23.614 --> 03:06:25.074]  Nobody's got something this good.
[03:06:25.074 --> 03:06:31.837]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 million live in each pill.
[03:06:31.837 --> 03:06:35.478]  Probiotic MycoZx contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and welcome
[03:06:35.578 --> 03:06:43.623]  I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them because regardless you can't lose your fun in the operation.

[03:08:09.211 --> 03:08:09.992]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:09.992 --> 03:08:12.533]  Because there is a war on.
[03:08:12.533 --> 03:08:13.714]  For your mind.
[03:08:18.952 --> 03:08:23.320]  The last few days I've talked to former and current Fox executives.
[03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:26.305]  It's no secret that Roger Ailes is reaching out to us before he died.
[03:08:26.305 --> 03:08:31.133]  I know about some of the new Fox networks they're trying to launch with big money.
[03:08:32.342 --> 03:08:47.771]  That would take over some of the big cable stations that are out there that kind of air old movies and stuff like that and put it onto a new Fox network that would have Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, you name it, Daniel Loesch and others on it.
[03:08:47.771 --> 03:08:56.796]  And I was talking to some of these folks and they were just bringing up the fact that when Trump won, there were people crying at Fox News.
[03:08:56.796 --> 03:08:59.418]  More than half the people are hardcore globalist liberals.
[03:09:01.912 --> 03:09:03.754]  It's New York.
[03:09:03.754 --> 03:09:05.675]  And it's peer pressure.
[03:09:05.675 --> 03:09:07.176]  It's a cult.
[03:09:07.176 --> 03:09:12.501]  And if you look at how controlled Fox News is, this is Fox News.
[03:09:12.501 --> 03:09:13.361]  Look at this headline.
[03:09:13.361 --> 03:09:21.188]  Immigrants defecated in the streets, behead chickens, angry Pennsylvania residents say.
[03:09:21.188 --> 03:09:22.629]  And it won't even
[03:09:24.363 --> 03:09:26.445]  Tell people that it's gypsies.
[03:09:26.445 --> 03:09:27.687]  That's their name.
[03:09:27.687 --> 03:09:29.048]  Or the... I said Romanov.
[03:09:29.048 --> 03:09:31.411]  That's the Russian royal dynasty.
[03:09:31.411 --> 03:09:33.934]  It's the Roman people as they call themselves.
[03:09:33.934 --> 03:09:35.476]  But they're not from Italy.
[03:09:35.476 --> 03:09:35.956]  The Roma.
[03:09:35.956 --> 03:09:38.980]  I've done the genetic testing.
[03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:41.943]  It's from like northern India and some from the Middle East.
[03:09:41.943 --> 03:09:43.885]  But it's a vagabond migrant.
[03:09:44.855 --> 03:09:55.637]  Groups that for thousands of years have gone around Europe and the culture is rob, steal, never assimilate, deform your children at birth, handicap them so they can beg, kidnap children.
[03:09:55.637 --> 03:09:57.697]  I mean, that's the gypsy culture.
[03:09:57.697 --> 03:10:07.339]  But they have the Disney movies and Quasimodo and The Hunchback of Notre Dame and how beautiful and how wonderful it is.
[03:10:07.339 --> 03:10:12.280]  Not even Fox News will tell you in the article they're gypsies.
[03:10:14.531 --> 03:10:24.515]  It just says they are a persecuted minority group from Romania, from Bucharest, who have been brought here by the federal government.
[03:10:24.515 --> 03:10:27.596]  And it's got... This is a whitewash how great they are.
[03:10:27.596 --> 03:10:32.457]  Oh, they're crapping in the streets, they're robbing people, they're stealing, they're... Whatever.
[03:10:32.457 --> 03:10:33.678]  We're going to play this clip in the morning.
[03:10:33.678 --> 03:10:36.779]  But at least Tucker Carlson said gypsies come into America.
[03:10:40.558 --> 03:10:47.798]  The Romanian refugees moved to the area through a federal program that fines temporary housing for immigrants, according to Post Gazette.
[03:10:48.669 --> 03:10:54.593]  The Romanians fled their homes in Bucharest area where they face persecution as a minority group.
[03:10:54.593 --> 03:10:56.794]  Yeah, since they came there a thousand years ago.
[03:10:56.794 --> 03:11:01.678]  More than 150 people attended the, you know, your kid gets kidnapped out of your backyard.
[03:11:01.678 --> 03:11:02.899]  Big kidnappings all over Europe.
[03:11:02.899 --> 03:11:06.021]  They find them with the gypsies and even liberal groups say, just let them have your kid now.
[03:11:06.021 --> 03:11:10.183]  It's part of their, I'm sure that those in Italy, they actually find them with kids and let them keep them.
[03:11:10.183 --> 03:11:12.005]  Oh, they've had your daughter for three years.
[03:11:12.005 --> 03:11:15.367]  Just let them keep them and let the Muslims rape your wife too.
[03:11:15.367 --> 03:11:16.327]  It's okay.
[03:11:16.327 --> 03:11:18.349]  They only get probation because it's liberal.
[03:11:19.310 --> 03:11:28.917]  More than 150 people attended California Borough's Council Municipal Meeting Thursday night, and several residents complained about the immigrants.
[03:11:28.917 --> 03:11:30.619]  And then it goes on to break it down.
[03:11:30.619 --> 03:11:31.980]  Paul Watson joins us.
[03:11:33.151 --> 03:11:39.438]  To talk about this and more, you've got a guy that was a national spokesman for the invaders that took over Syria.
[03:11:39.438 --> 03:11:41.260]  They called him a Syrian refugee.
[03:11:41.260 --> 03:11:49.749]  He's really an Islamist invader who slit his employer's throat after he was a model hairdresser, a model of integration they called him.
[03:11:50.350 --> 03:11:57.896]  And just every day, we've got the Somali cop shooting an unarmed woman, and then the Washington Post says, oh, he's a poor victim, he's a Somali, it's like he got hurt.
[03:11:57.896 --> 03:12:04.300]  And then the leftist sites are celebrating her death, saying it's good that the white bitch, close quote, was killed.
[03:12:04.300 --> 03:12:09.725]  So what is going on here, Paul Watson, as you take over the transmission?
[03:12:09.725 --> 03:12:11.446]  Good to be back, Alex.
[03:12:11.446 --> 03:12:16.830]  Basically, we're in a culture that's absolutely horrific, and the media won't tell us the truth about it.
[03:12:17.515 --> 03:12:18.997]  Similar case in London, Alex.
[03:12:18.997 --> 03:12:22.221]  We've got these acid attacks almost every weekend now.
[03:12:22.221 --> 03:12:23.923]  In fact, sometimes every day.
[03:12:23.923 --> 03:12:26.166]  So you have five attacks this weekend.
[03:12:26.166 --> 03:12:27.948]  What's wrong with throwing acid on women's faces?
[03:12:27.948 --> 03:12:28.369]  It's liberal.
[03:12:28.991 --> 03:12:30.652]  Progressive.
[03:12:30.652 --> 03:12:43.017]  But Alex, the vast majority of these acid attacks are taking place in, well, the clear majority at least, are taking place in Newham and Tower Hamlets, two boroughs of London that, surprise surprise, are Muslim ghettos.
[03:12:43.017 --> 03:12:51.301]  They admit that in the articles, but then when it actually comes to naming the individuals responsible for the attacks, they refuse to name the individuals.
[03:12:51.301 --> 03:12:55.863]  They named one individual yesterday, called him a 19-year-old boy.
[03:12:56.343 --> 03:13:00.366]  Now, Alex, in the United Kingdom, you're legally an adult when you hit 18.
[03:13:00.366 --> 03:13:04.028]  Sure, but when they rape women all over Europe, even if they're 25, they're called a boy.
[03:13:04.028 --> 03:13:05.429]  Yeah.
[03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:09.072]  It's impossible to be a 19-year-old boy in the United Kingdom.
[03:13:09.072 --> 03:13:10.573]  Legally, that's a man.
[03:13:10.573 --> 03:13:13.955]  And of course, he's called Ahmed, Mohammed, something, something.
[03:13:13.955 --> 03:13:14.175]  Sure.
[03:13:14.175 --> 03:13:16.757]  The majority of these incidents are in Islamic ghettos.
[03:13:16.757 --> 03:13:20.039]  I will throw acid on your face, bitch, for showing it.
[03:13:20.039 --> 03:13:21.160]  Ha ha ha!
[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:22.701]  Now you are ugly!
[03:13:22.701 --> 03:13:24.022]  I am beautiful!
[03:13:24.022 --> 03:13:25.903]  Durka durka Mohammed Jihad!
[03:13:27.685 --> 03:13:35.557]  I mean, bear in mind that this comes from the same culture that literally allows old men to rape young boys, and that's part of their culture.
[03:13:35.557 --> 03:13:36.779]  And that's why they like Hastert!
[03:13:36.779 --> 03:13:41.345]  That's why Hastert gets 13 months, and for robbery, OJ gets 9 years.
[03:13:42.776 --> 03:13:45.258]  So, we've got acid attacks almost every day.
[03:13:45.258 --> 03:13:46.318]  Last night there was another one.
[03:13:46.318 --> 03:13:55.685]  They flagged down an ambulance, I think it was, an emergency worker, pretending that they were in distress, just so they could throw acid in her face.
[03:13:55.685 --> 03:13:59.107]  There's not even a criminal motive in some of these cases.
[03:13:59.107 --> 03:14:01.288]  They're not even, like, stealing anything.
[03:14:01.288 --> 03:14:05.191]  It's just part of their fun to just disfigure people for life.
[03:14:05.191 --> 03:14:06.292]  That's progressive.
[03:14:06.292 --> 03:14:06.872]  That's liberal.
[03:14:06.872 --> 03:14:08.053]  We should embrace that.
[03:14:08.053 --> 03:14:09.714]  Get down on our knees and say, alright, well,
[03:14:10.254 --> 03:14:23.163]  And meanwhile, Alex, obviously in Saudi Arabia, you probably covered this earlier, they hunted down and arrested a young woman, for God forbid, wearing a skirt as she visited a national monument in Saudi Arabia.
[03:14:23.163 --> 03:14:25.685]  Because foreigners are allowed to do that if they visit.
[03:14:26.485 --> 03:14:28.086]  Actual Saudi citizens on.
[03:14:28.086 --> 03:14:29.947]  Where are the feminists today, Alex?
[03:14:29.947 --> 03:14:30.708]  Where are they?
[03:14:30.708 --> 03:14:33.009]  Completely frigging silent.
[03:14:33.009 --> 03:14:35.771]  They're more bothered about advertising in the United Kingdom.
[03:14:35.771 --> 03:14:41.134]  The news won't even show the thousands of videos of them blocking roads, robbing people all over Europe.
[03:14:41.134 --> 03:14:44.056]  They've declared civil emergency for years on French roads.
[03:14:44.056 --> 03:14:45.677]  Your family had to evacuate France.
[03:14:45.677 --> 03:14:48.038]  There's just Muslims running around, foaming at the mouth.
[03:14:48.038 --> 03:14:49.399]  They've taken over the tunnel.
[03:14:49.399 --> 03:14:51.741]  They're flooding everywhere, just climbing over.
[03:14:51.741 --> 03:14:53.602]  And, hell, we don't even show it.
[03:14:53.602 --> 03:14:55.283]  It's just like, we're just accepting it.
[03:14:57.045 --> 03:15:06.316]  You've literally got the Advertising Standards Agency banning advertisements that push gender stereotypes, which is basically, you know, women being attractive.
[03:15:06.316 --> 03:15:11.943]  I mean, you had Reebok come out and lecture people, don't compliment women on their appearance.
[03:15:11.943 --> 03:15:15.528]  That's a surefire way to end up as a lonely loser, isn't it, Alex?
[03:15:15.928 --> 03:15:20.271]  I get absolutely crucified by my girlfriend if I don't compliment her on her appearance.
[03:15:20.271 --> 03:15:21.931]  Women love that!
[03:15:21.931 --> 03:15:24.993]  So again, it's all about imposing this Sharia style.
[03:15:24.993 --> 03:15:31.377]  They had the body, the beach body post, I remember that a couple of years ago, and Sadiq Khan banned it.
[03:15:31.977 --> 03:15:38.800]  So it's this slow Sharia creep where it's being imposed culturally that you can't compliment women.
[03:15:38.800 --> 03:15:43.482]  And then also, while women are actually being oppressed, nobody's calling that out.
[03:15:43.482 --> 03:15:46.083]  Nobody gives a damn about the woman in Saudi Arabia.
[03:15:46.083 --> 03:15:46.784]  Feminists don't.
[03:15:46.784 --> 03:15:52.286]  They're still upset about, you know, body positivity and telling people that obesity is unhealthy.
[03:15:52.646 --> 03:15:54.447]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:15:54.447 --> 03:16:00.751]  And these acid attacks in London, right outside my door, there was a machete attack a couple of months ago.
[03:16:00.751 --> 03:16:03.053]  This is every single day now.
[03:16:03.053 --> 03:16:04.394]  Crime's going through the roof.
[03:16:04.394 --> 03:16:05.754]  We've had numerous terror attacks.
[03:16:05.754 --> 03:16:07.415]  We've got these acid attacks.
[03:16:07.415 --> 03:16:10.638]  And what is Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, concerned about?
[03:16:10.638 --> 03:16:17.482]  He's concerned about Donald Trump being insulting to Muslims, so he's not going to welcome him when he comes to the United Kingdom.
[03:16:17.822 --> 03:16:23.884]  It's incredible how he insults Londoners on a daily basis with his sheer and utter incompetence.
[03:16:23.884 --> 03:16:31.606]  People are getting acid attacked, we've got terror attacks every other week and he's worried about Donald Trump being mean to Muslims on Twitter.
[03:16:31.606 --> 03:16:33.027]  That's the situation.
[03:16:33.027 --> 03:16:35.968]  It's absolutely abhorrent and it seems to be getting worse every day.
[03:16:36.488 --> 03:16:38.289]  Alex, I'm going to have to move out of London soon.
[03:16:38.289 --> 03:16:49.952]  I mean, I'm going to have to move to some boring area of the country where nothing happens because that's the only place you can get away from some of the consequences that have been foisted on us by this multiculturalism.
[03:16:49.952 --> 03:17:01.075]  And there are the Somalis in France, literal Somalis, this looks like Day of the Dead here, zombieing around blocking trucks and then robbing it and robbing the cargo.
[03:17:01.075 --> 03:17:01.935]  There's even footage of
[03:17:02.535 --> 03:17:08.798]  I'm like tearing open trucks from zoos that have like you know polar bears in the back and crazy stuff.
[03:17:08.798 --> 03:17:13.560]  I mean it's like Road Warrior and they are literally just trying to cover all this up Paul.
[03:17:13.560 --> 03:17:15.041]  What do you think the master plan is?
[03:17:15.041 --> 03:17:19.563]  Because the big news is the EU has announced that they're going to stop fleets.
[03:17:20.643 --> 03:17:32.216]  They're going to stop EU member nations ships from taking Muslims back to Africa and that they're basically going to use the EU military to help Soros bring in more millions.
[03:17:32.216 --> 03:17:34.438]  10 million now they say brought into Europe.
[03:17:34.438 --> 03:17:35.359]  I thought it was 5 million.
[03:17:35.359 --> 03:17:38.202]  It's 10 million that they just announced.
[03:17:38.202 --> 03:17:39.223]  What are they planning?
[03:17:39.223 --> 03:17:41.426]  What is the master plan here by the EU?
[03:17:43.430 --> 03:17:48.754]  The master plan, and some of them admit it, is the complete collapse of Western civilization, and it's already happened.
[03:17:48.754 --> 03:17:55.698]  They get up in front of Parliament and brag about how Germans are going to be a minority in their own cities within 20 years.
[03:17:55.698 --> 03:17:58.660]  That's already the case in Frankfurt, Germany, big city.
[03:17:58.660 --> 03:18:01.943]  But it's not like they're bringing in Argentinians or...
[03:18:02.643 --> 03:18:07.226]  Or Chinese or something that historically don't have high crime rates and want to work and assimilate.
[03:18:07.226 --> 03:18:09.068]  They're bringing in North Africans.
[03:18:09.068 --> 03:18:12.330]  They're bringing in East Africa that's been a hellhole forever.
[03:18:12.330 --> 03:18:14.392]  They're with radical Muslim culture.
[03:18:14.392 --> 03:18:16.693]  They're bringing in the people that invaded Syria.
[03:18:16.693 --> 03:18:19.656]  They're bringing in 80% military age men.
[03:18:19.656 --> 03:18:28.762]  They're bringing them in and letting them do whatever they want and worshiping gypsies and MTV worships gypsies as if they're God.
[03:18:28.762 --> 03:18:30.744]  Tell folks about what gypsies are like in Europe.
[03:18:32.082 --> 03:18:34.332]  Well, there are huge crime problems with gypsies.
[03:18:34.332 --> 03:18:36.562]  I mean, Italy's been suffering from that for decades.
[03:18:37.405 --> 03:18:40.887]  There was another case in Vienna, by the way, you mentioned Somalis.
[03:18:40.887 --> 03:18:52.434]  A woman, a middle-aged woman walking her dog was attacked, scratched, bit by a Somali migrant because she actually dared Alex to walk her dog in the park.
[03:18:52.434 --> 03:18:54.175]  Dogs are unclean.
[03:18:54.175 --> 03:18:55.716]  That's what this attacker said.
[03:18:55.716 --> 03:18:58.737]  She was viciously attacked by an 18-year-old Somali.
[03:18:58.737 --> 03:19:01.779]  Again, it's probably like a 35-year-old, but they all lie about their age.
[03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:15.367]  The most basic, fundamental, pleasurable leisure pursuit, walking a dog in a European country, now you're even at risk if you do that because of this culture that we've imported.
[03:19:15.367 --> 03:19:17.769]  And it's just getting worse every single day.
[03:19:17.769 --> 03:19:18.970]  I'm going to go on to talk about it.
[03:19:18.970 --> 03:19:20.030]  I mean, let's just say it.
[03:19:20.030 --> 03:19:21.751]  It looks like something out of a zombie movie.
[03:19:21.751 --> 03:19:27.175]  There's hundreds of these videos of them just grabbing trucks, grabbing families, dragging them out.
[03:19:27.175 --> 03:19:29.636]  There's raw footage of raping women.
[03:19:29.636 --> 03:19:32.478]  I mean, I sat there one night and watched foot...
[03:19:32.898 --> 03:19:34.099]  Tapes.
[03:19:34.099 --> 03:19:36.301]  And I had to turn it off because I only watched like three of them.
[03:19:36.301 --> 03:19:47.851]  There's like 30-minute, hour-long rape videos at concerts with like 15 men lined up, two men holding each arm and each leg raping women, and the police do nothing.
[03:19:48.351 --> 03:19:53.734]  And you're watching them rape women, and it's like it's an anti-racism event.
[03:19:53.734 --> 03:19:59.077]  So the Muslims go to those to rape the dingbat women who then make excuses for it.
[03:19:59.077 --> 03:20:01.659]  And it's been in the German news and the Stockholm news.
[03:20:01.659 --> 03:20:05.601]  They will say, I said a German raped me, or I said a...
[03:20:06.201 --> 03:20:09.106]  You know, I said a Swede raped me because I didn't want to be racist.
[03:20:09.106 --> 03:20:11.770]  They then say that a white man raped him.
[03:20:11.770 --> 03:20:15.075]  They don't just get raped by the precious Muslims.
[03:20:15.075 --> 03:20:18.281]  They then say that a German or a Swede did it, Paul!
[03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:34.643]  No, there was a case on, I think it was a train in Germany where a woman got raped by an Iraqi migrant and she refused to report it to police because she said, oh, he's had a difficult life getting over here from Iraq, so maybe I should just be nice to him.
[03:20:34.643 --> 03:20:43.731]  Alex, every woman I talk to says that Europe has completely changed from France to Germany, whatever major city you want to talk about, the harassment is there.
[03:20:43.731 --> 03:20:46.714]  The bottom line is, liberals and leftists are going to get
[03:20:47.234 --> 03:20:53.020]  Right, they're the ones who are going to get harassed because they think everything's hunky-dory and that these people are going to tolerate it.
[03:20:53.020 --> 03:21:01.948]  Yeah, imagine, these women in Sweden go to events where it's, you know, half Muslim men and then the rest are a bunch of drugged out Swede men and they get raped.
[03:21:01.948 --> 03:21:03.590]  What do you think's going to happen?
[03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:05.832]  Every time they have them there's mass rapes.
[03:21:05.832 --> 03:21:07.294]  These people are laughing at us!
[03:21:09.059 --> 03:21:16.589]  No, the more hardcore ones think that they have the right to our spoils, our western spoils, and that includes women.
[03:21:16.589 --> 03:21:24.238]  So you're gonna get in Europe, and it's already happening, if you're not covered up, like the girl in Saudi Arabia that was hunted down and arrested for wearing a skirt.
[03:21:24.238 --> 03:21:27.582]  Yeah, that's why they wear hoods, folks, because you're fair game to be raped!
[03:21:28.243 --> 03:21:31.466]  If you don't, and if you fight back, they're going to pour acid on your face.
[03:21:31.466 --> 03:21:44.018]  Or if you try to have a job or drive a car, or walk a dog, they're going to show you women don't walk dogs, men don't walk dogs, and women don't work, and women don't drive cars, and Linda Sarcer said you're going to like it.
[03:21:45.270 --> 03:21:46.691]  Yeah, that's what it's all about.
[03:21:46.691 --> 03:21:52.797]  And at least it's having some impact financially, Alex, because we had the article up today.
[03:21:52.797 --> 03:21:56.841]  The tourist industry in America was saying, oh, Trump's going to be disastrous for tourism.
[03:21:56.841 --> 03:21:58.442]  This is going to be horrible.
[03:21:58.442 --> 03:22:05.009]  Six months into his presidency, six, seven months, tourism in the United States is up 5%, 6%.
[03:22:05.009 --> 03:22:06.210]  Hotel rooms are fuller.
[03:22:06.610 --> 03:22:08.511]  Guess where it's collapsing, Alex?
[03:22:08.511 --> 03:22:13.353]  It's collapsing in France, Germany, in London, in Brussels, in all these cities.
[03:22:13.353 --> 03:22:23.918]  When they ask the tourists why they're not going there, when they ask why hotel rooms in Paris have halved since 2015 occupancy, they say, migrants and terrorism.
[03:22:23.918 --> 03:22:25.018]  So it's hitting these countries hard.
[03:22:25.018 --> 03:22:25.998]  And Paul, let's expand on that.
[03:22:25.998 --> 03:22:26.859]  Let's expand on that.
[03:22:29.164 --> 03:22:30.445]  Your family had to leave France.
[03:22:30.445 --> 03:22:32.766]  You know, they got rid of the steel industry that your parents were involved in.
[03:22:32.766 --> 03:22:34.567]  They sold everything they had, moved to France.
[03:22:34.567 --> 03:22:37.188]  Bed and breakfast, had to leave there, went to another country now.
[03:22:37.188 --> 03:22:38.029]  This is real.
[03:22:38.029 --> 03:22:38.969]  This is happening.
[03:22:38.969 --> 03:22:40.290]  I'm going to get out of here and let you take over.
[03:22:40.290 --> 03:22:41.671]  You're always doing a great job.
[03:22:41.671 --> 03:22:46.553]  It's just so incredible that they have 80% of their tourism in France down the last decade.
[03:22:46.553 --> 03:22:50.235]  As you said, most of that just since two years ago.
[03:22:50.235 --> 03:22:51.756]  It's accelerating.
[03:22:51.756 --> 03:22:54.017]  I was in Italy, in Rome.
[03:22:54.017 --> 03:22:54.658]  It looked like
[03:22:55.598 --> 03:22:57.719]  There was just feces all over the ground.
[03:22:57.719 --> 03:22:59.840]  North Africans everywhere.
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:06.123]  Every tree, there's a lot of trees in Rome, had like 20 people under it, just camping out, laying around.
[03:23:06.123 --> 03:23:07.644]  There was robberies everywhere.
[03:23:07.644 --> 03:23:09.365]  The police looked totally freaked out.
[03:23:09.365 --> 03:23:12.427]  There were gypsies everywhere trying to steal our bags.
[03:23:12.427 --> 03:23:16.008]  We had Romans running up trying to protect us, saying, watch out, a gypsy's behind you.
[03:23:16.008 --> 03:23:17.369]  This happened like 10 times, right?
[03:23:17.369 --> 03:23:18.650]  I mean, sitting there with my wife.
[03:23:19.690 --> 03:23:21.492]  And not my ex-wife, my wife.
[03:23:21.492 --> 03:23:22.792]  I've been married for years, folks.
[03:23:22.792 --> 03:23:25.594]  You know, running up, you know, grabbing all this other stuff.
[03:23:25.594 --> 03:23:30.297]  And it was just like insane asylum to witness all of this happening.
[03:23:30.297 --> 03:23:32.359]  And then you ask, what are the globalists doing?
[03:23:32.359 --> 03:23:42.005]  Like you did a video last week, George Clooney said Europe's too dangerous and has just sold all his mansions and is leaving when he's the one pushing for total open borders.
[03:23:42.005 --> 03:23:43.586]  Paul Watson, take over that in a moment.
[03:23:43.586 --> 03:23:47.529]  But first, I didn't even really plug last hour, but a 30-second plug.
[03:23:48.484 --> 03:23:51.866]  I should be plugging every segment because we need financing to fund this operation.

[03:26:03.423 --> 03:26:10.747]  And we're using funding from that to try to get Paul some additional help in London with our London Stand Bureau.
[03:26:10.747 --> 03:26:14.490]  But again, back to Paul Joseph Watson, always doing a great job.
[03:26:14.490 --> 03:26:15.050]  Please take over.
[03:26:16.621 --> 03:26:17.181]  Thanks Alex.
[03:26:17.181 --> 03:26:29.366]  Yeah, I'll continue with what we were talking about regarding the migrant crisis because there was a big story out of RT today about what's happening in Germany, which of course took in 2 million migrants since 2015 at least.
[03:26:29.366 --> 03:26:34.568]  Merkel said she would reverse that policy, now it seems as though she's going ahead with it full steam anyway.
[03:26:34.568 --> 03:26:36.109]  This is out of RT.
[03:26:36.109 --> 03:26:39.490]  Sexual assaults and shocking violence involving migrants near
[03:26:40.110 --> 03:26:41.291]  German Town Fair.
[03:26:41.291 --> 03:26:49.755]  Now this was a thousand migrants attacking quite, not a massive city, this is quite a, you know, medium-sized town in Germany.
[03:26:49.755 --> 03:26:57.579]  A thousand migrants throwing bottles at the police, throwing bottles at festival goers, raping, assaulting women.
[03:26:57.819 --> 03:27:02.681]  Imagine having that visited on your little town fair out of nowhere.
[03:27:02.681 --> 03:27:04.822]  Absolutely horrendous.
[03:27:04.822 --> 03:27:09.744]  A German town summer fair turned violent over the weekend with multiple sexual assaults reported.
[03:27:09.744 --> 03:27:17.427]  A group of youths also attacked visitors and officers with police stating that many of the offenders were, imagine my shock, migrants.
[03:27:17.427 --> 03:27:19.007]  And they were desperate, the police.
[03:27:19.007 --> 03:27:21.668]  They were calling for backup from all the surrounding towns.
[03:27:21.668 --> 03:27:23.729]  They had to call in riot police.
[03:27:23.729 --> 03:27:26.110]  The violence occurred while residents of Schoendorf,
[03:27:27.045 --> 03:27:31.149]  In the southern German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, celebrating the town's week-long fair.
[03:27:31.149 --> 03:27:36.435]  However, while many were enjoying carnival rides and German beer, we can't have that.
[03:27:37.671 --> 03:27:44.033]  On Friday, the first day of the fair, at least three sexual assaults occurred in the town, resulting in the detention of an Iraqi suspect.
[03:27:44.033 --> 03:27:46.634]  So they only caught one guy as a result of this.
[03:27:46.634 --> 03:27:51.975]  Police reported three incidents of sexual harassment of women and men at a marketplace.
[03:27:51.975 --> 03:27:55.816]  In one case, an Iraqi suspect has been deterred.
[03:27:55.816 --> 03:28:07.280]  A police statement said a 17-year-old girl was the victim of a separate sexual assault after three men held her and grabbed her buttocks outside the town's main rail station, which of course is where they always seem to congregate.
[03:28:08.635 --> 03:28:19.822]  Meanwhile, around 1,000, 1,000 youths and young men gathered at the grounds of Schoendorf Castle on Saturday, throwing bottles at festival goers and police.
[03:28:19.822 --> 03:28:25.586]  The violence faced by police was shocking, a police spokesperson said, as quoted by German media.
[03:28:25.586 --> 03:28:29.768]  Imagine you're in this medium town, medium-sized town.
[03:28:29.768 --> 03:28:34.111]  You're going to a festival, you're going to a town fair next to a castle.
[03:28:35.219 --> 03:28:42.164]  You think you're going to have fun, you're going to have a good time, it's going to be a community occasion, you're going to talk to your neighbours and friends, you're going to have a laugh.
[03:28:42.164 --> 03:28:47.307]  A thousand frigging criminals show up and start pelting you with bottles.
[03:28:47.307 --> 03:28:51.230]  That's the cultural enrichment that Germans are experiencing right now.
[03:28:51.770 --> 03:28:53.913]  This is just one story out of many.
[03:28:53.913 --> 03:29:09.871]  I talked to you before about what was happening in Vienna, Austria, where a middle-aged woman was walking her dog and had to be hospitalized following a brutal beating in broad daylight by a veiled Somali asylum seeker, offended.
[03:29:10.911 --> 03:29:13.013]  Offended by her pet dogs.
[03:29:13.013 --> 03:29:20.398]  We've seen this in London and other cities where people try to get taxis and they try to take, you know, small dogs in the taxis.
[03:29:20.398 --> 03:29:22.799]  Would normally be no problem whatsoever.
[03:29:22.799 --> 03:29:27.062]  Over the past five, six years, it's suddenly become a problem.
[03:29:27.062 --> 03:29:28.123]  I wonder why that is.
[03:29:28.123 --> 03:29:32.026]  Well, it's because Uber is basically a Pakistani monopoly in London.
[03:29:32.813 --> 03:29:34.293]  They don't like dogs.
[03:29:34.293 --> 03:29:35.734]  They're offended by dogs.
[03:29:35.734 --> 03:29:37.954]  You're not going to even walk your dog anymore.
[03:29:37.954 --> 03:29:39.034]  You'll be attacked.
[03:29:39.034 --> 03:29:42.235]  And rightly so, because they have the moral high ground, don't they?
[03:29:42.235 --> 03:29:44.796]  Absolutely despicable.
[03:29:44.796 --> 03:29:52.518]  The victim, named only as Ingrid T., described how she was talking with neighbours at the gate of her garden, accompanied by dogs.
[03:29:52.518 --> 03:29:55.618]  The deaf, almost blind, three-legged Collie Mitch.
[03:29:55.618 --> 03:29:56.359]  We're on the march.
[03:29:56.359 --> 03:29:58.579]  Sitting peacefully alongside... The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:58.579 --> 03:30:02.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:07.554 --> 03:30:13.419]  Do you remember Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, also the highest-ranking U.S.
[03:30:13.419 --> 03:30:15.601]  politician to be sent to prison?
[03:30:15.601 --> 03:30:23.007]  Hastert was a small-town wrestling coach in Illinois when he was what Judge Thomas Durkin of the federal court described as a serial child molester.
[03:30:23.007 --> 03:30:31.355]  Because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out, Hastert was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in, if you can believe that.
[03:30:31.915 --> 03:30:36.838]  He did go down for illegal hush money, to the tune of at least $3.5 million.
[03:30:36.838 --> 03:30:41.561]  He was fined $250,000 and sentenced to 15 months in prison.
[03:30:41.561 --> 03:30:43.062]  Hardly justice.
[03:30:43.062 --> 03:30:47.624]  But now, the serial child molester is free once again, after serving only 13 months.
[03:30:49.145 --> 03:30:55.993]  Judge Durkin also said, there's nothing more disturbing than having a child molester and Speaker of the House in the same sentence.
[03:30:55.993 --> 03:30:57.014]  I disagree.
[03:30:57.014 --> 03:31:02.341]  There's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year in prison.
[03:31:02.341 --> 03:31:04.043]  Won't see that on CNN.
[03:31:04.043 --> 03:31:06.526]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:31:06.906 --> 03:31:15.997]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:15.997 --> 03:31:24.066]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:24.386 --> 03:31:29.269]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:36.052]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:36.052 --> 03:31:43.216]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:43.216 --> 03:31:50.099]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:50.259 --> 03:31:54.741]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:54.741 --> 03:31:58.122]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:58.122 --> 03:32:04.425]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:32:04.425 --> 03:32:06.106]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:32:08.055 --> 03:32:13.537]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:32:13.537 --> 03:32:14.377]  I take this.
[03:32:14.377 --> 03:32:15.497]  My family takes this.
[03:32:15.497 --> 03:32:19.779]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:32:19.779 --> 03:32:24.220]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:32:24.380 --> 03:32:29.023]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:32:29.023 --> 03:32:30.163]  I don't feel good.
[03:32:30.163 --> 03:32:33.906]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:32:33.906 --> 03:32:36.607]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:32:36.607 --> 03:32:42.411]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:32:42.411 --> 03:32:45.372]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:32:45.372 --> 03:32:48.894]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:32:48.894 --> 03:32:51.136]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:32:51.136 --> 03:32:51.496]  I love it.
[03:32:51.656 --> 03:32:54.461]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:32:54.461 --> 03:32:55.462]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:32:55.462 --> 03:33:01.292]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:33:01.292 --> 03:33:03.315]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:33:03.315 --> 03:33:04.537]  It's a win-win.
[03:33:04.537 --> 03:33:05.338]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:12.667 --> 03:33:19.736]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.736 --> 03:33:23.461]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:26.485 --> 03:33:28.326]  We're back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.326 --> 03:33:40.695]  We're going to get back into the news shortly, but I want to tell you about the 30 to 40% off discount, huge discount on InfoWars Select Storable Food at infowarsstore.com for a limited time only.
[03:33:40.695 --> 03:33:45.859]  Shelf life of 25 years with all the instability that's taking place in the world right now.
[03:33:45.859 --> 03:33:48.521]  Why wouldn't you have this backup insurance policy?
[03:33:48.521 --> 03:33:55.146]  I wish I could get my hands on this, given how inflated storable food prices are over here in Europe.
[03:33:56.227 --> 03:33:57.288]  Excellent value.
[03:33:57.288 --> 03:34:03.613]  I mean, if you don't need it, you can just eat it anyway after 25 years, so you're not even going to lose money on this.
[03:34:03.613 --> 03:34:05.415]  It's an insurance policy.
[03:34:05.415 --> 03:34:12.861]  There's a reason that FEMA reports predict up to the 395% increase in food prices that could trigger mass unrest.
[03:34:12.861 --> 03:34:15.484]  By taking advantage of this, you lock in the savings now.
[03:34:16.184 --> 03:34:18.968]  Government has vast food reserves.
[03:34:18.968 --> 03:34:22.032]  Nobody calls government tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists, do they?
[03:34:22.032 --> 03:34:23.554]  Nobody calls FEMA that.
[03:34:23.554 --> 03:34:30.083]  Oh, but God forbid you should have some storable food in your garage that lasts for 25 years.
[03:34:30.083 --> 03:34:30.623]  You're a kook!
[03:34:31.124 --> 03:34:32.485]  Well no, it's an insurance policy.
[03:34:32.485 --> 03:34:34.066]  It makes complete sense.
[03:34:34.066 --> 03:34:39.150]  And it's available right now for 30-40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:41.411]  Shelf life of 25 years.
[03:34:41.411 --> 03:34:48.757]  We've also got free shipping store-wide on the entire catalogue at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:34:48.757 --> 03:34:51.919]  On all supplements, water filters, gear, seeds, DVDs, books.

[03:34:55.295 --> 03:34:57.116]  Take advantage of that today.
[03:34:57.116 --> 03:35:01.499]  We're under constant attack from the mainstream media, from the deep state.
[03:35:01.499 --> 03:35:03.580]  We're beholden only to you.
[03:35:03.580 --> 03:35:05.581]  We're supported by you.
[03:35:05.581 --> 03:35:10.204]  We're not beholden to Gulf state dictatorships like CNN or big fat checks from George Soros.
[03:35:11.195 --> 03:35:12.777]  Like media matters.
[03:35:12.777 --> 03:35:17.641]  We rely on you, which is why we're able to maintain a complete independence.
[03:35:17.641 --> 03:35:19.523]  We're not controlled by anyone.
[03:35:19.523 --> 03:35:21.505]  We're not controlled by the Kremlin, by the way.
[03:35:21.505 --> 03:35:26.369]  That silly little investigation died a death pretty quickly, didn't it?
[03:35:26.369 --> 03:35:31.134]  Support us today by getting the products free shipping storewide at infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:32.932 --> 03:35:41.855]  Talking about the migrant situation in Europe before the break, which continues to escalate, especially in terms of Italy, where they're being completely deluged.
[03:35:41.855 --> 03:35:49.138]  George Clooney's getting the hell out of there after he advocated the very policies that caused the crisis in the first place.
[03:35:49.138 --> 03:35:55.381]  Now we learn tourism up under Trump collapses in Europe following terror and migrant invasion.
[03:35:56.499 --> 03:36:03.484]  Now they were really pessimistic, all the tourism industry reps, when Trump was elected president.
[03:36:03.484 --> 03:36:06.386]  They were saying this was doomsday for the tourist industry.
[03:36:06.386 --> 03:36:08.487]  It would lead to massive declines.
[03:36:08.487 --> 03:36:10.568]  Turns out the exact opposite has happened.
[03:36:10.568 --> 03:36:12.250]  Tourism is up in the United States.
[03:36:12.990 --> 03:36:15.551]  Wall Street Journal reports latest numbers from the U.S.
[03:36:15.551 --> 03:36:21.394]  Travel Association's Travel Trends Index showed 6.6% growth in international travel to the U.S.
[03:36:21.394 --> 03:36:26.656]  in April, 5% growth in May compared with the same months last year.
[03:36:26.656 --> 03:36:36.260]  Hotel occupancy in the United States for the first six months of 2017 is also, quote, higher than it has ever been before.
[03:36:37.040 --> 03:36:43.244]  Higher than it has ever been before, according to Jan Freytag, Senior Vice President with STR.
[03:36:43.244 --> 03:36:48.227]  You look at visits to museums in New York, they're up on the same period last year.
[03:36:48.227 --> 03:36:58.353]  You look at the theme park gateway, Florida in Orlando International Airport, they're also reporting growth in domestic and international passengers.
[03:36:58.353 --> 03:37:02.956]  So everything is hunky-dory right now with the US tourism industry.
[03:37:04.181 --> 03:37:11.767]  Not so much the case in Europe, where we've had a wave of terror attacks, we've had mass migration, and it's had an impact.
[03:37:11.767 --> 03:37:32.384]  Now, you know, leftists in Europe might not like to talk about it, they might like to virtue-signal all day while they're literally walking past open-air migrant camps on the streets of Paris with detritus and litter everywhere, crime rampant, but if you look at international visitors to Europe, that's collapsing as well.
[03:37:32.384 --> 03:37:32.845]  Germany.
[03:37:34.008 --> 03:37:47.912]  Of course, normally seen as quite a safe place to visit, since they imported 2 million migrants, they've experienced declines of up to 40% of tourists visiting from countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
[03:37:47.912 --> 03:37:52.814]  10% drop in visitors to Germany from the United States, so they're experiencing it.
[03:37:52.814 --> 03:37:53.814]  You look at Brussels.
[03:37:54.414 --> 03:37:58.676]  Of course we have the airport, the subway attack in Brussels at the start of 2016.
[03:37:58.676 --> 03:38:04.499]  Numerous terror plots linked to the city's infamous Molumbique Islamic ghetto.
[03:38:04.499 --> 03:38:07.360]  Tourism in Brussels is collapsing.
[03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:12.542]  Weekend hotel revenue has dropped 22% and occupancy rates are down 10%.
[03:38:12.542 --> 03:38:13.343]  You look at London.
[03:38:14.212 --> 03:38:26.235]  Which before the past, what, three months, was seen as a safer destination than some of the other European capitals, even before the terrorist attacks in Manchester and the London Bridge attack.
[03:38:26.235 --> 03:38:31.237]  Visitor numbers to the English capital's most popular hotspots were dropping.
[03:38:31.237 --> 03:38:40.059]  A million fewer people visited the British Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2016 compared to the previous year.
[03:38:41.289 --> 03:38:48.352]  According to Bernard Donoghue, director of Alva, tourists are avoiding central London due to security fears.
[03:38:48.352 --> 03:38:51.313]  This was before the Manchester attack.
[03:38:51.313 --> 03:38:53.074]  This was before the Westminster attack.
[03:38:53.074 --> 03:38:56.675]  This was before the attack in London Bridge.
[03:38:56.675 --> 03:39:00.297]  This was before the spate of acid attacks that I talked about earlier.
[03:39:00.297 --> 03:39:03.438]  This was before the stabbings which are through the roof.
[03:39:03.438 --> 03:39:09.020]  Reports of stabbings, people dying nearly every single day now in London.
[03:39:09.020 --> 03:39:10.361]  Even before all that,
[03:39:11.081 --> 03:39:13.822]  Tourism was already collapsing.
[03:39:13.822 --> 03:39:22.224]  The owner of Alton Towers and Madame Tussauds said the most recent terror attacks in the UK have resulted in a further deterioration in domestic demand.
[03:39:22.224 --> 03:39:25.025]  So it's only going lower.
[03:39:25.025 --> 03:39:25.945]  Nice.
[03:39:25.945 --> 03:39:29.686]  Of course, the truck attack back in July 2016.
[03:39:29.686 --> 03:39:37.848]  After that, and in fact before it as well, foreign tourists began shunning France in even greater numbers, with hotel occupancy rates in Paris halved.
[03:39:39.212 --> 03:39:42.754]  Compared to 2015, literally cut in half.
[03:39:42.754 --> 03:39:48.978]  1.5 million fewer French and international tourists visited Paris in 2016 compared to 2015.
[03:39:48.978 --> 03:39:53.641]  Of course, we had a number of other terror attacks in Paris so far this year, too.
[03:39:53.641 --> 03:39:55.182]  You look at Italy.
[03:39:55.182 --> 03:39:56.864]  Visitors to Rome are dropping.
[03:39:56.864 --> 03:39:59.085]  They're citing terror fears.
[03:39:59.085 --> 03:40:00.066]  You look at Sweden.
[03:40:00.706 --> 03:40:06.729]  They've got a government program in Sweden of turning holiday resorts into migrant centers, into migrant camps.
[03:40:06.729 --> 03:40:10.010]  Now there's no room for people who want to vacation there.
[03:40:10.010 --> 03:40:10.891]  Like you ever would.
[03:40:11.957 --> 03:40:16.099]  But still, there's no room because they've turned all the hotels over to migrant camps.
[03:40:16.099 --> 03:40:26.125]  So you look at every single major European country that has accepted large numbers of migrants, tourism is on its knees in America.
[03:40:26.125 --> 03:40:28.326]  It's doing very well.
[03:40:28.326 --> 03:40:29.426]  Thank you very much.
[03:40:29.426 --> 03:40:35.550]  Even though they said it was a doomsday scenario with Trump getting in, that he would cause tourism to collapse somehow.
[03:40:36.190 --> 03:40:37.252]  We're good to go.
[03:40:53.260 --> 03:40:58.804]  Quite visible, quite evident on the streets of Europe if you visit any major capital city.
[03:40:58.804 --> 03:41:14.176]  And in fact, many smaller and medium-sized towns, as I talked about earlier, with even dog walkers in Vienna being attacked because dogs are unclean and, you know, that's not part of their culture.
[03:41:14.176 --> 03:41:16.658]  We have to adapt to their culture.
[03:41:16.658 --> 03:41:20.981]  They don't have to adapt to ours.
[03:41:20.981 --> 03:41:22.382]  Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom,
[03:41:23.484 --> 03:41:26.466]  Gender stereotypes in adverts to be banned.
[03:41:26.466 --> 03:41:29.827]  We can't show women as being attractive.
[03:41:29.827 --> 03:41:31.608]  That's haram.
[03:41:31.608 --> 03:41:32.469]  We can't allow that.
[03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:33.229]  That's offensive.
[03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:34.249]  Might offend some people.
[03:41:34.249 --> 03:41:35.230]  Might offend Muslims.
[03:41:35.230 --> 03:41:36.851]  Might offend feminists.
[03:41:36.851 --> 03:41:42.634]  Adverts reinforcing gender stereotypes are set to be banned because they can restrict choices, aspirations and opportunities.
[03:41:43.334 --> 03:41:54.582]  In the latest 1984 style development in British society, adverts portraying women having sole responsibility for the housework look set to be axed by the Advertising Standards Authority.
[03:41:54.582 --> 03:42:00.827]  What are they gonna do for all the adverts that include cleaning products?
[03:42:00.827 --> 03:42:04.770]  You know, detergents, dishwashers, washing machines, mops.
[03:42:05.427 --> 03:42:06.228]  What are they gonna do?
[03:42:06.228 --> 03:42:11.973]  They're gonna have to have a man in every single advert just to comply with this ridiculous standard.
[03:42:11.973 --> 03:42:20.421]  Oh, are they gonna stop men from being portrayed as dumb oafs in adverts as they are on a routine basis, not to mention sitcoms?
[03:42:20.421 --> 03:42:22.303]  No, they're not gonna stop that.
[03:42:22.303 --> 03:42:24.344]  That's not gonna come under this.
[03:42:24.344 --> 03:42:27.848]  They probably had like a handful of complaints.
[03:42:27.848 --> 03:42:29.009]  Probably in a Reebok ad.
[03:42:29.881 --> 03:42:42.686]  You know, ironically enough, given that Reebok is lecturing everyone about, don't give compliments to women, meanwhile they literally, almost every single advert is a woman's butt on prominent display.
[03:42:42.686 --> 03:42:50.789]  But because a few people got offended, now they can't show women as being solely responsible for household duties.
[03:42:50.789 --> 03:42:55.411]  Even though, back here in reality, what, 90-95% of people watching those adverts
[03:42:59.431 --> 03:43:03.856]  You know, with the products that will appeal to them, they're gonna be women!
[03:43:03.856 --> 03:43:07.860]  You can't just change the nature of reality because some people got offended.
[03:43:07.860 --> 03:43:09.082]  I mean, my God!
[03:43:10.407 --> 03:43:21.058]  So they're going to literally have to have gender equality in adverts for cleaners, you know, for dishwasher tablets, for laundry powder.
[03:43:21.058 --> 03:43:28.325]  They're going to have to have men in every single advert because of this ridiculous 1984 style ruling.
[03:43:28.325 --> 03:43:30.587]  And of course it goes back to a couple of years ago.
[03:43:31.601 --> 03:43:47.036]  When Sadiq Khan basically banned the Protein World Beach Body ad, because that might cause offence, it was an ad that simply showed an attractive toned woman encouraging other women to be healthy, to have healthy bodies.
[03:43:47.036 --> 03:43:48.277]  No, we can't have that.
[03:43:48.277 --> 03:43:50.780]  That was banned, now it's led to this.
[03:43:50.780 --> 03:43:52.701]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:43:53.382 --> 03:43:56.145]  This is a form of creeping Sharia law.
[03:43:56.145 --> 03:44:06.335]  Again, it's feminists aligning with Islamists, being offended by something, because in the case of feminists, most of them are social failures, completely out of shape.
[03:44:06.335 --> 03:44:10.158]  They literally get triggered by attractive, thin women.
[03:44:10.158 --> 03:44:12.781]  Now we have Reebok saying that you can't compliment women.
[03:44:12.781 --> 03:44:13.822]  Yeah, good luck with that.
[03:44:14.887 --> 03:44:20.990]  Saudi Arabian miniskirt-wearing model collude arrested by police in Riyadh.
[03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:22.951]  Again, this was yesterday.
[03:44:22.951 --> 03:44:31.674]  They were on the hunt for her after she posted some videos on her Snapchat walking through a national monument in Saudi Arabia with a t-shirt and a miniskirt.
[03:44:31.674 --> 03:44:34.896]  It wasn't even a miniskirt, it was just a normal skirt, God forbid.
[03:44:36.169 --> 03:44:37.310]  Oh, and there was a debate.
[03:44:37.310 --> 03:44:39.911]  This is how the mainstream media, even in the West, covered it.
[03:44:39.911 --> 03:44:41.092]  There's a debate.
[03:44:41.092 --> 03:44:43.873]  Is it correct for them to go and arrest her?
[03:44:43.873 --> 03:44:45.954]  You know, she is breaking the law.
[03:44:45.954 --> 03:44:47.855]  Absolutely insane narrative.
[03:44:47.855 --> 03:44:49.516]  Absolutely insane.
[03:44:49.516 --> 03:44:59.020]  Kind of like the Otto Warmbier narrative in North Korea, where he was literally, you know, held in solitary confinement, tortured for, what was it, over a year.
[03:44:59.020 --> 03:45:01.782]  Came back, died as a result of being in a coma.
[03:45:02.779 --> 03:45:04.783]  Absolutely horrific case.
[03:45:04.783 --> 03:45:06.706]  Oh, but what did the mainstream media say?
[03:45:06.706 --> 03:45:08.188]  He did steal a poster!
[03:45:10.646 --> 03:45:12.107]  The same narrative here.
[03:45:12.107 --> 03:45:13.549]  Oh, she did break the law.
[03:45:13.549 --> 03:45:15.251]  The law's friggin' stupid.
[03:45:15.251 --> 03:45:18.073]  Has no place in the 21st century.
[03:45:18.073 --> 03:45:19.895]  There's no debate over this.
[03:45:19.895 --> 03:45:22.498]  Saudi Arabia is a cancer upon the planet.
[03:45:22.498 --> 03:45:23.438]  That's the debate.
[03:45:23.438 --> 03:45:24.419]  That's where it starts.
[03:45:24.419 --> 03:45:25.400]  That's where it ends.
[03:45:25.400 --> 03:45:29.224]  Don't arrest people for wearing skirts and t-shirts.
[03:45:29.224 --> 03:45:30.345]  That's dictatorial.
[03:45:30.345 --> 03:45:31.747]  That's authoritarian.
[03:45:31.747 --> 03:45:33.708]  Has no place in modern society.
[03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:36.471]  That's reprehensible.
[03:45:36.471 --> 03:45:40.675]  Oh, and all the feminists are out castigating the Saudi authorities, aren't they?
[03:45:40.675 --> 03:45:41.396]  No!
[03:45:41.396 --> 03:45:42.196]  None of them are.
[03:45:42.196 --> 03:45:44.899]  They're completely frigging silent.
[03:45:44.899 --> 03:45:47.141]  Now this woman's being arrested.
[03:45:47.141 --> 03:45:48.683]  God knows what will happen to her.
[03:45:48.683 --> 03:45:56.390]  The video first shared on Snapchat shows her walking around in an empty historic fort, a village north of the capital.
[03:45:57.296 --> 03:46:04.441]  In the capital of Saudi Arabia, in the desert region of Najd, where many of Saudi Arabia's most conservative tribes and families are from.
[03:46:04.441 --> 03:46:06.802]  So this was an outrage.
[03:46:06.802 --> 03:46:08.323]  How dare she?
[03:46:08.323 --> 03:46:13.487]  She was hunted down with the aid of social media, with the aid of the Islamists.
[03:46:13.487 --> 03:46:18.690]  Now she's been arrested, and the media was all, oh there's a debate over this, is it right, is it wrong?
[03:46:18.690 --> 03:46:21.412]  Of course it's friggin' wrong!
[03:46:21.412 --> 03:46:24.774]  Absolutely insane that they would even raise that as a narrative.
[03:46:27.062 --> 03:46:29.364]  Talked about this earlier, this is out of Sky News.
[03:46:29.364 --> 03:46:35.229]  Noxious substance thrown at paramedic after men flagged her down on 999 call.
[03:46:35.229 --> 03:46:41.073]  There wasn't even a... If they were stealing things, at least you could see it from that perspective.
[03:46:41.073 --> 03:46:43.075]  There wasn't even a criminal motive here.
[03:46:43.075 --> 03:46:47.138]  They're throwing acid in people's faces for fun.
[03:46:47.138 --> 03:46:49.040]  This is cultural enrichment.
[03:46:49.040 --> 03:46:56.386]  A paramedic who had a noxious substance thrown in her face as she rushed to a 999 call was called her masked attacker's cowards.
[03:46:57.367 --> 03:47:00.128]  Yes, in some cases this is criminals doing this.
[03:47:00.128 --> 03:47:01.688]  I'll just insert that.
[03:47:01.688 --> 03:47:07.910]  Not all Muslims proviso for all you butthurt leftists that demand it every time we talk about anything like this.
[03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:10.471]  But again, you look at the cases.
[03:47:10.471 --> 03:47:17.433]  The vast majority, the clear majority of cases of acid attacks in London are in Newham and Tower Hamlets.
[03:47:17.433 --> 03:47:19.994]  What do Newham and Tower Hamlets have in common?
[03:47:19.994 --> 03:47:22.475]  Oh yeah, they're Islamic ghettos.
[03:47:22.475 --> 03:47:26.516]  Largest population of Muslims out of the entirety of London live in those two boroughs.
[03:47:27.449 --> 03:47:34.995]  There's also a huge spike in acid attacks in a place called Barking, where the Muslim population has trebled in the last ten years.
[03:47:34.995 --> 03:47:37.177]  Just a coincidence.
[03:47:37.177 --> 03:47:46.625]  The 32-year-old paramedic was alone and on her way to help a man with chest pains when she was flagged down in North London at 1.30am on Sunday.
[03:47:46.625 --> 03:47:48.787]  She was stopped by three men who appeared to be in distress.
[03:47:49.687 --> 03:47:53.389]  So they faked some kind of emergency just to get her attention.
[03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:58.331]  When she stopped and wound down her window, they pulled bandanas over their faces.
[03:47:58.331 --> 03:48:00.933]  She says it was horrible, I didn't know what was going to happen to me.
[03:48:00.933 --> 03:48:03.254]  It all happened very quickly.
[03:48:03.254 --> 03:48:05.975]  One of them threw liquid out of a plastic bottle at me.
[03:48:05.975 --> 03:48:09.577]  The window was only open a few inches, but the liquid went on my face, neck and chest.
[03:48:10.697 --> 03:48:19.960]  Now of course when they say acid attacks, it conjures up some idea that they've cooked up some, you know, difficult to make corrosive substance in a lab.
[03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:22.060]  No, this is bleach.
[03:48:22.060 --> 03:48:28.622]  They're just buying cleaning products from the shop and squirting them in people's faces for fun.
[03:48:29.793 --> 03:48:31.234]  This is what's happening.
[03:48:31.234 --> 03:48:33.036]  So you can't just ban bleach.
[03:48:33.036 --> 03:48:34.177]  That's not the way to solve it.
[03:48:34.177 --> 03:48:38.321]  Again, you hear all these ridiculous ideas for solutions.
[03:48:38.321 --> 03:48:44.327]  Oh, Sadiq Khan, the Muslim mayor of London, came out and said, we're going to have a zero-tolerance approach to acid attacks.
[03:48:45.216 --> 03:48:46.238]  Great!
[03:48:46.238 --> 03:48:48.842]  So you were tolerating them before?
[03:48:48.842 --> 03:48:50.985]  Oh great, fantastic.
[03:48:50.985 --> 03:48:53.609]  Now you're finally having zero tolerance.
[03:48:53.609 --> 03:48:54.470]  Meaningless!
[03:48:54.470 --> 03:48:56.474]  Completely meaningless!
[03:48:56.474 --> 03:48:59.799]  You're not going to stop this by banning people from buying bleach.
[03:49:00.760 --> 03:49:03.882]  People are always going to be able to get frigging cleaning products.
[03:49:03.882 --> 03:49:05.843]  This is about the culture we're importing.
[03:49:05.843 --> 03:49:10.665]  This is about the individuals who are being ghettoized, who aren't being integrated into society.
[03:49:10.665 --> 03:49:16.148]  This is about the policies our leaders have imposed on us with mass uncontrolled immigration.
[03:49:16.148 --> 03:49:17.209]  That's what it's about.
[03:49:17.209 --> 03:49:24.032]  And yes, some of it is just criminals, but a great percentage of it is Muslims in these Islamic ghettos.
[03:49:24.032 --> 03:49:25.893]  Part of their culture.
[03:49:25.893 --> 03:49:27.214]  You've seen the pictures.
[03:49:27.214 --> 03:49:29.035]  Disfigured women out the Middle East,
[03:49:29.875 --> 03:49:37.756]  You know, if they're accused of having affairs, if they're accused of looking at a man twice, God forbid, they get acid attacked.
[03:49:37.756 --> 03:49:39.377]  If not, honour killed.
[03:49:39.377 --> 03:49:40.977]  And now we're seeing it.
[03:49:40.977 --> 03:49:47.758]  Basically, there's a case, several cases now, every single week in London.
[03:49:47.758 --> 03:49:49.898]  Oh, but now we're going to have zero tolerance for it.
[03:49:49.898 --> 03:49:50.478]  Oh, great.
[03:49:50.478 --> 03:49:53.199]  Thank you very much.
[03:49:53.199 --> 03:49:54.859]  Of course, Alex covered this earlier.
[03:49:54.859 --> 03:49:59.120]  Washington Post worries about Islamophobia after Somali cop kills white woman.
[03:50:00.455 --> 03:50:02.697]  So again, no explanation for this shooting.
[03:50:02.697 --> 03:50:06.740]  She was basically talking to the Somali cops' colleague.
[03:50:06.740 --> 03:50:08.642]  They were sat in a squad car.
[03:50:08.642 --> 03:50:12.925]  A woman, a 40-year-old Australian yoga teacher, was in her pyjamas.
[03:50:12.925 --> 03:50:17.469]  She had reported a crime in an upscale Minneapolis neighborhood.
[03:50:17.469 --> 03:50:18.710]  The cops arrived.
[03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:20.952]  She was talking to them through the squad car window.
[03:50:22.153 --> 03:50:32.781]  According to the report, the Somali cop who has been under investigation for prior abuse leaned over from the passenger side, shot her multiple times.
[03:50:32.781 --> 03:50:34.983]  Absolutely horrific case.
[03:50:34.983 --> 03:50:38.406]  No real explanation as to what happened, as to what caused this.
[03:50:39.588 --> 03:50:42.671]  And what's the debate amongst the mainstream media?
[03:50:42.671 --> 03:50:46.975]  Is it, should this cop be immediately suspended while we investigate this?
[03:50:46.975 --> 03:50:48.316]  What the hell is going on here?
[03:50:48.316 --> 03:50:48.937]  No.
[03:50:48.937 --> 03:50:54.441]  It's, some people on right-wing blogs are being mean to Muslims on Twitter.
[03:50:54.441 --> 03:50:58.886]  That's literally the narrative they've come out with yet again.
[03:50:58.886 --> 03:51:03.129]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live in the final segment after the break.
[03:51:03.129 --> 03:51:04.370]  BreakingNewsAtInfoWars.com.
[03:51:04.370 --> 03:51:04.951]  Don't go away.
[03:51:06.392 --> 03:51:09.495]  Extendovite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:09.495 --> 03:51:11.537]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[03:51:11.537 --> 03:51:13.359]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[03:51:13.359 --> 03:51:15.581]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep.
[03:51:15.581 --> 03:51:18.283]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[03:51:18.283 --> 03:51:20.445]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[03:51:20.445 --> 03:51:22.307]  Ankles that swell late in the day.
[03:51:22.307 --> 03:51:24.029]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[03:51:24.329 --> 03:51:30.913]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial blockages.
[03:51:30.913 --> 03:51:34.335]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Xtendivite.
[03:51:34.335 --> 03:51:36.617]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[03:51:36.617 --> 03:51:39.939]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.
[03:51:39.939 --> 03:51:41.860]  Get your Xtendivite today!

[03:52:05.978 --> 03:52:08.979]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:52:08.979 --> 03:52:13.161]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:52:13.161 --> 03:52:20.464]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:52:20.464 --> 03:52:23.565]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:52:24.285 --> 03:52:38.079]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[03:52:38.079 --> 03:52:43.685]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:52:44.225 --> 03:52:48.308]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:52:48.308 --> 03:52:59.516]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:52:59.516 --> 03:53:04.600]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:53:05.320 --> 03:53:11.264]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.

[03:55:13.132 --> 03:55:15.353]  I was talking about the events in Minneapolis.
[03:55:15.353 --> 03:55:18.074]  The woman shot by the Somali cop.
[03:55:18.074 --> 03:55:25.218]  Again, he was the poster child for multiculturalism and integration, even though he's under investigation for several other incidents.
[03:55:25.218 --> 03:55:29.560]  Looks like he may have shot a woman, an innocent woman, in cold blood.
[03:55:29.560 --> 03:55:31.661]  The main concern of the Washington Post
[03:55:32.361 --> 03:55:36.222]  Is people saying mean things about Muslims on Twitter?
[03:55:36.222 --> 03:55:41.763]  But even further than that, they literally say, people criticizing Islam.
[03:55:41.763 --> 03:55:43.444]  We can't have that, can we?
[03:55:43.444 --> 03:55:47.245]  In fact, I'll read you straight from the Washington Post.
[03:55:47.245 --> 03:55:52.746]  This is how the Washington Post reported to a 40-year-old woman being gunned down in cold blood.
[03:55:52.746 --> 03:55:54.727]  This is what they think is the primary concern.
[03:55:55.507 --> 03:56:03.456]  Already, hateful posts criticizing Islam and Sharia law are filling social media in response to the police shooting.
[03:56:03.456 --> 03:56:08.942]  Several far-right blogs featured sensational headlines that blamed the officers' ethnicity for the deadly use of force.
[03:56:08.942 --> 03:56:10.163]  So they're more concerned...
[03:56:11.124 --> 03:56:17.067]  About people on Twitter, quote, criticizing Islam and Sharia law.
[03:56:17.067 --> 03:56:21.489]  That's literally a quote direct from the article.
[03:56:21.489 --> 03:56:25.211]  That's more important than a woman being gunned down in cold blood.
[03:56:25.211 --> 03:56:28.513]  Again, we see this after every single massive terror attack.
[03:56:29.133 --> 03:56:35.499]  No concern, no real concern, no genuine concern about little girls being blown to pieces by terrorists, no.
[03:56:35.499 --> 03:56:39.903]  It's, oh how will the backlash affect the Muslim community?
[03:56:39.903 --> 03:56:42.765]  And that's where their loyalties lie every single time.
[03:56:42.765 --> 03:56:52.794]  Again, emphasising how this hysteria over political correctness is placed above and beyond any sense of rationality, any sense of actually
[03:56:53.695 --> 03:56:58.217]  Digging into how we solve, how we address the root causes of violence.
[03:56:58.217 --> 03:56:59.077]  That's not important.
[03:56:59.077 --> 03:57:03.760]  What's important is someone might say a mean thing on Twitter.
[03:57:03.760 --> 03:57:04.240]  Oh.
[03:57:04.240 --> 03:57:04.820]  My.
[03:57:04.820 --> 03:57:05.440]  Word.
[03:57:05.440 --> 03:57:07.161]  God forbid.
[03:57:07.161 --> 03:57:08.602]  That's the Washington Post today.
[03:57:10.262 --> 03:57:12.863]  Of course, there's no mass protest over the killing of this woman.
[03:57:12.863 --> 03:57:16.944]  Maybe if she'd have been black, then there would be, but she isn't, so nobody really cares.
[03:57:16.944 --> 03:57:21.766]  In fact, Black Lives Matter activists are all over Twitter celebrating her death.
[03:57:21.766 --> 03:57:23.886]  Yes, that's actually happening.
[03:57:23.886 --> 03:57:31.109]  Meanwhile, The Daily Caller reports, Women's March praises cop-killing terrorists as a sign of resistance.
[03:57:31.109 --> 03:57:34.790]  The Women's March praised a cop-killing terrorist as a sign of resistance on Sunday.
[03:57:35.933 --> 03:57:40.537]  And this is a woman who I've talked about before, I've written about her, Assata Chakur.
[03:57:40.537 --> 03:57:46.021]  She is the ideological guru and inspiration for Black Lives Matter.
[03:57:46.021 --> 03:57:50.885]  This is the woman whose name they chant at every single Black Lives Matter protest.
[03:57:50.885 --> 03:57:57.009]  Oh, and by the way, she's also a cop-killing fugitive who's listed by the FBI as one of their top ten
[03:57:57.890 --> 03:57:58.971]  Terrorists!
[03:57:58.971 --> 03:57:59.692]  Most.
[03:57:59.692 --> 03:58:00.512]  Wanted.
[03:58:00.512 --> 03:58:01.533]  Terrorists.
[03:58:01.533 --> 03:58:10.382]  That's literally who the Women's March organisation from their official Twitter account was glorifying, was celebrating on Sunday night.
[03:58:11.618 --> 03:58:19.880]  When they got called out on it, of course they defaulted to the usual victimhood grievance status of, oh, these evil right-wingers are calling us out.
[03:58:19.880 --> 03:58:29.363]  They proceeded to engage in a 20-tweet diatribe about Assata Shakur, the cop-killing, fugitive, domestic terrorist.
[03:58:29.363 --> 03:58:30.923]  That's who these people are.
[03:58:30.923 --> 03:58:32.324]  That's who they venerate.
[03:58:32.324 --> 03:58:36.885]  She's literally the ideological guru, inspiration behind Black Lives Matter.
[03:58:36.885 --> 03:58:39.666]  That's the icon for these kind of people.
[03:58:39.986 --> 03:58:41.268]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:58:41.268 --> 03:58:42.730]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[03:58:42.730 --> 03:58:43.851]  Nightly news coming up.
