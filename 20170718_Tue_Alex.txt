[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, the 18th day of July 2017.
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.000]  We have a massive, incredibly important transmission lined up.
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  But first, Key Intel from the one, the only, Mark Dice.
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  He was, you know, he was, he was living a dream. That was our dream, you know, and it was squashed out.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  My son was, our son was the second of four shot that night.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  And we've lost everything. He was my only child.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  I want some action. If this went and done years ago, my son would still be here.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  This is not anything you want anybody to ever go through. I want some action.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  I don't want anybody else in my family, and I don't want anybody else to feel what we have to feel.
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.000]  This is what some politicians in the country have decided is acceptable for us. It's not acceptable.
[00:58.000 --> 01:06.000]  While these politicians are sitting at home on holidays all warm and cozy with their families, most of us are at the cemetery.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  And it's just not acceptable.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  And I'm tired of our politicians not caring about their fellow Americans.
[01:14.000 --> 01:24.000]  Why, when did it ever become more important to our elected officials to protect illegal criminals in our country and not care about us?
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  I mean, the deport that murdered my father was deported twice previously and returned to our country illegally.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  This senseless crime has affected my family and I in many ways that are unexplainable.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  The pain is tremendous and it's something we'll never get over.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  I think it's important that we focus on these laws and getting them passed such as Kate's law.
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  And definitely most importantly for me personally is the Davis Oliver Act.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  We need our law enforcement officers to have more information about these people that are in our country illegally.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  So we can go ahead and get them detained so this can't happen to another family.
[02:04.000 --> 02:20.000]  My daughter, Kristi Supina, she was murdered. She was strangled, stabbed, raped, sodomized, her nude body was thrown in an artichoke feeling in the middle of winter.
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  And what I think that we're, Mr. President, here is trying to do is the best thing ever.
[02:28.000 --> 02:37.000]  And if you need a pin with a lot of ink, I got one of those too. And I'm all for everything that you do.
[02:37.000 --> 02:45.000]  We got to put our people safe. Just like they said over there, they protect them. That's not right.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  Americans first. Americans first.
[02:49.000 --> 03:01.000]  So why do we have to encounter any type of violence? And I'm sorry, these laws that are trying to be passed, most of them are common sense.
[03:01.000 --> 03:11.000]  And until this happened to me, I thought this is what was in place. And to find out it wasn't was terrifying to me.
[03:11.000 --> 03:23.000]  And I am telling you, these congressmen and senators that don't vote for these laws, the blood is on their hands for the next victim and that victim's family.
[03:23.000 --> 03:34.000]  I'm a legal immigrant. And I did it the right way. I came here knowing I wanted to be here. I had to go through certain steps.
[03:34.000 --> 03:43.000]  So I did that and I'm a proud citizen now. And I had one child, my son Dominic. I brought him with me. That's all I got.
[03:43.000 --> 03:54.000]  He was my only child. Mr. President, since I had no family left, I wanted to commit suicide. My fiancee didn't know.
[03:54.000 --> 04:04.000]  I wanted to go. I wanted to be with my son. On June 16th, when you came down at escalator, and you mentioned those words, illegal immigration.
[04:04.000 --> 04:12.000]  I was walking through my living room and I dropped to my knees because it was my little sign from God, you're not doing anything. You stay around.
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.000]  And then a month later, I met you personally in Los Angeles, where you were the only one that ever met with us and became our voice.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  But you're not only my hero, my president, you are my lifesaver. I wouldn't be here without you.
[04:27.000 --> 04:39.000]  The one thing that I think that you, Mr. President, have realized is that every one of our children's deaths has been preventable.
[04:39.000 --> 04:48.000]  All of our deaths, our loved ones, these were preventable. And Mr. President, Chairman Goodlatte, I think you guys realize that.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  That's why you're doing what you're doing, and I want to thank you both for what you're doing.
[04:53.000 --> 05:18.000]  With passing these laws as instrumental, I don't think I would wish the devastation that we felt every day on anyone.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  I don't know why, when he was what Judge Thomas Durkin of the federal court described as a serial child molester.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  Because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out,
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  Hastert was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in, if you can believe that.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  He did go down for illegal hush money, to the tune of at least $3.5 million.
[05:37.000 --> 05:43.000]  He was fined $250,000 and sentenced to 15 months in prison, hardly justice.
[05:43.000 --> 05:49.000]  But now, the serial child molester is free once again, after serving only 13 months.
[05:49.000 --> 05:56.000]  Judge Durkin also said, there's nothing more disturbing than having a child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence.
[05:56.000 --> 06:02.000]  I disagree, there's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year in prison.
[06:02.000 --> 06:14.000]  Won't see that on CNN, for Infowars.com, this is Elwin Schreuer.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[06:46.000 --> 06:57.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands,
[07:03.000 --> 07:28.000]  as it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[07:33.000 --> 07:40.000]  To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding,
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[07:50.000 --> 07:56.000]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom,
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[08:31.000 --> 08:55.000]  We're live broadcasting worldwide on the 18th day of July 2017 from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  We have several informative guests joining us today, including former Congressman Ron Paul on the economy,
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  on North Korea, on globalism's decline, and so much more.
[09:10.000 --> 09:18.000]  Wow, look at these headlines. We have the Federal Reserve coming out and announcing they're going to have big rate increases
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  in the next few months, and that drove down the dollar and is starting to put a dent in Trump's recovery.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  But then you've got other numbers coming in of even more jobs flooding back into the country,
[09:32.000 --> 09:41.000]  and massive increases in tourism while Europe and the rest of the world sees massive declines in tourism,
[09:41.000 --> 09:48.000]  namely because of the fact that much of the world is in a depression right now.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article, links to the Associated Press,
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  tourism up under Trump, collapses in Europe following terror, and migrant invasion.
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  Speaking of that, if I wanted to really sit here and bash radical Orthodox Islam as taking over, I could.
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.000]  I don't even cover the dozens and dozens of stories I have in my stack every day that I never even get to.
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  Like this one, up on infowars.com, linking right through to major German newspapers like Respiegel.
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  Germany's Syrian hairdresser, hailed as a model of integration, slits his female employer's throat.
[10:28.000 --> 10:53.000]  We love our Muslims, we love our Muslims, oh they're so good, we love our Muslims, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet.
[10:53.000 --> 11:05.000]  More and more, more and more, I am going to, every time we report on people screaming Allah Akbar and stabbing men, women, and children,
[11:05.000 --> 11:13.000]  I'm going to play clips from the Time Warner hit piece they put out via Super Deluxe, where they make it look like I'm just making stuff up,
[11:13.000 --> 11:20.000]  where I go, we're going to stab your daughter at the mall, we're going to stab your wife, your son.
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.000]  That was a real article I was reading, where the police chief came out and said, Somalis are wonderful, this is an Islamic attack.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  And then there was another stabbing like a day later at a university in Ohio,
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  so they had a couple stabbing in Minnesota, then one in Ohio, then one in Texas, then one in New York,
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  and then just a whole bunch of these attacks.
[11:39.000 --> 11:47.000]  And the news was like, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  So here it is, journey, I shouldn't laugh about it.
[11:51.000 --> 11:59.000]  Syrian hairdresser hailed his model of integration, that's a quote, slits his female employer's throat,
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  and then they got all these articles with her groveling and talking about how nice he was.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  I mean, it's just a fact that 98% of the rapes in Sweden are Islamists doing it,
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  and then the news has been ordered to say, quote, Swedish men arrested for rape,
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  and then they're released with counseling.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  They don't even get prison time in places like the Netherlands, in places like Sweden.
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  That's mainstream cuckold news, because they're part of the Globalist Club.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  Orthodox Islam supports pedophilia, Orthodox Islam supports enslaving women,
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  the globalists are all about it, it's psychotic, they want to overthrow the West, so they love it.
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.000]  And that leads me, of course, to all the other news I have on that similar subject.
[12:46.000 --> 12:54.000]  Dennis Hastert reportedly procured young boys for the Republican Party's leadership
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  so that they could bugger them, is the term for raping a young boy, I guess,
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  so that Hastert and his cohorts could bugger small boys, young men, young boys.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  And of course, we have Nambla and the Liberal Parties in Europe trying to legalize all that,
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  but not in time for Hastert.
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.000]  He spent 13 months in prison for buggering and procuring young boys.
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  He was taken from nowhere, run by the Republican leadership for the House,
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  was the shortest-serving Republican ever to be made the Speaker,
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  because he was such a horrible demonic jellyfish, and now he has been released.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  Dennis Hastert wants sex-abuse accuser to return the hush money.
[13:38.000 --> 13:45.000]  Yeah, he's suing the folks that dared expose him.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  Actually, they didn't, other people did, but still he says,
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  all the money I paid you is not worth it now, can I have that money back?
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  And look, I'm in a wheelchair now for everybody's sympathy, so it's okay that I'm a P.B.P.,
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  who looks like the brother of the guy that shot Congressman Scalise,
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  just saying Congressman Scalise has been exposing the pedophile rings.
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  But notice, he got 13 months, and they hushed it all up, just like Penn State,
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  or just like the new Pope and his deputy Pope caught raping, indicted hundreds of young boys.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  Again, a pure cure, a Renfield supplying ex-Speaker Dennis Hastert released from prison.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  Former U.S. Speaker Dennis Hastert has been released from a federal prison
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  13 months after he began serving a sentence for a bank fraud conviction
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  linked to his effort to buy the silence of former student.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  He sexually abused and took on special wrestling trips to Republican events
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.000]  during his days at a high school wrestling coach.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  Now, guess who got to spend almost nine years, even if he gets paroled
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  by the time of the parole hearing, it'll be nine years, O.J. The Juice Simpson,
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  who I'm not saying is a great guy, but the point is, is that he did get double jeopardy.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  He did have somebody reportedly that stole a bunch of his memorabilia, that's what he claimed.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  It was a crime of passion, I'm not defending it, but it wasn't like a cold-blooded robbery.
[15:12.000 --> 15:20.000]  He did go rob, though, the materials from his former business associate.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  And so he spent nine years, he's up for parole this year, they think he may get out
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  except that there was a cookie caper where someone gave him a cookie from the mess hall.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  Nine years, no disciplinary action, exemplary record, he may still stay in prison
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  because of a cookie someone gave him and they caught him with a cookie.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  He was honest, he said, they said, where'd you get the cookie?
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  And they said from the mess hall.
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  So he was caught like private pile in full metal jacket with a jelly donut.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  Basically, and so he may not get released, but if he does nine years for stealing back
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  some of his own memorabilia, then it's Hastert's 13 months.
[16:00.000 --> 16:07.000]  So I don't think it's because Hastert's white, it's because Hastert is an elitist pedophile.
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  Just like the Pope's deputy, just like everybody else in the power structure,
[16:11.000 --> 16:17.000]  you can't swing a stick in Washington without running into a PBP, a potbelly pedophile.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  And that's why there's been over 10,000 arrests and counting
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  and the courts are just shutting it down basically because it is becoming a huge national security issue.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  Just like in England, the former prime minister confirmed to be not just raping children,
[16:32.000 --> 16:39.000]  but having satanic ceremonies, killing them and then raping their dead bodies.
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.000]  They now broke into a basement that Jimmy Savelle had where he would rape and kill the children.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  And then he would also, when he couldn't get a kid he could kill,
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  he would go down daily to the morgue after car wrecks,
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  and he and his cohorts would have sex with the dead boys and dead little girls.
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  He liked dead little girls, but he would also have sex with the dead little boys.
[17:02.000 --> 17:09.000]  Investigation and satanic child sex abuse involving dead UK prime minister begins in Edmonton with hypothesis.
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  No, I've had guests on that talk to the witnesses when he would bring in a little girl, lay out the plastic,
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  they would slit their throats in front of them.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  I reported this 12 years ago before it was ever implicated.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  And then he would masturbate while their blood sprayed all over the room on the plastic.
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  He didn't like to get his hands dirty.
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  So remember, that's who's running the show.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  They want to kidnap your children and rape them to death,
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  but first they want to scare the hell out of them.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  They feed off the energy.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  And the sex cult is angry at us because they know we're coming for them.
[17:45.000 --> 17:50.000]  I need a bumper sticker that says, my wife's not street legal.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  I thought of that this morning being a cool shirt, right?
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  My wife's not street legal.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  I mean, who could ever get sick of God's wonderful creation of women?
[18:00.000 --> 18:06.000]  I have zero attraction to children, and that's because I'm not a devil worshipper.
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  I want to protect children.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  I want to empower children.
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.000]  And I want to gouge the eyeballs out of pedophiles with my thumbs.
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  Not because I'm a sadistic person, because I'm a good person.
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  I have instincts to want to get my hands around their necks
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze until their eyeballs pop out.
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  And we need to get the spirit back again in this country of resisting evil and triumphing over it
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  with the zeal and fury and power that God has given us.
[18:42.000 --> 18:49.000]  And I swear on the altar of God, before his son Jesus Christ,
[18:49.000 --> 18:54.000]  that I will resist the satanic hordes and their pedophile armies,
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  and I beg you to join me in this quest.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  We will bring down the forces of Lucifer.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  And believe me, you look at these people.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  Why are we ruled by P.B.P.'s like Hastert?
[19:08.000 --> 19:15.000]  And Salon magazine promoting pedophilia and the fetish of five-year-old girls
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  and all the rest of this insanity.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  But notice what the P.B.P.'s do.
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.000]  They make normal, like an 18-year-old date and a 16-year-old,
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  they make that statutory rape or pedophilia when it's not,
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  the prisons are full of people that got caught drunk peeing in a parking lot
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  or got caught when they're 18 dating their 16-year-old girlfriend.

[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  I, I, I
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  We'll stuff ourselves in a crap
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  We don't even notice and it's self rising up
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  Against the millions of pointed people
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  If the fair was tappin' I'm so pissed
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  We're gonna stare at your daughter at the mall

[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  And then the police chief is gonna say
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  We love our Somalis, we love our Muslims
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  Oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  So let's look at it
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  We need to worry about Somali terrorists in the U.S.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  U.S. News report edits out Allah Akbar during Russian ambassador's assassination
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  Three people killed in Fresno shooting spray
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  Shooters screamed Allah Akbar hated white people
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  But the news edited that out and changed it to God is great
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  AP
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  AP, Fresno shooter didn't yell Allah Akbar
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  He said God is great
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Here's the story today
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  Syrian hairdressers hailed as model of integration
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  That's a quote
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  Slits his female employer's throat
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  After a little over a year on the job
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  He decided to slit his female employer's throat
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  Oh we love our Somalis
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  Oh we love our Muslims too
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  We love our Muslims
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  Oh they're so good
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  Oh they're so sweet
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  And so we'll play that each day with the stabbing
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  The killings, Allah Akbar
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  Oh they're so good
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Oh they're so sweet
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  And then we've got to bend over backwards
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  And never report any of this is happening
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  And then say that we're bad
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Now let me continue here
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  Because I didn't get to this yesterday
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  But since I mentioned it
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  ISIS members destroyed Catholic church in the Philippines
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And I had the London Guardian with the Pope saying
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  It makes me sick to my stomach when I hear about Christian roots
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  We need to let more Muslims in
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  They're good
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  Now it's worth taking over
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  Your countries are ours
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  Mass rape festivals
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  Huge articles everywhere about that
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  ISIS members destroyed Catholic church in the Philippines
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  Here let's roll this video
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  For TV viewers I'll
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  Give you I guess verbal subtitles
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  For the radio audience
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  On their right
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Kill Jesus, how good
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Now
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  Stomping on the Jesus statue
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  Control and Richmond at its best
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  Now we kill Mary
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  You're up his weak Philippines
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  We Christians weak
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  Ah yes
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Pulling down the Pope he loves you
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  He says come on in
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  But he has his walls
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  Ah he has his beat Jesus with a hammer now
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  Guys are too dumb to even do that
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  Now let's throw the crucifix down
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  Oh that's so good
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  Oh that's so sweet
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  I mean their countries
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  Are all living hells
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  Now there's the article
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Islam Christianity share idea of conquest
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  Says Pope read down
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  Scroll down in there he says it makes him sick
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  He doesn't want to hear about Christian roots
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  No
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  Christianity has nothing
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  To do with Christianity
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  And Obamacare is free
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  Now
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  When we return
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  Trump says just repeal Obamacare
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  But in the last 160 years we have the most
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  Unproductive Congress ever and why is that
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  Because they're there blocking Trump
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  By partisanly
[29:54.000 --> 30:06.000]  We'll be back
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  We must keep the internet free
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  From communistic government restrictions
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  And parameters
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  Why? Because it would stop memes
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  And erase heroes
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  Don't believe me? Look at China
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  Chinese President Xi Jinping was famously
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  Memed with Barack Obama in 2013
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  Compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger 2
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  This happened again after an awkward handshake
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  Which Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.000]  Was compared to a handshake between Pooh and Eor
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  Other images such as Winnie the Pooh and a car
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  Have been memed alongside President Xi and his limo
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  But because the meme of President Xi and Winnie the Pooh
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.000]  Has gotten so popular
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  China has now censored it from the internet
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  This is commonplace in communist China
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  As a recently deceased political dissident
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  And Nobel Peace Prize winner
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  Liu Xiaobo has had his name completely
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  Censored from the virtual world
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  He's sending his name and a message to a friend
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  And the message will disappear into cyberspace
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  Xiaobo died in Chinese custody
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  And most people in China have no idea who he is
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  Keep the internet free in America
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  Stop net neutrality
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.000]  Save meme magic
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  For infowars.com

[31:41.000 --> 31:44.000]  Or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  The general public doesn't
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal

[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  There's the headline up on drudgerport.com
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  It's also up on infowars.com
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  Most unproductive Congress in 164 years
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  In 164 orbits of the sun
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  Most unproductive Congress in 164 years
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  Well, it was good to have gridlock
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  And very unproductive Congress under Obama
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  Because they couldn't get their whole globalist agenda through
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  Of carbon taxes and completely open borders
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  And taking our guns
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  But now it's unproductive, the most unproductive
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  Because they don't want Trump's dismantling
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  Of the globalist takeover getting through
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  But just executively
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  He's already hacked off four or five of the Hydra's heads
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  And Hydra's only got nine heads, ladies and gentlemen
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  If you go back to Greek mythology
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  Or its ethos of the Hydra
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  So he's pretty much already devastated them
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  Unless they remove Trump and the heads grow back
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  So we're in the fight, but we are in the thick of it
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  And we are by no means overall winning
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  But we do have the initiative and right on our side
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  But the battle, I'd say is 50-50 right now
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  And that's why the globalists are really turning up the heat
[35:27.000 --> 35:30.000]  Samantha Powers has agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  Of course they want to have it all behind closed doors
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  So that there's no PR exposing that Obama had them illegally spied on
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  Had Trump and the rest of them illegally spied on
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  So more of that, that's all coming up
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  Also some other key video that's up on infowars.com
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  Dan Lyman wrote a story about it
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  Students revolt against anti-Trump teacher
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  Troll her with facts and memes
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  That's all coming up
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  And then of course I'm going to get back into X. Speaker Dennis Hast third
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  Gets 13 months for raping little boys
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  There was a big cover up of just how deep it went
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  He was a rrrr in the field triracular
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  Not a drracula
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  But they're protecting their minion
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  O.J. Simpson for robbing some of his own memorabilia back
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  From somebody reportedly, reportedly
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.040]  that he had a beef with, I'm not defending it, but a crime of passion, a crime of business,
[36:29.040 --> 36:36.720]  he gets nine years if he gets parole this year, except for the cookie monster problem. Oh, cookie,
[36:37.520 --> 36:43.040]  he got caught sneaking cookie out of out of kitchen, and so they're looking at not letting
[36:43.040 --> 36:49.040]  him out to prison for robbery over a cookie. But if you want to rape little children and you want
[36:49.040 --> 36:54.480]  to take them to the republicans so they can rape them, then you only get 30 months. That's how
[36:54.480 --> 37:00.800]  the cookie works. But if you steal a cookie, then you get, then you get, then you get more prison
[37:00.800 --> 37:07.920]  time. That's right. There's only one thing worse than the cookie monster, and that's if the Marvin
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.840]  the Martian comes along. Oh dear pesky earth creature, I'll have to disintegrate you with my
[37:13.840 --> 37:21.760]  strontium 12 deputy tour. You know, I'm having a little bit of fun today. I ran into a feller at
[37:21.760 --> 37:27.200]  a gas station last night and I was going home from work at about seven o'clock. And he was behind
[37:27.200 --> 37:31.280]  the counter and he said, Alex, I've been listening to you for 20 years. I really like it when you
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.280]  make more jokes because some of this stuff's depressing. I know it's important to get the
[37:35.280 --> 37:40.720]  word out for folks that don't know and kind of shake them out of their trance. We looked at
[37:40.720 --> 37:44.960]  me and he said, but I like it when you're having a little bit of fun because I got to turn you off
[37:44.960 --> 37:48.640]  after an hour or two of, you know, screaming and yelling and talking about all the devil
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.120]  worshipers. I know it's true. And I thought, man, you're a crusty guy like out of a movie.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.520]  I go, are you the owner of this place? He goes, yeah, you can never find enough good employees.
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.440]  I had like a good five minute conversation with him. I said, you'd be a good talk show host.
[38:01.440 --> 38:07.040]  There are so many really smart guys out there and smart, smart gals as well, but they never want
[38:07.040 --> 38:13.120]  to get on air. They want to leave it up to me, but the age of YouTube and radio blog and all
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.120]  the rest of it, all of you need to be on the air. That's how we're going to defeat the globalist.
[38:17.760 --> 38:24.960]  So I agree. I like to have fun. I'll be honest with you, though. The audience has spoken in
[38:24.960 --> 38:34.080]  general in the main, as they say, and in the continuum, compendium of this little adventure,
[38:34.080 --> 38:39.840]  we're all on together called life. The general audience does not like the humor.
[38:40.720 --> 38:46.400]  It's a very serious time and people know it's dark, but they know admitting how dark it is
[38:46.400 --> 38:54.240]  is what makes us cherished light. So I should be careful not to descend into madness
[38:54.960 --> 38:58.080]  because we are in an insane world and truth is stranger than fiction.
[38:58.080 --> 39:04.640]  But look at Drudge report. There are the enemies you want to know. It's not the
[39:04.640 --> 39:10.880]  doddering Pelosi or the insane Maxine waters or the self-propelled job of the hut look like
[39:10.880 --> 39:18.720]  Michael Moore. That's the enemy. They're jokes. It's Mitch McConnell and look at that fake psychopath
[39:19.920 --> 39:25.520]  face that Paul Ryan makes. I've studied psychopaths. I've studied criminals.
[39:25.520 --> 39:31.760]  And if you study most psychopaths, they look and act just like the ones that actually go out and
[39:31.760 --> 39:39.840]  round up folks, grab people out of shopping mall parking spaces or kidnap women from the car wash
[39:39.840 --> 39:46.320]  when they're getting a car wash at 10 p.m. at night at the haunted car wash. You've got most
[39:46.960 --> 39:52.080]  unproductive cars in 164 years. And then there's Paul Ryan. Look at him with that sweet little
[39:52.080 --> 40:01.040]  Eddie Haskell face. And gee, Mrs. Cleaver, I don't know where Wally or Beaver are. Let me
[40:01.040 --> 40:07.440]  slit your throat while your back's turned. But even Mrs. Cleaver knew that Eddie Haskell was a fake.
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.960]  And then you've got McConnell. He's a little bit better at acting like, you know, he's not a complete
[40:16.960 --> 40:24.480]  globalist. And I think he's more of just a survivor and tries to play both sides. I don't
[40:24.480 --> 40:31.200]  like Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Let me be clear, but he's not on the Richter scale a demon.
[40:31.760 --> 40:36.400]  This man, just like I could look at Haster before he ever got busted. And I said,
[40:36.400 --> 40:43.440]  if that isn't a PBP, I'm a monkey's uncle. Potbelly pedophile. Well, I don't think Paul Ryan's
[40:43.440 --> 40:49.760]  a pedophile. He is a twinkly-eyed, blue-eyed psychopath that thinks he's better than everybody
[40:49.760 --> 40:55.680]  and has zero feelings except for himself. And all he wants is power and control. And he hates
[40:56.880 --> 41:00.640]  just like the niece of Martin Luther King just came out on Fox News. We ought to get that clip.
[41:00.640 --> 41:07.440]  I forgot to give it to you guys and said that Trump is a brilliant, big-hearted, compassionate man.
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.040]  And that's exactly what Trump is. Competitive, aggressive, worldly at some levels,
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.840]  but he didn't out the screw the average person. And he really hates the elites and he wants to beat
[41:17.840 --> 41:25.120]  him. Dr. Elveda King. Trump is a leading civil rights for unborn. And she went on to say he's
[41:25.120 --> 41:29.280]  a compassionate, brilliant man, which is absolutely true. It's not about groveling to Trump. He's our
[41:29.280 --> 41:37.680]  champion. The whole New World Order pedophile radical Islamic base. The corrupt Vatican, the New
[41:37.680 --> 41:43.760]  World Order, the EU, the globalists. They are Hollywood. Every sworn enemy of humanity is against
[41:43.760 --> 41:58.480]  Trump. And you look at Trump and he's somebody who feeds off being the underdog and just feeds off
[41:58.480 --> 42:08.160]  the attacks and feeds off taking these people on. Believe me, I know because I'm the same way. I know
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.280]  people's hearts. They're just like mine. And I can tell you, I've watched Paul Ryan. I've watched
[42:13.280 --> 42:18.640]  his press conferences and I've studied psychopaths and I've watched Ted Bundy and his hearings in
[42:18.640 --> 42:25.280]  court, serial killer, and I've seen it all. And they've got this fake niceness about them,
[42:25.280 --> 42:32.400]  but the back of your neck, the hair stands up when you just look at it. I mean, just look at
[42:32.400 --> 42:39.120]  Paul Ryan. Just type in Paul Ryan and click Google images. It's all this fake little nice guy
[42:41.200 --> 42:49.360]  face that he makes that is totally ungenuine. He's evil. He's bad. Not just in his actions
[42:49.360 --> 42:56.880]  betraying us and saying the right thing, but doing the wrong thing. Paul Ryan is the enemy's
[42:58.240 --> 43:02.720]  top general right now against us. Just let's just type in Paul Ryan, click Google images,
[43:02.720 --> 43:07.200]  and let's for TV viewers. Let's look. Oh, just look at that.
[43:09.680 --> 43:15.200]  Danger, Will Robertson. Captain, we have a prime computation from this man's actions,
[43:15.200 --> 43:22.480]  his demeanor. And from his continued studied facial expressions, he is hiding serious avarice
[43:23.120 --> 43:29.520]  and psychopathic wish for total dominion and usurpation. He is a usurper of all that is good.
[43:30.400 --> 43:33.200]  Prime computation, Paul Ryan is an enemy of humanity.
[43:33.200 --> 43:45.520]  Just look at that smug know it all power trip. My guts, my instincts, my genetics,
[43:45.520 --> 44:07.440]  my ancestors say enemy. Look at him. Oh, man. You'll be broken, Ryan, just like I told
[44:07.440 --> 44:17.360]  one of your little Kenrod minions, Megan Kelly, you will fall. You will be broken.
[44:18.400 --> 44:29.840]  So prepare yourself, enemy. It'll all be done politically, peacefully. We're going to politically
[44:30.400 --> 44:36.000]  tear you to pieces when we're done with you. You think you're on the winning team. You think
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.880]  you're in charge. You think you're going to dominate humanity. You are going to fail.
[44:40.880 --> 44:44.800]  And when we're done, you'll be known as the Benedict Arnold. You've always been make no
[44:44.800 --> 44:54.320]  mistake, trash. Now, before I get all these clips and the latest fake polls and all the rest of it,
[44:55.680 --> 45:00.640]  will you guys bring me a keg of it in? It's in there at my desk. There's an open container
[45:00.640 --> 45:07.200]  of it because I had it in my desk yesterday back there in the control room back by dude's desk.
[45:08.400 --> 45:11.360]  That kind of got lost in translation this morning when I was scrounging around for it.
[45:12.960 --> 45:19.680]  But we put it on screen for it. Caveman is finally back at infowarstore.com.
[45:20.400 --> 45:25.680]  We've done two runs of it and it is now, according to the national manufacturer that is
[45:25.680 --> 45:29.280]  one of the top manufacturers in the country. You can't say the biggest because you can't tell
[45:29.280 --> 45:33.680]  that of the three or four top companies is the biggest organic producer. But it is now the
[45:33.680 --> 45:41.120]  number one selling bone broth formula in the United States of America. Bone broth has just
[45:41.120 --> 45:45.120]  gotten hot the last four or five years. It's the big thing with all the health nuts and
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.320]  you know, experts and the rest of us with the ancients and every culture obsessed on.
[45:49.920 --> 45:55.920]  And one reason is it's it's it's it's we have the best seller is other folks aren't able to
[45:55.920 --> 46:02.720]  even get the big labs and the big companies to be able to get enough of the high quality
[46:02.720 --> 46:08.160]  organic chicken bones because we do do it organic to be able to put it out. Chicken is the best place
[46:08.160 --> 46:15.120]  to get your bone broth. And of course, everybody knows what's in the what's in the marrow is the
[46:15.120 --> 46:20.560]  stem cells, all the rest of it. I mean, the whole thing is the perfect food. It's what our ancestors
[46:20.560 --> 46:26.560]  went for first. Everybody knows you go to a fine French restaurant, you get the bone marrow as well
[46:26.560 --> 46:33.840]  there in your there in your roasted thigh bones, the cow. But this is from chicken. And then it's
[46:33.840 --> 46:42.400]  got all this other amazing stuff in it. It's got the multi collagen complex blend from chicken and
[46:42.400 --> 46:51.440]  chicken collagen and chicken broth powder protein, alfalfa herb powder, chaga mushroom, bee pollen
[46:51.440 --> 47:00.000]  powder, turmeric root powder, and goji berry. And so much more. And it is the ultimate bone
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.720]  broth formula out there. And it is naturally chocolate flavored. It's got chocolate. That's
[47:04.720 --> 47:10.320]  the best flavor. We are working on other flavors, but they don't taste as good. And yes, it doesn't
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.880]  taste too good when we did a flavorless one. Just a word of the wise. It's it's pretty it's
[47:14.880 --> 47:22.480]  concentrated. It's hard core. And I'm very, very excited about it. And we just got a big shipment
[47:22.480 --> 47:28.880]  of it in but it will sell out again because there is a shortage in organic chicken bone that is raw.
[47:30.880 --> 47:34.160]  There is a shortage in it because they got a freeze dry it, send it there, it's got to be
[47:34.160 --> 47:41.280]  tested and then it's rendered down so you get the full quality out of it. It is amazing. And it is
[47:41.280 --> 47:45.200]  now the number one bone broth formula in the country. Bone broth obviously is very, very hot.
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.720]  And I just kept reading about it in the different literature years ago and checking out some of
[47:50.720 --> 47:53.680]  the formulas that were out there. And I said, they got a little bit of kegs of this aren't even as
[47:53.680 --> 47:58.960]  strong with the same price as I don't get people double the amount for a little bit lower or the
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.120]  same price when it's not on sale. And so out of the gates, even though it's been sold out for months,

[48:38.880 --> 48:45.600]  primal superfutes. Also, I told you we're running free shipping throughout the month of July. And
[48:45.600 --> 48:51.760]  I said 20 to 40% off on all our major nutraceuticals. The problem is I've got to stop it because
[48:51.760 --> 48:58.880]  brain force is selling out right now. So that goes back to regular price. And it'll be a while till we get more in. So
[48:58.880 --> 49:05.440]  brain force, that is no longer 30% off. Super male vitality is 30% off for female 30%. X2 30%.
[49:07.280 --> 49:13.680]  Secret 12 back in stock will keep that at 25 DNA forces back in 20%. So those are there. But I've
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.400]  had to have brain force today, go back to regular price in the next two days. I'm going to have to
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.440]  go back to full price on all those and some other items that are also at infowarstore.com.
[49:24.560 --> 49:28.480]  Because we're selling out of it, and it'll be weeks or months, when more comes in,
[49:28.480 --> 49:31.920]  sort of keep a little bit back, obviously at the regular price to help under operation.
[49:31.920 --> 49:36.080]  That's free market capitalism. But thank you all for your support. So if you want X2,
[49:36.080 --> 49:41.360]  or things like that, it is 30% off right now. But it is about to go back to the regular discount
[49:41.360 --> 49:48.080]  that's just 10%. We always discount 10%. And we do 30 or 40 or more. So infowarslife.com,

[49:59.440 --> 50:04.560]  organic mouthwash we have. And or the toothpaste that's non fluoride with the colloidal silver
[50:04.560 --> 50:08.320]  and iodine. You can get a big discount across the board when you go to all three items together
[50:08.320 --> 50:14.320]  or get the new electric toothbrush for $24.95. I guess they already lowered that too. So I guess
[50:14.320 --> 50:19.760]  they've even by itself is $19.95. It was $24.95 yesterday. So it's now $19.95. They put that
[50:19.760 --> 50:26.000]  on screen for me. So the advanced oral pack, all of it's there, simply amazing infowarslife.com.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.160]  And it's simple. You shop with patriots. We fight for America, the Second Amendment,
[50:31.360 --> 50:37.600]  basic values, religious freedom, free market. You shop with Amazon. He's sworn to destroy
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.760]  Trump, the Second Amendment, and bring in radical Islamic system. Oh, by the way, I haven't even gotten
[50:41.760 --> 50:47.600]  to this yet. I'm going to lead with this in the next segment, not the whole group of clips we've
[50:47.600 --> 50:56.960]  got in the Trump news. The UN and the EU officially are setting up a Coast Guard to not let the
[50:56.960 --> 51:02.320]  countries leave, but also bring in the Islamic. So you thought it was bad with Soros spending hundreds
[51:02.320 --> 51:08.240]  of millions every quarter to ship people in out of the Middle East. It's been said any society
[51:08.240 --> 51:13.520]  is only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near. Think about it. Our
[51:13.520 --> 51:17.920]  country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[51:17.920 --> 51:22.880]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[51:22.880 --> 51:26.960]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[51:26.960 --> 51:31.840]  from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government
[51:31.840 --> 51:36.480]  knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency. That's why you need your
[51:36.480 --> 51:42.480]  own plan for self-reliance. That's where my patriot supply comes in. Get a four-week survival

[52:10.320 --> 52:15.440]  teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers
[52:15.440 --> 52:21.280]  and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use
[52:21.280 --> 52:27.680]  their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make them
[52:27.680 --> 52:34.480]  scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down
[52:34.480 --> 52:40.720]  interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the
[52:40.720 --> 52:46.560]  police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an
[52:46.560 --> 52:53.520]  excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our
[52:53.520 --> 53:00.800]  freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle
[53:00.800 --> 53:07.600]  Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place. Water is the single most important thing

[54:27.440 --> 54:36.720]  Who are you? All right. I'm here to ask you, folks, who are you? What's
[54:36.720 --> 54:41.520]  finding you on? I think you already joined. Pro humanity, pro innovation, pro freedom,
[54:41.520 --> 54:52.640]  pro free will, pro wonderment, wide-eyed wonderment. What if I say I'm not like the others? What
[54:52.640 --> 54:58.880]  if I say I'm not your slave? Am I going to go on with your globalist operation? What if I say
[54:58.880 --> 55:09.040]  you're the pretender? What if I say I'll never surrender? Now, Peter Sutherland founded the
[55:09.040 --> 55:14.160]  European Union. You can spend hours reading his public writings, his books, where he admits he
[55:14.160 --> 55:18.880]  wants to get rid of national sovereignty, create a quote, technocracy computer system to rule the
[55:18.880 --> 55:25.280]  world. Can read him at Davos Switzerland five years ago saying they want a $100 billion per decade
[55:25.280 --> 55:32.640]  global government fund on carbon taxes alone. They want currency tax transfers on every currency
[55:32.640 --> 55:42.800]  transfer and they want well-head taxes. Now, he said we must force Europeans out of their houses
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.560]  and put the migrants in. We must advertise the Middle East and North Africa to bring in
[55:48.560 --> 55:53.440]  Muslims, not Christians, because Christians would assimilate. Christian Africans have been shown to
[55:53.440 --> 56:03.360]  assimilate quite nicely in Europe, not Muslim Africans. And so here are the headlines. Italian
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.760]  officials call for investigation of George Soros supporting NGOs migrant fleet.
[56:10.560 --> 56:14.800]  And we have Peter Sutherland in the BBC saying Europe's white, we have to get rid of the white
[56:14.800 --> 56:21.040]  people and its homogeneity. That's a quote. Well, if you want to bring in people because Europe
[56:21.040 --> 56:25.200]  didn't have any babies, that's one issue. Why bring in Muslims? Tell them keep their culture
[56:25.200 --> 56:29.200]  and then cover up all the crimes they're committing. The stabbings, the murders,
[56:29.200 --> 56:34.960]  all of it we've already covered today. The poster child in Germany, this hairdresser
[56:37.760 --> 56:41.680]  for bringing in the migrants that are really the Islamic invaders just slit his boss's
[56:41.680 --> 56:50.400]  throat. Oh, we love our Somalis. We love our Muslims. We love our Muslims. Oh, that's so good.
[56:50.400 --> 56:59.680]  Oh, that's so sweet. Now, here's the latest little gem or giblet, giblet.
[57:02.880 --> 57:06.960]  EU foreign policy chief wants European Coast Guard to protect migrants.
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.040]  They've already announced an EU army that's going to march into France, Germany, the Netherlands,
[57:11.040 --> 57:15.760]  anybody that tries to pull out. Three years ago, we broke this with Nigel Frage and others.
[57:15.760 --> 57:19.280]  They said, oh, there's no secret army. That's tyranny. We never do that. Now they're like,
[57:19.280 --> 57:22.960]  yeah, we got an army. We'll take over your country. And then they went further.
[57:22.960 --> 57:27.440]  Junker, the head of the EU, the unelected EU said, we'll bring down Trump. We'll bring down America.
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.960]  And now EU foreign policy chief wants European Coast Guard to protect migrants.
[57:36.960 --> 57:41.280]  So we're not going to have Soros bringing the illegals in. They're going to have a
[57:42.880 --> 57:46.800]  Coast Guard that brings in the Muslims. Let's go out to break with part of this clip.
[57:48.480 --> 57:55.680]  Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have accused the Coast Guard
[57:55.680 --> 58:04.000]  for abusing the migrants and sending to unknown detainee centers. Are you aware of this and did
[58:04.000 --> 58:12.000]  you discuss about it? Thank you. Just like I pointed out that they put a Hitler mustache on
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.080]  the cover of Time on Donald Trump Jr. that was subliminal. That's now been basically admitted.
[58:16.080 --> 58:20.240]  Or just like I have told you about other subliminal stuff they do. And then later it comes out that
[58:20.240 --> 58:28.400]  indeed they are doing it. You notice the EU's armies symbol. You notice the EU foreign policy
[58:28.400 --> 58:34.160]  symbol of their State Department is an upside down American flag on screen. We'll put her back
[58:34.160 --> 58:41.360]  on screen. You see that? Everything is about bringing down America. I wonder if it's even
[58:41.360 --> 58:52.720]  got 13 stripes. Let's count them when we come back. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:52.720 --> 59:02.720]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[59:02.720 --> 59:07.840]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify
[59:07.840 --> 59:13.440]  the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield. Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's
[59:13.440 --> 59:19.120]  made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[59:19.120 --> 59:25.120]  detoxifying the body and it supports the infowar. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that
[59:25.120 --> 59:30.480]  I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[59:30.480 --> 59:34.800]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your
[59:34.800 --> 59:40.240]  family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and
[59:40.240 --> 59:46.800]  as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those
[59:46.800 --> 59:51.120]  brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support
[59:51.120 --> 59:55.760]  and your prayers together we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield
[59:55.760 --> 01:00:21.760]  M4's line. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. He aligns himself with the truth and it's
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:31.120]  time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. I see your hair is burning.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:38.240]  Let me stab you with a butcher knife. Heels are filled with fire. Thanks for bringing me in and
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:53.920]  giving me a job. Oh they're so sweet. Oh they're so sweet. You know they're going to rue the day
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:00.400]  they made that uh peace over to super deluxe. I haven't checked today it was like 10 million views
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.920]  yesterday but you know that's not a big deal 10 million views. Paul and I used to on facebook
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:13.840]  just about six months ago have videos with 15 25 35 37 million views and then I did a video about it
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:21.680]  and they just went I got rid of like 25 videos just because they don't like us having those
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:29.440]  trophies it doesn't matter it still happened it still went on and again it's not about us
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:37.440]  having the most views but despite all they're trying to do to block us they can't block you and 90
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.320]  percent of the comments are more on super deluxe on facebook on youtube I mean I gotta
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.680]  then I spent hours reading them because they're so good to watch the leftist converting and going
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:57.760]  I hated Alex Jones I believed all the hype but I I went to his show and actually listened to it
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:03.120]  and it's great why did I believe it and I go to these people's handles I've checked like 50 of them
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.520]  I mean literally they have got long-term globalist minion trendy backgrounds these aren't people
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.240]  trolling saying I used to be a liberal or a trendy now I'm not it's people saying man
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:22.000]  I finally went and listened to Alex Jones and I love this guy that's victory and just on facebook
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.080]  they tell me now on one version 7.1 million views as of saturday they said they had two
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.440]  million downloads at super deluxe who knows what it is now and on youtube it's in the millions
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.600]  so you gotta let together it's well over 10 million right now and again the reason it's
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.760]  important is it's not normally our demographic of libertarians conservatives people that don't
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.560]  live in mommy's basement a lot of the comments I saw were it's true I've been in my mom's
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:57.840]  basement I'm 30 I went out of it 92% or 93% of pillory voters you can google it of sjw's that's
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:06.720]  mainstream news 93% like 92.7 in fact people won't believe me just type it in 92 plus percent of
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:16.080]  sjw's live live with their parents is the headline and they did surveys and it's just incredible
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:23.120]  to see them saying I'm breaking the conditioning it's amazing it's true I want out of my mommy's
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.920]  basement and it's okay if you live in your parents basement a lot of folks do it to save money or
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.680]  whatever in this economy I can't blame you it's just that with conservatives libertarians it's
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.880]  like 5% but let's go out to break again with the EU saying they're going to shuttle the Muslims in
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.720]  with a new coast guard which they'll also use to harry and harass EU shipping here it is migration
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.480]  amnesty international and other human right human right organizations have accused the
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:58.240]  coast guarders for abusing the migrant sentencing the tiny centers are you aware of this and did
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.920]  you discuss about it thank you you have not kissed my booty enough the reason why you are working
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:10.960]  so much with the IOM and the UNHCR to guarantee that they have access to these centers we're
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:16.000]  living conditions we will bring more in of course it'll be a night for you to improve the living
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.640]  conditions oh that's so good oh that's so sweet as I said actually as a high commissioner grandy said
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:31.360]  and I share his words to change the very same logic of the tension oh to change the logic it's not
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:36.880]  the logic you're a collapsing no one come for tourism roads shut down Muslims robbing raping
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.880]  everywhere assist we bring more and we assist ready and then they didn't they they will control
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.720]  the nation states have their own 80s but also they're saying the nation states are shipping
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.640]  our precious is about that we will stop that we have we will bring our invasion friends hands
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:01.280]  to help stop the nation migrants that manage i will wear burqa my daughter will have her weewees
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.680]  chopped off of men and it is liberal we come right back that nobody should sir will the guy
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.240]  do you remember dennis has sturt the longest-serving republican speaker of the house in history
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.040]  also the highest ranking u.s politician to be sent to prison has sturt was a small town wrestling
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.840]  coach in illinois when he was what judge thomas durkin of the federal court described as a serial
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:27.520]  child molester because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:32.000]  has sturt was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in if you can believe that
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.320]  he did go down for a legal hush money to the tune of at least 3.5 million dollars he was fined 250
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:45.040]  thousand dollars and sentenced to 15 months in prison hardly justice but now the serial child
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:51.360]  molester is free once again after serving only 13 months judge durkin also said there's nothing
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:56.160]  more disturbing than having a child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence i
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.800]  disagree there's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:06.720]  one year in prison won't see that on cnn for info wars dot com this is elwin shroyer

[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.840]  were literally like about to come on live with us and they said thunderstorm overhead and then
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:30.800]  shh uh it knocked the power out so looks like imperial troops i have entered the base but
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.600]  we will we will try to get hooked back up with the former congressman here in a moment to talk
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:42.160]  about the big picture and what's happening around the country and around the world uh but look at
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:51.680]  this look at this headline tourism up under trump collapses in europe following terror
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:58.160]  and migrant invasion and i was making the point that there are seven unvetted nations that have
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:05.520]  failed governments and somalia hasn't had a real government in decades it's beyond something out of
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:14.080]  you know dystopic sci-fi road warrior films and every day or two a somali stab somebody in europe
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:19.600]  or the u.s or canada uh or attack somebody because they're not wearing a burqa or beat somebody up
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.440]  because they're drinking beer uh or there's a new case of a woman walking her dogs right barred as
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:31.520]  an article and then she gets attacked uh because they said the dogs are unclean actually once was
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.240]  walking my dog in a park and i was in college and a muslim came over and said dogs were unclean i
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:42.320]  thought it was a joke there it is dog walker hospitalized after attacked by somalian migrant
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:49.920]  who said dogs are unclean so every time i report on somalis attacking people and not being
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.640]  integrated into our society i'm going to play the clip that the media made fun of where i said
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:02.640]  oh we love our somalis we love our muslims too we love our muslims oh they're so good
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:10.160]  oh they're so sweet there you go ladies and gentlemen but tourism up under trump collapses
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:18.320]  in europe it's down 80 something percent in the last decade and most of that is in just the last
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:28.960]  few years now you have to ask yourself why are they sacrificing everything tourism sovereignty on
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.640]  the backs of this why is the eu military announced he's going to take over the nation states because
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:42.800]  it's unelected the people want out of it why is the eu bureaucracy announcing they're going to create
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:49.440]  a new coast guard that's a navy to stop the nation states of europe that occasionally
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.680]  send back the boats coming across the Mediterranean and then land the people
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:01.200]  back in north africa or back in the middle east well i played part of the clip i'm going to play
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:07.360]  it all right now eu foreign policy chief wants a european coast guard to protect migrants
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.960]  so the european coast guard is going to get in there with the other navies and make sure
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.200]  because they openly criticize in the press conference they say some of these eu countries
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:25.040]  aren't being nice enough to the islamic invaders that the eu's been advertising to invade europe
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.240]  she had the eu openly aiding it to bring down europe and that's what the hungarian and the
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.440]  romanian presidents and the polish presidents and now other presidents are saying it bill gates said
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:41.360]  that's an invasion of europe that's what's going on in soros funds the hundred foot zodiac boats
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.480]  24 hours a day that go back and forth bringing them in and they throw people out of their own houses
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.560]  they have video of it and put the illegals into their houses
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.240]  so let's go ahead and go to that clip from the press conference
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.080]  the foreign policy chief of the european union said at press conference
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:09.200]  that fron tech's european coast guard should protect migrants tipping to cross the mediterranean
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.000]  and north africa and the middle east of europe there you go protect them from the nation states
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.520]  oh you want to get out of the eu you never voted to enter it we're going to invade you
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:23.360]  with the military we're going to start by confronting your ships the eu is a hostile power now
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:30.800]  over europe here's the clip migration amnesty international and other human right human
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:37.440]  right organizations have accused the coast guards for abusing the migrants and sending
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:44.320]  to unknown detainee centers are you aware of this and did you discuss about it thank you
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:52.560]  this is exactly the reason why we are working so much with the iom and the unhcr to guarantee that
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:14:00.240]  they have access to these centers where living conditions appear to be inhuman to improve the
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:07.840]  living conditions of the migrants to protect their lives and their rights as i said actually as a
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:13.920]  high commissioner grant they said and i share his words to change the very same logic of the
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:22.480]  tension uh which is not the logic the european union or the unsystem uh follows and to assist
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:29.200]  the stranded migrants which are already inside libya uh in all possible ways in humanitarian
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:35.520]  terms but also with assisted volunteers the un goes into berma and slaughters 10 000 people for
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.880]  their land they go into africa do the same thing but again they're saying the eu and the un work
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.080]  together under the framework against the nation states of europe and they're quote not following
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.480]  our system so they're going to show you how to follow their system they're going to advertise
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.040]  that europe's open they're going to advertise there's free money free housing and free women
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.480]  that's advertised they're going to bring them in and let islamic clerics lead them to not assimilate
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:07.760]  just like linda sarsour says and then to carry out jihad and they call it sexual jihad raping
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:14.240]  women and then eu dirtbags like peter southerland and his minions are going to quarterback the whole
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:28.000]  operation here it is we have and i have personally heard uh from uh migrants that managed across
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:35.440]  stories of slavery uh inhuman conditions of men and women in particular women uh that nobody should
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.440]  uh not only live but nobody should even listen to uh so the work the european union is doing
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.560]  with the un agencies with the international uh angios is exactly to protect the migrants
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:53.520]  try to protect the migrants and we're asking our libyan friends to help us helping the
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.840]  international organizations to have full access to improve the living condition okay so there you
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.840]  have the eu saying of european countries don't pick up muslims from africa and the middle east
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.480]  coming across the Mediterranean that their ships are going to start stopping them and then helping
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:16.080]  the muslims come into europe under the un auspices this is the un and the eu taking over europe now
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.760]  former congressman ron paul has been warning of global government for decades and now it's here
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:28.000]  and as europe tries to pull out of the eu and as european countries try to reassess their sovereignty
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.760]  the eu is threatening to march in their eu military and it's beginning with their eu navy
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:41.440]  saying they're going to start basically stopping the ships from returning people this is outrageous
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.760]  this is a great place to start with ron paul uh mr paul you warned of this a long time ago doctor
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.920]  yeah we shouldn't be surprised it was set up uh a lot of people even predicted this way back in
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.520]  1945 when they started this mess but you know in a way it's similar to what we fight here at home
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.480]  uh because most of the sovereignty was supposed to be left with the states and not with the federal
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.960]  government but we fight that all the time and we've been losing that battle they run everything at the
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.680]  federal level but now federal governments and right now we're talking about european governments
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.760]  they have sacrificed too much of their liberties and it wasn't an accident it wasn't an unintended
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:25.280]  consequence it was an intended consequence of the of the people like soros and the other
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.800]  individuals who believe in world government but the big problem is it's not a voluntary world
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:36.720]  government it's a world government based on authoritarianism and ruthlessness and control
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:42.400]  and the destruction of the sovereignty of the individual as well as the individual countries
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.160]  and that's what we're facing today it's going to get a lot worse but it's great that some of these
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.200]  countries are finally saying hey maybe we ought to stand up to this but uh it's not going to go away
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:58.560]  easily i know you're not about getting credit the people have to realize that being one person in
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.400]  the right against a sea of lies ends up historically being effective and people should really take
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:12.800]  heart how far we've come exposing authoritarian crony capitalism and globalism the true force on
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:19.040]  this planet back when you first went to congress in the 80s for a stint and later back in the 90s
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:23.760]  you routinely didn't get any cosponsors now many of your bills are passed most people know the
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:30.480]  federal reserve is quasi public private they're aware of all this take dr. michael kaufman that
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:38.080]  died last month he was the first person to expose the jenna 21 and global zoning and global standards
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.960]  being created by corporations to control nation states all of that now being exposed trump pulling
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:49.760]  out of the carbon tax of the climate accords the tpp can you speak as a true visionary trailblazer
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:57.600]  about where you see the state of the world now and the positives well i think we're coming to a
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:04.080]  climactic and it's going to be very dangerous uh but the ducks are lining up that people are realizing
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.240]  how their liberties are being undermined the europeans want to be europeans and they don't
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:15.360]  want to be run by international uh in government so i think if you just look casually at the political
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.560]  situation around the world it looks like we we haven't accomplished much we're worse often ever
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:26.400]  but if you look at what i think you're alluding to is the intellectual fight going on the ideological
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:31.760]  fight and that's where we're having influence uh you know many people know that i speak a lot
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:38.400]  in college campuses and in spite of the reports you get from college campuses how bad cultural uh
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.160]  marxism is there's still a lot of people on the campus a lot of young people who are starting
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:49.360]  to realize they're paying these bills and there's a wake-up call for the young people too because
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.160]  they're getting out with all they have by living up to this they're getting out with all this debt
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:20:00.720]  but i think we're living at a time like it was uh like the soviets uh we're ending in the 80s and
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.920]  it was coming to an end but nobody believed the soviet system could collapse overnight and have
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:14.320]  an amazing change and yet i think we're at the end of this interventionism this world empire
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:21.200]  making uh you know cany and economic central banking uh and and the more difficult it gets
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.520]  for those who are in charge the more ruthless they get so we have a big battle ahead of us
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.840]  we're in the midst of the battle but i think there i think we win because their system
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.640]  doesn't work that's why we beat communism not because we had more nukes and not because we had
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:40.560]  a nuclear war it was a totally failed system and i think those who are defending what we have today
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.360]  are defending a system that they can't salvage that's why there's a stalemate in congress they
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.720]  haven't given up on it they think they can tinker around with government medicine not realizing
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.320]  that the end is here and as soon as we recognize that the better but uh i think that's where we're
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:01.840]  winning but we have a ways to go i agree it's the best of times worst of times the political elites
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:07.920]  have dug in in europe in asia in africa in latin america and in here from venezuela you know what
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.920]  we see happening in ijeria to what's happening in the middle east what's happening in the uk and the
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:19.760]  empire of corrupt crony capitalism is striking back ally with radical islam ally with other
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.400]  collectivist models but it's failing so when we hear we have the most unproductive congress
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.160]  in 164 years it was good to be unproductive blocking obama now that trump is trying to
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:35.120]  repeal obama care with your son senator paul and is trying to cut taxes and is trying
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.920]  in my view to save the economy they are really being obstructionist and have their heels dug
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:48.560]  in i mean is that basically what i got from what you said yeah that's it but i think we're we're
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.480]  weakest and where we don't do the best job is we know what's wrong we know what has to go and uh
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:00.320]  there's a good group speaking out against it but what is not readily apparent is what do you
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.040]  substitute for it and that's why we have to have to emphasize the principles of liberty
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.080]  and making this an individual thing and liberty comes to individuals and what are the principles
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.760]  of private property and sound money so to substitute you know most people in this country know that
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.880]  obama care failed it is failed no matter whether they believe it there or not it's always going to
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.560]  fail but we don't have enough people in the country willing to you know they don't understand and
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:32.800]  realize if they want good medical care and they have to you know admit the truth government medical
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:40.400]  care like obama care just doesn't work so our biggest job is to make it very clear what we believe
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:46.160]  in and what we need and also that you can't tinker with what we have if you and i were in charge
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:50.320]  of the federal reserve we can't do any better in charge of the federal reserve we won't get rid
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.840]  of the federal reserve exactly tell them why you have markets so you don't want you don't want
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.880]  better uh you know managers i remember in high school they used to talk about all we need is
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.520]  a businessman ahead of the post office and we're still talking about that we need a businessman
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.720]  running medical care now we we don't need we didn't don't need bureaucrats no we don't need a dollar
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.960]  48 going to bezos for every package these ships from taxpayers to undercut the rest of the free
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:22.480]  market we need him to sink or swim and behind all these big giant monopolies we always find
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:28.880]  government backing it up it's totally disgusting like carlo slim a foreigner making 10 billion
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:34.480]  dollars in profit in the eight years of obama on the stinking obama phone dr paul let me ask you
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:40.400]  this question then i agree intellectually there is a firestorm of awakening as collectivism again
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.560]  proves it's a nightmare scenario and as people that bought into it find that it's a fraud but
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:49.680]  what about the new talking point that i've seen from congressman quickly i've seen from a congresswoman
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:55.040]  maxine waters i've seen it from all of them i even heard howard stern randomly i was tuning
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.240]  through the dial yesterday and he said you don't talk to russians and and no one's allowed to talk
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:06.240]  to them the new talking point is quote bob bear said it on cnn they're all saying it if you talk
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:12.400]  to a russian period you're a spy and should be arrested uh i mean that is a new word for word
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:20.000]  talking point with cnn having hosts saying quote we're at war with russia we need to you know attack
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.840]  them there is this hysteria where the dying globalist program is pointing at you and me and
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.200]  i may have said this about you uh trump that we somehow get our orders uh from the russians
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.120]  this is so dangerous where is this going it's globalism that's the outside force isn't it
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:43.600]  yeah i say and uh these are the same people who condemn us for even saying that we ought to at
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.680]  least uh trade with and talk with a country like russia uh these are the same people who love the
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.160]  soviets you know they this group of people you mentioned they were they championed the soviets
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:25:00.000]  you know we were close allies in many things and even in that system i don't think that uh
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.760]  kennedy did the wrong thing when we had the confrontation over cuba that they at least
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.880]  talked that we didn't exchange nuclear weapons there are times when you do talk to even some
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.920]  of these bad people but that's we're not dealing with the soviets they're they're they're accusing us
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:22.800]  of talking to russians is if they are worse than the soviets and uh they're just uh they're just
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:29.120]  very fearful they're losing and they're thrashing out and they have to they don't they can't defend
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.040]  their positions because they're totally failing so they have to uh destroy our viewpoints and
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.280]  showing that we don't care we don't care about poor people we don't care about sick people
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:46.000]  and that's all they have but uh if if we can present our case in a very positive fashion what
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.960]  what should be substituted for what we have because there will well we already have the
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.560]  vacuum that is the problem there's a vacuum out there uh in washington and it's just a struggle
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.600]  for power and that's why some of the republican leadership are pretty pretty weak i mean they
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.960]  don't offer much difference uh because uh you know you've seen the republicans over these many
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:12.720]  decades uh just think back when we had prescription drug program with a complete republican
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.400]  sure the republican leadership help write i mean help write obama care and of course
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.960]  as a medical doctor you've exposed that with precision in the last few minutes we have sir
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.280]  looking big picture then you've traveled the world and we see the libertarian awakening
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.160]  in eastern europe that again you help start not trying to blow smoke at you we've been over there
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.760]  our reporters have been there you're a rock star over in europe that is that signifies that humanity
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.320]  really wants freedom and the more people have been under communism or socialism the more they
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:47.040]  recognize that the american free market system never fully realized is still much better than
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.080]  what we face so so rallying the troops out there i think what you're saying is we're at a crossroads
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:58.960]  there's a vacuum every person has to be more involved in than ever waking people up being
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.920]  engaged supporting independent media like ron paul liberty report and what you're doing and
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.640]  understanding we're turning the tide but we're in a very very dangerous climate because the
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:16.880]  authoritarians are cornered and are flailing yeah and i think uh that if people are offered and i
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.960]  know this for young people if they're offered freedom and responsibility and prosperity
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.200]  and peace they're going to accept it but i saw a right up the other day of a poll made that i was
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:33.040]  fascinated with because i believe it to be true that one of the another one of the many reasons
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:40.160]  why hillary lost was the fact that he was construed as a militant uh an authoritarian who was a promoter
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.800]  of war and uh that trump came across much better because he says why do we have to provoke russia
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.640]  you know uh and i don't like it when he sort of drifts away from that position but he was the one
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.200]  that represented those of us who were sure they're bullying him back into that that's why they're
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.520]  saying the new talking point is we're not allowed to even talk to russia beyond even the worst cold
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:08.240]  war then let me ask you this pulling back where do you expect this authoritarianism to go because
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:15.520]  it's only intensifying yeah well that's uh that's hard to tell but i think we're more likely to see
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:21.600]  a lot of violence before we see uh the acknowledgement that our side is winning and they they will
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:28.000]  start backing off uh so i think the the whole thing has to come down so they so they never
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.640]  fixed communism it had that it had to collapse so i think our system has to collapse and that's why
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.880]  people should be prepared and there's always a being prepared you know for your own safety and
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:43.600]  your i agree we only got a minute left two quick questions do you think the e will go down before
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.560]  the united states being more socialist a and b it seems like he's not perfect but you know he's
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.200]  embattled right now and is carrying the flag and you know to some extent for americana it seems like
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.800]  you've warmed a little bit more to trump you know i think that the europeans will go down whether
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.200]  they dissolve i think that what they'll do is reestablish uh their countries again i always
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:08.320]  argued when they were starting the e you was i don't see how it could work because i thought well
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:13.680]  you know it's not uh at least we had one we were supposed to at one time have one uh one language
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:19.280]  but over there i never thought the italians would get along with the spanish and this sort of thing
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.680]  and instead of recognizing their individuality they were going to push them to share these
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:29.280]  thoughts what about trump i always predict well i i think trump is up against the wall because the
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:35.920]  authoritarians are there i'm afraid that the neocons are still in style and uh he has a few
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:42.240]  people in his administration that i don't particularly trust because i think they're too close to the
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:47.600]  neocons but it's going to be up to him to make the decision and even though that he might have to
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:53.600]  give in to them a little bit uh he he has to stand firm but they're all around him they're every place
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:59.200]  and you can't cave into the uh new york times and the washington exactly ron paul thank you

[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:39.280]  natural lime essence and naturally carbonated water from a spring in the mexican mountains
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:45.600]  actually just brought this bottle in here because it matches the background i was drinking and i
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:51.760]  thought why have it down here why not just show the magic bottle brought you by tapachiko
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:34:12.720]  uh bomb bomb bomb it's right in the desert happy tapachiko it goes right to heaven in my belly

[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:40.720]  i have to suckle them all right let me stop right there by the way tapachiko is not a sponsor
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:47.120]  they ought to be i first drank this in mexico like 20 years ago and it's been in texas about 10 years
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.440]  but the lime was never here and popular about five years ago and now you can get everywhere this is
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:35:03.200]  the best drink ever right here i probably drank 10 of these a day anyway so stop that now uh let's
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:09.760]  get serious here ladies and gentlemen that was a powerful ron paul interview wasn't it
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:19.840]  one reason i've been in a better mood is i have 100 quit drinking 100 and i'm about
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:25.600]  i'm i'm i'm quite a ways into no drinking and i've been exercising more and i even though i'm not a
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.760]  heavy drinker i think drinking messes up my sleep patterns and so i just sleep better when i don't
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:39.440]  drink period i exercise better so that's one reason i'm being a little bit goofy is this is what
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:45.600]  happens when i'm completely 100 sober i thought i'd drink on air but you know what i mean it
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.480]  affects your neurological systems if you drink a bottle of wine at night the next day you got a
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:57.040]  headache you're kind of grumpy yeah brain fog even if you are taking brain force and bio true
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:04.240]  selenium from info wars life dot com you see this is what my voice really sounds like now
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:10.400]  unless i kind of talk fast and try to talk in a higher pitch voice then it kind of sounds like this
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.600]  which is scary because i'm wondering what my voice is going to sound like someday
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.040]  sometimes at night now i'll be out in an event or out at friends houses and they'll say does it
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:29.760]  hurt when you talk because by nighttime my voice is really told like so we may get to the point
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.680]  where i'm communicating on air like uh who's the physicist steven honking who talks to the robot
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.880]  but maybe we'll just do that hell they're already given the trips brain chips i reported on that
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.200]  like 15 years ago people didn't believe it then sure enough it came out the exact type of brain
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.840]  chips we were talking about were being rolled out first as quote anti ptsd and then anti depression
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:37:00.240]  but the truth is they're just getting everybody ready for biomechanical soldiers and the cia has
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:04.240]  even admitted the washington post through cartoons and popular culture they're preparing
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:11.440]  everyone for a microchipped future and suddenly from fox news to abc news we have news clips where
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:21.440]  they go soon everyone will have a microchip that's just the way it is just like oh everything you're
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.160]  doing is being surveilled your appliances are watching and listening to you but that makes
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:34.720]  alex jones even more kooky that he predicted it all specifically exactly as it would happen and i'd
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:42.880]  love to give myself credit that i had a big fat juicy palantir or crystal ball or oracles orb
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.200]  in my hands but i didn't
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:52.720]  in 1977 the pentagon developed a plan that was declassified in 2000
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.520]  it was reclassified in 2002
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.480]  i put it in my book to set into tyranny free online now out of print
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.080]  and they said to save the earth and finally have no more crime we're going to get everybody
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:13.600]  progressively into computers and then smaller devices and then brain implants and retinal
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:20.080]  implants and then finally we will live in tanks from birth and our own body heat will heat the
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:27.280]  computer systems as batteries and we will all live a virtual reality life you may have heard of
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:35.920]  that it's called the matrix it came out in 1999 that was art imitating a DARPA plan not
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:44.800]  the other way around we're not imitating art now with this stuff coming out this was always the
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:50.560]  plan and was cooked up and i'm not saying we're going to specifically go that way but that's
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.680]  what they have cooked up they have all these articles about oh in a thousand years you'll
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:01.600]  live in a tank and have an avatar virtual body no they plan to do it as soon as they can
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.160]  they've already got robots that are controlled by your cerebral cortex and the rest of it but
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.280]  they plan to then you convince you to live in a tank and then have that transfer because you know
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.080]  the tank will have a lower carbon footprint so they want to herd you into the carbon footprint
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.920]  and then you will you will opt into going into the tank because there'll be all these tax incentives
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:28.880]  and things if you do and then you'll have access to all the computer programs and things that'll
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:37.120]  give you unlimited ecstasy and unlimited vr and that's why time warner has a slogan through their
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:44.480]  trendy division they know nobody's watching cnn anymore so they have come out and they have
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:51.120]  things like super deluxe where they say their slogan is nothing's real it's all virtual reality
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:57.280]  telling you that this universe isn't real that something else created it there is no god but
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:03.200]  something superhuman created this and the mathematical and radio telescopes show in the dark
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:09.840]  matter there's an outside force many times more powerful holding all of this together and holding
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:20.240]  gravity artificially uh in place and that the elites want to have you break out of the vr
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.720]  by entering their new universe i think somebody
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:33.760]  somebody i read about before was in a reality and wanted to break away and create their own
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:41.280]  reality and said i am god i am more beautiful i am greater and god said oh really you're stuck
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:49.120]  on this planet and i'm gonna put myself back to day one i'm gonna put a creature on the planet
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:56.480]  in my image i'm gonna put you up against my larva and let's see if you can beat the larval form of
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:04.400]  god if you want to go from a scientific perspective that's what the elites actually believe they believe
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.800]  lucifer is the advanced god it's giving them them the awful world technology to build their
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:14.960]  breakaway civilization but they've got to kill all of us first because we're profane and ugly and bad
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.440]  our fellow humans believe they have to merge with machines and merge with animals and merge
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:26.480]  with other life to create the super creature that ai is going to weave together and that once they've
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:34.000]  done that they will then have this this breakaway transcendent moment and then they'll become god
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:43.440]  when what is really going on is hiding in plain view right there in every ancient text not just
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:56.320]  the bible so breakaway creation tells the creator i'm god i'm gonna overthrow you and god says you
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:05.840]  can't even overthrow something made in my image you can't even overthrow people running around in
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:17.840]  caves let's see how it works out with them and now you see what they built to try to capture us
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:26.080]  is present on this planet but the devil couldn't even build himself he had to get us
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:33.280]  to build our own cage but because we built our own cage we built backdoors into it
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:40.000]  Lucifer thinks he built backdoors we subconsciously built backdoors
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:46.720]  do you think the devil knows he was just sent here to test us
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.120]  no they're too arrogant you see the spirit of the devil and the enemy they're too arrogant
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.000]  to ever admit they're being beaten they're too arrogant to ever admit they're up against
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:06.320]  intelligences hundreds of times more powerful than theirs the devil can't even take on embryonic
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:17.200]  humanity and beat us and that's these people's god a god that wants to kidnap and rape children
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.960]  a god that wants to mutate children a god that wants to kill humans and make us ugly because
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:30.160]  it's so insecure and pathetic and that's the spirit of the world it is the spirit of the devil
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.760]  and whether you believe in the devil or not the devil believes in you and it is manifest it is real
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.400]  but there is no god there is no nothing we're on a planet nothing's fantastical play play your
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:50.160]  video games play your vr play your fantasy football just don't be in the real world because
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:56.480]  it's not real no it's real your great-grandparents were real you're real your children are real
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:02.000]  your husband's real your wife's real your experience is real the stars are real the moon's real
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.560]  the the the fish in the sea the birds in the air the plants it's all real
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:14.080]  and they want to tell you that the computers and the virtual realities that they've created
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:22.480]  that are nothing but electricity zeros and ones in a false system a dream they want to tell you a
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:30.400]  dream is real and make you believe the dream can deliver you into nirvana when it is the reality
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:41.280]  of the living dream the genetic dream the shared experience over space time with our species
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:47.760]  time traveling through our genetic replications into the future
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:58.320]  and no one will tell you any of this the enemy hates me because i know the information
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.440]  and the enemy's panicking because the information is being opened up now
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:12.880]  and they're in a rush to try to get as many people into their meat grinder as they can
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:18.320]  as many people into their hollywood msm sports combine
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:30.080]  they said 30 years ago by 2025 they'd have more combat robots and more combat aircraft that were
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:36.400]  autonomous drone working on ai algorithms than they would human and the pentagon is on schedule
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:47.040]  autonomous robots programmed by our loving friends who can't even contain their psychotic forms
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.000]  like jeff bezos mark zucker
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.080]  and the rest of these people
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:03.200]  they have turned themselves over and they are beast
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.440]  and what does zucker say about you he goes i can't believe the users trust me
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.840]  they're so stupid they're dumb efforts
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:23.440]  and he walks around glaring the most evil weak pathetic fallen
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:31.120]  and golem like creature with his own employees on their knees before him in giant ceremonies
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.160]  and they don't even know they are on their knees bound
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.360]  and their souls gagged with hoods over their heads
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:46.880]  being fed whatever he lets into the keyhole
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:56.800]  and he walks like a god you know god zucker you had to put them into a false reality
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:01.920]  so they would believe you are a god you're not even a man

[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:06.080]  like the ocean yellow gray ocean stretching out into infinity something very spiritual and magic
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:12.640]  about the desert all right let's get serious because i'm going to take your phone calls in the next
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:19.120]  hour paul joseph watson's hosting the fourth and i've got so many clips and so much news i just
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:24.080]  committed to myself to start trying to cover more of the news but it is fun to pontificate about
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:30.560]  intergalactic infestations isn't watch the media have fun with that but they always back off real
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.640]  quick because everybody instinctively already knows don't they before i go any further let's get
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:45.040]  into el presidente trump totally delivered i just tell the truth here he's delivered on breaking
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:50.320]  the back of globalism getting the economy going optimism so many things the the wall has begun
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.480]  in texas 63 percent to decrease the illegals coming across it was 40 something it's it's incredible
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:03.360]  but the federal reserve has announced they're going to massively start increasing interest rates
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:08.240]  the next year bigger than they had said that started hurting the economy that started cutting
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:14.720]  back factory orders and that started hurting the dollar and then they're trying to say oh look trump's
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:20.080]  whole agenda is in trouble if he can't repeal obama care right now it took obama two years
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.440]  to get it passed and then four more years to get implemented we've just been enjoying it the last
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:31.440]  two years two and a half years the nightmare that is the can't keep your doctor increased prices
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.920]  big insurance companies laughing all the way to the bank bank but trump has come out and just said
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:42.160]  listen let the whole thing just fail and he's absolutely right and then let the states deal
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:46.880]  with it because we had problems before just like with education with so much government money in it
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:52.480]  in it drove up prices and now it's big government and big corporations controlling healthcare it's
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:59.760]  even worse the answer is just killing let's go ahead and roll that clip we've had a lot of victories
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:06.800]  but we haven't had a victory in healthcare we're disappointed i am very disappointed because again
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.880]  even as a civilian for seven years i've been hearing about healthcare and i've been hearing about
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:19.760]  repeal and replace and obama care is a total disaster some states had over a 200 increase a
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:25.440]  200 percent increase in their premiums and their deductibles are through the roof it's an absolute
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:33.520]  disaster and i think you'll also agree that i've been saying for a long time let obama care fail
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:39.440]  and then everybody's going to have to come together and fix it and come up with a new plan and a
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.880]  plan that's really good for the people with much lower premiums much lower cost and much better
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:50.400]  protection i've been saying that mike i think you'll agree for a long time let obama care fail
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.360]  it'll be a lot easier and i think we're probably in that position where we'll just let obama care
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:59.920]  fail we're not going to own it i'm not going to own it i can tell you the republicans are not going
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:04.800]  to own it we'll let obama care fail and then the democrats are going to come to us and they're going
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:10.160]  to say how do we fix it how do we fix it he's amazing how do we come up with a new plan uh he
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.400]  said when he got inaugurated he said uh it's the right thing to do they own it but i'm going to try
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:20.000]  to repeal it but if they block me with the republican establishment then they're going to own it but
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.360]  i'm going to do my best to repeal it and he worked with rand paul and others to get a better bill

[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:57.280]  that their whole system's coming down but they're gonna try to counter strike uh trump is good but
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:03.040]  his back's against the wall i mean ron paul starting to really champion trump and i've been
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:08.400]  seeing ron paul sitting out positive tweets every day about trump because you cannot deny man he's
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:16.960]  the real deal i've never seen ron paul support anybody hardly anybody was pure enough for him
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:23.920]  and i mean you heard him say trump may even have to compromise with the neocons or they're
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.800]  gonna destroy him i mean paul's even like you might compromise and he's never talked like that
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:35.680]  because he knows they got their knives and they're sharpening those suckers right now
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:43.440]  now the big news is trump says hey i tried to repeal obama care i tried to give you a better
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:52.400]  version it's double premiums of many states uh the different fines and fees and the copay and the
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:02:00.240]  deductibles are exploding my parents in the first year of obama care they had never used their
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:04.320]  insurance in 30 something years since they had that insurance they've been married four to six years
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.480]  and they doubled it in the first year and then it kept going up so they went and shopped around
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:15.280]  and got something that still cost a lot more than it used to but was less than the blue cross blue
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:23.760]  shield they had previously and i mean they doubled it in one year and then my dad had to go out in
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:28.160]  the marketplace under obama care and wait and then try to sit there and get it and haggle around
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:36.560]  my family insurance went up about 60 the first year and then i went out and shopped around and
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.160]  got something that still costs more than it used to i i mean and and we don't use our insurance
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:48.080]  i'm going for a doctor's appointment or a yearly check up or to get you know a root canal done
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.320]  or something i don't i just pay with a credit card you pay with a debit card pay with cash
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.680]  because i don't want to mess with the insurance companies i go in to get the prescription every
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:01.760]  once in a while you know for antibiotics or whatever uh and uh you know when it's a hundred

[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:13.040]  with the insurance company well not anymore ladies and gentlemen and it just gets more and more and
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:19.520]  more and more and more and more and more expensive as more and more money's pumped in forcibly making
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:25.760]  you buy health care from the big insurance companies that wrote obama care with the republican
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:31.680]  and democratic establishment and you know obama care is going down there are some states where
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:37.520]  there's only one company that will even come into the market and then they've got computers all running
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:41.360]  the health care you get to be sure that they can still make money by not giving you care rationing
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:47.440]  care that's death panels that's in the computer algorithms they just call it bioethics you've

[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:58.160]  and speaker of the house in the same sentence i disagree there's nothing more disturbing than a

[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:26.880]  over again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance all to make them march

[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:56.400]  first time callers today on this Tuesday edition is 800-259-9231 i am your host alex jones after i
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:02.160]  take some phone calls i'm gonna just boom boom boom go through a hundred article headlines or so
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:06.240]  that's something i've just got to do and then i'm gonna go back through some of the more important
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:11.760]  stories a little bit more but first off genrich says boost economy with very large tax cut
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:19.600]  or real danger and that's absolutely true we see the federal reserve raising interest rates
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:24.640]  to try to dampen the trump recovery they admit they're doing something they wouldn't do under
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:30.400]  obama and remember low interest rates now under trump's policies are getting loans going to small
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:36.720]  businesses and individuals there's been basically loan freezing since 2008 for the general public
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:42.720]  so say what you want trump's trying to turn the economy on and then i look at the 401ks up
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:49.120]  the stock market up and new jobs up and then i see people rooting against trump it is just crazy
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:55.840]  we had ron paul on last hour he said trump overalls doing a good job but his back is against the wall
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.600]  and they're trying to start wars it's getting crazy
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  so let's go to that genrich club do we represent prosperity economic growth higher take home pay
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:17.440]  more jobs or not uh trump you just said you just said him uh the president a minute ago talking
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:22.160]  about what he wants to do to make america great again i think that he's in the right general
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:27.120]  direction i personally believe they ought to do as much as they can on health care right now
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:32.800]  but they shouldn't spend the whole rest this year on one issue they have also got to pass i think
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:39.920]  by thanksgiving and get signed into law by thanksgiving a very large tax cut uh retroactively
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:45.440]  designed back to january one to make sure that we have enough economic growth in 2018
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.400]  the republicans can run as the party of prosperity of jobs of higher take home pay
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:56.000]  and of economic growth and i would i would say the highest focus ought to be on getting the tax
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.360]  bill through because if we don't have economic growth next year i think we're in real danger of
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:07.520]  having speaker nancy polosum in 2019 if we do get this economic growth i think frankly we'll
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:11.520]  probably get reelected that's what's so annoying about genrich he's probably one of the smartest
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:19.200]  people in washington he knows everything and he's a globalist i just have to add every time what he
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:25.200]  says is true when he's on our side but when the wind looks like it's blowing the other way he's on
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:29.680]  the globalist side the good news is you notice he's on our side right now because he knows we're
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:36.320]  winning the tide of globalism is going out harvard business review harvard law journal financial
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:43.040]  times of london they're all admitting it but while we're busy all fighting with each other
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:48.480]  and the globalists want to kill the american system because it competes with their crony system
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:54.400]  elon musk has come out i want to go to this clip and said listen we've got to have laws on ai right
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:59.680]  now we've got to get control of this we're already making most of the aircrafts autonomous the combat
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:08.000]  drones autonomous within just seven years now that's how far 2025 is half the military isn't
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.640]  going to be soldiers it's going to be combat robots and believe me the stuff you've seen is
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:17.920]  nothing compared to what they've got that's in the news today and again the globalists the technocrats
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:21.440]  love this because they believe they'll be able to program and control it there are already hundreds
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:27.600]  of computer languages we know of where the computers are designing each other just just just the
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.840]  short circuit just the computers going haywire or glitching out
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:39.840]  or getting out of our control is and then you add genetic engineering and you add all of the
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:45.520]  cracking the atoms and they've been making black holes for 40 years japan did it first the us has
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:50.880]  been doing as well at least japan says they did it first on record fission fusion they've created
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:55.920]  artificial suns and laboratories this stuff's all on youtube it's all on pbs you tell the average
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:01.360]  person they think you're all that's buck rogers no that's happening now we're in the 21st century
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:04.640]  the future's here it's just not equally distributed
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:14.720]  and i talk about how they're splicing humans with aquatic re-entrance mammals how they're
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:19.440]  splicing humans with fish that's in mainstream news and then they just make a joke and go
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:21.440]  why is alex racist against mermaids
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:30.560]  now again artificial sun could start creating its own gravity that was large enough to suck in
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:37.680]  more matter and then cause a chain reaction creating a black hole a strangelet or other
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:43.760]  phenomenon that would basically take depending on the equations minutes weeks months to cause
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:49.280]  a chain reaction of enough mass you never know the mass was forming you'd have no way to stop it
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:55.600]  and by the time it was noticeable you'd have a few minutes until the whole planet was sucked into
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:01.760]  a black hole just like you saw on the latest remake of star trek the the second one that's exactly
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:07.120]  what a black hole artificially created that got purchased that got a toehold would look like
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:13.280]  when vulcan gets destroyed this is what we're facing we are about to go to the next level
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:18.640]  but we've got to come together to survive it the globalist claim they want a world government to
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:23.600]  stop us killing each other but they're the ones proliferating the weapons they're the ones creating
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:30.480]  and and and absolutely wild wild westing all this they're the ones that gave north korea nuclear
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:35.760]  weapons they don't want a global government to empower people they want a global government to
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:41.280]  absolutely enslave everybody and they're so psychotic and so demonic they can't help but like
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:49.520]  pyromaniacs play with this stuff i'm all in i got four children
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:59.440]  i am so selfish i want humanity to make it people think that's the the opposite of selfish like
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:04.080]  it's all about me and my life and i don't care once i die i don't care once i die i'm a human
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:10.800]  all my ancestors all my future progeny if we fail i fail everybody before me failed you care about
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:16.800]  some dumb football game how about the species how about all the incredible things we've done we're
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:23.840]  awesome don't the globalists tell you you're you're not sick of them bunch of damn devil
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:30.080]  warspers excuse me we're gonna we're gonna get you you just know that right now you piece of crap
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:37.440]  you globalist i know who you are get out of the way right now get behind us satan
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:45.120]  the name of jesus christ you get behind us satan you get behind us because when we're not around
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:53.680]  you'll have nothing you loser let's go ahead and go to the Elon Musk club here it is talked about
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:59.760]  workforce today but they asked me our robot's gonna take our jobs everybody's jobs in the future
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:09.760]  and how how much do you see our intelligence coming into the the workplace um well first of all i
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:16.480]  think on the artificial intelligence front um you know i i have exposure to the very the very
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:25.600]  most cutting-edge um ai and i think people should be really concerned about it um i keep
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:32.320]  sounding the long bell but until people see like robots going down the street killing people like
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:39.200]  they don't know how to react you know because it seems so ethereal um and um i think we should be
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:46.000]  really concerned about ai and i think we should this is ai is a rare case where i think we need
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:52.720]  to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive um because i think by the time we are reactive in
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:17:01.120]  ai regulation it's too late um and normally the way regulations are set up is that a whole bunch of
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:09.040]  bad things happen there's a public outcry the and then after many years a regulatory agency is set up
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:17.200]  to regulate that industry um there's a bunch of opposition from companies who don't like being
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:26.480]  told what to do by regulators um and it takes forever um that that in the past has been bad
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:35.280]  but not um something which represented a uh you know a fundamental risk to the existence of
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:42.880]  civilization ai is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization um in a way that
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:54.320]  car accidents uh airplane crashes um faulty drugs uh or bad food were were not they were not
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:18:00.560]  they were harmful to to uh instead of individuals within society of course but they were not harmful
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:07.920]  to society as a whole um ai is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization that's
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:13.040]  right and i don't think people fully appreciate all right now let let me break down why just from
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:21.840]  one position even if ai isn't malevolent the humans controlling it now with enough data can predict
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:28.240]  the future with total precision through mass movement and then guide stimuli into that algorithm to
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:33.440]  control the future then you realize the globalists believe they're going to transmit machines under
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:39.760]  god but the spirit of the world says they must break away from humanity before they can transcend
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:46.160]  as bill joy warned everybody 17 years ago in wired magazine the owner of some micro systems
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:49.760]  he went to the globalist meeting all the other tech folks agreed we're gonna have to just kill
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:54.480]  everybody you're not gonna be allowed to play video games you're gonna play video games that have
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.080]  vr until it's too late once the binary weapons have already been put into you but psychologically
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:04.560]  already be so poisoned you'll never even know or care that's what people are going crazy they're
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:10.000]  losing their humanity the mental illness is increasing because we're already under it there's
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.040]  already self-aware computers there's already ai beyond it's 30 40 years ahead of what we
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:21.360]  even think and then by the month it just exponentially is intensifying and that's why uh people that
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:26.400]  are for all this like schmidt eric schmidt says ha you don't know about alphabet our new system
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:32.320]  it's so advanced i ha ha governments are licking their lips and wishing they got what i got because
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:40.400]  from their perspective we're already like the nursery or something or like a bug and you know
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:44.240]  they're like well we might step on you we might not this is depends on how you behave we're so
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:49.680]  busy maybe you just sit over there while we're over here and so there's a big race to get more
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:55.040]  advanced ai to see who's going to be the first god as ray Kurzweil said he doesn't believe in god
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:20:00.880]  not yet so there you go a bunch of selfish psychotic narcissists in control of artificially
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:06.880]  intelligent machines it's already here they're already killing everybody in slow motion by now

[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:22.160]  we're here sending out our sos i have one more point i want to make on the whole elon musk situation
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:30.400]  no one here but elon musk is obviously an engineer genius major entrepreneur major inventor
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:36.160]  and he's dead on target that humanity faces an existential threat from ai it's the number one
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:41.440]  threat to humanity but if you read globalist publications that the elite read they have
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.920]  admitted for decades that ai would be the new life form that it would be far superior and
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:52.080]  replaces well i don't think just because silicon is able to mathematically dwarf the human brain
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:57.760]  that it makes it advanced and the silicon is taking all of our activity and all that we're
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:04.240]  doing through the internet interface and giving itself that omnipresent understanding that is
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:11.200]  still somewhat limited it is distorted it's not true omnipresence but the danger of it is the
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:17.600]  corrupt humans that are in control of the ai being able to corner not just the stock market
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:23.440]  but the entire industrial complex future to make the warning of eisenhower and his farewell address
[02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:32.480]  in 1961 look like a walk in the park it's fallible twisted arrogant globalist corporate
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:42.560]  power tripping chiefs in control of demi god level understanding and by us waving our rights
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:49.600]  and waving our privacy we give these thieves of our destiny total control you guard your
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:54.080]  information because bad people will use it against you not because you have something to hide
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:03.280]  to have a free people you must have privacy another key bedrock foundation being removed
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:09.600]  and remember my film in game out for 10 years specifically warned of ai as the number one
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:14.240]  threat specifically showed the globalist saying they were planning on phasing out humanity and
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:23.520]  the new york times made fun of me but in 2017 word for word they're forced to warn the world
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:31.680]  exactly as i did just pointing that out the fools at the new york times i care about their
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:36.000]  children more than they care about their children and not because i'm some goody tissue but because
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:42.160]  i understand the real threats as a man and have done my research your phone calls are coming up
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:49.600]  the start of the next segment right now let's go to g.o.p rep dav bratt expose ms m e c and how
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:58.880]  96 of their donations went to hillary i love how msnbc and cnn both gave over 95 to hillary
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:06.160]  golden sacks gave 100 to hillary jp morgan gave 100 to hillary the big wall street firms
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:12.160]  gave 100 to hillary but they claim trump's establishment and they claim there's no globalist
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:20.160]  liberal neoliberal bias against trump here's the clip but no one gets to play the innocent here
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:26.000]  hillary raised two billion dollars in the hillary foundation from foreign money and cnn and all the
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.880]  biggies never found anything on that the washington post is great on watergate but they missed
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:36.960]  clinton gate altogether why is that well it may be because 97 percent of the donations
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:43.120]  of from mainstream folks go to the democrat party gee i wonder if that could you know influence the
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:49.520]  news at all so now everyone's on the trump that collusion stuff they keep so let's just calm it
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:56.000]  all down and go back what statute has been violated name it and i'm i'm open-minded guy we always get
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.640]  hyped up every morning on our starbucks and you guys come at us with a new wave and then six months
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.960]  later you're not clinging to any of those stories this has been going on for a year every morning
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.760]  i wake up and there's another oh there's a key detail dave what do you think about it it's you
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:14.800]  congressman we're not coming at you with some sort of new wave it's it's new york times it's the
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:19.920]  washington post oh i know right all the usual that's enough all the all the usual yeah the
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:26.800]  usual suspects that are paid off of the cia publicly what about hillary
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:36.240]  and the foundation and stealing the Haitian money new numbers are out it's not 97 percent she kept
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:47.120]  it's 99.8 percent she gave 0.2 percent that was numbers i saw in the news yesterday 0.2
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:53.360]  what about comey lying to congress and saying he didn't have memos then saying it wasn't classified
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:58.160]  information then saying it wasn't illegal to not give it to the attorney general which they now
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:04.160]  confirm it is what about the demasking of hundreds of thousands of americans to be spied on during
[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:08.960]  the election by the clinton and hillary operation what about rigging the debates what about rigging
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:16.160]  the polls what about putting out new fake polls that are in the news today adding nine to 15 points
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:27.200]  as they always did to the gallup to the rasmussen to all of them same old baloney add nine to 15
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:33.360]  points sometimes 20 they added 30 plus points as to the cnn phone polls and their own methodology
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:39.040]  gee let's give hillary 35 more points and wonder why she's winning wow hey how about that madame
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:47.520]  president newsweek cover you scumbags don't control reality we'll be back with your phone calls
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:53.600]  we are the human resistance we're humanity trying to survive trying to move forward we are standing
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:30:02.240]  up for life we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:11.840]  we must keep the internet free from communist government restrictions and parameters why
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:17.360]  because it would stop memes and erase heroes don't believe me look at china chinese president ji ji
[02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:22.240]  ping was famously memed with barack obama in 2013 when a picture of the two was compared to a picture
[02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:26.160]  of winnie the pooh and tigger too this happened again after an awkward handshake with japan's
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:31.360]  prime minister shinzo abe was compared to a handshake between pooh and ior other images such as winnie
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:35.840]  the pooh and a car have been memed alongside president g in his limo but because the meme of
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:40.080]  president g and winnie the pooh has gotten so popular china has now censored it from the internet
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:43.840]  this is commonplace in communist china as a recently deceased political dissident and
[02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:49.440]  Nobel peace prize winner lu xiao bo has had his name completely censored from the virtual world
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:53.840]  try sending his name and a message to a friend and the message will disappear into cyberspace
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:58.640]  xiao bo died in chinese custody and most people in china have no idea who he is keep the internet
[02:30:58.640 --> 02:31:04.480]  free in america stop net neutrality save me magic for info wars dot com this is our destroyer
[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:10.880]  it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's

[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.200]  lady with no criminal record that people said was just a wonderful woman called the police
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:22.880]  because of a reported break in and uh she walked up talked to cops the squad car and no one knows
[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:27.600]  why the first some molly on the force pulled his gun shot her right in the stomach and of course
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:32.400]  that they now won't release the dash cam footage or the body cams they claim those weren't on even
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:37.760]  though it's the law that they're on and the uh black lives matter folks are celebrating it
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:44.160]  ain't god good do i care that cops killed a white woman no i don't nobody cares if that stupid
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:52.880]  bitch died you're doing amazing sweetie and that is the level of just piranha like hate you got
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:59.280]  on the streets of austin you go to a trendy area white people walk up and scream f u white devil
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:03.600]  you're gonna die it's mainly white people but you'll run to some black folks to do it too
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:08.480]  total mental illness and if a cop shoots a black person they totally freak out even if there's
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:12.480]  the you know black guy pulling a gun it's like it's the end of the world even though
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:17.600]  you'll have thousands of black folks shot every year in chicago about their blacks nobody cares
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.720]  about that if there's you know a few cases of cops wrongly shooting black folks which do happen
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:27.680]  there's some bad cops out there i say throw the book at them it is the end of the world
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:35.760]  and now even cbs and others are saying all the poor some mollies they're so good they're so sweet
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:42.240]  here's the washington post just breaking down after many apples officer in police shooting
[02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:49.600]  his name some molly community braces for backlash and it goes oh we love our some mollies oh they're
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:59.680]  so good oh they're so sweet oh they're so good oh they're so sweet we love our muslims we love
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:07.440]  We love our Muslims, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet, we love our Somalis, we
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:13.400]  love our Muslims, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet.
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:14.400]  Absolutely.
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:18.640]  I mean, I don't think you can hear that too much, and it just was every day when Somalis
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:24.360]  kill people, screaming Allah Akbar and the news says that they screamed God is great
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.560]  because they were as a Christian that did it, of course it wasn't.
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:30.880]  Every time that happens or the police are ordered to cover it up, we're just going to
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.280]  play that clip and then show you the news here.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:39.720]  After Minneapolis officer in police shooting his name, Somali community, raised for backlash,
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:44.240]  CBS is pushing gun control in response to a questionable shooting of an Australian
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:50.440]  woman by a Somali migrant cop, or translated above the law, God creature.
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:55.000]  Despite gun control advocates consistently claiming only cops should carry guns.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.840]  Additionally, the mainstream media doesn't seem to motivate a report on the story given
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:03.920]  it wasn't a white cop shooting a Muslim, nor was much of the reporting and the possibility
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:08.040]  of a shooting was Sharia inspired on part of a criminal cover-up.
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:14.160]  If the roles were reversed, there'd be ten times more coverage.
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:19.480]  In the report published Tuesday morning, CBS began blaming America's notorious gun culture
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:24.600]  of violence in the second sentence of the article and even quoted an anti-gun academic
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:25.600]  in the third sentence.
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:34.320]  Yes, a cop shoots an unarmed woman who walked out to the squad car in her pajamas.
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:40.520]  And so the Somali cop saw somebody walking up, shot her, and the Washington Post says,
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:56.680]  Oh, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims, oh, they're so good, oh, they're so sweet.
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:39:59.320]  Can we show the lady attacked and in the hospital for the dog?
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:04.040]  You don't drink beer at, at, at, at, at a cub profession, Germany, no, that's been banned.
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:08.200]  They're banning men at outdoor concerts in Sweden because the Muslims come and rape everybody
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:09.720]  and you can't arrest a Muslim for rape.
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:13.120]  In fact, they're giving probation when they rape now.
[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:18.400]  Just like Astor, he got 13 months for procuring little boys, delivering them to the Republicans.
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:21.240]  And he's even suing folks that exposed him now.
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:22.240]  Well, there you go.
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:24.600]  He says, give him my hush money back.
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.360]  Dog Walker Hospitalized after attack by Somali migrant who said, dogs are unclean.
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:32.520]  Allah Akbar.
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:35.360]  It appears the only way the mainstream media can take advantage of the shooting is to push
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:37.600]  gun control, expect the inherent contradiction.
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:40.040]  But what I love is how they make the Somalis the victims.
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:41.040]  That's right.
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:42.200]  It's a Somali officer.
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:47.600]  Normally, the media would absolutely jump on a cop if, you know, if a guy pulls a gun
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:49.920]  on him and the cop shoots him, the cop's banned.
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:57.920]  But now, because it's a Somali, oh, we love our Somalis, oh, they're so good, oh, they're
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:03.120]  so sweet, oh, they're so good, oh, they're so sweet.
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:08.840]  And the reason I can't help it is every day I see a Somali, Allah Akbar, and stabbing
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:14.120]  or running over somebody with a car in Europe, in Canada, in the U.S. or shooting, just doing
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:15.120]  crazy stuff.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:19.560]  I mean, Somali, I've talked to militaries, but over there, it is literally women are
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:21.760]  kept like slaves everywhere.
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:23.640]  They're below human.
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:26.440]  It is like road warrior on PCP.
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:29.920]  And then we're, it's the biggest group we're bringing in.
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:34.360]  And then you've got all the radicalization of the Somalis.
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:36.680]  They constantly get caught doing terror attacks.
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:39.800]  And then you go to the Minneapolis airport, because GCN's based up there.
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:45.320]  I've probably flown in there 15 times or more over the years.
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:50.800]  And it's like, you're going to the scanner and it's Somalis and it's women in burkas.
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:55.120]  And it's like, you've got to do this because of them.
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:56.480]  And I don't even hate them.
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:59.600]  Go back to Islam, chop your women's genitals off.
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:05.040]  Make them wear beekeeper suits, run around on the desert, hijack boats, rob everybody.
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:07.480]  Just enjoy yourselves.
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:11.120]  I just don't want to live like that.
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:14.160]  Oh, we love our Somalis.
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:16.360]  Oh, we love our Muslims.
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:18.120]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:20.000]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.720]  I'm just learning to submit to Islam right now.
[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:26.800]  Can we play it just one more time and I'm going to your call?
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:27.800]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:29.800]  We love our Somalis.
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:31.800]  We love our Muslims.
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:33.800]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:36.680]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.880]  And again, every time, I mean, the reason I said that a few months ago was remember
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:45.560]  they had like in a week, they had five Somali attacks in the U.S., Allah Akbar this, Allah
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:48.560]  Akbar that, run over folks with cars, stabbing people.
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:55.200]  And then the SJW has complained, was in Ohio, remember, the cop shoots the guy after he
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:58.920]  stabbed nine people, killed a couple of them.
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:02.960]  And the guys walk around with a huge butcher knife, just stabbing people at the college
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:04.600]  where he had free tuition.
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:10.480]  Just a crazy Somali, completely out of his mind, totally inbred, that's admitted, just
[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:17.120]  walking around with a huge butcher knife, just trying to run it into people.
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:27.120]  The cop shoots him, and the headline was cop shoots black man, from Somalia to the U.S.,
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:30.120]  Ohio State attacker, path to violence.
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:33.120]  Oh, we love our Somalis.
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:35.120]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:37.120]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:42.120]  And then I got to read the Washington Post today.
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:48.120]  It's how great he is.
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:53.120]  When Muhammad Noor joined the Minneapolis police force and was assigned to patrol the
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:57.120]  city's southwest corridor, the Somali community there, the nation's largest, threw a party
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:59.120]  for him to celebrate.
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:01.120]  Yes, he was the first Somali.
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:02.120]  Oh, he's so good.
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:03.120]  Oh, he's so great.
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:05.120]  Sorry, whenever you say Somali, you got to say that.
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:06.120]  He was the first Somali.
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:07.120]  Oh, he's so good.
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:08.120]  Oh, he's so great.
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:13.120]  Oh, he's so great, American officer to serve Minneapolis fifth precinct and one of fewer
[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:17.120]  than a dozen Somali American officers in the department.
[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:19.120]  To the headline to lie, there's a dozen.
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:23.120]  His presence on the squad brought Somali activists some pride.
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:24.120]  And oh, the activist.
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:26.120]  Yes, you got to learn to kiss your butt more.
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:27.120]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:28.120]  Let me please do it.
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:31.120]  And reassurance at the time of Islamophobia.
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:33.120]  Oh, yes, it's just, oh, they're so good.
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:34.120]  Oh, they're so great.
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:35.120]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:38.120]  Yeah, I won't be scared of rattlesnakes either.
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:43.120]  At the time of Islamophobia in America and nationwide racial tension stoked by part
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:45.120]  of the shootings of black people by white officers.
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:48.120]  Yeah, which are super rare, but Islamic attacks are everywhere.
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:50.120]  But let's just talk about evil white people.
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:53.120]  Let's just demonize white people and then talk about how the Somalis are God.
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:54.120]  See, that's what I hate.
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:57.120]  White people are bad Somalis are God with a total failed state.
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:01.120]  And they're suing Trump because he tried to block people with fake passports flying
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:04.120]  here from Somalia when the e-bombs issue them.
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:05.120]  Oh, here.
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:06.120]  E-moms says kill everybody.
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:07.120]  He issued my passport.
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:10.120]  Now accept it.
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:14.120]  Now that time, same Somali community is bracing for a backlash.
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:19.120]  Oh, the poor babies against Noor that has already begun.
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:24.120]  He just shot an unarmed woman in the belly without even anybody criticizing.
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:25.120]  He's Somali.
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:26.120]  They're already bitching.
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:31.120]  They're like, oh, hey, they're so mean to us.
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:35.120]  How about Katie Metler of the Washington Post?
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:37.120]  How about she moves to Somalia?
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:42.120]  She'll be kidnapped in five minutes flat cupcake.
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:47.120]  On Monday, multiple media outlets named Nord as the officer who fatally shot an unarmed
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:49.120]  Australian woman.
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:55.120]  But like Black Lives Matter sites celebrating to be a enemy of America and I'm the enemy
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:58.120]  and everybody else is an enemy and everybody else needs to, you know, go down and everything
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:01.120]  else is like, oh, so many Sam has taken over the country.
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:06.120]  He's like, oh, I hate white people and I'm going to kill them and I'm going to stop them
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:08.120]  and I'm going to murder them.
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:14.120]  And then it's not most Black people that are even buying into this.
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:16.120]  Put up those quotes again.
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:22.120]  It's young people at colleges that have been brainwashed led by weirdo white professors
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:24.120]  saying, no whites allowed this weekend.
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:27.120]  That's not racist.
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:29.120]  It's so good.
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:30.120]  It's so great.
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:33.120]  On Monday, multiple media outlets named Nord as the officer who fatally shot an unarmed
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:37.120]  Australian woman in the city's popular Folsom neighborhood.
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:39.120]  That means trending.
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:44.120]  Over the weekend, an incident that has grabbed global attention and thrust Minneapolis into
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:45.120]  yet another uproar.
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:46.120]  Yeah.
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:52.120]  How do you blame police officers when it's a God that did it?
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:55.120]  Officials have not publicly confirmed the officer's name.
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:59.120]  Tom Plunk, an attorney who said he represents Nord to the statement that the officer extends
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:05.120]  his condolences to the morning 40-year-old Justine Damon's death and takes their loss
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:06.120]  seriously.
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:10.120]  We would like to say more and we'll say it's more in the future.
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:13.120]  At this time over, there are several investigations I'm doing.
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:15.120]  And then it just goes on to worship him.
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:17.120]  Oh, the boys.
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:18.120]  It's like he got killed.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:21.120]  He got shot or his family lost him.
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:22.120]  Let's just apologize then.
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:26.120]  I'm so sorry, Officer Nord.
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:28.120]  There.
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:30.120]  Poor Officer Nord.
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:32.120]  Stories about him in the Washington Post.
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  Oh, I saw my lease.
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:37.120]  Oh, that's so good.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:39.120]  Oh, that's so great.
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:42.120]  And now your phone calls.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:44.120]  Let's go to Kevin in Florida.
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:46.120]  Charles in Missouri.
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:50.120]  And we're going to go to Katherine in Florida.
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.120]  James in Texas, Jason in Washington.
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:56.120]  My phone ringing off the hook here.
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:03.120]  Let's see who's calling.
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:04.120]  Got to check sometimes.
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.120]  You know, that's the bat phone.
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:10.120]  But let's put the quotes back on screen.
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:13.120]  Those people can look at what folks are saying in the celebration.
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:15.120]  I remember when they shot that black lady a few years ago,
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:17.120]  was driving around scared of the checkpoints in D.C.
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:20.120]  And I thought it was wrong that she was killed and she was black.
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:21.120]  And I got all these emails and calls from folks saying,
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:23.120]  thank you for carrying a black person got killed.
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:24.120]  Of course I cared.
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:26.120]  I didn't care what color she was.
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:29.120]  If this guy had shot a black woman, I'd be just as concerned.
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:34.120]  It's so tribal now, though.
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:36.120]  Kevin wants to talk about unrest.
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:40.120]  Charles wants to talk about info wars.
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:42.120]  Katherine wants to talk about Florida.
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:43.120]  James wants to talk about Texas.
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:45.120]  Jason wants to talk about Trump winning.
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:47.120]  And I think we should go to Kevin in Florida.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.120]  You're on the air.
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:51.120]  So much, Alex.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:55.120]  I just want to say I think it's hilarious that you guys keep on playing that clip
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:56.120]  that they created of you.
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.120]  I think you guys should make it go viral.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:00.120]  It's played every single day, like you said.
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:03.120]  I think it's already gone viral, but we want it to go more viral.
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:07.120]  So since you requested it, here it is.
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:08.120]  Very exciting clip, isn't it?
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:11.120]  We love our Somalis.
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:13.120]  We love our Muslims.
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:15.120]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:17.120]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:18.120]  That's good.
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:19.120]  Sorry, circle ahead.
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:24.120]  No, I just wanted to say, I think you might have addressed this once,
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:29.120]  but I think the biggest hurdle to Trump getting everything through is not him himself,
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:31.120]  because I'm going to stand by him through thick and thin.
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:33.120]  I voted for him.
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:36.120]  He's the only one who actually wants to turn this country around.
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:41.120]  But I think even a bigger problem than that is that most of the informed Americans
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:45.120]  know that these elected employees to care less what they think.
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:47.120]  They're so out of touch with reality.
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:50.120]  They have no idea what the average American goes through,
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:54.120]  the fact that there's a lot of people that are straddling to feed their families
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:55.120]  that are losing their job.
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:57.120]  They're living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:02.120]  They're having to scrape two pennies together and hope a nickel pops out.
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  And these Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan and all these high and mighty elitists
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:12.120]  about the people, and unless that changes,
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:16.120]  I don't know if Trump's going to be able to overcome that because he's...
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:17.120]  No, I totally agree.
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:18.120]  He's got to get the economy going.
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:21.120]  He's got to get tax cuts, or they're going to end up selling the idea
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:24.120]  that you've got to have government take care of you, which of course never works.
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:27.120]  So we've got to expose Paul Ryan and others.
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:30.120]  I totally agree with you, Kevin.
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:34.120]  I think that's what it's going to come to because I think the average informed American
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:40.120]  knows what's going on and that CNN's plan of trying to propagandize
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:45.120]  all the other Americans is failing.
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.120]  Well, they're absolutely trying to create racial division,
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:52.120]  and they're totally engaging in the most evil forms of division I've ever seen.
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:53.120]  Great points, Kevin.
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:57.120]  Charles, Catherine, James, Jason and others, your calls are straight ahead.

[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:26.120]  I want to be clear, and I don't just say this for political correctness, it's true.
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:31.120]  I'm sure there's some great Somalis out there, nice folks, businesses, things like that.
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:38.120]  But statistically it's the most backwards, vicious caveman level country where women have no rights.
[02:54:38.120 --> 02:54:41.120]  We're just bringing people here, particularly in Minnesota.
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:45.120]  I mean, it's like that's the biggest colony of Somalis they brought in, and they're not assimilating.
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:51.120]  And there's all sorts of attacks, and there's constant cover-ups of what's happening.
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:56.120]  And every time a Somali Allah Akbar's and stabs somebody or shoots an innocent person,
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:03.120]  the media makes excuses for it, and whines and complains, and acts like,
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:06.120]  we're not supposed to talk about the elephant in the room, just like Islam in general.
[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:11.120]  We're not supposed to talk about all the sexual mutilation, all the sex slavery and ongoing slavery,
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:15.120]  and women not being able to drive cars and having to wear hoods over their heads,
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:20.120]  and all the weird pedophilia that goes on, and is institutionalized in Orthodox Islam.
[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:24.120]  They don't want that discussed. Well, we're going to discuss it.
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:31.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Catherine in Florida. You're on the air worldwide, thank you for holding.
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:37.120]  Forgive me, but I had to call and tell you why we're not allowed to speak to the Russians,
[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:47.120]  because in 1914, the Russians had 55,000 churches, and in October of 1917, 100 years ago,
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:53.120]  the Bolsheviks took over and declared separation of church and state.
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:57.120]  And they said they were going to help everybody fight against the capitalists.
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:03.120]  They took all the Christians and killed them, and they put all the free thinkers into concentration.
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:07.120]  No, that's right, and it was the United States and England, and it was the New York Liberals,
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:10.120]  all went over there, took over, and murdered everybody in Russia.
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:15.120]  And that's right, and then the United States colonized Russia with communism to control it.
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:19.120]  And then the same communist influences now want to do that here.
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:25.120]  And then Russia took back Russia, and Russia became a revived Christian country.
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:30.120]  And in Hollywood, and everybody admits they want to literally enslave and murder the Russian children,
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:34.120]  like they want to do to ours. Yeah, that's a bunch of pedophiles.
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:38.120]  Because they know. They know what we're going to go through.
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:45.120]  And if Trump and Putin talk, you know, they went five years ago, said no GMOs here.
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:50.120]  Well, Russia's done a lot of good stuff. It's still got globalist infestation in it.
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:51.120]  But you're absolutely right, man.
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:55.120]  That is why they're allied with radical Islam as well, because it's anti-Christian.
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:59.120]  And the globalists are prosecuting this attack. They admit it in the WikiLeaks.
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.120]  They hate Christians. They hate children.
[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:05.120]  Hastard's a pedophile. The Pope's a pedophile. His deputy's a pedophile.
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:09.120]  They are pedophile devil worshipers.
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:14.120]  That's right, and they're going to kill free thinkers. They know who we are. They're going to come and kill us.
[02:57:14.120 --> 02:57:16.120]  No, that's right. They are devil worshiping pedophiles.
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:21.120]  And it's the EU. It's the Pope. It's the Islam leaders, the radical Islam leaders.
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:25.120]  It's Hollywood. It's the Republican leadership, our pedophile devil worshipers.
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:28.120]  They're getting busted every day, and they're all going to get busted. It's all going to happen.
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:32.120]  It's all coming out. I'd say half the Republican leadership are probably pedophiles.
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:36.120]  The same thing with the Democrats. It's just they're a bunch of pedophile, slime devil worshipers.
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:41.120]  And who could deny that? The media will probably run stories saying, I say that, the public will read it and say he's right.
[02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:44.120]  Because they're constantly getting caught. It's who they are.
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:48.120]  We know they're devil worshiping pedophiles who are willing to do anything for power.
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:52.120]  That's why they're in power because they're scum, but they can only rule when we're asleep.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:56.120]  And that's coming to an end. And we will stop the pedophiles. We will stop the Islamists.
[02:57:56.120 --> 02:57:59.120]  We will stop the globalists. We will stop all of them.
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:02.120]  With the Lord's help.
[02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:07.120]  That's right. Absolutely. Because we don't love the radical Islamists.
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:09.120]  We don't love the pedophiles. We don't like what they're doing.
[02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:13.120]  And we're awake and we're conscious and nothing's putting that back in the bottle again.
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:17.120]  And we know they're adulterating our food and our water and the vaccines to poisonous.
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:20.120]  That's been declassified. We're aware of it and the word spreading.
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:26.120]  And people of every race, color and creed who are humans with red blood are coming together for life and justice in the future
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:29.120]  against the satanic hordes of the New World Order. Thank you.
[02:58:29.120 --> 02:58:33.120]  James, Jason, Charles, your calls are T minus 70 seconds away.
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:36.120]  I didn't plug this hour. We got free shipping in the month of July.
[02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:40.120]  But a lot of stuff. The sales have to end in the next few days. In fact, brain forces no longer on sale.
[02:58:40.120 --> 02:58:44.120]  The Supermelon X2R 30% off. Cape Man's back in stock.
[02:58:44.120 --> 02:58:46.120]  Your purchase funds. Everything we do.
[02:58:46.120 --> 02:58:49.120]  Infowarsstore.com. We're maniacs for freedom.
[02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:51.120]  Hour number four with Paul Watson. Straight ahead.
[02:58:51.120 --> 02:59:19.120]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic. We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:31.120]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:38.120]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:51.120]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally. We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the public.
[02:59:51.120 --> 03:00:17.120]  So please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[03:00:17.120 --> 03:00:25.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:33.120]  The Nazis had an evil culture. The Aztecs had a corrupt evil culture. Every group goes through these cycles.
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:47.120]  But coming up in the next segment, I'm going to introduce Paul Watson. We brought masses of gypsies who they sell as the most rockstar thing there is, whether it's Irish Pikes or whether it's Roman offs out of Eastern Europe, which are originally out of the Middle East.
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:54.120]  The culture is rob you, steal, take advantage of you. There are some gypsy sex that are quasi-reformed and don't do that.
[03:00:54.120 --> 03:01:03.120]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and I saw gypsies rob and steal from people. I've been to Europe when they walk over and steal your wallet.
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:13.120]  They'll kidnap your kids, and I got a report coming up where they're stealing and robbing and crapping on the streets, and the left is hailing it as like sacraments of God.
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:24.120]  You know that gypsy craps on your front doorstep. De Beers will buy that for a million dollars. Actually, they don't, but that's what's going on here, folks.
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:34.120]  So that's all coming up. We love our gypsies. We love our Somalis. All I'm saying is they're not assimilating.
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:41.120]  There are certain cultures that are like gangs that don't assimilate, and in response to that, you get the other response, the Nazis.
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:51.120]  I'm saying, I want our Christian society. I don't want this, but the globalists know what they're doing.
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:58.120]  They want us all in our grips, folks. Excuse me, my lungs. I shouldn't eat a jalapeno during the break. Excuse me.
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:05.120]  We love James and Texas. All right, that's really stuck in my head. I'm going to stop doing it. James and Texas, go ahead.
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:14.120]  Hey, Alex, I guess the biggest question I have is why do we keep playing this rig game? Let's go back to the Federal Reserve and how they're raising the rates.
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:16.120]  Why do we keep playing this when we know it's rigged?
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:25.120]  Trump needs to fire Yellen, but Yellen's got a 10-year term, so they claim it's separate so Congress would have to repeal the Federal Reserve Act.
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:31.120]  I agree. What on earth is the Federal Reserve doing countermanding our president's policies?
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:37.120]  I mean, we need to go back to a real gold standard, then we need to go back to a U.S. currency, not a Federal Reserve.
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:47.120]  I love Janet Yellen. I love the Chabani owner on the same board. Having more power than our president. I love the Muslims raising our interest rates.
[03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:49.120]  Sorry.
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:58.120]  No, totally agree. Understand? And I just think it's time for us, you know, Christian citizens of the United States to take back, you know, what's ours.
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:06.120]  Onward Christian soldiers marching into war with the cross of Jesus.
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:10.120]  People make fun of that, but I mean, if you don't have that, what else you got?
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:17.120]  I don't mean Bible thumpers, you know, that are probably, you know, engaged in oral sex at the local bathroom.
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:25.120]  I'm talking about real Christians standing up against the New World Order, not a bunch of Pharisees, trying to tell folks how great they are, but people really want to fight the spirit of this world.
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:27.120]  You get what I'm saying, James?
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:30.120]  I do. Appreciate you, Alex. Thank you.
[03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:32.120]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:36.120]  All right, Jason in Washington, go ahead.
[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:52.120]  Hey, um, hello, I, um, I have something written for you because I know I don't have much time. So first, before my main reasons, my call, I like to ask if you're building another studio, I'd like to be hired for any position that you may need because this, what you stand for is exactly what I stand for.
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:57.120]  And it's my calling in life. I've emailed you multiple times. Maybe I can share my email with your crew so we could search for you.
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:02.120]  Hey, folks, you're a video editor's journalist, especially have a background we can check. We're trying to hire some more folks.
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:08.120]  So again, you know, email us jobsandinfowars.com.
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:16.120]  We're looking for female reporters, particularly because that's always great to have that perspective and view looking for more video editors, more researchers, more writers.
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:25.120]  We don't have a huge budget, but we pay more than other folks. Most people pay zero nowadays. So jobsandinfowars.com, my friend.
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:28.120]  I just need a living. I don't care how much I get paid.
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:45.120]  So what I want to do is take the globalist on. The problem is little stuff like hiring people takes time or Paul is supposed to announce tomorrow, the winner of the meme contest. We got like 10,000 memes last time I checked. So it was so successful. It bogged us all down.
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:56.120]  That's why I can't do more of these contests. I need to create a whole contest department because the contests are so successful. But then it bogs us down. Jason, we love you. We love Jason from Washington.
[03:04:56.120 --> 03:04:59.120]  We'll drive back with Paul Joseph Watson. Stay with us.
[03:05:26.120 --> 03:05:55.120]  And now, the serial child molester is free once again after serving only 13 months. Judge Durkin also said there's nothing more disturbing than having a child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence.
[03:05:55.120 --> 03:06:01.120]  I disagree. There's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year in prison.
[03:06:01.120 --> 03:06:26.120]  Paul won't see that on CNN for info wars.com. This is Owen Schreuer.
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:55.120]  Oh, I'm so glad you'll come back.
[03:06:56.120 --> 03:06:59.020]  I'm on here and tell you what it did for them because regardless you can't lose your
[03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:00.020]  foot in the operation.
[03:07:00.020 --> 03:07:07.060]  infowarslife.com, infowarstore.com, or cripple82533139.

[03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:06.100]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.100 --> 03:08:18.100]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:22.820]  In the last few days, I've talked to former and current Fox executives.
[03:08:22.820 --> 03:08:26.980]  It's no secret that Roger Ells is reaching out to us before he died.
[03:08:26.980 --> 03:08:32.460]  I know about some of the new Fox networks they're trying to launch with big money that
[03:08:32.460 --> 03:08:38.820]  would take over some of the big cable stations that are out there that kind of air old movies
[03:08:38.820 --> 03:08:43.620]  and stuff like that and put it onto a new Fox network that would have Bill O'Reilly,
[03:08:43.620 --> 03:08:47.220]  Sean Hannity, you name it, Daniel Loesch and others on it.
[03:08:47.220 --> 03:08:52.140]  And I was talking to some of these folks and they were just bringing up the fact that when
[03:08:52.140 --> 03:08:56.900]  Trump won, there were people crying at Fox News.
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:09:01.980]  More than half the people are hardcore globalist liberals.
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:05.740]  It's New York and it's peer pressure.
[03:09:05.740 --> 03:09:06.740]  It's a cult.
[03:09:06.740 --> 03:09:11.740]  And if you look at how controlled Fox News is, this is Fox News.
[03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:17.100]  Look at this headline, immigrants defecated in the streets, behead chickens, angry Pennsylvania
[03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:21.260]  residents say.
[03:09:21.260 --> 03:09:26.700]  And it won't even tell people that it's Gypsies.
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:27.700]  That's their name.
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:31.500]  Or the, I said Romanov, that's the Russian royal dynasty.
[03:09:31.500 --> 03:09:35.500]  It's the Roman people as they call themselves, but they're not from Italy.
[03:09:35.500 --> 03:09:36.500]  The Roma.
[03:09:36.500 --> 03:09:39.060]  They've done the genetic testing.
[03:09:39.060 --> 03:09:44.740]  It's from like Northern India and some from the Middle East, but it's a vagabond migrant
[03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:49.660]  groups that for thousands of years have gone around Europe and the culture is Rob Steel,
[03:09:49.660 --> 03:09:55.060]  never assimilate, deform your children at birth, handicap them so they can beg, kidnap
[03:09:55.060 --> 03:09:56.060]  children.
[03:09:56.060 --> 03:10:02.260]  I mean, that's the Gypsy culture, but they have the Disney movies and Quasimodo and the
[03:10:02.260 --> 03:10:07.540]  hunchback of Notre Dame and how beautiful and how wonderful it is.
[03:10:07.540 --> 03:10:14.580]  Not even Fox News will tell you in the article, their Gypsies.
[03:10:14.580 --> 03:10:21.500]  It just says they are a persecuted minority group from Romania, from Bucharest, who have
[03:10:21.500 --> 03:10:24.620]  been brought here by the federal government.
[03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:27.300]  And it's got, this is a whitewash, how great they are.
[03:10:27.300 --> 03:10:28.860]  Oh, they're crapping in the streets.
[03:10:28.860 --> 03:10:29.860]  They're robbing people.
[03:10:29.860 --> 03:10:33.940]  They're stealing their, whatever, we're going to play this clip in the morning.
[03:10:33.940 --> 03:10:40.620]  But at least Tucker Carlson said Gypsies come into America.
[03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:45.820]  The Romanian refugees moved to the area through a federal program that finds temporary housing
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:48.700]  for immigrants, according to post-Cazette.
[03:10:48.700 --> 03:10:53.940]  The Romanians fled their homes in Bucharest area, where they faced persecution as a minority
[03:10:53.940 --> 03:10:54.940]  group.
[03:10:54.940 --> 03:10:57.940]  Yeah, since they came there a thousand years ago, more than a hundred and fifty people
[03:10:57.940 --> 03:11:02.460]  attended the, you know, your kid gets kidnapped out of your backyard, big kidnappings all
[03:11:02.460 --> 03:11:03.460]  over Europe.
[03:11:03.460 --> 03:11:06.060]  They find them with the Gypsies and even liberal groups say, just let them have your kid now.
[03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:09.100]  It's part of their, I'm sure that those in Italy, they actually find them with kids and
[03:11:09.100 --> 03:11:10.100]  let them keep them.
[03:11:10.100 --> 03:11:12.140]  Oh, they've had your daughter for three years.
[03:11:12.140 --> 03:11:15.580]  Just let them keep them and let the Muslims rape your wife to it.
[03:11:15.580 --> 03:11:16.580]  It's okay.
[03:11:16.580 --> 03:11:19.420]  They only get probation because it's liberal.
[03:11:19.420 --> 03:11:23.020]  More than a hundred and fifty people attended California boroughs council municipal meeting
[03:11:23.020 --> 03:11:29.780]  Thursday night and several residents complained about the immigrants and then it goes on to
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:30.780]  break it down.
[03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:34.860]  Paul Watson joins us to talk about this and more.
[03:11:34.860 --> 03:11:40.300]  We've got a guy that was a national spokesman for the invaders that took over Syria.
[03:11:40.300 --> 03:11:41.300]  They called him a Syrian refugee.
[03:11:41.300 --> 03:11:46.540]  He's really an Islamist invader who's slit his employer's throat after he was a model
[03:11:46.540 --> 03:11:50.580]  hairdresser, a model of integration, they called him.
[03:11:50.580 --> 03:11:53.660]  And just every day and we've got the Somali cop shooting the unarmed woman and then the
[03:11:53.660 --> 03:11:55.980]  Washington Post says, oh, he's a poor victim.
[03:11:55.980 --> 03:11:56.980]  He's a Somali.
[03:11:56.980 --> 03:11:57.980]  It's like he got hurt.
[03:11:57.980 --> 03:12:01.540]  And then the leftist sites are celebrating her death, saying it's good that the white
[03:12:01.540 --> 03:12:03.820]  bitch, close quote, was killed.
[03:12:03.820 --> 03:12:08.100]  So what is going on here, Paul Watson, as you take over the transmission?
[03:12:08.100 --> 03:12:11.820]  Well, good to be back, Alex.
[03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:16.380]  Basically we're in a culture that's absolutely horrific and the media won't tell us the truth
[03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:17.740]  about it.
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:22.260]  Similar case in London, Alex, we've got these acid attacks almost every weekend now.
[03:12:22.260 --> 03:12:26.260]  In fact, sometimes every day, but you had five attacks this weekend.
[03:12:26.260 --> 03:12:27.980]  What's wrong with throwing acid on women's faces?
[03:12:27.980 --> 03:12:28.980]  It's liberal.
[03:12:28.980 --> 03:12:29.980]  It's progressive.
[03:12:29.980 --> 03:12:35.380]  Well, Alex, the vast majority of these acid attacks are taking place in, well, the clear
[03:12:35.380 --> 03:12:40.140]  majority at least, are taking place in Newham and Tower Hamlets, two boroughs of London that
[03:12:40.140 --> 03:12:43.380]  surprise, surprise on Muslim ghettos.
[03:12:43.380 --> 03:12:47.700]  They admit that in the articles, but then when you actually come to naming the individuals
[03:12:47.700 --> 03:12:52.580]  responsible for the attacks, they refuse to name the individuals, they named one individual
[03:12:52.580 --> 03:12:56.020]  yesterday, called him a 19 year old boy.
[03:12:56.020 --> 03:13:00.220]  Now, Alex, in the United Kingdom, you're legally an adult when you hit 18.
[03:13:00.220 --> 03:13:04.700]  Sure, but when they write women all over Europe, even if they're 25, they're called a boy.
[03:13:04.700 --> 03:13:05.700]  Yeah.
[03:13:05.700 --> 03:13:09.980]  It's impossible to be a 19 year old boy in the United Kingdom legally.
[03:13:09.980 --> 03:13:10.980]  That's a man.
[03:13:10.980 --> 03:13:14.180]  And of course, he's called Ahmed Mohammed, something, something.
[03:13:14.180 --> 03:13:16.660]  The majority of these incidents are in Islamic ghettos.
[03:13:16.660 --> 03:13:20.460]  I will throw acid on your face, bitch, for showing it.
[03:13:20.460 --> 03:13:27.620]  Now you are ugly, I am beautiful, Durga Durga Mama Jihad.
[03:13:27.620 --> 03:13:31.540]  I mean, bear in mind that this is, this comes from the same culture that literally allows
[03:13:31.540 --> 03:13:35.540]  old men to rape young boys and that's part of their culture.
[03:13:35.540 --> 03:13:36.860]  And that's why they like Hastard.
[03:13:36.860 --> 03:13:42.820]  That's why Hastard gets 13 months and for robbery, OJ gets nine years.
[03:13:42.820 --> 03:13:45.420]  So we've got acid attacks almost every day.
[03:13:45.420 --> 03:13:46.420]  Last night there was another one.
[03:13:46.420 --> 03:13:51.140]  There was a flag down an ambulance, I think it was an emergency worker pretending that
[03:13:51.140 --> 03:13:55.780]  they were in distress, just so they could throw acid in her face.
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:13:59.220]  There's not even a criminal motive in some of these cases.
[03:13:59.220 --> 03:14:01.340]  They're not even like stealing anything.
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:05.380]  It's just, it's just part of their fun to just disfigure people for life.
[03:14:05.380 --> 03:14:06.380]  That's progressive.
[03:14:06.380 --> 03:14:07.380]  That's liberal.
[03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:08.380]  We should embrace that.
[03:14:08.380 --> 03:14:10.380]  Get down on our knees and say, Alarakbo.
[03:14:10.380 --> 03:14:14.620]  And meanwhile, Alex, obviously in Saudi Arabia, you probably covered this earlier, they hunted
[03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:21.240]  down and arrested a young woman for God forbid wearing a skirt as she visited a national
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:26.740]  monument in Saudi Arabia, because foreigners are allowed to do that if they visit actual
[03:14:26.740 --> 03:14:28.240]  Saudi citizens on.
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:30.100]  Where are the feminists today, Alex?
[03:14:30.100 --> 03:14:31.100]  Where are they?
[03:14:31.100 --> 03:14:33.100]  Completely frigging silent.
[03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:36.100]  They're more bothered about advertising in the, in the, in the, in the, in the news.
[03:14:36.100 --> 03:14:40.180]  The news won't even show the thousands of videos of them blocking roads, robbing people
[03:14:40.180 --> 03:14:41.180]  all over Europe.
[03:14:41.180 --> 03:14:44.140]  They've declared civil emergency for years on French roads.
[03:14:44.140 --> 03:14:48.100]  Your family had to evacuate France or just Muslims running around, foaming at the mouth.
[03:14:48.100 --> 03:14:49.460]  They've taken over the tunnel.
[03:14:49.460 --> 03:14:53.620]  They're flooding everywhere, just climbing over and hell, we don't even show it.
[03:14:53.620 --> 03:14:57.140]  It's just like, we're just accepting it.
[03:14:57.140 --> 03:15:02.540]  You've literally got the advertising standards agency banning advertisements that push gender
[03:15:02.540 --> 03:15:06.340]  stereotypes, which is basically, you know, women being attractive.
[03:15:06.340 --> 03:15:12.180]  I mean, you had Reebok come out and lecture people don't compliment women on their appearance.
[03:15:12.180 --> 03:15:15.900]  That's a surefire way to end up as a lonely loser, isn't it, Alex?
[03:15:15.900 --> 03:15:20.580]  I get absolutely crucified by my girlfriend if I don't compliment her on her appearance.
[03:15:20.580 --> 03:15:21.980]  Women love that.
[03:15:21.980 --> 03:15:25.060]  So again, it's all about imposing this sharia style.
[03:15:25.060 --> 03:15:30.500]  They had the body, the beach body poster, remember that a couple of years ago, and Sadiq
[03:15:30.500 --> 03:15:32.060]  can't ban it.
[03:15:32.060 --> 03:15:37.380]  So it's, it's this slow sharia creep where it's being imposed culturally that you can't
[03:15:37.380 --> 03:15:42.740]  compliment women, and then also while women are actually being oppressed, nobody's calling
[03:15:42.740 --> 03:15:43.740]  that out.
[03:15:43.740 --> 03:15:46.140]  Nobody gives a damn about the woman in Saudi Arabia.
[03:15:46.140 --> 03:15:47.140]  Feminists don't.
[03:15:47.140 --> 03:15:52.740]  They're still upset about, you know, body positivity and telling people that obesity is unhealthy.
[03:15:52.740 --> 03:15:54.500]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:15:54.500 --> 03:15:59.740]  And these acid attacks in London, right outside my door, there was a machete attack a couple
[03:15:59.740 --> 03:16:00.860]  of months ago.
[03:16:00.860 --> 03:16:04.460]  This is every single day now, crimes going through the roof.
[03:16:04.460 --> 03:16:05.820]  We've had numerous terror attacks.
[03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:07.460]  We've got these acid attacks.
[03:16:07.460 --> 03:16:10.700]  And what is Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, concerned about?
[03:16:10.700 --> 03:16:15.460]  He's concerned about Donald Trump being insulting to Muslims, so he's not going to welcome
[03:16:15.460 --> 03:16:17.900]  him when he comes to the United Kingdom.
[03:16:17.900 --> 03:16:18.900]  It's incredible.
[03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:24.100]  Because he insults Londoners on a daily basis with his shia and utter incompetence.
[03:16:24.100 --> 03:16:25.300]  People get an acid attack.
[03:16:25.300 --> 03:16:29.740]  We've got terror attacks every other week, and he's worried about Donald Trump being mean
[03:16:29.740 --> 03:16:31.820]  to Muslims on Twitter.
[03:16:31.820 --> 03:16:33.100]  That's the situation.
[03:16:33.100 --> 03:16:36.180]  It's absolutely abhorrent, and it seems to be getting worse every day.
[03:16:36.180 --> 03:16:38.260]  Alex, I'm going to have to move out of London soon.
[03:16:38.260 --> 03:16:42.540]  I mean, I'm going to have to move to some boring area of the country where nothing happens,
[03:16:42.540 --> 03:16:46.940]  because that's the only place you can get away from some of the consequences that are
[03:16:46.940 --> 03:16:50.060]  being foisted on us by this multiculturalism.
[03:16:50.060 --> 03:16:54.260]  And there are the Somalis in France, literal Somalis.
[03:16:54.260 --> 03:16:59.140]  This looks like Day of the Dead here, uh, zombieing around blocking trucks and then robbing
[03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:01.220]  it and robbing the cargo.
[03:17:01.220 --> 03:17:06.180]  There's even footage of them like carrying open trucks from zoos that have like, you
[03:17:06.180 --> 03:17:08.460]  know, polar bears in the back and crazy stuff.
[03:17:08.460 --> 03:17:13.140]  I mean, it's like Road Warrior, and they are literally just trying to cover all this up,
[03:17:13.140 --> 03:17:14.140]  Paul.
[03:17:14.140 --> 03:17:15.140]  What do you think the master plan is?
[03:17:15.140 --> 03:17:20.740]  Because the big news is the EU has announced that they're going to stop fleets.
[03:17:20.740 --> 03:17:26.860]  They're going to stop EU member nations ships from taking Muslims back to Africa, and that
[03:17:26.860 --> 03:17:32.580]  they're basically going to use the EU military to help Soros bring in more millions, 10 million
[03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:34.300]  now they say brought into Europe.
[03:17:34.300 --> 03:17:38.340]  I thought it was 5 million, it's 10 million that they just announced.
[03:17:38.340 --> 03:17:39.340]  What are they planning?
[03:17:39.340 --> 03:17:43.460]  What is the master plan here by the EU?
[03:17:43.460 --> 03:17:47.900]  The master plan, and some of them admit it, is the complete collapse of Western civilization,
[03:17:47.900 --> 03:17:48.900]  and it's already happened.
[03:17:48.900 --> 03:17:52.620]  They get up, they get up in front of parliament and brag about how Germans are going to be
[03:17:52.620 --> 03:17:55.900]  a minority in their own cities within 20 years.
[03:17:55.900 --> 03:17:58.740]  That's already the case in Frankfurt, Germany, big city.
[03:17:58.740 --> 03:18:04.580]  But it's not like they're bringing in Argentinians or Chinese or something that historically
[03:18:04.580 --> 03:18:07.300]  don't have high crime rates that want to work in an assimilate.
[03:18:07.300 --> 03:18:11.340]  They're bringing in North Africans, they're bringing in East Africa that's been a hell
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:12.900]  whole forever.
[03:18:12.900 --> 03:18:16.780]  With radical Muslim culture, they're bringing in the people that invaded Syria, they're
[03:18:16.780 --> 03:18:21.980]  bringing in 80% military aged men, they're bringing them in and letting them do whatever
[03:18:21.980 --> 03:18:28.860]  they want and worshiping gypsies and MTV worships gypsies as if they're God.
[03:18:28.860 --> 03:18:31.260]  Tell folks about what gypsies are like in Europe.
[03:18:31.260 --> 03:18:34.180]  Well, there are huge crime problems with gypsies.
[03:18:34.180 --> 03:18:37.500]  I mean, Italy's been suffering for that for decades.
[03:18:37.500 --> 03:18:40.820]  There was another case in Vienna, by the way, you mentioned Somalis.
[03:18:40.820 --> 03:18:46.780]  A woman, a middle-aged woman walking her dog was attacked, scratched, bit by a Somali
[03:18:46.780 --> 03:18:52.700]  migrant because she actually dared Alex to walk her dog in the park.
[03:18:52.700 --> 03:18:53.700]  Dogs are unclean.
[03:18:53.700 --> 03:18:55.780]  That's what this attacker said.
[03:18:55.780 --> 03:19:00.660]  She was viciously attacked by an 18-year-old Somali, again, it's probably like a 35-year-old,
[03:19:00.660 --> 03:19:02.180]  but they all lie about their age.
[03:19:02.180 --> 03:19:09.740]  But again, the most basic fundamental pleasurable leisure pursuit, walking a dog in a European
[03:19:09.740 --> 03:19:15.380]  country, now you're even at risk if you do that because of this culture that we've imported.
[03:19:15.380 --> 03:19:17.700]  And it's just getting worse every single day.
[03:19:17.700 --> 03:19:18.900]  I'm going to go on to talk about it.
[03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:21.820]  I mean, let's just say, it looks like something out of a zombie movie.
[03:19:21.820 --> 03:19:26.380]  There's hundreds of these videos of them just grabbing trucks, grabbing families, dragging
[03:19:26.380 --> 03:19:27.380]  them out.
[03:19:27.380 --> 03:19:29.380]  There's raw footage of raping women.
[03:19:29.380 --> 03:19:35.140]  I mean, I sat there one night and watched, tapes, and I had to turn it off because I
[03:19:35.140 --> 03:19:36.420]  only watched like three of them.
[03:19:36.420 --> 03:19:43.900]  There's like 30-minute hour-long rape videos at concerts with like 15 men lined up, two
[03:19:43.900 --> 03:19:48.420]  men holding each arm and each leg, raping women, and the police do nothing.
[03:19:48.420 --> 03:19:53.780]  And you're watching them rape women, and it's like, it's an anti-racism event.
[03:19:53.780 --> 03:19:59.220]  So the Muslims go to those to rape the dingbat women who then make excuses for it, and it's
[03:19:59.220 --> 03:20:04.500]  been in the German news and the Stockholm news, they will say, I said a German rape
[03:20:04.500 --> 03:20:09.140]  me, or I said a, you know, I said a Swede rape me because I didn't want to be racist.
[03:20:09.140 --> 03:20:11.780]  They then say that a white man raped them.
[03:20:11.780 --> 03:20:15.060]  They don't just get raped by the precious Muslims.
[03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:18.860]  They then say that a German or a Swede did it, Paul.
[03:20:18.860 --> 03:20:24.180]  No, there was a case on, I think it was a train in Germany where a woman got raped
[03:20:24.180 --> 03:20:29.700]  by an Iraqi migrant and she refused to report it to police because she said, oh, he's had
[03:20:29.700 --> 03:20:32.620]  a difficult life getting over here from Iraq.
[03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:34.500]  So maybe I should just be nice to him.
[03:20:34.500 --> 03:20:40.300]  Alex, every woman I talked to says that Europe has completely changed from France to Germany,
[03:20:40.300 --> 03:20:43.740]  the other majors that you want to talk about, the harassment is there.
[03:20:43.740 --> 03:20:47.340]  The bottom line is liberals and leftists are going to get raped.
[03:20:47.340 --> 03:20:51.260]  They're the ones who are going to get harassed because they think everything's hunky-dory
[03:20:51.260 --> 03:20:52.860]  and that these people are going to tolerate.
[03:20:52.860 --> 03:20:57.820]  Yeah, imagine, these women in Sweden go to events where it's, you know, half Muslim
[03:20:57.820 --> 03:21:02.060]  men and then the rest of them are drugged out, Swede men, and they get raped.
[03:21:02.060 --> 03:21:03.780]  What do you think is going to happen?
[03:21:03.780 --> 03:21:05.900]  Every time they have them, there's mass rapes.
[03:21:05.900 --> 03:21:08.180]  These people are laughing at us.
[03:21:08.180 --> 03:21:14.500]  Now, the more hardcore ones think that they have the right to ask spoils, our western
[03:21:14.500 --> 03:21:16.620]  spoils, and that includes women.
[03:21:16.620 --> 03:21:18.620]  So you're going to get in Europe and it's already happening.
[03:21:18.620 --> 03:21:23.380]  If you're not covered up like the girl in Saudi Arabia that was hunted down and arrested
[03:21:23.380 --> 03:21:24.380]  for wearing a skirt.
[03:21:24.380 --> 03:21:28.940]  Yeah, that's why they wear hoods, folks, because you're fair game to be raped if you don't.
[03:21:28.940 --> 03:21:32.020]  And if you fight back, they're going to pour acid on your face or if you try to have a
[03:21:32.020 --> 03:21:38.020]  job or drive a car or walk a dog, they're going to show you women don't walk dogs, men
[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:42.100]  don't walk dogs, and women don't work, and women don't drive cars.
[03:21:42.100 --> 03:21:44.700]  And Linda Sarser said, you're going to like it.
[03:21:44.700 --> 03:21:46.940]  Yeah, that's what it's all about.
[03:21:46.940 --> 03:21:52.820]  And at least it's having some impact financially, Alex, because we had the article up today.
[03:21:52.820 --> 03:21:56.900]  The tourist industry in America was saying, oh, Trump's going to be disastrous for tourism.
[03:21:56.900 --> 03:21:58.620]  This is going to be horrible.
[03:21:58.620 --> 03:22:03.820]  Six months into his presidency, six, seven months, tourism in the United States is up
[03:22:03.820 --> 03:22:06.780]  five, six percent, hotel rooms are fuller.
[03:22:06.780 --> 03:22:08.580]  That's where it's collapsing, Alex.
[03:22:08.580 --> 03:22:13.460]  It's collapsing in France, Germany, in London, in Brussels, in all these cities.
[03:22:13.460 --> 03:22:17.500]  When they ask the tourists why they're not going there, why they, when they ask why hotel
[03:22:17.500 --> 03:22:23.940]  rooms in Paris have harmed since 2015, occupancy, they say migrants and terrorism.
[03:22:23.940 --> 03:22:24.940]  So it's hitting these.
[03:22:24.940 --> 03:22:26.100]  And Paul, let's expand on that.
[03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:29.260]  Let's expand on that.
[03:22:29.260 --> 03:22:31.860]  Your family had to leave France, you know, they got rid of the steel industry that your
[03:22:31.860 --> 03:22:32.860]  parents were involved in.
[03:22:32.860 --> 03:22:34.700]  They sold everything they had, moved to France.
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:37.300]  Had breakfast, had to leave there, went to another country now.
[03:22:37.300 --> 03:22:38.700]  This is real.
[03:22:38.700 --> 03:22:39.700]  This is happening.
[03:22:39.700 --> 03:22:40.700]  I'm going to get out here and let you take over.
[03:22:40.700 --> 03:22:41.780]  You're always doing a great job.
[03:22:41.780 --> 03:22:45.860]  It's just so incredible that they have 80 percent of their tourism in France down the
[03:22:45.860 --> 03:22:46.860]  last decade.
[03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:51.620]  As you said, most of that just since two years ago, it's accelerating.
[03:22:51.620 --> 03:22:57.900]  I was in Italy, in Rome, it looked like there was just feces all over the ground, North
[03:22:57.900 --> 03:23:03.580]  Africans everywhere, every tree, there's not a lot of trees in Rome, had like 20 people
[03:23:03.580 --> 03:23:07.660]  under it, just camping out, laying around, there was robberies everywhere.
[03:23:07.660 --> 03:23:09.420]  The police looked totally freaked out.
[03:23:09.420 --> 03:23:12.460]  There were gypsies everywhere trying to steal our bags.
[03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:16.060]  We had Romans running up trying to protect us, saying, watch out, a gypsy's behind you.
[03:23:16.060 --> 03:23:19.860]  This happened like 10 times, right, me sitting there with my wife.
[03:23:19.860 --> 03:23:23.700]  And not my ex-wife, my wife, I've been married for years, folks, you know, running up, you're
[03:23:23.700 --> 03:23:25.660]  grabbing all this other stuff.
[03:23:25.660 --> 03:23:30.140]  And it was just like insane asylum to witness all of this happening.
[03:23:30.140 --> 03:23:31.980]  And then you ask, what are the globalists doing?
[03:23:31.980 --> 03:23:36.980]  Like you did a video last week, George Clooney said Europe's too dangerous and has just sold
[03:23:36.980 --> 03:23:41.980]  all his mansions and is leaving when he's the one pushing for total open borders.
[03:23:41.980 --> 03:23:46.420]  Paul Watson, take over with that in a moment, but first, I didn't even really plug last
[03:23:46.420 --> 03:23:48.420]  hour, but a 30 second plug.

[03:26:15.820 --> 03:26:16.820]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:26:16.820 --> 03:26:20.860]  Yeah, I'll continue with what we were talking about regarding the migrant crisis because
[03:26:20.860 --> 03:26:25.940]  there was a big story out of RT today about what's happening in Germany, which of course
[03:26:25.940 --> 03:26:28.300]  took in 2 million migrants since 2015.
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:32.820]  At least Merkel said she would reverse that policy now it seems as though she's going
[03:26:32.820 --> 03:26:38.180]  ahead with it full steam anyway, this is out of RT sexual assaults and shocking violence
[03:26:38.180 --> 03:26:41.340]  involving migrants near German town fair.
[03:26:41.340 --> 03:26:47.260]  Now this was a thousand migrants attacking quite not a massive city.
[03:26:47.260 --> 03:26:52.700]  This is quite a, you know, medium sized town in Germany, a thousand migrants throwing bottles
[03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:58.060]  at the police, throwing bottles at festival goers, raping, assaulting women.
[03:26:58.060 --> 03:27:05.140]  Imagine having that visited on your little town fair out of nowhere, absolutely horrendous.
[03:27:05.140 --> 03:27:09.660]  In town summer fair turned violent over the weekend with multiple sexual assaults reported
[03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:14.540]  a group of dudes also attacked visitors and officers with police stating that many of
[03:27:14.540 --> 03:27:18.900]  the offenders were major my shock migrants and they were desperate the police.
[03:27:18.900 --> 03:27:22.700]  They were calling for backup from all the surrounding towns they had to call in riot
[03:27:22.700 --> 03:27:23.700]  police.
[03:27:23.700 --> 03:27:29.500]  The violence occurred while residents of Schaundorf in the southern German state of Baden-Wuttenburg
[03:27:29.500 --> 03:27:31.660]  celebrate the town's week long fair.
[03:27:31.660 --> 03:27:37.700]  However, while many were enjoying carnival rides and German beer, we can't have that.
[03:27:37.700 --> 03:27:41.540]  On Friday, the first day of the fair, at least three sexual assaults occurred in the town
[03:27:41.540 --> 03:27:44.100]  resulting in the detention of an Iraqi suspect.
[03:27:44.100 --> 03:27:46.900]  So they only caught one guy as a result of this.
[03:27:46.900 --> 03:27:51.980]  Police reported three incidents of sexual harassment of women and men at a marketplace.
[03:27:51.980 --> 03:27:55.780]  In one case, an Iraqi suspect has been deterred.
[03:27:55.780 --> 03:28:00.460]  The police statement said a 17 year old girl was the victim of a separate sexual assault
[03:28:00.460 --> 03:28:05.420]  after three men held her and grabbed her buttocks outside the town's main rail station, which
[03:28:05.420 --> 03:28:07.980]  of course is where they always seem to congregate.
[03:28:07.980 --> 03:28:14.860]  Meanwhile, around 1000, 1000 youths and young men gathered at the grounds of Schaundorf
[03:28:14.860 --> 03:28:19.860]  Castle on Saturday, throwing bottles at festival goers and police.
[03:28:19.860 --> 03:28:24.340]  The violence faced by police was shocking, the police spokesperson said as quoted by
[03:28:24.340 --> 03:28:30.060]  German media, imagine you're you're in this medium town, medium sized town, you're going
[03:28:30.060 --> 03:28:35.300]  to a festival, you're going to a town fair next to a castle.
[03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:37.500]  You think you're going to have fun, you're going to have a good time, it's going to be
[03:28:37.500 --> 03:28:40.900]  a community occasion, you're going to talk to your neighbors and friends, you're going
[03:28:40.900 --> 03:28:47.500]  to have a laugh, a thousand frigging criminals show up and start pelting you with bottles.
[03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:51.860]  That's the cultural enrichment that Germans are experiencing right now.
[03:28:51.860 --> 03:28:53.900]  This is just one story out of many.
[03:28:53.900 --> 03:29:00.620]  I talked to you before about what was happening in Vienna, Austria, where a middle-aged woman
[03:29:00.620 --> 03:29:06.580]  was walking her dog and had to be hospitalized following a brutal beating in broad daylight
[03:29:06.580 --> 03:29:13.140]  by a veiled Somali asylum seeker, offended, offended by her pet dogs.
[03:29:13.140 --> 03:29:17.620]  We've seen this in London and other cities where people try to get taxis and they try
[03:29:17.620 --> 03:29:20.540]  to take, you know, small dogs in the taxis.
[03:29:20.540 --> 03:29:26.140]  Would normally be no problem whatsoever, over the past five, six years, it's suddenly become
[03:29:26.140 --> 03:29:27.140]  a problem.
[03:29:27.140 --> 03:29:28.300]  I wonder why that is?
[03:29:28.300 --> 03:29:32.860]  Well, it's because Uber is basically a Pakistani monopoly in London.
[03:29:32.860 --> 03:29:35.820]  They don't like dogs, they're offended by dogs.
[03:29:35.820 --> 03:29:39.900]  You're not going to even walk your dog anymore, you'll be attacked, and rightly so because
[03:29:39.900 --> 03:29:42.780]  they have the moral high ground, don't they?
[03:29:42.780 --> 03:29:44.820]  Absolutely despicable.
[03:29:44.820 --> 03:29:49.300]  The victim, named only as Ingrid T, described how she was talking with neighbors at the
[03:29:49.300 --> 03:29:55.700]  gate of her garden accompanied by dogs, the deaf, almost blind, three-legged, collie mix.
[03:29:55.700 --> 03:29:56.700]  We're on the march.
[03:29:56.700 --> 03:29:57.700]  Fishing piece for the long-siders.
[03:29:57.700 --> 03:29:59.500]  We have tires on the run.
[03:29:59.500 --> 03:30:07.620]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:07.620 --> 03:30:12.340]  Do you remember Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican speaker of the House in history?
[03:30:12.340 --> 03:30:15.620]  Also the highest-ranking U.S. politician to be sent to prison?
[03:30:15.620 --> 03:30:19.500]  Hastert was a small-town wrestling coach in Illinois when he was what Judge Thomas Durkin
[03:30:19.500 --> 03:30:23.220]  of the federal court described as a serial child molester.
[03:30:23.220 --> 03:30:27.740]  Because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has run out, Hastert
[03:30:27.740 --> 03:30:31.940]  was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in, if you can believe that.
[03:30:31.940 --> 03:30:36.900]  He did go down for illegal hush money to the tune of at least $3.5 million.
[03:30:36.900 --> 03:30:43.180]  He was fined $250,000 and sentenced to 15 months in prison, hardly justice.
[03:30:43.180 --> 03:30:46.780]  And now, the serial child molester is free once again.
[03:30:46.780 --> 03:30:51.980]  After serving only 13 months, Judge Durkin also said, there's nothing more disturbing
[03:30:51.980 --> 03:30:55.900]  than having a child molester and speaker of the House in the same sentence.
[03:30:55.900 --> 03:30:56.900]  I disagree.
[03:30:56.900 --> 03:31:01.100]  There's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one year
[03:31:01.100 --> 03:31:02.100]  in prison.
[03:31:02.100 --> 03:31:04.060]  Won't see that on CNN.
[03:31:04.060 --> 03:31:06.900]  For Infowars.com, this is Elwin Schreuer.
[03:31:06.900 --> 03:31:10.940]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[03:31:10.940 --> 03:31:16.060]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:16.060 --> 03:31:20.100]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:24.460]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:24.460 --> 03:31:29.780]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:29.780 --> 03:31:36.180]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.

[03:31:41.300 --> 03:31:43.420]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:43.420 --> 03:31:47.740]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[03:31:47.740 --> 03:31:50.300]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:50.300 --> 03:31:55.140]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:32:03.140 --> 03:32:04.900]  my favorite coffee.
[03:32:04.900 --> 03:32:08.060]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:32:08.060 --> 03:32:11.980]  The reason InfowarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want
[03:32:11.980 --> 03:32:13.420]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[03:32:13.420 --> 03:32:14.420]  I take this.
[03:32:14.420 --> 03:32:15.580]  My family takes this.
[03:32:15.580 --> 03:32:19.100]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going
[03:32:19.100 --> 03:32:20.100]  to find anywhere.
[03:32:20.100 --> 03:32:24.380]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:32:24.380 --> 03:32:28.940]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:32:28.940 --> 03:32:30.180]  I don't feel good.
[03:32:30.180 --> 03:32:33.780]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:32:33.780 --> 03:32:36.580]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my superfemale.
[03:32:36.580 --> 03:32:42.660]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:32:42.660 --> 03:32:48.460]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is a little luxurious once
[03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:49.460]  again.
[03:32:49.460 --> 03:32:51.100]  So obviously, a superfemale is amazing.
[03:32:51.100 --> 03:32:52.100]  I love it.
[03:32:52.100 --> 03:32:54.780]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[03:32:54.780 --> 03:32:55.780]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:32:55.780 --> 03:33:00.580]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's nascent iodine Survival
[03:33:00.580 --> 03:33:01.580]  Shield X2.
[03:33:01.580 --> 03:33:03.380]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:33:03.380 --> 03:33:05.380]  So win-win, InfowarsLife.com.
[03:33:05.380 --> 03:33:20.380]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now
[03:33:20.380 --> 03:33:23.380]  your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:23.380 --> 03:33:28.500]  We are back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:28.500 --> 03:33:33.540]  So I'm going to get back into the news shortly, but I want to tell you about the 30% to 40%
[03:33:33.540 --> 03:33:34.540]  off.
[03:33:34.540 --> 03:33:39.140]  Huge discount on Infowars Select's storeable food at Infowarsstore.com for a limited time
[03:33:39.140 --> 03:33:40.140]  only.
[03:33:40.140 --> 03:33:45.900]  Shelf life of 25 years with all the instability that's taking place in the world right now.
[03:33:45.900 --> 03:33:48.500]  Why wouldn't you have this backup insurance policy?
[03:33:48.500 --> 03:33:54.260]  I wish I could get my hands on this, given how inflated storeable food prices are over
[03:33:54.260 --> 03:33:56.660]  here in Europe.
[03:33:56.660 --> 03:33:57.660]  Excellent value.
[03:33:57.660 --> 03:34:02.060]  If you don't need it, you can just eat it anyway after 25 years.
[03:34:02.060 --> 03:34:03.660]  So you're not even going to lose money on this.
[03:34:03.660 --> 03:34:05.500]  It's an insurance policy.
[03:34:05.500 --> 03:34:11.060]  There's a reason FEMA reports predict up to the 395% increase in food prices that could
[03:34:11.060 --> 03:34:12.860]  trigger mass unrest.
[03:34:12.860 --> 03:34:16.500]  By taking advantage of this, you lock in the savings now.
[03:34:16.500 --> 03:34:19.140]  Government has vast food reserves.
[03:34:19.140 --> 03:34:22.060]  Nobody calls government tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists, do they?
[03:34:22.060 --> 03:34:23.260]  Nobody calls FEMA that.
[03:34:23.260 --> 03:34:30.180]  Oh, but God forbid you should have some storeable food in your garage that lasts for 25 years.
[03:34:30.180 --> 03:34:31.180]  You're a cuckoo.
[03:34:31.180 --> 03:34:32.540]  Well, now it's an insurance policy.
[03:34:32.540 --> 03:34:39.380]  It makes complete sense, and it's available right now for 30% to 40% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:34:39.380 --> 03:34:41.500]  Shelf life of 25 years.

[03:34:57.180 --> 03:35:01.620]  We're under constant attack from the mainstream media from the deep state.

[03:35:05.660 --> 03:35:11.340]  We're not beholden to Gulf state dictatorships like CNN or Big Fat Checks from George Soros.
[03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:12.820]  Like media matters.
[03:35:12.820 --> 03:35:17.740]  We rely on you, which is why we're able to maintain a complete independence.
[03:35:17.740 --> 03:35:19.220]  We're not controlled by anyone.
[03:35:19.220 --> 03:35:23.820]  We're not controlled by the Kremlin, by the way, that silly little investigation died
[03:35:23.820 --> 03:35:26.700]  to death pretty quickly, didn't it?
[03:35:26.700 --> 03:35:31.060]  Support us today by getting the products free shipping store-wide at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:31.060 --> 03:35:37.500]  Talking about the migrant situation in Europe before the break, which continues to escalate,
[03:35:37.500 --> 03:35:42.500]  especially in terms of Italy, where they're being completely deluged, George Clooney's
[03:35:42.500 --> 03:35:47.380]  getting the hell out of there after he advocated the very policies that caused the crisis in
[03:35:47.380 --> 03:35:49.220]  the first place.
[03:35:49.220 --> 03:35:56.580]  Now we learn tourism up under Trump collapses in Europe following terror and migrant invasion.
[03:35:56.580 --> 03:35:58.980]  Now they were really pessimistic.
[03:35:58.980 --> 03:36:04.180]  All the tourism industry reps when Trump was elected president, they were saying this was
[03:36:04.180 --> 03:36:06.420]  doomsday for the tourist industry.
[03:36:06.420 --> 03:36:07.900]  It would lead to massive declines.
[03:36:07.900 --> 03:36:10.980]  It turns out the exact opposite has happened.
[03:36:10.980 --> 03:36:13.100]  Tourism is up in the United States.
[03:36:13.100 --> 03:36:16.740]  Wall Street Journal reports, latest numbers from the US Travel Association's travel
[03:36:16.740 --> 03:36:23.580]  trends index showed 6.6% growth in international travel to the US in April, 5% growth in May
[03:36:23.580 --> 03:36:27.020]  compared with the same months last year.
[03:36:27.020 --> 03:36:34.060]  Hotel occupancy in the United States for the first six months of 2017 is also, quote, higher
[03:36:34.060 --> 03:36:37.260]  than it has ever been before.
[03:36:37.260 --> 03:36:41.940]  Higher than it has ever been before, according to Jan Freitag, senior vice president with
[03:36:41.940 --> 03:36:48.260]  STR, you look at visits to museums in New York, they're up on the same period last year.
[03:36:48.260 --> 03:36:53.260]  You look at the theme park gateway, Florida and Orlando International Airport, they're
[03:36:53.260 --> 03:36:58.380]  also reporting growth in domestic and international passengers.
[03:36:58.380 --> 03:37:04.300]  So everything is hunky dory right now with the US tourism industry.
[03:37:04.300 --> 03:37:08.460]  Not so much the case in Europe where we've had a wave of terror attacks, we've had mass
[03:37:08.460 --> 03:37:11.820]  migration and it's had an impact.
[03:37:11.820 --> 03:37:16.460]  Now, you know, leftists in Europe might not like to talk about it, they might like to
[03:37:16.460 --> 03:37:21.420]  virtue signal all day while they're literally walking past open air.
[03:37:21.420 --> 03:37:26.980]  Migrant camps on the streets of Paris with detritus and litter everywhere, crime rampant.
[03:37:26.980 --> 03:37:32.420]  But if you look at international visitors to Europe, that's collapsing as well.
[03:37:32.420 --> 03:37:36.900]  Germany, of course, normally seen as quite a safe place to visit.
[03:37:36.900 --> 03:37:42.660]  Since they imported 2 million migrants, they've experienced declines of up to 40% of tourists
[03:37:42.660 --> 03:37:46.820]  visiting from countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
[03:37:46.820 --> 03:37:52.900]  10% drop in visitors to Germany from the United States, so they're experiencing it.
[03:37:52.900 --> 03:37:56.820]  You look at Brussels, of course, we have the airport, the subway attack in Brussels at
[03:37:56.820 --> 03:37:59.020]  the start of 2016.
[03:37:59.020 --> 03:38:04.980]  Numerous terror plots linked to the city's infamous Molenbeek Islamic ghetto.
[03:38:04.980 --> 03:38:11.220]  And in Brussels is collapsing, weekend hotel revenue has dropped 22% and occupancy rates
[03:38:11.220 --> 03:38:12.220]  are down 10%.
[03:38:12.220 --> 03:38:18.340]  You look at London, which before the past, what, three months was seen as a safer destination
[03:38:18.340 --> 03:38:20.980]  than some of the other European capitals.
[03:38:20.980 --> 03:38:27.740]  Even before the terrorist attacks in Manchester and the London bridge attack, visitor numbers
[03:38:27.740 --> 03:38:33.460]  to the English capital's most popular hotspots were dropping, a million fewer people visited
[03:38:33.460 --> 03:38:39.220]  the British Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2016 compared
[03:38:39.220 --> 03:38:40.660]  to the previous year.
[03:38:40.660 --> 03:38:46.340]  And according to Bernard Donoghue, director of Albert tourists are avoiding central London
[03:38:46.340 --> 03:38:48.460]  due to security fears.
[03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:51.380]  This was before the Manchester attack.
[03:38:51.380 --> 03:38:53.140]  This was before the Westminster attack.
[03:38:53.140 --> 03:38:56.740]  This was before the attack in London bridge.
[03:38:56.740 --> 03:39:00.380]  This was before the spate of acid attacks I talked about earlier.
[03:39:00.380 --> 03:39:05.540]  This was before the stabbings, which are through the roof, reports of stabbings, people dying
[03:39:05.540 --> 03:39:09.180]  nearly every single day now in London.
[03:39:09.180 --> 03:39:13.860]  Even before all that, tourism was already collapsing.
[03:39:13.860 --> 03:39:17.820]  The owner of Alton towers and Madame Tussaud said the most recent terror attacks in the
[03:39:17.820 --> 03:39:21.900]  UK have resulted in a further deterioration in domestic demand.
[03:39:21.900 --> 03:39:24.420]  So it's only going lower.
[03:39:24.420 --> 03:39:25.420]  Nice.
[03:39:25.420 --> 03:39:31.940]  Of course, the truck attack back in July 2016, after that, and in fact, before it as well,
[03:39:31.940 --> 03:39:36.260]  foreign tourists began shunning France in even greater numbers with hotel occupancy rates
[03:39:36.260 --> 03:39:44.020]  in Paris halved compared to 2015, literally cut in half, 1.5 million fewer French and
[03:39:44.020 --> 03:39:49.020]  international tourists visited Paris in 2016 compared to 2015.
[03:39:49.020 --> 03:39:53.700]  Of course, we had a number of other terror attacks in Paris so far this year, too.
[03:39:53.700 --> 03:39:59.140]  You look at Italy, visitors to Rome are dropping, they're citing terror fears.
[03:39:59.140 --> 03:40:03.900]  You look at Sweden, they've got a government program in Sweden of turning holiday resorts
[03:40:03.900 --> 03:40:06.780]  into migrant centers, into migrant camps.
[03:40:06.780 --> 03:40:12.780]  Now there's no room for people who want a vacation there, like you ever would, but still,
[03:40:12.780 --> 03:40:16.180]  there's no room because they've turned all the hotels over to migrant camps.
[03:40:16.180 --> 03:40:22.020]  So you look at every single major European country that has accepted large numbers of
[03:40:22.020 --> 03:40:28.460]  migrants, tourism is on its knees in America, it's doing very well.
[03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:29.460]  Thank you very much.
[03:40:29.460 --> 03:40:33.900]  Even though they said it was a doomsday scenario with Trump getting in, that he would cause
[03:40:33.900 --> 03:40:38.780]  tourism to collapse somehow, like tourists wouldn't want to visit because they would
[03:40:38.780 --> 03:40:42.300]  be sanctifying his presidency or whatever.
[03:40:42.300 --> 03:40:47.420]  Actually turns out that America is rising in terms of tourism, Europe is collapsing because
[03:40:47.420 --> 03:40:54.420]  of the insane disastrous policies of our leaders, which are now quite visible, quite
[03:40:54.420 --> 03:40:59.940]  evident on the streets of Europe if you visit any major capital city, and in fact, many
[03:40:59.940 --> 03:41:07.940]  smaller and medium-sized towns, as I talked about earlier, with even dog walkers in Vienna
[03:41:07.940 --> 03:41:14.180]  being attacked because dogs are unclean and that's not part of their culture.
[03:41:14.180 --> 03:41:19.780]  We have to adapt to their culture, they don't have to adapt to ours.
[03:41:19.780 --> 03:41:27.780]  Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, gender stereotypes and adverts to be banned, we can't show women
[03:41:27.780 --> 03:41:33.700]  as being attractive, that's haram, we can't allow that, that's offensive, might offend
[03:41:33.700 --> 03:41:37.140]  some people, might offend Muslims, might offend feminists.
[03:41:37.140 --> 03:41:40.620]  Adverts reinforcing gender stereotypes are set to be banned because they can restrict
[03:41:40.620 --> 03:41:47.180]  choices, aspirations and opportunities in the latest 1984 development in British society.
[03:41:47.180 --> 03:41:51.700]  Adverts portraying women having sole responsibility for the housework looks set to be axed by
[03:41:51.700 --> 03:41:54.820]  the advertising standards authority.
[03:41:54.820 --> 03:42:02.060]  What are they going to do for all the adverts that include cleaning products, detergents,
[03:42:02.060 --> 03:42:05.540]  dishwashers, washing machines, mobs?
[03:42:05.540 --> 03:42:06.540]  What are they going to do?
[03:42:06.540 --> 03:42:11.580]  They have to have a man in every single advert just to comply with this ridiculous standard.
[03:42:11.580 --> 03:42:17.660]  Oh, are they going to stop men from being portrayed as dumb oaths in adverts as they
[03:42:17.660 --> 03:42:20.300]  are on a routine basis, not to mention sitcoms?
[03:42:20.300 --> 03:42:24.700]  No, they're not going to stop that, that's not going to come under this, they probably
[03:42:24.700 --> 03:42:31.260]  had like a handful of complaints, probably in a Reebok ad, ironically enough, given
[03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:35.660]  that Reebok is lecturing everyone about, don't give compliments to women.
[03:42:35.660 --> 03:42:42.780]  Meanwhile, literally almost every single advert is a woman's but, unprominent display.
[03:42:42.780 --> 03:42:48.420]  But because a few people got offended, now they can't show women as being sole responsible
[03:42:48.420 --> 03:42:50.940]  for household duties.
[03:42:50.940 --> 03:42:59.820]  Even though, back here in reality, what, 90, 95% of people watching those adverts with
[03:42:59.820 --> 03:43:03.900]  the products that will appeal to them, they're going to be women.
[03:43:03.900 --> 03:43:07.820]  You can't just change the nature of reality because some people got offended.
[03:43:07.820 --> 03:43:10.460]  I mean, my God.
[03:43:10.460 --> 03:43:17.020]  So they're going to literally have to have gender equality in adverts, the cleaners,
[03:43:17.020 --> 03:43:22.140]  you know, for dishwasher tablets, the laundry powder, they're going to have to have men
[03:43:22.140 --> 03:43:28.380]  in every single advert because of this ridiculous 1984 style ruling.
[03:43:28.380 --> 03:43:34.820]  And of course, it goes back to a couple of years ago, when Sadiq Khan basically banned
[03:43:34.820 --> 03:43:39.380]  the protein world beach body ad because that might cause offence.
[03:43:39.380 --> 03:43:44.860]  It was an ad that simply showed an attractive toned woman encouraging other women to be
[03:43:44.860 --> 03:43:46.820]  healthy, to have healthy bodies.
[03:43:46.820 --> 03:43:48.380]  No, we can't have that.
[03:43:48.380 --> 03:43:49.380]  That was banned.
[03:43:49.380 --> 03:43:53.500]  Now it's led to this, absolutely incredible.
[03:43:53.500 --> 03:43:59.260]  This is a form of creeping Sharia law, again, it's feminist aligning with Islamists being
[03:43:59.260 --> 03:44:04.660]  offended by something because in the case of feminists, most of them are social failures
[03:44:04.660 --> 03:44:06.340]  completely out of shape.
[03:44:06.340 --> 03:44:09.340]  They literally get triggered by attractive, thin women.
[03:44:09.340 --> 03:44:12.700]  Now we have Reebok saying that you can't compliment women.
[03:44:12.700 --> 03:44:13.700]  Yeah.
[03:44:13.700 --> 03:44:14.700]  Good luck with that.
[03:44:14.700 --> 03:44:20.900]  Saudi Arabian miniskirt wearing model collude arrested by police in Riyadh.
[03:44:20.900 --> 03:44:26.060]  Again, this was yesterday they were on the hunt for her after she posted some videos on
[03:44:26.060 --> 03:44:31.580]  her Snapchat, walking through a national monument in Saudi Arabia with a t-shirt and a miniskirt.
[03:44:31.580 --> 03:44:35.380]  It wasn't even a miniskirt, it was just a normal skirt, God forbid.
[03:44:35.380 --> 03:44:37.380]  Oh, and there was a debate.
[03:44:37.380 --> 03:44:41.140]  This is how the mainstream media, even in the West covered it, there's a debate.
[03:44:41.140 --> 03:44:43.940]  Is it correct for them to go and arrest her?
[03:44:43.940 --> 03:44:49.620]  You know, she is breaking the law, absolutely insane narrative, absolutely insane.
[03:44:49.620 --> 03:44:54.860]  Kind of like the Otto Warmbier narrative in North Korea, where he was literally, you know,
[03:44:54.860 --> 03:45:00.460]  held in solitary confinement, tortured for what was it over a year, came back, died as
[03:45:00.460 --> 03:45:03.260]  a result of being in a coma.
[03:45:03.260 --> 03:45:04.460]  Absolutely horrific case.
[03:45:04.460 --> 03:45:06.740]  Oh, but what did the mainstream media say?
[03:45:06.740 --> 03:45:10.660]  He did steal a poster.
[03:45:10.660 --> 03:45:13.540]  The same narrative here, oh, she did break the law.
[03:45:13.540 --> 03:45:18.180]  The law's frigging stupid, has no place in the 21st century.
[03:45:18.180 --> 03:45:20.180]  There's no debate over this.
[03:45:20.180 --> 03:45:22.660]  Saudi Arabia is a cancer upon the planet.
[03:45:22.660 --> 03:45:23.660]  That's the debate.
[03:45:23.660 --> 03:45:24.660]  That's where it starts.
[03:45:24.660 --> 03:45:25.660]  That's where it ends.
[03:45:25.660 --> 03:45:28.660]  Don't arrest people for wearing skirts and t-shirts.
[03:45:28.660 --> 03:45:34.700]  That's dictatorial, that's authoritarian, has no place in modern society.
[03:45:34.700 --> 03:45:35.700]  That's reprehensible.
[03:45:35.700 --> 03:45:41.020]  Oh, and all the feminists are out castigating the Saudi authorities, aren't they?
[03:45:41.020 --> 03:45:42.380]  No, none of them are.
[03:45:42.380 --> 03:45:44.380]  They're completely frigging silent.
[03:45:44.380 --> 03:45:50.420]  Now this woman's being arrested, God knows what will happen to her.
[03:45:50.420 --> 03:45:55.060]  The video first shared on Snapchat shows her walking around in an empty historic fort,
[03:45:55.060 --> 03:46:00.420]  the village north of the capital, in the capital of Saudi Arabia in the desert region of Najid,
[03:46:00.420 --> 03:46:04.500]  where many of Saudi Arabia's most conservative tribes and families are from.
[03:46:04.500 --> 03:46:06.820]  So this was an outrage.
[03:46:06.820 --> 03:46:08.380]  How dare she?
[03:46:08.380 --> 03:46:13.220]  She was hunted down with the aid of social media, with the aid of the Islamists.
[03:46:13.220 --> 03:46:17.660]  Now she's being arrested, and the media was all, oh, there's a debate over this.
[03:46:17.660 --> 03:46:18.660]  Is it right?
[03:46:18.660 --> 03:46:19.660]  Is it wrong?
[03:46:19.660 --> 03:46:21.940]  Of course, it's frigging wrong.
[03:46:21.940 --> 03:46:27.220]  Absolutely insane that they would even raise that as a narrative.
[03:46:27.220 --> 03:46:28.220]  Talked about this earlier.
[03:46:28.220 --> 03:46:29.300]  This is out of Sky News.
[03:46:29.300 --> 03:46:35.300]  Noxious substance thrown at paramedic after men flag her down on 999 call.
[03:46:35.300 --> 03:46:39.660]  There wasn't even a, if there were stealing things, at least you could see it from that
[03:46:39.660 --> 03:46:40.660]  perspective.
[03:46:40.660 --> 03:46:47.220]  There wasn't even a criminal motive here, throwing acid in people's faces for fun.
[03:46:47.220 --> 03:46:51.660]  This is cultural enrichment, a paramedic who had a noxious substance thrown in her face
[03:46:51.660 --> 03:46:56.420]  as she rushed to a 999 call, it's called her mass attack as cowards.
[03:46:56.420 --> 03:47:00.180]  And yes, in some cases, this is criminals doing this.
[03:47:00.180 --> 03:47:01.820]  I'll just insert that.
[03:47:01.820 --> 03:47:05.540]  Not all Muslims provides, though, for all you bought her leftist that demand it every
[03:47:05.540 --> 03:47:08.020]  time you talk about anything like this.
[03:47:08.020 --> 03:47:13.420]  But again, you look at the cases, the vast majority, the clear majority of cases of acid
[03:47:13.420 --> 03:47:17.540]  attacks in London are in Newham and Tower Hamlets.
[03:47:17.540 --> 03:47:19.780]  What do Newham and Tower Hamlets have in common?
[03:47:19.780 --> 03:47:24.620]  Oh yeah, they're Islamic ghettos, largest population of Muslims out of the entirety
[03:47:24.620 --> 03:47:27.580]  of London live in those two boroughs.
[03:47:27.580 --> 03:47:31.260]  There's also a huge spike in acid attacks in a place called Barking, where the Muslim
[03:47:31.260 --> 03:47:35.140]  population has trebled in the last 10 years.
[03:47:35.140 --> 03:47:37.100]  Just to go incident.
[03:47:37.100 --> 03:47:42.780]  The 32-year-old paramedic was alone and on her way to help a man with chest pains when
[03:47:42.780 --> 03:47:46.660]  she was flagged down in North London at 1.30 a.m. on Sunday.
[03:47:46.660 --> 03:47:50.780]  She was stopped by three men who appeared to be in distress, though they faked some kind
[03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:53.460]  of emergency just to get her attention.
[03:47:53.460 --> 03:47:58.380]  When she stopped and wound down her window, they pulled bandanas over their faces.
[03:47:58.380 --> 03:47:59.380]  She says, it was horrible.
[03:47:59.380 --> 03:48:00.940]  I didn't know what was going to happen to me.
[03:48:00.940 --> 03:48:03.300]  It all happened very quickly.
[03:48:03.300 --> 03:48:07.260]  One of them threw liquid out of a plastic bottle at me, the window was only open a few
[03:48:07.260 --> 03:48:10.020]  inches, but the liquid went on my face, neck, and chest.
[03:48:10.020 --> 03:48:15.100]  Now, of course, when they say acid attacks, it conjures up some idea that they've cooked
[03:48:15.100 --> 03:48:20.020]  up some, you know, difficult to make corrosive substance in a lab.
[03:48:20.020 --> 03:48:22.180]  No, this is bleach.
[03:48:22.180 --> 03:48:28.060]  They're just buying cleaning products from the shop and squirting them in people's faces
[03:48:28.060 --> 03:48:29.900]  for fun.
[03:48:29.900 --> 03:48:31.260]  This is what's happening.
[03:48:31.260 --> 03:48:33.180]  So you can't just ban bleach.
[03:48:33.180 --> 03:48:34.780]  That's not the way to solve it again.
[03:48:34.780 --> 03:48:37.820]  You hear all these ridiculous ideas for solutions.
[03:48:37.820 --> 03:48:42.260]  Oh, Sadiq Khan, the Muslim mayor of London came out and said, we're going to have a zero
[03:48:42.260 --> 03:48:44.900]  tolerance approach to acid attacks.
[03:48:44.900 --> 03:48:45.900]  Great.
[03:48:45.900 --> 03:48:49.100]  So, so you so you were tolerating them before.
[03:48:49.100 --> 03:48:50.100]  Oh, great.
[03:48:50.100 --> 03:48:51.100]  Fantastic.
[03:48:51.100 --> 03:48:56.540]  Now we are finally having zero tolerance, meaningless, completely meaningless.
[03:48:56.540 --> 03:49:00.980]  You're not going to stop this by banning people from buying bleach.
[03:49:00.980 --> 03:49:03.940]  You're always going to be able to get frigging cleaning products.
[03:49:03.940 --> 03:49:05.900]  This is about the culture we're importing.
[03:49:05.900 --> 03:49:09.780]  This is about the individuals who have been ghettoized, who aren't being integrated into
[03:49:09.780 --> 03:49:10.780]  society.
[03:49:10.780 --> 03:49:16.300]  This is about the policies our leaders have imposed on us with mass uncontrolled immigration.
[03:49:16.300 --> 03:49:17.300]  That's what it's about.
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:22.060]  And yes, some of it is just criminals, but a great percentage of it is Muslims in these
[03:49:22.060 --> 03:49:25.980]  Islamic ghettos of their culture.
[03:49:25.980 --> 03:49:30.340]  You've seen the pictures disfigured women out the Middle East, you know, if they're
[03:49:30.340 --> 03:49:35.660]  accused of having affairs, if they're accused of looking at a man twice, God forbid, they
[03:49:35.660 --> 03:49:37.780]  get acid attacked.
[03:49:37.780 --> 03:49:43.580]  If not on a killed, and now we're seeing it, basically, there's a case, several cases
[03:49:43.580 --> 03:49:47.340]  now every single week in London.
[03:49:47.340 --> 03:49:49.980]  Oh, but now we're going to have zero tolerance for it.
[03:49:49.980 --> 03:49:50.980]  Oh, great.
[03:49:50.980 --> 03:49:51.980]  Thank you very much.
[03:49:51.980 --> 03:49:57.740]  Of course, Alex covered this earlier, Washington Post worries about Islamophobia after Somali
[03:49:57.740 --> 03:50:00.540]  cop kills white woman.
[03:50:00.540 --> 03:50:02.780]  So again, no explanation for this shooting.
[03:50:02.780 --> 03:50:08.580]  She was basically talking to the Somali cop's colleague that was sat in a squad car.
[03:50:08.580 --> 03:50:12.980]  The woman, a 40 year old Australian yoga teacher was in her pajamas.
[03:50:12.980 --> 03:50:17.500]  She had reported a crime in an upscale Minneapolis neighborhood.
[03:50:17.500 --> 03:50:18.780]  The cops arrived.
[03:50:18.780 --> 03:50:22.460]  She was talking to them through the squad car window.
[03:50:22.460 --> 03:50:28.300]  According to the report, the Somali cop who has been under investigation for prior abuse
[03:50:28.300 --> 03:50:33.380]  leaned over from the passenger side, shot her multiple times.
[03:50:33.380 --> 03:50:35.020]  Absolutely horrific case.
[03:50:35.020 --> 03:50:39.660]  No real explanation as to what happened as to what caused this.
[03:50:39.660 --> 03:50:42.740]  And what's the debate amongst the mainstream media?
[03:50:42.740 --> 03:50:47.460]  Is it should this copy immediately suspended while investigating this, what the hell is
[03:50:47.460 --> 03:50:48.460]  going on here?
[03:50:48.460 --> 03:50:54.740]  No, it's some people on right wing blogs are being mean to Muslims on Twitter.
[03:50:54.740 --> 03:50:58.660]  That's literally the narrative they've come out with yet again.
[03:50:58.660 --> 03:51:03.260]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live in the final segment after the break.
[03:51:03.260 --> 03:51:06.740]  Breaking news at info wars dot com don't go away.
[03:51:06.740 --> 03:51:09.540]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:09.540 --> 03:51:11.580]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[03:51:11.580 --> 03:51:13.460]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[03:51:13.460 --> 03:51:18.300]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep on short walks to your legs get aches and pains.
[03:51:18.300 --> 03:51:22.380]  Is your memory worse than it used to be ankles that swell late in the day?
[03:51:22.380 --> 03:51:24.380]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[03:51:24.380 --> 03:51:30.180]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial
[03:51:30.180 --> 03:51:31.180]  blockages.
[03:51:31.180 --> 03:51:34.500]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Extendivite.
[03:51:34.500 --> 03:51:36.660]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[03:51:36.660 --> 03:51:40.100]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.

[03:52:06.020 --> 03:52:09.060]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[03:52:09.060 --> 03:52:13.220]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:52:13.220 --> 03:52:17.820]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[03:52:17.820 --> 03:52:20.580]  narrative over and over again.
[03:52:20.580 --> 03:52:24.340]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:52:24.340 --> 03:52:30.180]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia
[03:52:30.180 --> 03:52:36.020]  and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully
[03:52:36.020 --> 03:52:41.420]  and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their
[03:52:41.420 --> 03:52:44.340]  jobs and stop the madness.
[03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:48.380]  And when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:52:48.380 --> 03:52:54.980]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[03:52:54.980 --> 03:52:59.420]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[03:52:59.420 --> 03:53:05.380]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.

[03:55:12.100 --> 03:55:13.100]  Final few news stories here.
[03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:17.860]  I was talking about the events in Minneapolis, the woman shot by the Somali cop.
[03:55:17.860 --> 03:55:23.540]  Again, he was the poster child for multiculturalism and integration, even though he's under investigation
[03:55:23.540 --> 03:55:25.380]  for several other incidents.
[03:55:25.380 --> 03:55:29.580]  Looked like he may have shot a woman, an innocent woman in cold blood.
[03:55:29.580 --> 03:55:35.340]  The main concern of the Washington Post is people saying mean things about Muslims on
[03:55:35.340 --> 03:55:36.340]  Twitter.
[03:55:36.340 --> 03:55:41.820]  But even further than that, they literally say people criticizing Islam.
[03:55:41.820 --> 03:55:43.220]  We can't have that, can we?
[03:55:43.220 --> 03:55:47.340]  In fact, I'll read you straight from the Washington Post.
[03:55:47.340 --> 03:55:52.380]  This is how the Washington Post reported to a 40 year old woman being gunned down in cold
[03:55:52.380 --> 03:55:53.380]  blood.
[03:55:53.380 --> 03:55:55.300]  What do you think is the primary concern?
[03:55:55.300 --> 03:56:02.060]  Already, hateful posts criticizing Islam and Sharia law are filling social media in response
[03:56:02.060 --> 03:56:03.660]  to the police shooting.
[03:56:03.660 --> 03:56:07.180]  Several far right blogs feature sensational headlines that blame the officers ethnicity
[03:56:07.180 --> 03:56:08.980]  for the daily use of force.
[03:56:08.980 --> 03:56:16.180]  So they're more concerned about people on Twitter, quote, criticizing Islam and Sharia
[03:56:16.180 --> 03:56:17.180]  law.
[03:56:17.180 --> 03:56:21.780]  That's literally a quote direct from the article.
[03:56:21.780 --> 03:56:25.100]  That's more important than a woman being gunned down in cold blood.
[03:56:25.100 --> 03:56:29.140]  Again, we see this after every single massive terror attack.
[03:56:29.140 --> 03:56:34.220]  No concern, no real concern, no genuine concern about little girls being blown to pieces by
[03:56:34.220 --> 03:56:35.220]  terrorists.
[03:56:35.220 --> 03:56:36.220]  No.
[03:56:36.220 --> 03:56:39.940]  It's, oh, how will the backlash affect the Muslim community?
[03:56:39.940 --> 03:56:46.100]  And that's where their loyalties lie every single time, again, emphasizing how this hysteria
[03:56:46.100 --> 03:56:52.260]  over political correctness is placed above and beyond any sense of rationality, any sense
[03:56:52.260 --> 03:56:58.380]  of actually digging into how we solve, how we address the root causes of violence.
[03:56:58.380 --> 03:56:59.380]  That's not important.
[03:56:59.380 --> 03:57:07.300]  What's important is someone might say a mean thing on Twitter, oh, my word, God forbid.
[03:57:07.300 --> 03:57:08.980]  That's the Washington Post today.
[03:57:08.980 --> 03:57:13.060]  Of course, there's no mass protest over the killing of this woman.
[03:57:13.060 --> 03:57:16.460]  Maybe if she'd have been black, then there would be, but she isn't, so nobody really
[03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:17.460]  cares.
[03:57:17.460 --> 03:57:21.740]  In fact, Black Lives Matter activists are all over Twitter celebrating her death.
[03:57:21.740 --> 03:57:23.900]  Yes, that's actually happening.
[03:57:23.900 --> 03:57:29.300]  Meanwhile, the Daily Caller reports Women's March praises cop killing terrorists as a
[03:57:29.300 --> 03:57:31.140]  sign of resistance.
[03:57:31.140 --> 03:57:36.060]  The Women's March praised the cop killing terrorists as a sign of resistance on Sunday.
[03:57:36.060 --> 03:57:37.940]  And this is a woman who I've talked about before.
[03:57:37.940 --> 03:57:40.620]  I've written about her, Asata Shakur.
[03:57:40.620 --> 03:57:46.100]  She is the ideological guru and inspiration for Black Lives Matter.
[03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:50.540]  This is the woman whose name they chant at every single Black Lives Matter protest.
[03:57:50.540 --> 03:57:56.300]  Oh, and by the way, she's also a cop killing fugitive who's listed by the FBI as one of
[03:57:56.300 --> 03:58:01.740]  their top 10 terrorists, most wanted terrorists.
[03:58:01.740 --> 03:58:08.180]  That's literally who the Women's March organization from their official Twitter account was glorifying,
[03:58:08.180 --> 03:58:11.700]  just celebrating on Sunday night.
[03:58:11.700 --> 03:58:16.260]  When they got called out on it, of course, they defaulted to the usual victimhood grievance
[03:58:16.260 --> 03:58:19.900]  status of, oh, these evil right wingers are calling us out.
[03:58:19.900 --> 03:58:27.540]  They proceeded to engage in a 20-twee dire tribe about Asata Shakur, a cop killing fugitive,
[03:58:27.540 --> 03:58:29.540]  domestic terrorist.
[03:58:29.540 --> 03:58:31.140]  That's who these people are.
[03:58:31.140 --> 03:58:32.380]  That's who they venerate.
[03:58:32.380 --> 03:58:37.100]  She's literally the ideological guru inspiration behind Black Lives Matter.
[03:58:37.100 --> 03:58:39.660]  That's the icon for these kind of people.
[03:58:39.660 --> 03:58:41.300]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:58:41.300 --> 03:58:42.820]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
