[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this fourth day of Monday already in May
[00:07.000 --> 00:14.840]  2015, coming up detailed breakdown on the Jihad attack up in Garland, Texas, right
[00:14.840 --> 00:19.320]  outside my hometown, but first this report on Disney sweatshops in America
[00:19.320 --> 00:25.800]  and how it ties into the TPP. I want to thank all my fellow leaders for their
[00:25.800 --> 00:30.440]  partnership and their commitment to making the TPP a reality. If President
[00:30.440 --> 00:35.080]  Obama the IMF and legions of New World Order stalwarts have their way, your
[00:35.080 --> 00:39.200]  job, your children's future, and the future of the United States will be
[00:39.200 --> 00:44.880]  assimilated to the corporate cratic Borg. Obama is diligently attempting to get
[00:44.880 --> 00:48.200]  the Trans-Pacific Partnership passed. The single greatest challenge for the
[00:48.200 --> 00:53.080]  United States right now, and my highest priority as president, is creating jobs
[00:53.080 --> 00:58.920]  and putting Americans back to work. And one of the best ways to do that is to
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.280]  increase our trade and exports with other nations. 95% of the world's
[01:04.280 --> 01:11.160]  consumers are beyond our borders. I want them to be buying goods with three
[01:11.160 --> 01:16.200]  words stamped on, made in America. Corporations are heavily lobbying for the
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.600]  deal as legislative sycophants pawns of their corporate masters like John
[01:20.600 --> 01:30.640]  Boehner. Making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream, like I did.
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.360]  It's important. Rally support for a trade agreement that will make NAFTA look like
[01:36.360 --> 01:40.720]  child's play. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce my introduction off and
[01:40.720 --> 01:45.600]  request co-sponsors for a privileged resolution to withdraw the United States
[01:45.600 --> 01:50.520]  from the World Trade Organization. By what authority does the World Trade
[01:50.520 --> 01:55.760]  Organization assume jurisdiction over the United States federal tax policy?
[01:55.760 --> 02:00.040]  That's the question. At last reading, the Constitution required that all
[02:00.040 --> 02:03.840]  appropriations bill originate in the House and specify that only Congress has
[02:03.840 --> 02:08.040]  the power to lay and collect taxes. Taxation without representation was a
[02:08.040 --> 02:12.280]  predominant reason for America's fight for independence during the American
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.080]  Revolution. Yet now we face an unconstitutional delegation of taxing
[02:17.080 --> 02:21.720]  authority to an unelected body of international bureaucrats. Let me assure
[02:21.720 --> 02:26.040]  you, Mr. Speaker, this nation does not need yet another bureaucratic hurdle to
[02:26.040 --> 02:30.320]  tax reduction. It's very hard to make anything of the TPP because it's been
[02:30.320 --> 02:37.600]  kept very secret. A half secret, I should say. It's not secret from the hundreds
[02:37.600 --> 02:42.800]  of corporate lawyers and lobbyists who are writing the legislation. To them,
[02:42.800 --> 02:47.040]  that's perfectly public. They're in fact writing it. It's being kept secret from
[02:47.040 --> 02:51.640]  the population. High-wage American workers and union members would face more
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.400]  direct competition from low-wage Malaysian, Vietnamese, and Mexican workers
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.760]  because the partnership would create a free trade zone with no tariffs or
[03:00.760 --> 03:04.360]  barriers. The treaty would give corporations a direct way to object to
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.760]  an even override individual country's democratically passed laws. An
[03:08.760 --> 03:13.080]  international tribunal would have the power to overrule individual nation's
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.960]  legal standards and impose economic penalties. That power would be the
[03:17.960 --> 03:23.280]  cornerstone of an unelected, corporate, new world order. I wish people could
[03:23.280 --> 03:28.160]  remember what the border looked like between Texas and Mexico before and
[03:28.160 --> 03:34.720]  after. And there's poor, really poor, on both sides of the border. If you go down
[03:34.720 --> 03:39.320]  there today, there's prosperity on both sides of the border, and that's in our
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.400]  nation's interest. We have the opportunity to remake the world. For this new
[03:44.400 --> 03:48.680]  era, our national security we now know will be determined as much by our
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.320]  ability to pull down foreign trade barriers as by our ability to breach
[03:53.320 --> 03:58.120]  distant ramparts. The devastation the US economy and the Mexican economy suffered
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.920]  under NAFTA is shocking. Another corporate toxicity program shipping away at the
[04:02.920 --> 04:09.320]  US jobs economy is the abuse of the H-1B visa work program. For example, at the
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.440]  end of October 2014, IT employees at Disney Parks and Resorts were replaced
[04:14.440 --> 04:19.960]  by imported cheap labor they had to train as they were laid off. Disney CEO Bob
[04:19.960 --> 04:24.560]  Iger is one of eight co-chairs of the partnership for a new American economy, a
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.760]  leading group advocating for an increase in the H-1B visa cap. One of the
[04:29.760 --> 04:34.560]  briefing documents made this claim. H-1B workers compliment instead of
[04:34.560 --> 04:40.040]  displace US workers. It explains that as employers use foreign workers to fill
[04:40.040 --> 04:46.000]  more technical and low-level jobs, firms are able to expand and allow US workers
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.760]  to assume managerial and leadership decisions. It doesn't happen. We're going to break the full
[04:51.760 --> 04:56.920]  report as up on infowars.com. We'll be back with a ton of vital news obviously
[04:56.920 --> 05:01.840]  Michael Savage is coming up too. You've probably heard of the shooting at the
[05:01.840 --> 05:05.600]  Prophet Muhammad cartoons exhibition in Garland, Texas over the weekend but did
[05:05.600 --> 05:08.960]  you know Daily Mail used pictures from the event but bowing to political
[05:08.960 --> 05:13.320]  correctness blacked out the offensive images and thus far President Barack
[05:13.320 --> 05:17.440]  Obama has been silent about the attacks and CNN used the event to attack the
[05:17.440 --> 05:20.400]  Second Amendment when it was the Second Amendment that stopped the gunman in
[05:20.400 --> 05:23.640]  their tracks but now we've learned that the FBI has been watching one of the
[05:23.640 --> 05:27.720]  suspects using an FBI informant. Elton Simpson the man identified as one of
[05:27.720 --> 05:31.080]  the two gunman killed was under surveillance by the FBI and subject of
[05:31.080 --> 05:34.560]  a terror investigation. The FBI has arranged numerous fake terror plots
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.000]  including the Washington Metro bombing plot, the New York subway plot, the plan
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.400]  to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago, the plot to bomb the Portland Christmas
[05:41.400 --> 05:45.800]  tree lighting and others. In 2014 Human Rights Watch released a report stating
[05:45.800 --> 05:49.200]  nearly all high-profile domestic terrorism plots in the United States after
[05:49.200 --> 05:53.640]  9-11 included the direct involvement of government agents and informants. You can

[08:00.480 --> 08:16.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[08:16.480 --> 08:24.720]  GCN radio network. Welcome ladies and gentlemen it is Monday already May 4th
[08:24.720 --> 08:33.640]  2015. I'm your host Alex Jones. Dr. Michael Savage will be joining us in the
[08:33.640 --> 08:39.840]  second hour today. He was originally coming on to talk about his new book by
[08:39.840 --> 08:46.480]  New York Times best-selling author. A Time for War Michael Savage Countdown to
[08:46.480 --> 08:54.520]  Mecca. Basically he can't get books about what he really thinks published or they
[08:54.520 --> 08:59.240]  end up censoring him. That happened on the last book about China and so he's
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.360]  put out a fiction book close quote and he's going to be joining us on that
[09:04.360 --> 09:13.360]  subject. But obviously it'll be informative to have him on to give us
[09:13.360 --> 09:20.880]  his breakdown on the shooting that took place last night in Garland where they
[09:20.880 --> 09:28.520]  were having a free speech event demonstration. One police officer
[09:28.520 --> 09:35.600]  wounded in a lag. The two gunmen gunned down by the Garland SWAT team that was
[09:35.600 --> 09:41.160]  lying in wait because the FBI had already questioned their reported
[09:41.160 --> 09:47.440]  shooters and as usual had not been allowed to basically indict them by the
[09:47.440 --> 09:52.000]  Justice Department. They'd caught them traveling to North Africa for training
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.600]  and they were allowing them basically to travel back and forth for ISIL Islamic
[09:57.600 --> 10:06.440]  State and the ISIS forces who have taken responsibility. Now some will ask is
[10:06.440 --> 10:13.440]  this a false flag and it would take an hour to go into why with first look
[10:13.440 --> 10:18.880]  last night and this morning probably not. If this had been a staged event you'd
[10:18.880 --> 10:22.720]  have had hostages taken the real killers would have gone out the backdoor they
[10:22.720 --> 10:27.920]  had a shot a couple patsies that is the operators would have and the local cops
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.880]  would have been held back by the feds and thought that the terrorist had killed
[10:31.880 --> 10:35.960]  themselves. That's the kind of staged event that has been run before in Europe.
[10:35.960 --> 10:41.360]  The fact that the SWAT team took them out instantly and that it looks so good for
[10:41.360 --> 10:47.720]  the Second Amendment versus what you saw with the Charlie Hebdo fiasco in France
[10:47.720 --> 10:52.800]  and the way that CNN and others are responding with their spin you see they
[10:52.800 --> 10:58.160]  weren't lined up with their PR points day one. When you see a provocateur or
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.760]  staged event like Sandy Hooker 9-11 the media is ready with the narrative
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.480]  scripted on every channel. When it's not staged they're not scripted and ready
[11:07.480 --> 11:13.120]  on every channel and again ISIS itself is a false flag and they've been armed
[11:13.120 --> 11:18.920]  allowed to train allowed to operate and build up and then recruit and as I've
[11:18.920 --> 11:23.560]  said they don't need to get ISIS or ISIL forces it's all part of the same
[11:23.560 --> 11:30.160]  Islamic State across the border because ISIS mainly recruits for Islamic State
[11:30.160 --> 11:35.600]  out of the West out of Europe out of the UK out of the United States and Canada
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.280]  and we've been complaining for years that our government and other governments
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.880]  allow them to fly back and forth to build up this force I mean they just had
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.680]  another big suicide bombing in Damascus trying to topple the Assad regime and
[11:48.680 --> 11:55.200]  put ISIS in control there to set up Islamic State. So the media does not like
[11:55.200 --> 12:01.040]  the image of instant reaction by the police gunning these two down there
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.920]  were a lot of witnesses out on the busy road there in Garland I even know where
[12:04.920 --> 12:11.800]  that convention center is I grew up in Rockwall across the lake from Garland so
[12:11.800 --> 12:15.640]  you've got Rockwall outside Dallas you've got Lake Ray Hubbard and you've got
[12:15.640 --> 12:20.920]  Roilette and Garland and my stomping grounds were Garland and Richardson and
[12:20.920 --> 12:29.160]  Roilette and Rockwall and so I know that area well and from witnesses and the
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.200]  rest of it they just saw the car pull up start shooting and they got gunned down
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.200]  immediately only wounding one person so that's certainly good news separately
[12:38.200 --> 12:49.040]  though it is a false flag in that globalist forces that I like a
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.440]  inspector criminal groups within compartmentalized areas of government
[12:53.440 --> 12:57.840]  and corporations are on record admitting they use the radical Zihadi
[12:57.840 --> 13:01.720]  Islamic threat funded by Saudi Arabia and others to destabilize the planet and
[13:01.720 --> 13:07.200]  bring in social control which is then not used against radical Islam but is used
[13:07.200 --> 13:11.560]  against libertarians veterans conservatives people that are actually
[13:11.560 --> 13:16.600]  trying to restore the Republic I've got to say though watching CNN last night
[13:16.600 --> 13:23.200]  and ABC News and MSNBC monitoring propaganda and this morning watching it
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.040]  we've got a bunch of these clips but it's it's all over the news you're seeing it
[13:27.040 --> 13:31.320]  why even play them where they go these are bigoted horrible people has it gone
[13:31.320 --> 13:38.520]  too far their their speech these people are idiots these people are are are
[13:38.520 --> 13:47.480]  horrible you've got this European government member who was over there to
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.920]  speak it's a free speech event if you don't believe in free speech you don't
[13:52.920 --> 13:58.000]  believe in this country and we should be having a debate about radicals that don't
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.320]  like free speech the point that they're ready to go out and kill people and then
[14:02.320 --> 14:07.840]  the media acts like it's the fault of the event holders that had it in a
[14:07.840 --> 14:13.640]  convention center that they rented out where you could have a convention for
[14:13.640 --> 14:17.640]  Muslims you could have a convention for Baptist you could have a convention for
[14:17.640 --> 14:22.280]  Catholics you could have a convention for for Zoroastrians you could have a
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.440]  convention for atheists you could have a convention for Harry Potter enthusiasts
[14:26.440 --> 14:33.120]  Star Wars nerds I mean it's not like they were in front of somebody's church
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.600]  at a funeral making fun of dead people and that's even protected though it
[14:37.600 --> 14:43.320]  starts to get into incitement no it was inside a closed-door event that they
[14:43.320 --> 14:49.920]  paid for I don't believe in stirring people up so I'm not going to go out
[14:49.920 --> 14:58.240]  and depict you know Muhammad with you know Muhammad given you know another
[14:58.240 --> 15:01.720]  man fallatio or you know things like that that's some of the stuff in the
[15:01.720 --> 15:05.920]  Charlie Hebdo art we don't know what was in this art because seeing in and other
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.560]  channels when they show it blur out all the art
[15:13.240 --> 15:18.360]  I've also seen a lot of comments on info wars dot com about the garland tactical
[15:18.360 --> 15:22.520]  team you know not wearing their armor plates right and you know looking like
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.440]  their their own steroids or whatever look at the end of the day I don't even
[15:26.440 --> 15:31.440]  care they didn't sit there and wait three hours like other departments do
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.960]  around the country while everybody was getting shot inside and I'll guarantee you
[15:35.960 --> 15:39.760]  if the jihadis would have got into the building citizens and there were carrying
[15:39.760 --> 15:45.480]  guns and they'd have been met with lethal force so all I can say is welcome to
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.840]  Texas radical jihadis because this is exactly what's going to happen to you
[15:49.840 --> 15:57.440]  anywhere that I live or anybody I know this is an armed camp my office is an
[15:57.440 --> 16:05.120]  armed camp and it's not because we live in fear we live in strength through the
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.680]  right to keep bare arms there's an article on info wars calm guns the
[16:10.680 --> 16:14.680]  difference between garland and Paris when armed terrorists attacked Charlie Hebdo
[16:14.680 --> 16:18.840]  headquarters over Muhammad cartoons January 7th unarmed police officers
[16:18.840 --> 16:24.520]  were forced to flee for their lives yeah and beg for their lives because in
[16:24.520 --> 16:28.120]  England and France still the police in many areas aren't even armed what a
[16:28.120 --> 16:32.680]  joke so see when we hear about oh we shouldn't have militarized police I
[16:32.680 --> 16:37.840]  don't care if we have militarized police as long as they're not targeting
[16:37.840 --> 16:45.000]  nonviolent people which they're starting to do and as long as the citizens are
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.120]  left alone to be armed to the teeth as well because let me tell you how the UN
[16:49.120 --> 16:54.720]  model works they start disarming the police or restricting the police they're
[16:54.720 --> 16:59.920]  coming after you next I mean who wants your police to not have guns I mean
[16:59.920 --> 17:07.760]  let's just get real here if we had a totally armed society by law like
[17:07.760 --> 17:10.720]  Kennesaw Georgia which I'm not for because you can't force somebody to be
[17:10.720 --> 17:16.400]  armed you would basically not even really need police except an official
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.760]  group to go out and grab someone when they've been basically indicted by the
[17:20.760 --> 17:27.200]  grand jury that's the people the grand jury indites we we call you in you go
[17:27.200 --> 17:32.600]  to court and a jury finds your fate that's why we have constables it's why
[17:32.600 --> 17:37.080]  we have sheriffs it's why we have police departments the idea that the police
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.400]  are a nanny state there to wipe all of our hind ends and there you you call them
[17:41.400 --> 17:44.920]  when your five-year-olds acting up or when a hamburger from McDonald's is
[17:44.920 --> 17:51.280]  cold that's true story the problems we have with our police say a lot about us
[17:51.280 --> 17:56.200]  that we put up without a control police that we basically ask for out of control
[17:56.200 --> 18:01.640]  police that we ask for more police than we need I mean these are all problems
[18:01.640 --> 18:07.760]  with the people and the police are basically taken from a pool of the
[18:07.760 --> 18:15.560]  people and let's face it we've got some really bad entitled out of control
[18:15.560 --> 18:21.800]  corrupt police departments in this country but I see the cause celeb in the
[18:21.800 --> 18:28.920]  media the invoke thing is to hate police conservatives libertarians liberals
[18:28.920 --> 18:34.600]  especially and that's all been orchestrated by the mainstream media and
[18:34.600 --> 18:38.200]  the Soros group and others in the Justice Department who's busy bashing local
[18:38.200 --> 18:43.840]  police it isn't that I'm endorsing bad police activity you're not going to
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.880]  reform it becoming plain enemies with the police you're going to reform it by
[18:48.880 --> 18:52.640]  getting control of your counties and cities kicking the globalist out kicking
[18:52.640 --> 18:56.360]  the Southern Paralympic Law Center out kicking the ADL out and bringing local
[18:56.360 --> 19:02.560]  control back and telling the police what type of police activity and culture we
[19:02.560 --> 19:15.320]  want but when we start cowering from the police it elicits a lot of mixed
[19:15.320 --> 19:22.920]  feelings and problems that are played upon by the social engineers now we've
[19:22.920 --> 19:30.440]  got big news on Obamacare big news on the situations in Baltimore big news on
[19:30.440 --> 19:37.080]  focus on the family dobson fall of us with civilization at hand I agree I
[19:37.080 --> 19:42.960]  think civilization's already fallen to a certain extent but still you've kind of

[24:25.560 --> 24:49.240]  so we told everybody that ISIS was operating in all 50 states that's what
[24:49.240 --> 24:53.680]  the FBI said two months ago we pointed out this was different than the so-called
[24:53.680 --> 24:58.000]  al-Qaeda threat that was almost completely manufactured by the West this
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.960]  ISIS Islamic State is an attempt by Saudi Arabia allied with different
[25:02.960 --> 25:10.600]  elements of our government NATO and Turkey and Israel to take over any Shiite
[25:10.600 --> 25:16.720]  held areas of the Middle East and that of course is Iran that is headed up by
[25:16.720 --> 25:26.160]  the minority Muslim group and now in America under political correctness
[25:26.160 --> 25:33.440]  CNN and others BBC and others are blurring out any criticism of Islam
[25:33.440 --> 25:40.440]  and even saying the word Muhammad you're supposed to say the Prophet Muhammad
[25:40.440 --> 25:46.520]  CNN has now actually suggested the victims of the garland shooting were to
[25:46.520 --> 25:51.080]  blame for being provocative and Paul Watson has the transcript in the news
[25:51.080 --> 25:55.720]  article where they actually set that up on info wars comm and the YouTube clip
[25:55.720 --> 26:02.880]  it is simply mind-blowing and this is why this country is falling we don't have
[26:02.880 --> 26:10.960]  a culture anymore we have a corporate plastic culture that changes like the
[26:10.960 --> 26:16.680]  wind we don't have a free market culture we don't have a family culture we
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.520]  don't have any values on average in fact if you do have values you're under
[26:21.520 --> 26:26.680]  attack because the corporate system doesn't want you to have any views they
[26:26.680 --> 26:32.920]  want you to submit to whatever their current world plan is they want us to
[26:32.920 --> 26:37.120]  act like robots and there's a world that daily article that's excellent it's
[26:37.120 --> 26:44.680]  full of Western civilization at hand Dr. James Dobson who's been attacked by a
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.040]  gunman saying he was there for the Southern property law Center shooting
[26:48.040 --> 26:52.520]  people who founded the highly influential group focus on the family and
[26:52.520 --> 26:58.320]  family research council now runs family talk radio is warning that if the US
[26:58.320 --> 27:03.400]  Supreme Court redefines marriage as analysts predict the ruling will
[27:03.400 --> 27:09.880]  presage the fall of Western civilization which that's the plan ladies and
[27:09.880 --> 27:19.280]  gentlemen is to end any units that have tribal fealty to each other I couldn't
[27:19.280 --> 27:22.720]  believe the headline on CNN yesterday I talked about it on the Sunday radio show
[27:22.720 --> 27:30.520]  it was if you want to destroy a people destroy their men and they admitted that
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.920]  the end of the black family and the fact that there weren't men in leadership
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.880]  roles and that only gang members were leaders in areas of Baltimore was why
[27:40.880 --> 27:48.720]  there was absolute basic hell on earth in many areas but this is all designed
[27:48.720 --> 27:52.680]  it's like overrunning the Native Americans and killing them but the
[27:52.680 --> 27:56.120]  naming sports teams after him saying you're honoring them or after the
[27:56.120 --> 27:59.720]  British family conquered the Scots that were 500 years the British Royals
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.920]  adopted Scottish cultures are wearing kilts
[28:06.920 --> 28:13.440]  very very frustrating and by the way CNN originally had the headline and I got
[28:13.440 --> 28:22.760]  a screenshot of it if you want to destroy a people destroy their men and
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.880]  then they changed it to Lord of the Flies comes to Baltimore in fact I want
[28:27.880 --> 28:34.560]  to show them I got a screenshot of it because I was so amazed by it
[28:35.560 --> 28:45.120]  let me see if I could find it here for TV viewers and it just blew me away that
[28:45.120 --> 28:50.120]  they would admit that here it is give me a document cam shot please guys I want
[28:50.120 --> 28:56.000]  to show TV viewers this and now they've removed this sub headline if you want to
[28:56.000 --> 29:03.240]  destroy a people first break their men something's missing from the
[29:03.240 --> 29:10.320]  neighborhoods CNN's John Blake grew up in older black men full story and they
[29:10.320 --> 29:25.120]  removed that from the headline I mean I knew that I was surprised I knew that
[29:25.120 --> 29:30.600]  that was not like CNN to be truthful and of course it was removed amazing
[29:30.600 --> 29:35.600]  simply amazing we're gonna break down more of what dr. Dobson had to say when
[29:35.600 --> 29:39.640]  we come back because it's a fact it's in the university studies I made a film
[29:39.640 --> 29:46.640]  about it in game 1.5 where we have the university documents in the 60s the
[29:46.640 --> 29:52.200]  plan to end humanity as we know it we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[30:36.680 --> 30:40.480]  would have preached the gospel and though he was very vocal in his
[30:40.480 --> 30:45.360]  opposition he never forgot that he was there to save the same people he often

[33:22.240 --> 33:32.840]  the GCN radio network
[33:52.560 --> 34:00.160]  Pamela Geller heads up the free speech organization that believes that they
[34:00.160 --> 34:04.400]  have a right to criticize the Prophet Muhammad I mean we have political
[34:04.400 --> 34:09.840]  cartoons on info wars dot com right now criticizing Hillary Clinton and showing
[34:09.840 --> 34:15.200]  you're like a basically a flying monkey in a tree and whether you agree with that
[34:15.200 --> 34:21.920]  or not I have a right to do it and you watch CNN you would believe that the
[34:21.920 --> 34:30.040]  people inside were the bad guys and this shows the totalitarianism of the so-called
[34:30.040 --> 34:35.600]  left and how they're allied with radical Islam remember when the Muslim
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.480]  Brotherhood backed up by Al Qaeda was murdering Christians all over the
[34:40.480 --> 34:48.320]  Middle East and had overthrown the government of Egypt our own media
[34:48.320 --> 34:54.440]  Anderson Cooper and others were praising it so there's a very sick alliance
[34:54.440 --> 34:59.760]  going on here and it's beyond the class of civilizations yes the neocons and
[34:59.760 --> 35:04.360]  the Republicans have a public plan project for the American century put out
[35:04.360 --> 35:10.080]  in 2000 shang basically stir up radical Islam have a big global war with it use
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.560]  that as the excuse for the US to take over the planet but that's not what's
[35:14.560 --> 35:20.000]  being done now radical Islam is spreading and taking over and being
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.680]  protected so you see the triple cross there and the biggest group being
[35:25.680 --> 35:31.400]  harmed and attacked is Muslims per capita then Christians just because
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.520]  there are less Christians in the Middle East but overall it's a very serious
[35:36.520 --> 35:42.600]  situation and it's compounding and when we have terror attacks launched by ISIS
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.760]  in this country in Islamic State has taken credit for this attack in Garland
[35:45.760 --> 35:50.880]  Texas last night they're promoting in the media censoring free speech and
[35:50.880 --> 35:55.680]  basically garrisoning troops everywhere to protect us from a threat our
[35:55.680 --> 36:00.480]  government has allowed to come in and start radicalizing US citizens as we
[36:00.480 --> 36:07.040]  have in this particular case so let's go ahead and play a clip of what the
[36:07.040 --> 36:13.000]  organizer had to say on CNN well it's dangerous because increasingly we're
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.360]  abridging our freedoms so as not to offend savages the very idea that if
[36:19.360 --> 36:25.440]  something offends me or I don't I'm insulted by something I'll kill you and
[36:25.440 --> 36:30.760]  that way I can get my way and somehow this is okay with members of the elite
[36:30.760 --> 36:38.200]  media and academia is outrageous well it's a car it's a car it's a car to it's
[36:38.200 --> 36:43.760]  a cartoon sure it's a cartoon and no idea that this warrants the violence that you
[36:43.760 --> 36:47.360]  saw I mean I haven't heard anyone in the media saying that it's okay for gunmen
[36:47.360 --> 36:50.600]  to show up at an event like this but what people are saying is that there's
[36:50.600 --> 36:56.000]  always this fine line you know between freedom of speech and being intentionally
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  incendiary and provocative there is no fine line intentionally incendiary and
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.920]  provocative by drawing a cartoon this is the low state of freedom of speech in
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.080]  this country I disagree and I disagree most vehemently if they can shut that
[37:11.080 --> 37:15.440]  down they can shut it all down not the 10th but the first protects all speech
[37:15.440 --> 37:20.680]  not just ideas that we like that's right but even core political speech ideas
[37:20.680 --> 37:23.560]  that we don't like because who would decide what's good and what's forbidden
[37:23.560 --> 37:29.320]  by Islamic State the government's inoffensive speech Allison needs no
[37:29.320 --> 37:35.840]  protection but in a pluralistic society you have offensive speech you have ideas
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.240]  you have an exchange of ideas you don't shut down a discussion because I'm
[37:40.240 --> 37:45.120]  offended if something offends me should I go out and slaughter people when
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.800]  Jesus Christ was put in a jar of urine it was called art did Christians like it
[37:50.800 --> 37:55.600]  of course not did they slaughter people did they burn embassies did they kill
[37:55.600 --> 38:00.440]  kill whole communities of course not this cannot be sanctioned that's right
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.360]  yeah this cannot be sanctioned remember when piss Christ that was the name of the
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.240]  art exhibit they paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for they had piles
[38:09.240 --> 38:14.280]  of Kalmaner and horsemen are piled on the Virgin Mary and taxpayers had to pay
[38:14.280 --> 38:20.760]  for it conservatives and Christians protested having to pay for it and we're
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.920]  called sensors and then when people would criticize it they'd say hey don't
[38:25.920 --> 38:31.000]  attack my speech as if you having your speech was an attack on their speech
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.400]  see it's about the control totalitarian left the fascist left being able to
[38:38.400 --> 38:44.520]  define reality and they play this game they set the parameters of the rules of
[38:44.520 --> 38:48.200]  the game and people tend to go along with it well that's starting to stop
[38:48.200 --> 38:55.120]  right now but getting back to Dobson and the fall of Western civilization is in
[38:55.120 --> 39:00.040]  hand and the rise of the technocracy you have to bring down humanity first to
[39:00.040 --> 39:04.760]  build on its ashes the new world it is right out of a dystopic you know science
[39:04.760 --> 39:09.480]  fiction movie that's the reason every science fiction movie I go see now is
[39:09.480 --> 39:13.880]  about this battle between a world for humans or a world where humans merge
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.480]  with machines and it's because they're letting the public know the decisions
[39:17.480 --> 39:21.520]  already been made Dr. James Dobson who founded the highly influential group
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.920]  focus on the family said that basically if the Supreme Court rules as analysts
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.840]  say they're set to to end you know marriage being something to man and a
[39:29.840 --> 39:35.640]  woman that Katie bar the door I don't recall a time when the institutions of
[39:35.640 --> 39:38.960]  marriage and family have been in such peril or when the forces are rating
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.720]  against them were more formidable and determined yeah they're banning homes
[39:43.720 --> 39:46.560]  cooling all over the country saying you gotta have a teaching certificate to do
[39:46.560 --> 39:50.240]  it I mean they're coming forced inoculations I mean it's here he
[39:50.240 --> 39:52.840]  writes in a letter distributed to his hundreds of thousands of supporters
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.480]  buying a miracle the family this existence antiquity will likely crumble
[39:57.480 --> 40:01.040]  it already has
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.760]  I mean even if you got kids most parents let their children be raised by their
[40:06.760 --> 40:13.880]  iPads presaging the fall of Western civilization this is a time for
[40:13.880 --> 40:17.560]  concerted prayer divine wisdom and greater courage and we've ever been
[40:17.560 --> 40:21.000]  called on to exercise
[40:21.680 --> 40:29.160]  then it goes on now let's go over some of these Islamic State headlines
[40:29.160 --> 40:35.240]  silence from Obama on Islamic terror attack in Texas one police officer was
[40:35.240 --> 40:40.880]  wounded in the attack two attackers were shot dead by police
[40:40.880 --> 40:48.720]  sharia's light was the name of his Twitter account hashtag Texas attack the
[40:48.720 --> 40:56.320]  bro with me and myself have given by a ha to the I can't speak Arabic may Allah
[40:56.320 --> 41:07.800]  accept us Mujahideen make duh and ISIS is now taking responsibility guns the
[41:07.800 --> 41:12.320]  difference between Garland and Paris that's just some of the headlines we
[41:12.320 --> 41:19.160]  don't shoot people for bigoted views CNN and that's the side of CNN saying they
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.800]  have free speech the rest are saying they don't have free speech simply
[41:23.800 --> 41:34.080]  disgusting you know there's more than one way to censor and I talked some
[41:34.080 --> 41:38.280]  about this yesterday Paul Watson is going to write an article about it
[41:38.280 --> 41:42.160]  tomorrow detailing it and giving some of the history in fact I think I'm gonna
[41:42.160 --> 41:48.000]  write it with him because I'm gonna do a major push talking about other forms of
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.240]  censorship already taking place against the internet against talk radio and
[41:52.240 --> 41:58.040]  against libertarian renaissance style thinkers that aren't on the establishment
[41:58.040 --> 42:05.720]  of a Republican Democrat plantation there was an article
[42:08.240 --> 42:16.120]  last October and that's when this first happened in World Net Daily by Leo
[42:16.120 --> 42:22.160]  Homan and it was a detailed story they did a lot of research they called us
[42:22.160 --> 42:26.160]  they called others they did their homework disturbing mystery affecting
[42:26.160 --> 42:31.920]  your favorite news sites and of course it's not a mystery at all the algorithm
[42:31.920 --> 42:38.960]  was artificially manipulated to where CNN MSNBC media matters everybody else
[42:38.960 --> 42:44.880]  went up 60 to 80 percent in ratings and every Patriot site drudge report
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.240]  Breitbart info wars the blaze the Daily Caller and others went straight down
[42:50.240 --> 42:57.280]  60 to 80 percent but NPR daily cost democracy now media matters think
[42:57.280 --> 43:04.480]  progress all rose on the same day in early October now we have Google
[43:04.480 --> 43:11.240]  analytics and other systems that show us the real time and in the past Alexa was
[43:11.240 --> 43:20.680]  dead on with Google using their own system of sampling I was like number 300 to
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.240]  400 in the US back in October of last year now we're 1000 something now you
[43:25.240 --> 43:28.520]  have to understand in reality if we look at the old metric with Google
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.520]  analytics we're like 200 now we've risen so you see them artificially lower us
[43:33.520 --> 43:38.800]  drudge and others but then you notice we're going up and drudge is going up
[43:38.800 --> 43:43.440]  we went down off a cliff but we're still going up once we hit the cliff because
[43:43.440 --> 43:49.040]  they just set the set the thing down they just dialed it back fraudulently but
[43:49.040 --> 43:51.800]  because our numbers are actually going up it looks like we're going back up
[43:51.800 --> 43:57.080]  again so even cooking the books even putting sugar in our gas tank at the
[43:57.080 --> 44:03.520]  NASCAR race we're still winning and see this is meant to target our advertisers
[44:03.520 --> 44:09.640]  as if our advertisers go off ratings they go off their own dashboards their
[44:09.640 --> 44:14.440]  own computer metrics that's why the age of the outside rating party is over
[44:14.440 --> 44:20.720]  because people actually run one of five or six different on-site server systems
[44:20.720 --> 44:27.520]  that give it to you all in 3d if you want it down to are they men are they
[44:27.520 --> 44:31.280]  women where are they from what are their IP addresses what do they click on I
[44:31.280 --> 44:36.360]  mean we don't need Alexa but I'm going to get Paul Watson with my IT department
[44:36.360 --> 44:43.880]  today to give our own internal metric computer systems to get some screenshots
[44:43.880 --> 44:50.720]  of our growth curve from audio streams of video streams to page views and then
[44:50.720 --> 44:54.480]  we're going to give screenshots of Google analytics that we have access to
[44:54.480 --> 45:03.440]  that shows us growing at about a good 30% rate a year in web traffic video
[45:03.440 --> 45:12.840]  streaming traffic's tripled just the last month so our biggest growth rates
[45:12.840 --> 45:18.480]  aren't even on the sites but but it we're exploding they're imploding and of
[45:18.480 --> 45:22.520]  course in Nielsen and other ratings MSNBC and CNN and the rest are plunging
[45:22.520 --> 45:28.040]  and even though they cooked the books and lowered us by 70 80% it varies 60 to
[45:28.040 --> 45:35.160]  80% we're exploding so fast that we're still way above them thousands of
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.560]  rankings higher so even though they're gaming it we're still crushing them but
[45:40.560 --> 45:48.840]  it shows the concerted fraud in my view and it's just not my opinion I know our
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.520]  numbers are going up I know their numbers are going down they were going
[45:53.520 --> 45:58.840]  straight down but if you go to MSNBC now on Alexa they're they're they're going
[45:58.840 --> 46:09.880]  up but they were going down until October 1st if you think if you expand it to
[46:09.880 --> 46:13.400]  multi years they're just plunging they were kind of flat in the last few months
[46:13.400 --> 46:22.000]  for October last year they shoot up now you put info wars.com in there and they
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.200]  have inverted the numbers we were like number 300 in the US now we're 1,085
[46:27.200 --> 46:32.840]  they're 500 so see they can't actually beat us and it's embarrassing to them
[46:32.840 --> 46:39.800]  and we've done articles on this so they just get ahold of of Amazon that owns
[46:39.800 --> 46:47.800]  Alexa and all Alexa's doing is ensuring that they won't be used as a source but
[46:47.800 --> 46:53.560]  world that daily did this back in late October now we're six months later seven
[46:53.560 --> 47:00.880]  months later and I'm not gonna put up with it because this is censorship just
[47:00.880 --> 47:04.640]  like they want to shut down free speech and not let you have Prophet Muhammad
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.200]  cartoons or whatever just like they want to say you can't have brown paper bags
[47:09.200 --> 47:12.720]  in Seattle government because it's code for racism or just like if you don't
[47:12.720 --> 47:16.880]  like Obamacare you're a racist on on on this is the totalitarianism of these
[47:16.880 --> 47:23.560]  people and it's a big deal for them on October 1st to spike every socialist
[47:23.560 --> 47:30.280]  anti-American gun grabbing open border promoting system but it still doesn't
[47:30.280 --> 47:36.520]  matter MSNBC and CNN are going bankrupt on record if they weren't taxpayer
[47:36.520 --> 47:39.080]  funded through bailout money through stimulus money they wouldn't be there
[47:39.080 --> 47:45.560]  and so it's ghost trying to convince the living that they still matter so I tell
[47:45.560 --> 47:51.440]  you what Alexa say that there are zero viewers of info wars.com and zero
[47:51.440 --> 47:57.480]  affiliates and just that we don't exist in fact why don't you just announce that
[47:57.480 --> 48:03.560]  I'm dead of course it's not true but this is the totalitarianism that we're
[48:03.560 --> 48:11.480]  facing and I want a big article on it I want the graphs I want it all we have a
[48:11.480 --> 48:21.360]  billion views on YouTube a billion one channel 500 million that's just a small
[48:21.360 --> 48:26.440]  part of what we do here how do you think I have 50 employees and a multi-million
[48:26.440 --> 48:30.760]  dollar studio how do you think there's no listeners in in in hundreds of news
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.440]  articles today attacking me there have been hundreds a day for a month plus
[48:34.440 --> 48:42.120]  they call me internet host even though we have well over 160 affiliates I'm an
[48:42.120 --> 48:47.800]  internet host and there is a major effort to buy off stations to harass
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.120]  stations to have them dump the show going on everywhere because the system
[48:52.120 --> 48:56.760]  scared of us and you know what I ought to be glad that they at least are trying
[48:56.760 --> 49:00.720]  this instead of just killing me outright they're just trying to kill the signal and
[49:00.720 --> 49:06.480]  stop it you the listeners have to understand all Hades is breaking loose
[49:06.480 --> 49:12.440]  they are desperately afraid of this broadcast because Michael Savage is
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.680]  coming on and Colonel Schaefer is coming on today and you can call in and Ron
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.320]  Paul was on last week and governor of Texas put out a tweet agreeing with us
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.400]  about Jade Helm and senator Cruz came out and said it is a concern because he
[49:25.400 --> 49:30.040]  can't trust the federal government there's an awakening happening they're
[49:30.040 --> 49:34.520]  scared of the Tea Party and Time Magazine called me five years ago the
[49:34.520 --> 49:39.400]  prophet of the Tea Party and it's true that's basically the function I'm the
[49:39.400 --> 49:42.800]  guy in the wilderness that everyone's scared of and no one dares say my name
[49:42.800 --> 49:48.080]  and Fox News says the one we will not name well because it freaks you out Fox
[49:48.080 --> 49:53.040]  News you've got about 15 million viewers a day and we've got about four or five
[49:53.040 --> 49:58.720]  million one way or another and that freaks you out because we're your biggest
[49:58.720 --> 50:02.160]  competition next to I mean you've defeated CNN MSNBC they don't even
[50:02.160 --> 50:07.480]  exist but here's the thing Fox I'm not in competition with you you want to play
[50:07.480 --> 50:10.880]  the part of the fake conservative group I just want to have a country in a
[50:10.880 --> 50:14.520]  future I really want to keep the Second Amendment I really take it personal
[50:14.520 --> 50:19.240]  being overrun by a bunch of social engineers I take it personal having
[50:19.240 --> 50:23.840]  Obama act as a dictator I take it personal they want to ban homeschooling I
[50:23.840 --> 50:31.120]  take it personal they're trying to force an oculate I can't sell out it's not who
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.840]  I am I don't want to be enemies with anybody I just want to be free and I
[50:35.840 --> 50:41.640]  have a right to be free and not the slave I have an inalible right from my
[50:41.640 --> 50:46.680]  creator not the state I am a free being and other free beings for every race
[50:46.680 --> 50:50.960]  color and creed resonate with that I don't care what's radical Islam or the
[50:50.960 --> 50:54.480]  Southern Poverty Law Center they're all tyrants together that's why they work
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.520]  together to shut down their enemy Christians conservatives and libertarians

[54:46.760 --> 54:51.640]  they put out this info judicial watch said that they confirm there was ISIS
[54:51.640 --> 54:56.160]  training camp over there and then the FBI came to the airport wanted to meet
[54:56.160 --> 55:01.400]  with our people and said they thought it was very credible and again it was low
[55:01.400 --> 55:06.080]  level FBI tried to stop this the hijacker decoys in three different
[55:06.080 --> 55:12.280]  states actually four different states and four different major cities before
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.600]  9-11 and were ordered to stand down the low levels not the enemy folks it's the
[55:17.600 --> 55:22.360]  globalists that infest the government but in hundreds of articles a day
[55:22.360 --> 55:30.440]  hundreds NPR Texas governor deploy state guard to stave off Obama takeover all
[55:30.440 --> 55:33.440]  he did was say I'm gonna monitor the federal troops and make sure they
[55:33.440 --> 55:37.520]  follow everybody civil rights and and make sure everything goes well I
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.520]  understand Texans are concerned but you know we support the military and we
[55:42.520 --> 55:45.000]  sure everything's fine but we'll make sure that's what states supposed to do
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.360]  is monitor the feds and they monitor us and then they misrepresent that
[55:49.360 --> 55:52.800]  governor Abbott said that Obama was trying to take over it's the same thing
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.640]  praying on their audience who are totalitarians and are so dumb they
[55:56.640 --> 56:01.600]  don't know it and reading from this did I mention the ISIS terrorist they've
[56:01.600 --> 56:04.280]  come across the border and they're going to hit soft targets all across the
[56:04.280 --> 56:08.240]  Southwest they've set up a camp a few miles outside El Paso that includes a
[56:08.240 --> 56:12.600]  Mexican Army officer and Mexican federal police inspector not sure what
[56:12.600 --> 56:16.320]  they're doing there but probably nothing good that's why special forces guys
[56:16.320 --> 56:22.640]  are here get it to wipe out ISIS and impose martial law so you know what you
[56:22.640 --> 56:27.960]  say get back to the party or grab another beer this is a transcript from
[56:27.960 --> 56:35.680]  NPR making fun of us this was put out May 2nd one day before the attack in
[56:35.680 --> 56:43.760]  Dallas and ISIS is recruiting Americans Brits and others and ISIS is taking
[56:43.760 --> 56:49.920]  responsibility I mean is a cop shot in the leg enough of a terror attack for
[56:49.920 --> 56:52.840]  you it had been a whole bunch of dead people the police hadn't been staked
[56:52.840 --> 57:04.080]  out figuring there might be an attack doing their job the FBI NPR says ISIS is
[57:04.080 --> 57:09.560]  in all 50 states that was in the Associated Press a couple months ago
[57:09.560 --> 57:13.160]  now I don't know if they're gonna be provocateur windup toys I'm gonna let
[57:13.160 --> 57:16.480]  them attack us but I know our borders are wide open and they let ISIS flaw of
[57:16.480 --> 57:21.480]  the world the FBI tried to stop both these guys from flying to North Africa
[57:21.480 --> 57:27.400]  both the dead shooters one of them had gone to court over caught lying about
[57:27.400 --> 57:35.760]  going to North Africa but the judge ordered them released okay the point
[57:35.760 --> 57:39.720]  is is that NPR and everybody thinks they control reality you don't control

[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:36.760]  Alex Jones
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.880]  there's new photos out of West Virginia the Michelle Obama federal lunch
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.240]  program which is nothing but a giant scam for donors to sell rotten food to the
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:53.360]  kids and tiny portions burnt burritos and melted plastic was served to the
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.840]  school and it's because there's no respect there's a passing the buck zero
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.080]  tolerance has allowed people to shuck the responsibility and say I'm just
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.600]  following orders and it starts with saying a kid to a picture of a gun so
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.640]  we're gonna arrest him or we're gonna lie and say there's a law you got to be
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.520]  vaccinated because the school said so or you know what Michelle says we burnt
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:28.760]  burritos or food with bugs all over it we do it and they've been here lying to
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.640]  us as unemployment intensified as more people went off the employment roles as
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:41.360]  every real economic number showed our society was falling apart and now
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.800]  they're slowing down on QE which is trillions of dollars given to major
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.920]  mega banks and corporations that are basically tax exempt it came out in the
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.680]  news yesterday in the street publication that George Soros got away with not
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.120]  paying over six billion dollars in taxes on a law he got the Republicans and
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:10.440]  Democrats to pass that George W. Bush signed while he again lobbies to raise
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:16.560]  middle-class taxes but I'm just excited that it's finally in mainstream news I
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.400]  mean I talk about this all the time but here it is from CNN then Michael
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.000]  Savage is going to be joining us America's capsizing economy can it
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.560]  right the ship follow little stock markets weak economy have created a
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.400]  perfect storm for nearly flat growth zero point two percent with cook numbers
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.280]  is actually negative to 23% Ron Paul agree with me last week the question is
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.720]  whether the US economy and markets can write the ship in May and beyond there's
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:55.320]  reason to believe they can start to this week and it's just more false hope more
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.160]  bull but they know now that they can't lie to you about the economy anymore
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.040]  people aren't buying it so they're claiming oh basically growth's flat no
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:12.720]  it's negative and negative growth for three quarters is a depression here's
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:19.640]  another headline from zero hedge US factory orders drop for fifth consecutive
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:26.200]  month after six months of MOM drop something not seen outside of a
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.880]  recession February saw a modest zero point two percent rise in factory
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:36.360]  orders which has spurred economists to extrapolated 2.0 expectation for March
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:43.080]  however while factory orders rose 2.1 in March February was revised to a zero
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:49.200]  point one drop leaving the manufacturing orders down 4.0 yoy the
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.000]  series of yoy drops continues now a fifth consecutive months to indicate a
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.880]  recessionary environment the ratio of inventories to shipments remain stuck
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.880]  the extremely elevated levels but you can use all these fancy numbers all you
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:12.360]  want they're cooking inflation they're cooking unemployment they are cooking the
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:19.760]  price of goods in the inflation numbers there's all these new taxes and
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.000]  regulations and Obamacare weighing things down Obamacare and it's going into
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.240]  effect now the last year is meant to kill and consolidate and clout and
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:35.160]  pivot the economy and that is exactly what's going on now is there a way out
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:43.360]  of this nightmare I don't know because the the the social engineers don't want
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.480]  us to have a culture and they want a divide and conquer strategy where we're
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.720]  just a tower of Babel where no one can communicate with each other and that's
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:58.240]  basically what it's like now where we're a mass folks stay with us
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.000]  despite the revelation that half the officers charged in the death of Freddie
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.520]  Gray are black the narrative that black people are being disproportionately and
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.120]  unfair targeted by predominantly white police officers and a racist criminal
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.160]  justice system continues to dominate but let's look at the facts between 1980 and
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.920]  2008 blacks committed 52% of homicides compared to 45% committed by whites
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:24.040]  during this time blacks are only 13% of the population in 2013 black criminals
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.360]  carried out 38% of murders compared to 31% for whites again despite the fact
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.640]  there are five times more white people in the US despite the fact that black
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.040]  people commit an equal or greater number of violent crimes than whites whites are
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.760]  almost twice as likely to be killed by police officers police brutality is a
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.680]  huge problem within the United States and anyone that denies that fact is part
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.360]  of the problem but until we acknowledge and address the equally important issue
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.720]  of violent criminality within the black community and until that becomes part of
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.440]  the national conversation this issue is never going to be resolved read more in

[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:30.640]  well islamic state has taken responsibility for their botched attack in
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.360]  garland texas pretty much my hometown I'm from the same suburb rock wall
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:42.600]  bordering it and CNN I've got the clips is actually basically saying the people
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.960]  deserved it because they dare have cartoons criticizing the prophet
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:54.560]  Muhammad well we are a classically liberal society and that doesn't mean
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.440]  we restrict free speech it means in the words of Thomas Jefferson free speech
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:06.520]  the first amendment is king it is simply amazing to see CNN MSNBC
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:15.440]  criticizing the people who are pretty mild who were putting on this event we
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.960]  have the FBI claiming that ISIS has tentacles in all 50 states we have
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.160]  judicial watch that I found to be very credible claiming that they found camps
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.440]  over the border we've gone out and investigated found huge mosque you name
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.680]  it meanwhile focus on the family head dr. dobson's come out and said the
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.360]  collapse of western civilization is now happening and I agree with that
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:44.120]  statement someone who's been ringing the alarm bell for decades is dr. Michael

[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:28.960]  also banned in England for criticizing radicalism and I've been basically told
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.720]  that I'll be banned if I don't watch myself and now this is coming here so I
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:38.080]  want to get into his new book Michael savage countdown to Mecca I know his
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.400]  previous book openly criticizing China and their power grabs got censored so it
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.920]  looks to me like as I'm reading it's just excellent they basically putting
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.400]  what he thinks is going to happen into a novel we'll see if I'm correct in a
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.960]  moment but you need to get it from the multi-time number one New York Times

[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:14.520]  the situation that just unfolded up in garland and the response to saying the
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.200]  first amendment is to blame and and nothing about the shooters that shot the
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:25.440]  cop are my friend you we're getting a little feedback so what I need to do
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.280]  here is turn off my speaker I think Alex can you hear me now yes I can you've
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.120]  got the floor go ahead Alex can you hear me now yes I can go ahead we're
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.080]  having a little technical problem tell me when we're ready to go here because I
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.640]  don't know if you're hearing me we've got a little bit of feedback back and
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.440]  forth we don't normally have problems with skype dr. savage you go ahead and
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.080]  just have the floor I want you to speak to what I was just talking about all right
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:58.320]  can you hear me now yes okay sorry about that
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:04.440]  Alex the thing is this we've been penetrated we've been infiltrated how
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.320]  high up it goes as anyone's guess we know that the president's middle name is
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:14.640]  not Jesus we know that the military has been told to stand down we know the
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.680]  police have been told to stand down we know that there's only one sacred
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.880]  religion in the United States of America and it isn't the founding religion
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:28.040]  it's the invasive religion and the fact of the matter is the FBI director who
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:35.240]  warned us six weeks ago this was just before Hussein's conference anti-terrorism
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.280]  counter-terrorism conference in Washington where he invited Muslim groups he
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.240]  disinvited the head of the FBI who said that ISIS is in 49 out of the 50 states
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.200]  well why would he do that to the head of the FBI who warned us there's only one
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:56.640]  answer someone in that team in the White House is playing for the other side
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.080]  they're not on our side now of course the good news here Alex is when I saw
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.000]  this terrible event last night the good news is the beefy Texas cops killed a
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.800]  scum they they wiped the scum off the planet sent them to heaven where they
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.760]  can go rape go rape babies I guess that's their reward they get to rape 72
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.760]  rape babies in the next world what a what a religion isn't that great kill
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.760]  someone on this planet so you can rape 72 infants in the next world doesn't see
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:32.800]  it and find that up obscene and pornographic and sickening what can I
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.280]  say to you that you don't already know Alex we know we're at war they've been
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.680]  at war with us for a thousand years the president has been been at war with
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.280]  America for the time he uh I guess what left Columbia and discovered his
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.080]  afro roots when he was a kid he didn't identify with his radical side read his
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.200]  own autobiography then he found out that by acting like a black radical
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.360]  everyone kissed his feet and look where he is today so why should he stop now
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.240]  he wasn't a radicalized young man but he found out that the white people fell
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.880]  on their feet the minute he acted out the black panther game look where he is
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.120]  now why should he stop now he has that scum Al shot it in the White House 50
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:17.040]  times and no one says a word the anti-police scum Alex this is I get
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.200]  apoplectic over this can you imagine if a right-wing president had won the
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.680]  presidency in away and shortly after winning invites the grand wizard of the
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.600]  Ku Klux Klan in and out of the White House for six years tell me what the
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.840]  vermin at CNN and MSNBC would be saying Al Sharpton is the equivalent of the
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.880]  Ku Klux Klan on the other side there he is his ace walking to the plane put
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:46.240]  that from the feed mr. Cool mr. Cool helicopter he got Air Force one he's got
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.560]  the biggest military in the world and the country is dying maybe you can give
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.000]  one of those limp salutes now to the Marines what is their in-game dr.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.880]  Savage clearly I thought you were exaggerating seven years ago when you
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.200]  said they would destroy the country that this was going to be at that they
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.320]  just destroy everything because I imagine that when they finally got power
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.720]  that that they would then do the rational thing and want to maintain it
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:17.720]  not even a moral perspective why scuttle the country why wreck it why destroy it
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.240]  when they're in control of it well I believe Alex that it's a it's a
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:28.000]  combination of both willfulness and incompetence there are those within the
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.320]  administration to go back to the 60s in mentality bring it all down man you know
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.240]  then let's rebuild it in our own image that's the that's the communist view the
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.720]  left-wing university view wreck it screw the patriarchy bring down the white
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.720]  man you'll have paradise that's one view the other view is a bunch of morons who
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.120]  are college girls who know nothing on drugs raised on Adderall parents who
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.200]  are psychotic I can name three of them most of them speak for the Obama
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.560]  administration one of them is the stupidest girl I've ever seen in my life
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.720]  I call them Obama's sorority you know who I'm talking about that Marie Bar for
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.080]  Marie Harf oh yeah it's Samantha Powers all of them moronic stupid college
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.960]  girls sorority girls they don't know what world they live in they live in a
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.960]  sheltered bubble and they think that they know the world they know nothing
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.840]  that's what scares me is that they're starting wars all over the place they
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.880]  openly armed al-qaeda now they call it ISIS they claim they're fighting it but
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.680]  they keep catching them you know giving them arms shipments their own military
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.200]  said two years ago that they wouldn't be part of being the Air Force for al-qaeda
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.160]  so now they've changed the narrative let me ask you this do you think they're
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.840]  going to be successful in their takeover plan this was a ballgame Dr. Savage
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:52.200]  what's the score right now patriots versus the the the French Revolution
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:58.520]  crazies oh the guillotines are ready the guillotines are ready and they're
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:05.160]  greasing the skids for the blades yeah that are they gonna be successful how
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.760]  much more successful can they be Alex internment camps I mean what's next with
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:16.360]  this group of it in it maniacs don't they have a problem turn it into into the
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.680]  book but I have to talk about countdown to mecca no I want to get to that we're
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.080]  going to break in just a moment I because I know it ties into it but let me just
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.440]  ask you this then because the book so important and and I want to promote it
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.920]  but but just the two minutes before you go to break the police are super awake
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.760]  despite all their problems the country's disintegrating I mean you know what do
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.960]  you expect the military from my what I've seen is super awake to what's going
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:44.760]  on doesn't that give the the the socialist the globalist a problem isn't
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:50.160]  that their Achilles heel no because Obama gutted all of the combat veterans
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.520]  who could have led a movement against an illegitimate government he started it
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.440]  right after Benghazi I named them in my last book one general after the other
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.080]  was purged like Stalin purged them only instead of shooting them first they
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:09.160]  smeared the generals he got drunk in Moscow you hear this he got drunk in
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.480]  Moscow so they fired the chief of our nuclear arsenal the man who knew how to
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.920]  run the nuclear a system he was fired for getting drunk in Moscow another one
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.640]  was found with a gambling chip in his trousers after going gambling I mean if
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.280]  that was the the the score here they would have all quit I guarantee they've
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.160]  done more than get drunk and go gambling so no they're gone the police have been
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:36.000]  this the bald by this illegitimate racist administration holder has the ball
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.600]  the police look what they've done in various cities using the pretext of
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.720]  racism all lies to the ball of police so yeah the police are there they're brave
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.920]  in their arm the military is there they're brave and they're on but who's
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.920]  gonna lead them we're without a Napoleon where did the troops go well that's
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.120]  another point that's why George Soros got caught as you know openly trying to
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:02.040]  fund the white instigators they send in to chant you know kill the pigs and all
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.000]  this and then they get away with it it's so clear they're trying to start a
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.840]  civil war remember my last book stop the coming civil war yes well guess what
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.720]  it started it's we don't have to talk about it has there been a civil war
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:20.840]  yeah it's a slow burning civil war what do you think we'll we're looking at here
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:28.400]  it's a race war these are their shock troops these are their shock troops and
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.240]  they don't have the brown shirts yet they don't have the on bands but soon
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.360]  Obama could deputize them isn't that a natural army for him Alex it is that's
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.000]  what he called for in a national security force take the crypts in the
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.280]  bloods give them a green uniform and give them a weapon and they'll keep
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:49.760]  order in the streets won't they it's so crazy and history's repeating itself
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.800]  it's it's just bizarre oh land dr. Michael savages our guests we're gonna

[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:25.520]  and in vice versa because I can tell you at the end of the day we probably agree
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.000]  with each other on about 90% of things it doesn't matter we want to have a
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.920]  country I know I'm not speaking for him I've listened to a show I know what he
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:39.760]  says and I'm on the same page these are real totalitarians we're dealing with
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.480]  it's about raw power they're using a communist playbook but they're fascist
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:49.280]  when it gets to the upper echelons that's what Ted Cruz has said he's called
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.800]  them liberal fascist and they are and Michael Savage one of the smartest
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.120]  intellectuals out there when it comes to really understanding what we face his
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:06.280]  last book came out a year ago how to stop the coming civil war and now 96% of
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:13.160]  Americans in a Gallup poll think of race wars coming listen I'm not I'm not
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.080]  kidding when I say that I in the last few months three times I've had people
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:22.040]  three times come up and say racial things to me in Austin a very friendly
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:26.840]  town living here most my life and it's happening all over the country and it's
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.080]  all MSNBC in the White House meanwhile we're being sold out to China Michael
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.560]  Savage has a new book out Countdown to Mecca and Dr. Savage I'm guessing I
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.280]  haven't read the whole book yet I know your last book got censored unprecedented
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:46.800]  because it was nonfiction and really criticized China and and now am I
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.680]  guessing that you've put a lot of what you really think's going on into a
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.920]  fiction book or what's happening that's why I went back to the novel format
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:59.880]  because you can only go so far in in speaking in a documentary fashion about
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.280]  reality I have a radio show and I have restrictions as you do we have various
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:11.920]  and sundry restrictions meaning on how far we can go on a public broadcast when
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.800]  it comes to fiction though I guess you can use your imagination still the
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:21.040]  censors haven't gotten to it so in Countdown to Mecca I pose a certain
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:25.880]  theory that a group of patriotic generals get together and they see the
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.880]  scourge of Islam what it's doing to the world and they want to take care of the
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:37.800]  problem directly so they plot to do something in Mecca and the book is all
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.040]  about the generals plot now these are families these generals are not wild
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.320]  cards off the gutter three four generations and military highly
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:51.840]  educated VMI West Point so the dialogue between them analyzing whether to do it
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:59.640]  is I think very well done and my hero Jack Hatfield gets wind of it in an
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:05.640]  obtuse manner and he analyzes this and realizes that by doing harm to Mecca and
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.520]  killing millions of Muslims you're gonna set off a war that will never end so he
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:15.800]  tries to stop the plot now I will be castigated with this book by the vermin
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:22.880]  and MSNBC and CNN for saying the opposite of what the book says the vermin the
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.440]  cilantro it's to not use a word that's has too much connotation we won't call
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.440]  Wolf Blitzer and company vermin we won't call MSNBC vermin we'll call them
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.800]  cilantro it's the cilantro it's will say oh he wants to blow up Mecca without
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:43.120]  having read the book it's the opposite the whole book is a novelistic plot
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.920]  which shows intelligent people discussing such a doomsday scenario and
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.320]  saying don't be crazy it'll set the world apart that's like Jade Helm all we
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.320]  said is it's conditioning for military occupation for the Tea Party which they
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.000]  admit and the media says that I say Obama is gonna invade Texas they always
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.840]  deceive please continue I want to read you a paragraph Alex I know that you're
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.960]  gonna like it so it's the generals are talking about it it's two paragraphs
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.440]  long and one of them says to the other that they should do it and the general
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.680]  Morton invites them to a shooting range at West Point to finish the plot and the
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.920]  men say to him what did you get us here for and he says I will cast terror into
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.560]  the hearts of those who disbelieve Brooks quoted as if General Morton had
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.960]  not spoken therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.640]  them who said that he looked into the face of each general Reynolds seemed to
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.840]  look back at him but in fact his gaze wavered between the generals eyebrows and
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.120]  eyelashes bulls eye looked around like a soldier on point only Morton stared
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.560]  back defiantly his lips tight the Quran sir Morton replied verse 812 just one of
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.160]  the more than 100 verses that call Muslims to war with what they call
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.200]  non-believers general Brooks asking who do they call non-believers anyone who
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:05.200]  isn't Muslim renal Reynolds interrupted Quran 551 states that Muslims are not
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.800]  to take Jews and the Christians for friends a lot describes them as unjust
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.920]  people close quote the Quran invokes kill the infidel 120 times general Brooks
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.040]  said quietly almost to himself he gazed at the empty sky what kind of say
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:23.520]  nation permits these people to practice such open hatred sir Morton said I
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.000]  thought we were here to discuss Firebird that's the generals in their
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.400]  discussion of why they're planning this Michael Savage quick break long 18

[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.440]  Republicans showed their true colors you got angry and elected Democrats and
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:28.320]  when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:33.360]  side were looking out for your best interest you acted like they were crazy
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:39.480]  but the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again

[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:48.400]  people thinking and i'll be honest if you go back 15 years ago i saw the
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.680]  peanut clash of civilizations the neocons saying we'll start a war with islam
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:57.320]  because they've already started a war with us and have this big war and beat
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.280]  them i think that's kind of what savage is getting into in the book i haven't
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:06.280]  read it yet only if 30 or 40 pages it's excellent like all those books but
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:14.000]  that's basically a more modern example in fiction of what's going on but at the
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.840]  same time i'm not what you'd call to use a liberal term islamophobic i know
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:22.520]  that there are ala whites and non radical groups and you know nice people i
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:27.480]  went to college with or whatever but the big strong vein of islam funded by
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:34.920]  saudi arabia and others is to conquer is to take over is i mean they're killing
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.360]  christians all over the world that you and admits in 2014 the worst year on
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:44.200]  record for christians i mean and then i watch cnn anderson cooper praising the
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.920]  muslim brotherhood when they were blowing up churches every day
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:52.960]  crucifying people upside down and attacking the military with one of our
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:59.160]  greatest allies so i see obama working with odinga his muslim cousin in in
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:06.840]  kenya to try to overthrow that country i mean this is real and is this really a
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:15.000]  double cross is this a triple cross what is the larger plan there are hundreds
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.360]  of saudi princes worth billions of peace some of them over 200 billion apiece
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.760]  you hear the richest man in the world's carlos slim that's not true i mean could
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:30.160]  it be that actually we're we're being overtaken because england if you they
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.840]  had thousands of kids in different cities being raped by muslims and they
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:37.200]  couldn't even report on it because that was seen as racist or or is political
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.560]  correctness so strong that the left really doesn't understand what's
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.480]  happening michael savage get more into your book into the generals into what you
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.920]  break down finish up that part of them please answer my question about what the
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.640]  endgame is who you think these operatives might be and what you think the
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.440]  establishments doing michael savage right you know your questions are so good
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.440]  alex as usual that they have answers built into them and and it would be
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.960]  commentary upon your commentary for me to even answer them you said you said it
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:13.480]  all by asking the question but i mean to embroider on it is about all i can do
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:20.600]  the fact of the matter is either it's by design or by default that islam is
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.280]  conquering the world make no mistake about it they are conquering the world
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.880]  we all know about londonistan we all know that the most popular young boys
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.720]  name in england is mohammed now what's a nation on earth permits this to how
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.880]  could us a nation with such great dignity and great strength founded by such
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:43.560]  powerful crazed men that conquered most of the world roll over like a bunch of
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.360]  pansies for this how did this happen well let's go back the leader who let
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:55.360]  this happen said himself i think was tony blair said i made a mistake by
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:01.440]  promoting multiculturalism he said that two years ago remember oh he made the
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.320]  mistake well have they reversed it have they stopped importing muslims from
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:11.480]  pakistan have they stopped giving welfare to families with 12 children have
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.200]  they stopped the hate preachers from preaching no they banned michael savage
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:19.720]  from entering england have they said oops was sorry we didn't mean to ban you
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:25.240]  no they didn't say was sorry they didn't give me reparations for having banned me
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.520]  and denied me the access to england and the great dental care that i have been
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.080]  after all my life or the great cuisine of england i mean after all i can't get
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.280]  fish and ships in america you know how great their cuisine is and i i can't get
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.080]  my teeth fixed because i can't go to england the law the laws here is i love
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:46.240]  i love the brit i love english society british english society england the
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.120]  people i do love the people are amazing i there's a certain wonderfulness about
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.960]  english people at least they used to be when i went over there i missed that but
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.120]  the fact of the matter is i'm not the only one ban from entering england some
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.720]  brave israeli generals are banned from entering england some in very good
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.920]  company and is their loss but the question is not about michael not about
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.880]  england the question is what's coming here that's all we care about there's a
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:14.360]  huge difference between england being taken over in america and it's both good
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:18.320]  and bad news we're all all on to the teeth here england has no weapons they
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:23.160]  would disarm by their liberals a long time ago right so this is the only thing
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:27.880]  that keeps the psychos the sorority in the white house in check is fear of the
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:32.520]  masses with weapons but don't worry they're working on that plan they got
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.760]  the gangs in the streets of bolton more fergus in new york and philadelphia all
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.280]  riled up they can always deputize them and give them weapons will tell me just
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.200]  bring out their ak-47s since they already have them somewhere in their in
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:51.160]  their mother's closet so that's not good news you're asking me what the solution
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.520]  is alex if i knew the solution it would have happened already we had an
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:59.480]  election last november that was the solution elections used to be the place
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.360]  to go you went i remember i used to say this on radio 15 years ago you go to
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.960]  the ballot box or else they're gonna go to the bullet box so we had a way to
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:12.120]  redress our grievances we voted we said get rid of this bum in the white house
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.640]  get rid of the sorority of leftist fanatics get rid of the corruption it
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.720]  stinks to high heaven he's the most abusive president in american history not
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:24.280]  in terms only of his politics but the abuse of
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:28.920]  the finances of this administration he has sully the white house by inviting
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.760]  one lowlife after another in there for parties were not even allowed to see
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.600]  he abuses the taxpayer by flying on air force one
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.960]  on any whim without any accountability what if bush had gone off
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.880]  on air force one as often would mrs bush have dare take the air force air force
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:49.960]  two or three on a junket with the whitham look at the clinton spending half
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.760]  the money they stole from the Haitian kids for their own private jets and
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:58.680]  hotels and and foreign donors it's all illegal
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:03.160]  they are above the law the entire democratic parties above the law
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.280]  and then john bainer won't repeal obama care the supreme court's about to rule
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.840]  that uh marriage isn't sanctified this is a crazy war
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.200]  and what do all the so-called liberals think they're going to do
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.640]  when they finally crapped in the nest and ruin the country
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:25.560]  i mean these people have a death wish okay we can agree on that but that
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:28.520]  doesn't stop the problem it doesn't say we had an election
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.320]  last november the election was supposed to change the
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.320]  course of this society it's we said no to the communist
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.920]  running america we said no to the socialist the globalist the islamist
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.760]  i call him the democrat socialist islamist party that's what the ds
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.160]  i is that's the democrat party is today democrat socialist islamist party
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:51.400]  i've been saying it for three years and america went to the polls and voted the
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:54.520]  next day the con man the charlatan in the white
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:58.840]  house got up and basically said drop dead i don't care what you voted on
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:02.040]  you ain't seen nothing yet by the time of the next election
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.160]  i'll make certain that there's so many immigrants in this country and that the
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.520]  gangs are riled up in the gutters that the white man will no longer have the
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:12.120]  majority in this country then i'll show you what this country really wants classic
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:16.760]  socialism with with a with an elite in control of 20 000 nuclear
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.520]  weapons and space stations i mean it's just totally insane listen
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:24.200]  if we brought the immigrants in and actually taught of americana
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.360]  renaissance crazed freedom it wouldn't be an issue but
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:33.320]  literally i've i grew up in dalish you know in the 70s and 80s i've never seen
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.920]  such racial tension even in the sweet little town austin and i'm not
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:40.840]  whining about it three times the last two months
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:44.600]  at night coming out of restaurants uh or or once on a martin springs this
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.280]  saturday at like eight at night i've had black people come up and just
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:51.160]  threaten me and then they go threaten the next group of people
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.520]  and and bear their teeth at me because i'm white and i'm like my god what
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.000]  country did i just wake up in how did this happen
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.320]  i have no bad will against black people i mean it's just it's mind control
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.000]  but it's alex come on how did it happen obama's been working on this from the
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.720]  day he started him and holder every speech they've given has
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.480]  fanned the flames of racial enmity
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:17.320]  i have followed their speeches at colleges and high schools
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:22.040]  it's constantly harkening back to the civil rights movement and how black
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:26.600]  people used to be in the back of the bus and how your ancestors suffered
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.280]  we were getting along we were moving together in this society
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:34.040]  there was a relative harmony in this country and then this administration
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:37.640]  came along and we feared what would happen is happening alex you know it's
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.560]  going to get much worse you know they're ramping it up for the
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.120]  2016 election we all see that you don't have to be a
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.200]  an einstein to see what this man is doing you know give him one credit
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:54.440]  he's diabolically a genius he really is diabolical and you know i always say
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:57.640]  it's an elite running things but as you know there's different power structures
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.880]  this really is a cancerous power structure that he actually believes
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:05.800]  their communist ideology it's just crazy well
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:09.560]  i you know a story just came out over the weekend about fidel Castro's former
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.600]  bodyguard who said that he gave up on fidel when he
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:15.880]  found that he was a coke basically a cocaine dealer
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.480]  the revolutionary who fought alongside fidel Castro
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.400]  said that he had to abandon Castro because he found that he was nothing but a
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:26.520]  drug dealer using Cuba as a transit point right
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:32.280]  in order to to fund the revolution so what does it have to do with here i don't
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.600]  know what does it have to do with here
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:38.920]  why are we opening up why are we opening up uh uh channels with Cuba all of a
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.880]  sudden where'd that come from
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:47.000]  who is really running america and why but you we know it didn't start with
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.240]  obama come on let's be real alex in the last three months of george bush's
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.040]  reign i was not invited to the white house
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:59.960]  sean hannity was rush limbo was and the other members of the rush limbo cartel
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.080]  remember now on the other side alex there's a cartel as well and you're
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.000]  you're a target of theirs as am i am i oh i know oh they're constantly engaged in
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.200]  dirty treks fox news rush limbo uh hannity they're all
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.280]  represented by by um hannity and him and other
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.920]  lesser talkers or no one ever heard of are represented by limbo's brother
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:24.600]  and that's the rush cartel they're the establishment republicans who pretend
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:28.600]  they're not they've been carrying water for the republican party for as long as
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.040]  i can remember when bush was president they were invited to the white house
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:36.520]  remember that alex we are invited i wasn't no they were given a tour
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.960]  i wasn't invited but hannity went there when old hannity went there
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:45.000]  all uh they all went in there well they had private meetings with bush
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.840]  but but that's the thing where does the establishment blue blood
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.600]  country club group think they're going to be in their luxury golf courses
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.840]  when they bring in a violent revolution how stupid are they what is their
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:00.840]  problem i don't think they think that far ahead
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.840]  i think they live for today they live for the comfort of today
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:08.600]  the convenience of today they believe there's a buffer between them and the
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.520]  masses and that whatever uh hits the fan isn't going to hit them
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:16.440]  they actually think they're insulated sounds like maria tornado
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.240]  well yeah as i said the guillotines are are already being uh released you know
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.280]  and they're getting them ready then i say that is i don't mean to me well mad
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.280]  rudge as you know tweeted that america may fall soon
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.680]  now uh james dobson is saying that i mean the really smart people can see
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.680]  what's going on you don't be that smart now
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:39.320]  i mean this is really historically obvious and and i got to be honest with
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:43.160]  you it's i'm i'm i'm really concerned about i mean i don't know how much time
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:46.040]  we've got left what else and then we get back into your book
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:50.360]  what else do you think they might pull in his year and a half left in office
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.880]  that's what i was getting at remember at toward the end of bush's regime
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.960]  it was it was september of that year and i called him a fiscal socialist i've
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.240]  been calling him that for three four months and i was castigated for it
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:05.000]  by the limbaugh's and the hanities what do you mean fiscal socialist they never
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.840]  heard the phrase well that's what bush was doing expanding
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:13.800]  you know spending he went crazy and i said you've seen nothing yet
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.560]  watch what bush does in the last three months of his regime and what did he do
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.480]  he busted the economy and gave us obama remember obama was the
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.520]  the savior who was going to save us from what had happened to the economy
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:28.680]  remember that yes so it was it was a transition
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.600]  after eight years of republican ruin to give us eight years of democrat ruin
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:36.680]  that's the game alex eight years one gang eight years the other gang
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.320]  eight years one gang eight years the other gang meanwhile the economy is
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.040]  is uh apparently doing well is it i don't know we don't know we don't really
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:49.240]  know no even with cook numbers at zero point two percent that's what
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:52.280]  unlimited free money to the establishment i think you're right
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:55.960]  though history shows this your historian elites always become
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:00.040]  decadent and think they're invincible and what i'm saying is
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:03.880]  you ask what what will obama likely do between now and there's a long time left
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:08.200]  it's not just three months left he has a lot of time so we already see what's
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:12.520]  coming the riots he's got the gangs in the streets on
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:16.440]  his side he's got them awakened he's got them armed they're armed to the teeth
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.800]  with illegal weapons aren't they and so you're gonna see more race war
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:28.840]  right up until the labor day of 2016 for an obvious reason
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:32.200]  and some conspiracy conspiracist fear
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.720]  that he's going to declare martial law i'm not so sure that he needs to
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.080]  because it doesn't matter whether he's in power or hillary's in power
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.600]  or another demon cat it doesn't matter mali whatever his name is
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:45.320]  they're all the same they're cut from the same cloth they're run by the same
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:50.200]  controllers it doesn't matter they're going to take the street garbage
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.080]  they're going to take the illegal immigrants and they're going to walk the
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.800]  entire election so it doesn't really matter who runs on the other side
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.320]  so i don't think that it's going to come down to the camps and the internment
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.400]  and martial law i don't believe so i think it would upset
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.760]  the economy and the world for him to do that they've got that as an emergency
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.880]  fallback they've got that as an emergency fallback but rest assured if they
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:16.120]  don't get everything they want they might have the bravada
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.280]  or what's the better word the hutzpah to push it i i mean i they're bold
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.680]  fortune favors the bold i think they're capable of anything
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:28.040]  well they are capable of anything because he's the smoothest conman america
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:31.000]  has ever seen in the white house you got to admit he's smooth
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.280]  he doesn't scream in german he doesn't march to the host vessel song does he
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.960]  but he's performing along the lines of any other petty dictator
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.160]  we know what he is we can see it those of us who can smell it
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:46.520]  he is out shopped in with a smoother act sure so
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:50.600]  in other words strip away the veneer of obama and look at that street rat out
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.680]  shopped in and that's who's running the country
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.880]  well look at how sharp has been at the white house over 50 times
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:02.600]  i mean al sharpton is a joke a huge weirdo gang member fbi informant uh who
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:08.280]  wears huge leisure suits suits uh with long coming curly hair it really is a
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.560]  freak show it'd be like having benny hill as president or
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.640]  something it's just it's just none of it makes sense
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.240]  let me ask you this i want to get back into the book here michael savage
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:19.960]  is our guest michael savage countdown to mecca
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:25.640]  because that's the other big wild card is isis running around stirred up by our
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:31.400]  ally saudi arabia you've got the whole new cold war getting kicked off
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:35.320]  you've got all these public statements about the tea parties the main enemy and
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:39.560]  gun owners of the main enemy and veterans of the main enemy and then meanwhile
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.120]  we just mentioned five weeks ago hey jade helm
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.360]  list texas is the enemy in utah and orange county um
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.560]  it's and then here's these training manuals that says
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.920]  you know semen and forbs and ap that the military is trying to take on
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.360]  the veterans of the tea party we have a concern so they have
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:01.720]  literally hundreds of publications a day saying i'm saying obama is going to
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:06.040]  invade texas in july never said that they never quote me saying that they just
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:09.480]  lie why do you think they're running around like chickens with their head
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:13.640]  cut off about that well we all know who they are there's a very small
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:17.640]  only you mentioned annison cooper these are talentless people with no ratings
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.760]  they see an independent guy like you so what are they going to do they see an
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.040]  independent guy like me who rose from the ashes
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:28.280]  like a phoenix i rose from the ashes i'm on over 250 the biggest stations in the
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.200]  country the limbaugh cartel hates me because they
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:35.080]  can't understand how i got where i am without them
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.160]  fox news hates me i call megan kelly moth of washington
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.760]  sarcastically because she thinks she's the founding
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:46.680]  mother of the nation she is doing the bidding of the islamists as far as i
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.840]  can tell especially after this event they actually blamed
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.600]  pamela galler for this event in texas didn't they
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:57.720]  yeah they said it's her fault they basically said she deserves it

[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.320]  that's the good news that's the future we should look to
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:32.760]  all of the armed police in this country you have a job
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:37.080]  all of the military in this country active or retired who are armed to the
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:40.520]  teeth you have a job stand up to this scum

[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:53.160]  it really is true they kill you well it it it really is true that we ask why is
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:57.000]  this elite doing this they have a crazed

[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.520]  they want to mount america's head on their wall
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:10.440]  and they will work with any coalition to do it
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:14.920]  and i got to say it there is mentally ill as hitler
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:18.680]  uh i mean they really are mentally ill
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:23.480]  bugs i've for years been screaming for if you're going to work for a corporation
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.320]  you have to pee in a cup why don't we demand that the president
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:30.840]  and all the members of the cabinet and all members of congress
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:36.040]  go for a mandatory drug test every month i'd like to know what they're on
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:41.000]  that's a good point today on that's a good point i want to shift ears into
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.840]  your book again because it ties into all of this
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:50.680]  uh talking more about your book okay i'll make it simple you know it's hard
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:55.400]  to describe a nonfiction a book of uh you know a novel
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:59.480]  i did something different in this novel with the jack hatfield character
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:03.880]  i created new characters including and this is an interesting one
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.840]  a a jewish gangster sol minsky who actually works with jack hatfield
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:13.080]  to protect him from the cia who was trying to kill him because
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:16.920]  see jack's trying to stop the bombing of mecca or the it's not bombing actually
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:22.680]  it's another technique and he the government then goes after jack hatfield
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:26.360]  and he has to employ local gangsters to protect him
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.760]  so there's new characters and he's one of them and sammi's uh
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:34.520]  his new brothers a new character is jack hatfield's brother sammi the clown
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:38.200]  ex marine uh motorcycle accident living on the
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.440]  proceeds of the motorcycle accident he lives next door to a russian prostitute
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:45.960]  who becomes a heroine in the book because she's invited by the generals
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:48.840]  to do her work and she overhears the plot
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:55.880]  she has one word and her name is anesthesia her eyes normally alert as
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:00.360]  those of a nordic wolf seem wary and frightened she's a great character
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:04.120]  and i would say she's the hooker with a heart of gold character come back to
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.240]  life so what i'm saying is i make it entertaining
[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:10.040]  alex you know there's only so much people can take from
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:13.480]  you and i it's it's palatable only up to a point
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:17.720]  that's another question that's another question i used to could work 18 hours a
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.160]  day literally many days but it was killing me
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:25.000]  and now i've only worked about you know 10 10 12 and i need some time with my
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.440]  family this stuff is so sick now the things they're
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:33.480]  doing that i i would go crazy if i continued to
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:37.240]  work as hard as i was you multi-time you know top
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:40.760]  supplement developer top you know best-selling author kind of launching
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:45.400]  a lot of the health revolution 35 40 years ago i'm not bragging for you it's
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.560]  actually true for folks that don't follow it i mean you've made you know your
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.720]  family things you've deployed some of the biggest
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.760]  products in the country i don't want to brag for you but there's some of the
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:57.560]  biggest names out there you don't talk about on your show
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:00.760]  you don't need money but you're writing books constantly you're on the air
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:05.880]  every day but what do you do to unwind
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:11.160]  i sleep a lot i'm serious i the minute the show is over i go to sleep for
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:15.960]  20 30 minutes it's a great technique alex i need to do it i try um
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:19.400]  no no but here's the thing go to a dark room it has to be a totally absolute
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:24.040]  dark room no light hold it hold your keys in your hand
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.040]  on the side in your hand on the side of the bed it's an old trick
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:31.720]  and let yourself drift the minute the keys hit the floor it'll wake you up it's
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.080]  no more than 12 minutes that's all you need you sleep more than
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:38.280]  15 12 15 minutes you're gonna get groggy i agree yeah
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:42.200]  right so 12 minutes you do the Edison nap that's number one
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:49.320]  i am saturated in vitamins i am swimming in a score bait i'm a big vitamin c man
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.800]  i've been for years and and many other things
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.880]  i uh i mean people know me i talk about it i love to eat
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:59.400]  i do drink at night and that helps me
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:02.680]  just completely turn it off you have to turn it off
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:05.720]  yep you have to turn the switch alex you cannot do your wife probably doesn't
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:10.120]  want to hear you talk about this am i right yes right she's stopping already
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.240]  i i mean you have a family so you do have to learn to turn that off
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:16.600]  or you'll go crazy well i do turn it off and then people walks me on the street
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.600]  and want to talk about this stuff and i i'm i'm sorry i just can't do it
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:25.240]  i play i ride a bicycle every day and i do it in the way that uh
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:28.840]  mr. Kellogg did you know the man who created Kellogg's conflicts he would
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.960]  ride the bicycle one mile a day from his home to the plant in battle creek
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:35.720]  michigan in a suit and tie looking like colonel sanders
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:39.240]  and he said i'm riding the bicycle for equilibrium in other words we think
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:43.960]  we're supposed to ride the bicycle for a cardio pumping our bodies to death
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:47.960]  he saw it another way i ride my bicycle for that balance
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.480]  you know i'm saying equilibrium that's right yeah yeah just ride the bike a
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:55.560]  little like a mile on a flat road get equilibrium
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:59.960]  try to see it in the zen way in the in the uh in the in that way honestly
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.080]  and these are things they're simple techniques and also luck you've got to
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.560]  be lucky alex i'm over 70 i'm 73 years old i should
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:11.400]  be dead by now my father died god rest the soul of 53
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.080]  my grandfather at 47 so i used to hang on on hoping that in
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.160]  the old world my great grandfather lived they said no he died at 45
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:22.520]  i've had a gun to my head since i'm young always thought i'd be dead
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:25.480]  it's what drove me into the nutrition fields what drove me
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:28.520]  to the island south pacific islands when people didn't even know where they
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:32.680]  were fiji water yeah well i was in fiji before there was fiji water
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.120]  collecting medicinal plants talking to folk killers
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:39.320]  no you're right i made the decision about four years ago to lose weight getting
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:42.280]  shape because of the same thing like a lot of my great grandfathers and people
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.240]  were successful businessmen they all died like 50 from heart attacks and
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:48.440]  never slowed down my dad's dad as well so i've
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.400]  absolutely that's why i just won't work as much as i did
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:55.480]  because i just it's it's up to other people to fight this as well
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:58:01.160]  not just us and it comes down to scum wants to conquer better men better women
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:04.440]  and and and if we let them conquer us i guess they are better than us

[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:37.080]  well compared to what i was a few years ago what are you doing i don't have time
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:41.400]  to tell him i'm doing true clean nation iodine
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:44.520]  i'm doing oxy powder once a month for six days to flush my upper and lower
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.720]  intestine out it's a higher level oxygen than time releases it goes through the
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.160]  stomach and i'm taking supermail vitality
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:55.080]  that he's an herbologist he's got three phd's
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:59.480]  and he he could read the ingredients and know that it's the known concentrated
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:01.880]  organic forms of what naturally boost a lot of
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.080]  hormones that we already have that have been suppressed by all the estrogen
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:09.880]  mimickers and chemicals and garbage uh i just gave up on things and was just
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:14.440]  killing myself uh fighting the globalist to the point of
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:19.800]  becoming a caricature almost and so i about five years ago started working
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:24.600]  out again and dieting but it just did it got like 20 30 pounds off and getting
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.840]  proper nutrition and other things but was now 60 plus pounds and i plan on
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:31.960]  losing another 25 pounds or so and i'm just doing
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:36.200]  over a process by taking over six months uh i don't claim them some beach boy
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:40.440]  model mr universe or something but compared to where i was it's it's a
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.880]  total change um and i just owe it to finding out
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:49.160]  you know not taking some synthetic multivitamin but really finding out
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.360]  hey fluoride is the bad halogen and blocks out the good one
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:58.040]  and the feds used to make the salt companies put iodine in the salt now
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.760]  they took it out in the 70s and and then we have
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:06.520]  all these thyroid problems and yeah you could take too much of it too so
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:11.320]  consult your physician but it's not a game and we discovered iodine that
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:14.040]  nobody else has got for whatever reason they've always got it
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:19.880]  they call it nascent but it's really bound if it turns red immediately on
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:23.960]  paper and then black that's that's what all the other
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:28.760]  iodine's do ours turns electric purple blue
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:32.440]  because that's the color of iodine crystals
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:36.920]  it's nine nine nine nine nine i nine i mean it just no one's got anything like
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.320]  it and it's from seven to twelve thousand feet
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:44.760]  and it was by the grace of god we had a pretty good seaweed based one
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:50.120]  that would turn red and black but some blue so it was very pure very good and
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:53.480]  then we had people trying to mess with our suppliers actual espionage and
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:57.400]  stuff that goes on at this level and dea and stuff because it's such a controlled
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:00.840]  substance it's what you can make with it
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.560]  and a bunch of hoops and then we just found this deep earth source dr grip did
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:10.120]  and we were able to get a large supply of it and
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:14.200]  he said you're going to get sick in two weeks you're pretty toxic

[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:04.680]  it's expensive to get the real stuff but it's better than nothing
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:08.120]  you don't have the iodine the bad halogens

[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:17.160]  odds with the philosophy of the constitution and the declaration of

[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:54.360]  it's alex jones
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:07.480]  we're here my friends
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:10.280]  monday through friday from 11 a.m to 2 p.m central
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.800]  back weeknight seven o'clock central standard time
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:17.000]  well we've had him on many times as the best-selling author lieutenant colonel
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.240]  tony schaefer ran the anti-bin laudan unit could have killed him twice that
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:25.160]  came on congressional hearings that was ordered to stand down
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:28.760]  he blew the whistle on it i remember seeing it uh in the new york times in
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.640]  san francisco chronicle they then tried to investigate
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:34.680]  inclaiming he was using a cell phone to call his wife which you're allowed to
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:37.240]  do next they'd accuse him of stealing a
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:41.480]  pencil uh but he was able to get through that persecution
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.320]  londoncenter dot org is one of the think tanks he works with
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:49.880]  and the u.s army war college i'm not going to go through
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:53.800]  all the things he did is an highly experienced cia trained
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:10:00.840]  army intelligence officer but now he is being censored
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:06.040]  with a biography he's writing with stuff that's declassified
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.840]  because they don't want him telling what really went on and that ties into
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:15.000]  record journalists being locked up record amount of four-year requests being
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.600]  ignored violating federal law and the open records act it's a felony when
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:24.360]  they do that uh it it it ties into FCC commissioner cns news
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:30.200]  feds may come for drudge with the federal elections commission claiming he
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.720]  can't you talk about candidates and if they can knock off drudge they can
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:37.560]  knock off info wars everybody else they're already delisting us from the
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:43.400]  ratings along with drudge at alexa.com uh there is just massive
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:48.680]  censorship going on at so many different levels
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.680]  there's an iron curtain of suppression descending down
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:56.120]  undoubtedly and so lieutenant colonel
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:01.480]  anthony schaefer joins us overall before we get into your current case here's
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:05.320]  the headline military uh redactions of public info
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:08.760]  criticized lieutenant colonel schaefer and defense intelligence agency have
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.600]  been locked in court battle for five years now
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:16.600]  and now you're able to speak about it courthouse news has some of the report
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.520]  what do you make the colonel schaefer just at the big view first
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.840]  of the overall climate uh in this country i don't think of it as what you see
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.280]  in a free society well i agree with you completely alexa me
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.720]  let's be uh totally clear here uh everybody this includes uh elements the
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:38.200]  left elements on the right uh basically being censored a friend of mine who
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:43.960]  works uh pat eddington uh did a foyer he works for a a new jersey democrat
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:48.200]  today he's a staff of a foyer on the stingray
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:53.240]  program and the fbi returned something like 5 000 pages completely blank
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:58.040]  completely redacted so it clearly this is not a left right issue this is just a
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:00.680]  big government versus the everyone else issue
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:04.520]  uh and when it comes to a number of things that they're ongoing
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:07.640]  regarding your issues our issues it's all about
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:10.280]  essentially this white house more than any other
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.440]  has been going about trying to essentially um
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:17.960]  make sure that the public is uninformed that that the only sources of
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:22.040]  information will be available to the public actually come from some asleep
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:26.040]  approved source by the white house or some menu to the white house
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:29.800]  and i thought you know it's it's one of those things where if you don't pay
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:33.000]  attention if you really don't watch day to day
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.640]  look at every single source of information you can and
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:39.080]  and frankly alex one of the things which i find most interesting right now one
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:41.960]  of the best sources of information i get on a daily basis
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:45.640]  is the mail uk a fun newspaper because apparently
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:50.040]  somehow they're not as centered as us media is i've got to say that the daily
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:52.680]  mail is one of the best newspapers out there it you know it covers a lot of
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:56.360]  celebrity news as well uh but it just has hardcore info all
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:58.520]  the time and it's one of the few publications that'll
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:02.600]  actually carry what we say and not criticize info wars
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:06.440]  i mean take jade helm all we said is man there's a lot of military training
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.640]  we have some of the manuals they talk about fighting veterans and tea party
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.160]  being their next big enemy with no proof this is part of conditioning
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.560]  they've had literally a thousand plus publications cbs nightly news
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:22.040]  you name it come out and say alex jones and governor abbott say obama
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:26.440]  is going to invade and how dare them say the army wants to kill texans
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:31.080]  so they build this straw man uh out of that just more and more and i think it's
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:35.240]  the complicity of mainstream media working with the
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.000]  white house that allows them to run these hoaxes
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.680]  watch a little bit i think that's a big thing that is in in vogue right now
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:45.480]  essentially she said creating straw men creating
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.240]  phantoms which don't exist at all you have to become the main issue that the
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:52.920]  mainstream media follows and thereby distracting public from the real issues
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:55.720]  and and it's it's really important again for your show
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.200]  for others alex to actually as as best we can as best anyone can
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.720]  to state the information as best they understand it may not be
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:08.920]  but uh i was in a bit of hot water with pentagon about two months ago when i
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:13.240]  made an a call in january to basically uh my sources told me that the
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:17.640]  burgdoll certain burgdoll was going to be basically indicted for desertion
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:20.280]  i got a lot of heat off that but it turned out to be correct so i think it's
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:23.560]  very important that that everybody is best at in fact
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:26.520]  get the best information out there out they can to the american public as
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.080]  quickly as possible now you've gone through hell
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:32.680]  with your fiction books your nonfiction books and the new book you're putting
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:35.480]  together tell us about those books for a moment
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.320]  well um the the court action basically to give your audience a very
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:44.360]  brief summary is uh they attempted alex from day one ever since i've been
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:47.880]  publishing books to go back essentially redact or
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:50.200]  basically delete force me to delete information
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:53.400]  which is in the public domain now you might
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:57.000]  wonder why would a government agency spend so much time in this case
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.080]  five years trying to essentially pull information
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:06.920]  out of a book of two books that um that is in the public domain and
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.760]  there's really no clear answer that you can get i think i believe personally
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.960]  goes back to as you mentioned the introduction my testimony on
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:17.320]  capitol hill relating to the 9-11 information we had
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.720]  regarding up here uh others believe that maybe
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.400]  it continued retaliation by the government against me simply because
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:27.560]  they don't like the fact that continue to speak
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:30.360]  well i think it's both but what gives them the right
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:35.320]  to say that you can't put a clip out of a new york times article in your book
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:38.360]  for those that don't know you might explain that to them that
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:41.560]  they're restricting things that are public it's kind of like when gibbs was
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:45.720]  told say there's no drone program when for a decade it was public it's like
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:48.840]  saying there is no sun coming up in the morning i mean maybe
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:52.120]  you're not allowed to say that army uniforms are green next
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:55.880]  right well that's the thing i mean we we had a partial victory by the fact that
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:59.880]  the judge a judge called here rule flat out that the government cannot take
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:02.840]  information which i have testified to was in the public record
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:05.880]  and say that they cannot use that that is for example one of the things that
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:08.760]  they actually tried to censor me on which is totally
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.920]  personally think about it is my my open testimony to congress
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:16.200]  which is part of the congressional record they the the government
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:20.360]  uh this this administration attempted to say that information in the public
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.560]  record and the congressional record could not be used by me
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:27.640]  in my book that's how insane this guy and and clearly they completely lost on
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:31.080]  that we continue to contend any other issues
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.760]  clearly the judge ruled with the government as you mentioned alexa
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:38.120]  it's in the public domain the information relating to my work in
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:41.560]  afghanistan the contents of the bronze star all these
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.600]  things which they're now arguing should be classified to me are totally
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:48.200]  insane by the fact it's been in the public domain for almost 10 years
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:52.520]  and it is uh almost an orwellian attempt by the government
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:56.680]  almost uh because they can do it they're going back now attempting to rewrite
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:16:59.400]  history and to me it absolutely makes no sense it
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:03.640]  waste the taxpayer money in this case because we did actually win the account
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:08.600]  of of the fact that they tried to keep out the the clear testimony
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.480]  they've lost they've lost that piece and they're going to have to pay the court
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:15.240]  piece from my lawyer as well so this is where you know their continued
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:19.800]  obsturance about things that are clearly in the interest of the public to know
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:23.560]  and then fighting it it really makes it look sure well it's also getting worse
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:27.080]  i mean i see the headlines every day where now the white house just said two
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:31.400]  weeks ago no more four-year period we're not going to respond period i mean
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:35.640]  that's totally arrogant it's totally illegal but it's like opening the
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:39.320]  borders up now i've got to shift gears because you're such an expert on al-qaeda
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.080]  on ices which obviously is the same mohabbis group
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:47.240]  what do you make of the fbi saying at least 49 states do have ices
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:50.760]  in them this attack in garland that it would have been in like you know
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:54.040]  chicago or something my god would take in the police hours to respond or
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.880]  imagine london what do you make of that
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:03.160]  and the recruiting power of these groups uh in the west because you know as you
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.440]  know a lot of the recruits are being pulled out of the west
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:12.120]  right well two things first uh ices unlike any other group
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:15.800]  it within modern the modern era of art and i care as an effort
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:20.520]  have adopted a very effective strategy of using social media
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:23.640]  they're very slick they have actually paid a lot of money to bring hollywood
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:27.800]  types in and make some very slick videos and this this draws in this goes to my
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:32.040]  second point they've been able to focus on a group a specific
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:36.120]  group that is essentially vulnerable to their message
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:39.000]  and there's a lot of folks out there and it doesn't matter if they're rich or
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.200]  poor i found it totally laughable one that they
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:45.320]  these people just don't have jobs it's totally insane
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:52.520]  this is all about a very severe form of of extreme racism where they believe
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:56.040]  that they are the superior race that they have the right to basically dominate
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:58.680]  everybody else and if you don't choose to be dominated
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:02.440]  you can die that's right i mean isn't this the most operandi it did
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.960]  from all over the world it's a lot of times it's even upper middle class
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:10.200]  spoiled brat kind of gangbanger types who want to be somebody and want to go
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.560]  be in an adventure and want to go rape and rob and do whatever
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:17.640]  they want i mean i mean isn't this just a legion of scum
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:21.320]  exactly and they've been able to hit that nerve and so they are they're able
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:24.520]  to bring these people in and many of them and i think in the case you saw in
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:26.440]  texas and i think you're going to see more of this
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:29.960]  and by the way i shout out to james comey james comey i do believe is trying to
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.760]  do that the best he can in very difficult circumstances by the fact he
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:35.560]  recognizes all these people but we've got to do more and
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:38.600]  essentially they're going to get to you to come until we just pop them where
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:42.360]  they started and i reckon stay there i want to come back and
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:45.240]  finish up with that and then get into the larger
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:50.360]  isle invasion uh the islamic state has taken credit for this attack with their

[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:14.280]  we're going to air as well i'm alex jones we're talking to bestselling
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:16.840]  author american soldier lieutenant colonel
[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:20.280]  tony schaffer who was blocked twice from taking out bin laden
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:24.280]  confirmed right before 9-11 very interesting because i guess you need
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:27.960]  that enemy a lot of folks know that i wrote the book on
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:32.680]  and now it's even the new york times uh on exposing false flag terror letting
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:36.760]  groups attack you wind up toys things like that
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:41.800]  that said islamic state before they even islamic state when they were the
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:45.880]  syrian uh you know free syrian army i was exposing it tip of the spear getting
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:49.400]  the military to talk about it to say we won't be in al-qaeda's
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:52.520]  air force ron paul picked it up ran paul ted cruise
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:55.640]  colonel schaffer was at the tip of the spear in congress saying don't do this
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:01.240]  we were all there exposing it we started getting real threats and and i'm not
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:05.480]  supposed to get into it because law enforcement got involved and stuff but
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:08.040]  real stuff with ices and you've now seen them
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:13.160]  you know up there attack the uh the event with their wind up toys up there in
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:18.520]  garland i recognize this as different and i see a
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:21.880]  lot of liberals a lot of trendies mayday march this week and i shot video
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:25.800]  ed had folks kind of dressed up like that a lot of islamic state
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:31.640]  things at public events so it's kind of a trendy thing with young people
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:34.840]  is the point i'm getting at that's why i say i believe it's a real threat what
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:39.480]  do you say colonel schaffer it is no i think these people have struck a nerve
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:43.400]  and some of these young people actually suffer from what you talk about it is
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:47.880]  kind of a society that's very artificial it's hard to fit
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:51.240]  and what's happened is instead of people seeking the truth and seeking to become
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:54.680]  better people uh what they do is they they see
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:58.680]  an opportunity to belong to something and as you mentioned right before the
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:02.920]  the last break they see this as an adventure i mean many of these kids i
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:06.360]  actually work with a group called the association of british muslims in London
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:10.040]  who are attempting to stop the radicalization
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:14.120]  it's interesting because many of the muslims who are the british empire
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:18.680]  from essentially the the old empire states of pakistan and india see this
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:21.960]  as a threat many of them have assimilated to the british society
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:25.240]  and they don't like this very extreme brand of islamic
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:29.320]  hate and it actually damages the brand which president obama doesn't even
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:33.000]  understand this islamic error so happening right now as you
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.720]  point out is that these people these bots essentially
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:39.800]  are being recruited and that it happened in australia last year where
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:43.480]  a bunch of these folks who were recruited were essentially told to do jihad in
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:48.200]  place don't come to syria do what you can to disrupt the society you're in
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.080]  so i think that's where this is all going this is why komi
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:54.920]  things call me that director if the i said that in every state except alaska
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:59.400]  you have elements of icis now essentially coalescing and beginning to form
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.120]  and simply put the fbi is not big enough counter every single threat
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:07.640]  no matter how successful they are alex eventually one's going to get to the
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:10.040]  net i think last night we saw one get to the net
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:13.640]  because apparently as we're known to the i said
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.760]  texas being what it is i think responded very quickly
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:20.120]  and very aptly to the threat of course i don't think we're going to see all of
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.800]  our states have to pick up that tradition
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:28.040]  well and exactly i criticize the fbi for when they get caught manufacturing
[02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:31.400]  plots are basically setting people up that are already radicalized
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:34.680]  but but that's higher level justice department stuff
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.920]  usually just like 9-11 you had fbi at the grass roots trying to stop hijackers
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:42.760]  order to stand down in this case it's the same thing again
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:45.880]  where they had them in custody know they were going to north africa
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:49.400]  and the judge basically released them even though they got caught lying about
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:52.920]  it so i think it's that the grass roots fbi gets their hands
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:56.360]  tied in real cases right it's correct i i'll wait for the
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:00.040]  number of the i agents and yes i have friends who are very close to
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:03.080]  to the headquarters and they're often saying the headquarters is the problem
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:06.440]  obviously alex is the politics once you get past the field agents
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:09.240]  if the politics of up the chain of command and i think that's where everything
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:12.840]  gets really off the rails is here in washington dc
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:16.120]  what do you think washington's main strategy is because we know they were
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:19.720]  funding the the whole anti-syria deal now they claim they're fighting ices
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:22.920]  you're up there in a lot of classified stuff you can't get into is this a real
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:25.960]  war against ices or what's happening
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:28.840]  let's go back and you you predicted this and we talked about this a couple
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:32.040]  years ago but look we the united states had a huge
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:35.640]  role in helping ices get off the ground it was the arms that the left
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:39.000]  vangasi were shipped to the turks that first gave them to these
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  so-called moderate extremists who then sprouted out you know instead of going
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.120]  after the Assad or they're supposed to do they figured out hey
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:49.480]  it's it's easier to go after ungoverned space in Syria and iraq
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:53.400]  and off they went so we had a huge hand in this i'm not sure how we're going to
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:57.240]  atone for that with that said right now it's way out of control
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:02.520]  they've been able to establish funding global funding anywhere al-qaeda was ices
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:06.040]  will be or is soon going to over overcome al-qaeda
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:09.960]  so this is the problem alex they have been able to their strategy
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:12.360]  to basically
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:15.640]  it's careful organization and in about 18 months
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:19.800]  and it's one it's simply put we are not in the game washing is not have a strategy
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:22.520]  to defeat them either either at the local level at the
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:26.760]  national level or at the strategic level right now it's all bits are off i don't
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:29.000]  think they want a strategy because they're letting them be
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.400]  saudi arabia's proxy army to take over wink wink what do you say to that
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:36.040]  i think it's part of the problem right now is you have people in the middle east
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:39.880]  on both sides that includes the Saudi so it is a problem all right london center
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:43.880]  dot org get his books colonel shaver thanks for your courage and patriotism
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:48.840]  in your service thanks i'm here god bless you we'll be back stay with us
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:57.480]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:03.320]  as protests over police brutality erupt across the nation
[02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:07.000]  i'm reminded of this passage from the capitalist conspiracy booklet
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.840]  written by g edward griffin in 1971 if those who seek world dominion can
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:17.640]  stimulate leftist mobs into violent confrontation with local law enforcement
[02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:23.400]  and also provide exhaustive news coverage so that the entire nation can see
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:26.680]  and tremble then the peaceful and freedom loving majority
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:31.880]  can be programmed to accept a vast expansion of government powers and even
[02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:36.120]  a national police force offered supposedly to end the violence
[02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:39.400]  we're witnessing that same old hegelian dialectic today
[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:43.000]  by stimulating unrest and allowing it to spiral out of control
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.360]  the federal government can offer itself up as the solution
[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:50.120]  sacrificing ourselves for the king's nefarious takeover plan
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:54.360]  join the revolution subscribe to the alex jones channel on youtube and

[02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:06.520]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to
[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:10.840]  develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:15.000]  help children focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control

[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:25.400]  the big question people are asking on info wars.com and the comments of any
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:29.880]  other places do i think that the event up in
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:33.400]  garland texas suburb of dallas to the east
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:40.040]  was a false flag and i've seen criticism on youtube and on info wars by a
[02:34:40.040 --> 02:34:43.160]  minority of people saying jones i'm done with you
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:48.600]  isis and al-qaeda are fake none of these attacks are real
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:53.080]  i can't believe you're promoting all this propaganda
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:59.400]  i'm the guy that wrote the book and introduced the terms that were already
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:04.840]  there but popularized self-inflicted wound inside job
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:08.440]  false flag the galleon dialectic
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:14.120]  staged terror even mainstream media admits that and demonizes me for it
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:19.080]  now they dumb it down and say he says there's no radical Islam and that
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:23.320]  george bush had a dynamite plunger like wiley kyle that's a meme
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:29.000]  that's been said on cnn fox msnbc cnbc in fact we played the clips here
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.320]  but last week we played some of the clips
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:36.600]  where they say that very thing
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:40.520]  just like they say that i say obama's gonna invade texas and put everybody in
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:44.600]  femacamps this summer never said any such thing
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:47.720]  i said it's part of the ongoing conditioning with jade helm and now i
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:51.560]  have my own listeners arguing with me on the street like i'm covering up jade
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:56.600]  helm they think it's a takeover it's very
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:01.000]  frustrating okay i've studied this so long i know the angles i know how the
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.560]  enemy operates it's criminal networks in government
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:08.600]  corporations creating bigger crises that they
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:11.880]  pose as the saviors to to get more money and more power
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:16.200]  they have the motive they have the history they've been caught
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:20.440]  is this new event a false flag
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:26.280]  even the new york times had to admit that out of a hundred
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:29.640]  foiled terror attacks in the last decade
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:34.360]  almost all of them the fbi went out and basically provocateur mentally ill
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:38.920]  low iq idiots to do it now you could argue they're trying to find out who
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:42.120]  might do it but then when you give them the bomb give them the gun
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:46.200]  and then bust them right before it's pretty bad in my view
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:51.080]  but when you let them attack it's even worse and i've had a mod salon
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:54.680]  a mod salim the former egyptian intelligence
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:37:00.920]  uh kernel on and he's the guy again in the new york times cbs news who exposed
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.560]  that they let that bombing go forward and didn't let the lower fbi didn't want
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:09.160]  to do it it was the higher level let the bombing go forward
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:12.200]  that was a staged event both men that carried it out
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:17.160]  had basically 75 iqs were on welfare and had to be taught how to drive the
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:22.520]  truck they were so stupid a blind crazy chic who was a known
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:26.520]  terrorist blowing up you know marine corps bases and he's allowed to live in
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:32.920]  new york they're letting these people operate it's a fact
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:36.680]  and we have to have that come to jesus moment that this is going on
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:38.920]  and they're not even letting a few terrorists slip through there's the
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:41.320]  headline terrorist plots hatched by the fbi
[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:45.000]  they're not letting a few of these slip through
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.480]  so they can then get more security to actually protect the country that'd be
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:51.160]  bad enough they're doing it to set up a paramilitary force
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:56.040]  that'll get public support to then flip that onto the patriot movement
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:58.840]  and i told you that 14 years ago before it happened
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:03.800]  now you watched it in slow motion happen what a train wreck
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.720]  but that doesn't mean every attack is staged
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.840]  it's staged that they gave five six billion dollars we know of the last
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:17.640]  five years to attack syria libya egypt well it's it's five six
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:20.760]  billion just in syria alone a couple billion and libya
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:26.440]  billions of aid into egypt gosh about 10 billion 10 billion dollars
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:29.160]  our government
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:32.200]  and you got to say it's obama we always say oh they're all controlled the same
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:36.600]  people i've seen a major shift i mean where there's public funding
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:40.920]  by nato and our government of islamic state that was
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:45.080]  the free syrian army i just had colonel shaffer on he said yeah you
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:48.440]  predicted all this three years ago when ben gazi happened
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:51.720]  yeah yeah because i know how this works
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:55.160]  and shaffer said yes you're correct but it's classified i can't tell you
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:59.160]  he got called in and chewed out for it
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:06.600]  and shaffer is involved in a bunch of shadowy stuff he's a good guy
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:10.200]  he tried to kill ben laden twice and was ordered by the cia not to do it and
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:13.720]  then he blew the whistle and they tried to put him in jail for it so i say thank
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:15.880]  you for your service i mean i'd like to see ben laden dead
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:21.720]  it's a bad guy he died a kidney failure shortly after that
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:25.720]  so we don't know exactly what happened in dalis
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:29.240]  in garland i just call it dalis i grew up there i grew up in the town right next
[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:32.920]  to garland my stomping grounds were garland
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:36.680]  i know where that convention center us
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:40.840]  in fact the wildest girls were from garland that's been a lot of time there
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:45.800]  a lot of time in garland but long story short
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:50.680]  when you see them demonizing the the police when you see them claiming the
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:53.800]  people inside deserved it when they were just
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:58.120]  exercising their first amendment when you hear the new york times and
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:04.120]  cnn we have articles on info wars dot com blaming
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:08.440]  the people inside and trying to whitewash this and cover it up
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:15.640]  you better believe it really happened because if they had staged
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:19.160]  this it would have been a place where there were hundreds of disarmed people
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:22.920]  like a school they would have been conveniently killed by another black
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:26.600]  op team or by part of their handlers who would then
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:29.960]  exfiltrate get out and be basically flown to safety because i've seen this
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:34.440]  happen before this didn't fit
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:41.000]  into any of those narratives and it looks like a real event
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:48.360]  but does that mean then that there aren't other staged events absolutely
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:54.920]  isis is recruiting out of the west isis is in america
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:58.680]  isis i believe and i've been saying this is going to start attacking
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:03.320]  shopping malls and convention centers and colleges and and and now you see it
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:05.960]  happening there have been a bunch of shootings at
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:09.800]  military bases and a bunch of other shootings of police and stuff by his
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:13.320]  long assist it's going on
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:16.520]  and we now know that an fbi informant didn't meet with the garland shooting
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:20.280]  suspect and then the the fbi arrested them
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:25.480]  found out they've been flying north africa and the judge released them
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:30.600]  the fbi this time didn't give them guns and didn't say please go attack
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:34.920]  like they do sometimes or maybe they did we just don't know
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:38.680]  that yet so because the fbi has a history of this
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:43.320]  you have to look at it and it's fair to say they might have done it
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:46.680]  new headline london guardian government agents directly involved in most high
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.600]  profile us terra plots see boom same thing the new york times is saying but
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:56.360]  it's beyond that now that was previously with al qaeda that
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:01.000]  was made up to a great extent most of their leadership really was working for
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.600]  western intelligence so that's come out now they've retired the old one they're
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:09.080]  killing adam gadan the adl heads grandson and
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:13.080]  the jewish leader of al qaeda doesn't anyone believe that
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:17.800]  and they're they're basically getting rid of that old network
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:22.120]  that the west and israel had some control of
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:26.680]  and they're rising up a new one that's a real jihad army run by saudi arabia and
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:30.760]  turkey and with arabic speakers and they're
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:35.560]  going out and finding the bots as colonel shape were found them dumb
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:41.160]  xcon mad at the world they've got religion you're not going to talk about
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:44.040]  my mohammed
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.920]  and the police had been tipped off that they'd probably get attacked they were
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:53.800]  lying in wait the guys get out shoot from their car
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:58.840]  they start firing for one second and they're taken out
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:02.360]  and that's why you want local police because if you didn't have local police
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:07.160]  the feds could command right down the chain put in a special team
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:09.800]  that would have probably stood down for two hours and let them go in the
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:12.920]  building and kill a hundred people
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:20.680]  so is it a false flag this one i don't think is
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:23.880]  was the boston bombing false flag absolutely
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:29.320]  telltale sign the older brother tamerlin was on the cia payroll the russians
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:32.520]  blew his cover two years before the fbi said they never heard of him
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:35.720]  turns out they were following him had met with him over and over again
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:40.920]  family hooked him with major spy agencies the brothers set up lied about
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:44.680]  they tried to execute the younger one to shut him up says he's not guilty
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:48.120]  lawyer says he's guilty should have been a mistrial right there
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:52.440]  phony is a three dollar bill the media then spins it and says that i'm saying
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:54.920]  craft international was involved in the attack
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:58.520]  no they were wearing craft punisher hats and the craft uniform
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:01.800]  of khakis and black shirts and we're clearly part of a drill
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:05.160]  and local news admitted a drill and so did the boston globe
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:09.240]  and then they said there was no drill and then i'm a liar and that i say craft
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:12.280]  did it i never said that
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:18.600]  i said there was a drill there's a cover up we need to investigate it
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:21.880]  it's clearly a false flag does that mean we know exactly what happened no
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:24.680]  but we know it's fake
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:29.960]  so let's go ahead and go to rob do's report on this with the history
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:34.280]  of the fbi and others provocaturing islamist here it is
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:37.320]  you've probably heard of the shooting at the prophet muhammad cartoons
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:40.920]  exhibition in garland texas over the weekend but did you know daily mail
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:43.640]  used pictures from the event but bowing to political correctness
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:48.360]  lacked out the offensive images and thus far president barack obama has been
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:51.560]  silent about the attacks and cnn used the event to attack the
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:54.440]  second amendment when it was the second amendment that stopped the gunman
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:57.720]  in their tracks but now we've learned that the fbi has been watching one of
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:01.880]  the suspects using an fbi informant elton simpson the man identified as one of
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:04.680]  the two gunmen killed was under surveillance by the fbi and
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:08.520]  subject of a terror investigation the fbi has arranged numerous fake terror
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:11.800]  plots including the washington metro bombing plot the new york subway plot
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:15.240]  the plan to blow up the sears tower in chicago the plot to bomb the portland
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:19.160]  christmas tree lighting and others in 2014 human rights watch released a
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:22.680]  report stating nearly all high-profile domestic terrorism plots in the united
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:26.680]  states after 9 11 included the direct involvement of government agents and
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:30.600]  informants you can read about all these stories at info wars dot com
[02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:34.520]  rob do reporting for prison planet dot tv can the federal government take
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:39.000]  credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation the fbi has foiled about
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.520]  17 plots to kill americans during the past 10 years
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:46.600]  they all have a common and reprehensible thread they were planned
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.080]  plotted controlled and carried out by the federal government itself
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:54.360]  in all of these 17 cases from the fort dick six
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:57.720]  to the lakawana seven to the portland parade bomber
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:01.240]  the feds found young men of muslim backgrounds
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.920]  loners who were bitter at america they befriended them cajoled them and
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:08.680]  persuaded them that they could change the world by killing americans
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:13.880]  but none of this keeps us safe all of this makes us less free as any one of
[02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:18.200]  us can be entrapped and we are fools if we praise the government
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:22.680]  for exposing a plot of its own creation and saving us from a danger that never
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:25.720]  existed
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:30.040]  that's rob do and commentary by judge depolitano a few years ago
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:35.640]  when that news first was breaking it's actually over a hundred of these events
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:39.640]  he was talking about 17 big ones it's one thing if you
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:43.000]  get intel somebody's planning to launch something and then you go approach him
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:46.040]  and say hey let's do this to see if they agree then you find out what their plot
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:51.640]  is but to lead the thing and organize it is aiding and abetting
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:55.160]  it's beyond entrapment uh it's orchestrating
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:00.600]  it's provocaturing but see that was the old al-qaeda model
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:04.680]  now they just hype the daylights out of it twitter and facebook let them recruit
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:09.880]  but censor us and you notice a lot of these guys are young black males already
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:13.400]  mad and everybody's being racist to them they've been in jail they get recruited
[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:18.360]  by the imam and they're just it's just it's it's it's it's a
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:22.360]  perfect storm of idiocy
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:26.200]  and they want to be somebody
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:34.040]  meanwhile the economy is falling apart meanwhile islamic state just blew up
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:38.040]  a large part of a market today in demascus our government helped fund all
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:40.840]  that this is crazy it's like the government's going to protect you from
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.960]  radical islam and then this is their proxy army
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:49.640]  that's doing all of this i'll tell you the good news though
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:58.840]  the really exciting news and that's that people are waking up to jade helm
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:02.360]  the governor senator cruz have come out and said the people don't trust the
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.160]  government anymore can we queue up that ted cruz clip again thank you
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:10.040]  and it shows
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:17.960]  that the ridicule of npr the ridicule of msnbc doesn't matter anymore
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:22.040]  now npr actually has a big audience msnbc doesn't
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:28.760]  npr taxpayer and publicly funded has most of the most plump fm stations in the
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:32.680]  country and meanwhile they want to censor and
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:36.200]  promote fairness doctrine to censor talk radio that's libertarian and
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:40.920]  conservative and as i mentioned earlier fcc commissioners
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:47.000]  feds may come for drudge federal communications commission member
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.600]  ajeet pie said over the weekend that he foresees a future in which federal
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:53.480]  regulators will seek to regulate websites based on political content using
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:55.480]  the power of the fcc and federal elections commission
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:58.840]  he also revealed that his opposition to net neutrality regulations have resulted
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:02.280]  in personal harassment and threats to his family
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:06.760]  and it goes on from there yeah they've said that's the plan they've said they
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:10.520]  can regulate it and we'll do it like they've done talk radio
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:14.920]  because they're messing with the ratings to make us look bad
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:18.120]  we covered that in the first hour they're just they're pulling out stops
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:23.480]  because we're cleaning their clocks folks and the power structure is so
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:26.040]  desperate knowing there's revolution in the air
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:29.080]  they don't want to be peaceful revolution of free market ideas a
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:32.680]  revolution of prosperity they are desperately trying to make a
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:37.000]  revolution of racial division and fighting
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:43.080]  and people are so mad at the government that it's not just poor black people
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:49.720]  that are mad when we're off the cops it is white people it is hispanics
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:53.720]  it is just people are sick of the government and the most representative
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:50:00.520]  of government is somebody in a uniform
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:05.240]  notice it's the criminals in government that are scared of people in uniform
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:09.800]  because that's somebody low level that they don't control
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:18.840]  homeland security says they want to go after
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.560]  the veterans and then the soros group wants to make every problem the
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:29.960]  cops of course there's 300 plus 100 million people 330 million people
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:35.320]  325 million people whatever it is now the latest is 327 million isn't it
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:38.680]  of course there's bad police of course the training's bad many areas
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:41.720]  of course there's horrible thugs in uniform some places
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:46.280]  it's a major problem but the answer to fixing the whole government
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:51.080]  isn't in federalizing the police and blaming them for everything
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:54.280]  i mean it's like nazi germany but it's almost inverse
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:58.040]  they use the cops to take over but then they're the new group escape go it's
[02:50:58.040 --> 02:51:03.240]  it's very sophisticated why use dilup when you can use broadband
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:07.160]  why travel with this when you can use this
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:10.520]  and why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver
[02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:15.320]  when you can use supernatural silver supernatural silver is state-of-the-art
[02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:18.920]  and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective
[02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:22.200]  than those other silvers it's powerful enough to protect you

[02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:16.760]  all they want us to do is keep on forcing them
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:22.840]  i tell you they don't want to see us live together
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:25.800]  they want us to go on killing one another
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:32.040]  all they want us to do is keep on killing one another that's how
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:47.960]  it was just more bob marley on my playlist good music
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:51.880]  i mentioned that ted cruise clip this is a big deal to have a u.s senator from
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:55.720]  texas coming out and saying yeah you know
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:00.840]  i'm gonna talk to military about jade helm but the public doesn't trust obama
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:05.160]  well if you can get them to start saying that then we can go all the way
[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:08.280]  and this is all about acclimate and the public for military takeover we're not
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:11.560]  saying it's imminent it basically already happened
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:14.520]  and they talk to the public like their five-year-olds and go that's cuz like
[02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:18.680]  david doerr said that's cuz alex hates the military
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:21.160]  that's right that's why the military doesn't want to train to take guns
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:24.520]  because they're bad too right because they hate the military
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:28.520]  we hate who's in control of it
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:33.080]  the military is on average the most
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:36.760]  oh wait group that's why they're listed as the number one enemy by the criminals
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:40.680]  that hijacked the country of course hitler was afraid of the general
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:44.840]  staff in the military of course stolam was afraid of his military
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:51.400]  they're the tyrants they're afraid of it because they're doing illegal things
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:55.960]  let's go to ted cruise well i have a great great deal of faith and
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:56:00.120]  confidence in governor abed he is a longtime friend and mentor of mine
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:03.400]  you know i understand the concern that's been raised by a lot of citizens
[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:05.960]  about jade helms question i'm getting a lot
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:10.120]  and i think part of the reason is we have seen for six years a federal
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:13.800]  government disrespecting the liberty of the citizens
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:16.920]  and then that produces fear when you see a federal government
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.880]  that is attacking our free speech rights or religious liberty rights or
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:24.440]  second amendment rights that produces distrust us to government now
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:29.000]  my office we've reached out to the pentagon to inquire
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.200]  about this exercise we're assured that it is a
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:37.160]  military training exercise and and i have no reason to doubt those assurances
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:41.720]  but i understand the reason for concern and uncertainty because when the
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:45.000]  federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:49.480]  in this administration for consequences that many of the citizens
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:54.520]  don't trust yeah yeah open borders outside of law power grabbing obama
[02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:58.040]  care screw job
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:03.080]  i mean what do you expect people to do and then of course just like governor
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:06.840]  abed said the same thing the headlines are ted cruise thinks obama is going to
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:10.760]  take over texas no that's what ted cruise just
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:16.120]  said you people are disgusting crux you really are i mean you are
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:19.480]  you just have to realize the our opposition's not misguided dumb liberals
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:23.160]  folks they are taking over they are pirates they
[02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:26.200]  are laughing they sit around their board rooms and talk
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:29.560]  about how to bs everybody and they got the republican
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:33.240]  leadership blackmailed or bought off and they're almost as bad
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:37.080]  except for ran paul ted cruise governor abed ron paul
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:40.920]  people like that and that's what the when when the democrats are meeting it
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:45.560]  comes out in the republican leadership they're scared of what the tea party
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:48.680]  and who do they know the tea party gets their talking points from
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:52.280]  info wars it's not talking points is what's going on
