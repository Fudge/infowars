[00:00:01.217 --> 00:00:04.078]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:18.302]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy.
[00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.492]  There is a war.
[00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.374]  It's happening now.
[00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:30.715]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:33.277]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:35.218]  We are the resistance.
[00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:37.099]  We are the Infowar.
[00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.080]  And it's Friday!
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.581]  Get ready for kickoff.
[00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:55.119]  It is an uncommon in the United States for its citizens to wind up at the foul end of the deep state's ire, as is eventually revealed by buried evidence spun out of the narrative by the Mockingbird Media.
[00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:00.582]  Now more details surrounding the body count connected to the DNC's muzzling of WikiLeaks
[00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:27.603]  ...have begun to find solid ground, and it could open an investigation involving the DC Mayor's Office, the DC Police Department, and rocket its way into the chain of command at the DNC as to why a DNC staffer who reportedly sent 40,000 emails to WikiLeaks director and BBC Democratic National Committee history documentarian Gavin McFadden was murdered in an as-yet unverified robbery on July 10, 2016.
[00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:45.475]  World Net Daily reported a federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of Rich's computer, generated within 96 hours after his murder, told Fox News that Rich made contacts with WikiLeaks through Gavin McFadyen.
[00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:58.183]  Seth Rich's parents, Mary and Joel Rich of Omaha, Nebraska, said in August of 2016 in an interview with the Daily Mail that their son had been asked to join Hillary Clinton's campaign four days before he was murdered.
[00:01:58.183 --> 00:01:59.064]  I whistleblowed his guy.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.481]  That was just a robbery I believe, wasn't it?
[00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:04.421]  What are you suggesting?
[00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:07.102]  I'm suggesting that our sources take risks and they are
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.361]  They become concerned to see things occurring like that.
[00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.122]  But was he one of your sources then?
[00:02:38.122 --> 00:02:41.323]  I mean... We don't comment on who our sources are.
[00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:46.104]  But why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?
[00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:54.666]  Because we have to understand how high the stakes are in the United States and that our sources are
[00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.780]  You know, our sources face serious risks.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.702]  That's why they come to us, so we can protect their anonymity.
[00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:06.564]  If it were one death, perhaps you'd say, alright, a coincidence.
[00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:07.664]  Three deaths?
[00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:08.004]  Really?
[00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:14.227]  I don't think it's unreasonable to scratch your head and say, why are three insiders with intimate knowledge
[00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:29.499]  I'll tell you this, the Sox has got giant eggs because if you look at this, he knows it's hurting Hillary.
[00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.540]  She's degenerating under the stress daily.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.202]  Whatever's in these emails has got her scared to death.
[00:03:34.202 --> 00:03:35.203]  You can see it.
[00:03:35.203 --> 00:03:36.064]  She looks like a cornered
[00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:37.765]  Hairless rat!
[00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:39.586]  Because I am familiar with D.C.
[00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.167]  and, you know, been a previous D.C.
[00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:50.033]  homicide detective, they just wanted me to kind of look into the case a little bit more, see if I can develop some leads, interview some people, which I've been doing over the past three weeks.
[00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:57.818]  What's really interesting, since I've been looking into this case, I've uncovered quite a few things, but not necessarily related to Seth's death.
[00:03:58.418 --> 00:04:07.642]  But related to an underground, a possible underground corruption, organized crime, corruption group that may be operating in the district.
[00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:15.385]  Because I've started looking at other homicides and deaths that were called homicide or called accidental deaths but could have been homicide.
[00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:21.488]  So this case, Allison, may actually open up a can of worms as far as what's been going on here in D.C.
[00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:25.589]  My job is to shut other white people down when they want to interrupt.
[00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:29.930]  Let the acting or future FBI director, the Washington D.C.
[00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:49.216]  Police Department and Mayor's Office, and your representatives know that you want the location of Seth Rich's laptop to be public and immediate further exploration into the involvement of the DNC and the finer points surrounding the untimely deaths of Shawn Lucas, John Ash, and Seth Rich.
[00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:51.177]  John Vaughn for Infowars.com.
[00:04:51.977 --> 00:04:52.599]  We're live.
[00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.348]  It's Friday the 19th day of May 2017.
[00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:57.534]  Please stay with us and please spread the word.
[00:04:57.534 --> 00:04:59.380]  InfoWars is under attack.
[00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:06.560]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:18.027]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:24.331]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this
[00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:25.032]  I think?
[00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:51.619]  That will be an uphill battle and we need to be prepared to go into the trenches to fight back.
[00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:54.722]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:56.003]  I'm Millie Weaver reporting.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.004]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:08.866]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:10.848]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:15.872]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:17.973]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:17.973 --> 00:06:19.254]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:24.378]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:24.378 --> 00:06:27.741]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:34.224]  Superblue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:34.224 --> 00:06:37.925]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:37.925 --> 00:06:44.828]  Superblue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:52.351]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[00:06:52.351 --> 00:06:55.272]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Superblue toothpaste.

[00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:05.762]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[00:08:05.762 --> 00:08:10.391]  The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:13.476]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:20.432]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:24.674]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls, and in our minds.
[00:08:24.674 --> 00:08:26.955]  We have to be good.
[00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:27.815]  We have to be pure.
[00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:28.976]  We have to be strong.
[00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.817]  We have to build prosperity.
[00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:34.778]  We have to bring every one of every race, color, and creed.
[00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:41.101]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants, who believe we were going to fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:43.602]  Yes, we've won the first phase.
[00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:49.197]  For the soul of humanity has just begun.
[00:08:49.197 --> 00:08:55.740]  But, Obama, and Hillary, and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:19.407]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:09:19.407 --> 00:09:20.607]  Move, bitch!
[00:09:20.607 --> 00:09:23.448]  Get out the way!
[00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:27.590]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag...
[00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.511]  It's the American flag!
[00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:33.993]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:37.575]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:39.055]  I will not let you down.
[00:09:39.055 --> 00:09:42.177]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:09:42.177 --> 00:09:43.697]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:09:43.697 --> 00:09:45.878]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:09:45.878 --> 00:09:51.401]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:09:51.401 --> 00:09:54.122]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:09:54.122 --> 00:09:55.123]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:03.917]  And ladies and gentlemen, we're here about 120 days into this historic administration.
[00:10:03.917 --> 00:10:08.979]  You see jobless numbers the lowest they've been in 30 years.
[00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:13.541]  You see small business startups the best it's been since 1984.
[00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:18.463]  You see, despite the Democrats and others trying to drive down the stock market, a stock market that's got over three trillion dollars in it.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.942]  You see a real paradox though, as internationally, depressions and recessions accelerate.
[00:10:25.942 --> 00:10:37.126]  And Trump's doing everything you do, textbook, whether you were JFK or Ron Paul, it's bipartisan, to turn the economy back on.
[00:10:37.126 --> 00:10:40.467]  And the establishment doesn't want that because they don't want to have a success.
[00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:43.128]  They don't want the American system to come back.
[00:10:43.128 --> 00:10:48.090]  And so make no mistake, that's why they're trying to destroy Donald, John, Trump with everything they've got.
[00:10:49.386 --> 00:10:51.307]  I'm surprised Trump's gotten done what he has gotten done.
[00:10:51.307 --> 00:10:55.729]  Killing TPP, getting a good Supreme Court Justice in.
[00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:57.810]  He's pushing for the big tax cuts.
[00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.751]  He's got a good reform of Obamacare passed to the House.
[00:11:01.751 --> 00:11:07.854]  He's hitting on all ten cylinders.
[00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:12.736]  But I can see with the general public the shine of Trump's worn off.
[00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:16.978]  The mainstream media couldn't break a stir in the election with their lies and deception and fake polls.
[00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:27.325]  But some people are buying into just the incessant drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip of lies.
[00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:32.788]  Doesn't matter if I have stacks of news where Obama gave classified information to the Russians over and over again.
[00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:36.571]  Because Obama's allowed to do that, he was the president.
[00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.454]  But then when Trump doesn't even do it, they try to paralyze him and say he's done it.
[00:11:41.454 --> 00:11:43.335]  In fact, there's a new memo out.
[00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:44.816]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:45.677]  There's several memos.
[00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:55.652]  And we already know this from the statements from the New Yorker Magazine and Atlantic Monthly and Reuters and The Economist and what's been said on Fox News and CNN.
[00:11:55.652 --> 00:12:02.093]  I mean, I have Dana Bash and Chuckie Schumer and the Democrats themselves all admitting it.
[00:12:02.093 --> 00:12:10.155]  And I've got Dennis Kucinich, a realistic patriot, a liberal, but a real guy saying there's a deep state coup against Trump.
[00:12:10.155 --> 00:12:11.935]  And we've got Colonel Schaefer saying it.
[00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:14.356]  We've got countless others.
[00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:32.286]  Like David Goldman for CNBC, the list goes on and on, saying this is an attempt to overthrow the president, it's made up, it's a lie, they're trying to get him impeached or they want him to resign.
[00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:34.526]  And they're not going to stop.
[00:12:34.526 --> 00:12:37.587]  And that's why they're doing it.
[00:12:37.587 --> 00:12:42.188]  There's a new Harvard study out where 98% of the news against Trump is negative.
[00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:44.437]  What's that tell you?
[00:12:44.437 --> 00:12:52.640]  If you want out from under the globalists, if you want out from under the establishment, you should know that Trump is your man.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:13:08.724]  That's why they are in a total foam at the mouth, destroy Trump frenzy of disinformation, lies, twisting spin, and fraud, and lying by omission that I've ever seen in my life.
[00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:24.442]  That's because he's transferring power away from the establishment and transferring it back to the people.
[00:13:24.442 --> 00:13:26.403]  And that's why they're pissed.
[00:13:26.403 --> 00:13:38.733]  They've hijacked this country and they don't want you to struggle out of their giant squid-like grasp.
[00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:41.034]  But look at these headlines from Infowars.com.
[00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:45.774]  That are so incredibly critical to save this country.
[00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:57.962]  Notice, all our talking points, all our facts, all our analysis, weeks and months and years before, are the exact terms then being battled about in the news.
[00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.064]  Are the big issues we face.
[00:14:00.064 --> 00:14:01.925]  See, they've already had gigantic failure.
[00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.747]  They didn't want COG or TPP.
[00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:09.797]  Or IMF or World Bank to be discussed.
[00:14:09.797 --> 00:14:11.860]  They didn't want the private Federal Reserve to be discussed.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.082]  They didn't want the fact that the New York Fed runs it all.
[00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:16.485]  They didn't want that discussed.
[00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:21.190]  Or how they run ISIS and how they run Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.612]  And how they've been caught doing it.
[00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:23.393]  They don't want that discussed.
[00:14:23.393 --> 00:14:26.196]  But see, now it's all going to be discussed.
[00:14:30.543 --> 00:14:39.941]  And we are going to discuss the Vaccine Damage Fund they set up in the 80s to keep vaccine damage secret and pay billions of dollars out secretly to people damaged from vaccines.
[00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:42.185]  But now because we've talked about it and you've talked about it...
[00:14:43.595 --> 00:14:50.240]  There's now state and federal laws getting passed to expose it all and to open the vaccine makers up for total lawsuits.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.401]  And all the truths start to come out.
[00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:54.603]  Just like Prozac causing brain damage.
[00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:56.864]  Just like aspartame causing brain damage.
[00:14:56.864 --> 00:15:05.010]  Just like everything we told you 20 plus years ago is all coming out now because we had medical doctors and scientists on then.
[00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:11.593]  Who wouldn't let Prozac get approved in the 70s?
[00:15:11.593 --> 00:15:15.195]  And wouldn't let Aspartame get approved in the 70s?
[00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:18.597]  Because it was causing brain damage and death.
[00:15:18.597 --> 00:15:22.339]  They knew all this stuff before any of this ever got approved.
[00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.920]  And where am I going with all this?
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.902]  This is not about partisanship.
[00:15:27.902 --> 00:15:29.303]  I will say that the Libtards
[00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:39.901]  Are the most dumb, out of control, spoiled, entitled, dumb, crazy people I've ever seen.
[00:15:39.901 --> 00:15:43.045]  But establishment Republicans and bluebloods are almost as disgusting.
[00:15:45.657 --> 00:15:53.043]  But I've got stacks of news here where all over the United States, they're saying we don't like brown-paneled wood.
[00:15:53.043 --> 00:15:56.326]  It's racist and too Western.
[00:15:56.326 --> 00:15:58.868]  We want it pulled off the walls at the library.
[00:15:58.868 --> 00:16:00.449]  It scares us.
[00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:03.852]  And so the schools are running in and doing it immediately.
[00:16:03.852 --> 00:16:06.114]  Or we don't like this called Lynch Hall.
[00:16:06.114 --> 00:16:08.076]  It reminds us of blacks being lynched.
[00:16:08.076 --> 00:16:09.097]  It's just an Irish name.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:18.004]  Or don't show pictures of masculine football team, you know, in the school paper, because some of us aren't masculine.
[00:16:18.004 --> 00:16:19.425]  Or don't show mothers and fathers.
[00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:20.966]  Some of us don't have mothers and fathers.
[00:16:20.966 --> 00:16:22.507]  This isn't insanity.
[00:16:22.507 --> 00:16:26.589]  This is cultural total takeover disease by design.
[00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:28.830]  Insanity must come up for air.
[00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.093]  We must start saying no to this.
[00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:39.097]  But the good news is, Donald Trump is just an old-fashioned throwback Americana.
[00:16:40.612 --> 00:16:57.125]  And that's why those out there that can't bully him hate him so much, because if he can survive, and if we can thrive, and if we can be successful, and if we can pull out of globalism, it will break the back of these oligarchs and these crony capitalists forever.
[00:16:57.125 --> 00:17:07.574]  And we must break their back, because their goal is to end civilization as we know it, is to irrevocably dumb people down, and turn us back into basically superstitious savages,
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:27.541]  We're scared of our own shadow and see racism in the clouds and in the stars and don't see the cultural scientific dehumanization that has been weaponized against all of us that breathe oxygen and bleed red blood.
[00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:28.181]  Now that said,
[00:17:29.372 --> 00:17:31.933]  They've had quite a success in the media.
[00:17:31.933 --> 00:17:47.601]  It took three days for it to get out that former Attorney Generals and Deputy Attorney Generals were saying it was illegal for Comey, if he supposedly had an attempt at obstruction of justice by the President, to not bring that to the Attorney General's office.
[00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:51.303]  It was in the news three days ago with former Deputy Attorney Generals and U.S.
[00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:53.884]  prosecutors and others saying it.
[00:17:53.884 --> 00:17:56.645]  They ran a hoax everywhere saying it doesn't exist.
[00:17:56.645 --> 00:17:57.666]  It's totally insane.
[00:17:58.973 --> 00:18:11.560]  Then yesterday, we start putting out the video, we're going to play in a moment, of Comey saying, months after he supposedly written this memo from his White House meeting with the President, that he may have tried to obstruct justice.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:17.104]  Comey goes before Congress and says no one's tried to obstruct justice.
[00:18:17.104 --> 00:18:23.227]  Not one publication ran a story about that to show the incredible control of the corporate press.
[00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.809]  Not liberal, not conservative, none of it ran a story.
[00:18:27.785 --> 00:18:35.009]  Until this morning, then they started saying, oh, it's a conspiracy theory that Comey perjured himself here.
[00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:44.934]  But that's how it started three days ago, saying it was a conspiracy theory that anybody in the Justice Department had said Comey may have obstructed justice, not bringing the memo.
[00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:46.935]  But that collapsed in as well.
[00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:52.926]  So that's the good news, is this big lie is beginning to collapse.
[00:18:52.926 --> 00:19:03.430]  And if you'll just go to Real Alex Jones on our Twitter, and if you'll just retweet the video and retweet the articles about Comey being caught lying, we've got a chance at a major, major victory.
[00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.731]  Here's that clip of Comey on May 3rd.
[00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:16.414]  So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[00:19:17.887 --> 00:19:20.369]  In theory, yes.
[00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:22.150]  Has it happened?
[00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.470]  Not in my experience.
[00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:30.134]  Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[00:19:30.134 --> 00:19:35.918]  Oftentimes, they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:40.040]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.801]  That would be a very big deal.
[00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:43.142]  It's not happened in my experience.
[00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:55.948]  Not happen, in my experience, two months after he had two phone calls and a private meeting and wrote notes about the president supposedly saying what Comey then said never happened.
[00:19:55.948 --> 00:19:56.609]  And no wonder.
[00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:57.650]  The silence is deafening.
[00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.151]  They're so scared of that clip.
[00:19:59.151 --> 00:19:59.592]  We'll be back.
[00:20:01.247 --> 00:20:07.229]  The 300 Blackout is an incredible rifle, and Infidel Body Armor is giving one away in just a few days.

[00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:12.768]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[00:23:12.768 --> 00:23:16.751]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[00:24:12.788 --> 00:24:13.688]  We are back live.
[00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:15.269]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:19.231]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, you're going to hear it here first.
[00:24:19.231 --> 00:24:19.871]  It's official.
[00:24:19.871 --> 00:24:22.232]  We actually have the documents.
[00:24:22.232 --> 00:24:27.635]  The Democrats are about to announce that they want a new election.
[00:24:27.635 --> 00:24:32.157]  They're about to announce they want to overturn the 2016 election.
[00:24:32.157 --> 00:24:33.798]  You're like, that's deja vu.
[00:24:33.798 --> 00:24:35.619]  That happened during the election.
[00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:37.740]  And after it, yes, and they're back.
[00:24:39.005 --> 00:24:43.068]  And I have that from my White House sources this morning.
[00:24:43.068 --> 00:24:47.250]  I made a phone call to our congressional sources, and they said, indeed, that's happening.
[00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.351]  And Paul Watson has his sources as well.
[00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:50.892]  We should probably get Cernovich to pop in.
[00:24:50.892 --> 00:24:55.995]  There's nothing that I've ever known about that he didn't also know about simultaneously.
[00:24:55.995 --> 00:25:07.803]  Oh, and incidentally, just to give credit where it's due, I didn't know Cernovich and a few others Wednesday night were already covering and pointing out that online researchers, you,
[00:25:09.209 --> 00:25:19.852]  We, the people, had found the Comey clip where he said that no one had tried to influence him, nobody tried to obstruct justice, two months after he supposedly wrote this fake memo.
[00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:25.053]  So, and we were saying we were breaking that yesterday, but we didn't break it.
[00:25:25.053 --> 00:25:33.655]  Which shows how Cernovich is breaking it, and I guess Red State even broke it before him, and it gets no attention.
[00:25:33.655 --> 00:25:38.216]  I wish it should have been Cernovich should have been all over the news yesterday with that clip.
[00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:45.294]  But instead, somebody sends it to our inbox, points it out, we go, oh look.
[00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:47.815]  And then Google, and nobody's covering it.
[00:25:47.815 --> 00:25:49.396]  And we think, wow, we're breaking this?
[00:25:49.396 --> 00:25:51.557]  And this is such big news?
[00:25:51.557 --> 00:25:54.719]  That shows how they're fighting to keep all this from coming out.
[00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:59.862]  And how it's so important for you to get the videos and the articles we've written about this.
[00:25:59.862 --> 00:26:01.863]  Comey caught perjuring himself out.
[00:26:01.863 --> 00:26:04.985]  This will destroy their agenda.
[00:26:04.985 --> 00:26:07.286]  A lot of people won't cover this stuff because they're scared of the FBI.
[00:26:08.868 --> 00:26:13.131]  The FBI's got some really bad people in it at the top, some good people in the middle and the bottom.
[00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:13.891]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:13.891 --> 00:26:19.235]  I'm not going to be scared of this, and I'm going to go up against Comey, and I'm going to go up against anybody else for this country.
[00:26:19.235 --> 00:26:23.838]  If Trump starts doing bad stuff, I'm going to go after him!
[00:26:23.838 --> 00:26:24.399]  But he's not!
[00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:26.360]  He's completely surrounded and under attack!
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.744]  98% of the news is negative, and it's all lies!
[00:26:31.744 --> 00:26:34.566]  The lies have gotten so bad, I can't even respond to it anymore.
[00:26:34.566 --> 00:26:35.606]  It's just pure lies.
[00:26:35.606 --> 00:26:36.307]  Everything's a lie.
[00:26:38.598 --> 00:26:42.599]  Speaking of that, they kept saying for three days, when U.S.
[00:26:42.599 --> 00:27:04.725]  attorneys and people were being quoted to a couple newspapers, and on this show, and on Fox News, to Hannity's credit, he's on target, that hey, if Comey just wrote this memo and kept it for himself, more than just a few days, and didn't bring it to the Justice Department, then it's clear obstruction of justice.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.921]  And that's clear-cut.
[00:27:06.921 --> 00:27:07.481]  Of course it is.
[00:27:07.481 --> 00:27:14.526]  You don't just have somebody say something illegal to you, write a memo, and then keep it for blackmail, or for influence peddling, or for racketeering later.
[00:27:14.526 --> 00:27:16.728]  Or to, you know, cover your butt.
[00:27:16.728 --> 00:27:18.969]  CYA.
[00:27:18.969 --> 00:27:19.750]  And that's well-known.
[00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:26.034]  People have gotten in trouble for that many times in the 200-plus year of this nation.
[00:27:26.034 --> 00:27:28.295]  And so they just say, hoax, hoax, hoax, hoax, hoax.
[00:27:28.295 --> 00:27:30.137]  It's not true.
[00:27:30.137 --> 00:27:34.340]  Now, Alberto Gonzalez has gone on CNN
[00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:45.514]  And said that if Trump did involve himself in obstruction of justice, or it looked like that, Comey had an obligation to notify Jeff Sessions.
[00:27:45.514 --> 00:27:46.514]  Boom!
[00:27:46.514 --> 00:27:50.715]  So there's the former Deputy Attorney General.
[00:27:50.715 --> 00:27:55.957]  Though he was the deputy, then he was the Attorney General.
[00:27:55.957 --> 00:27:58.778]  So the former Attorney General.
[00:27:58.778 --> 00:28:02.680]  I got it confused, he's been a former deputy, but also other former deputies have gone public.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.841]  So you got all these former deputies, former AGs, telling you this,
[00:28:06.923 --> 00:28:07.644]  On CNN.
[00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:10.447]  So again, another conspiracy theory turns out to be true.
[00:28:10.447 --> 00:28:11.528]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:11.528 --> 00:28:16.934]  It's known law that if somebody says, hey, I robbed the bank, you want some of the money.
[00:28:16.934 --> 00:28:21.699]  And then if you don't go do that, you're going to end up being an accomplice.
[00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:22.080]  Here's the clip.
[00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:30.710]  You know, it is true that traditionally there's not a really strong relation between the President and the FBI Director, and for good reasons, quite frankly.
[00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:47.881]  If in fact Jim Comey felt so strongly about the pressure he was feeling from the White House, he had an obligation, in my judgment, and I don't think any former Attorney General would disagree with this, he had an obligation to notify either Jeff Sessions, Rod Rosenstein, Dana Bente, someone, because
[00:28:49.342 --> 00:28:57.045]  It is a job of the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General to protect all of the bureaus and services and divisions within the Department of Justice.
[00:28:57.045 --> 00:29:06.468]  It may very well be that Donald Trump, not having served in office, might not know that these conversations are inappropriate, particularly when there's an investigation that may touch upon the White House.
[00:29:06.468 --> 00:29:11.009]  Someone like Jeff Sessions, who has this relationship with Donald Trump, could be very
[00:29:11.069 --> 00:29:11.870]  I don't know.
[00:29:37.793 --> 00:29:40.494]  And that's saying it kindly.
[00:29:40.494 --> 00:29:42.274]  If he didn't do it, he obstructed justice.
[00:29:42.274 --> 00:29:43.655]  If he really believed that was obstruction.
[00:29:43.655 --> 00:29:46.015]  But we all know whatever was said wasn't.
[00:29:46.015 --> 00:29:47.536]  So it's all a big lie.
[00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:48.876]  Another fraud.
[00:29:48.876 --> 00:29:49.857]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.857 --> 00:29:51.257]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.257 --> 00:29:52.978]  The empire is on the run.
[00:29:52.978 --> 00:29:55.738]  The biggest Alex Jones of the month.
[00:29:55.738 --> 00:29:56.919]  In three minutes folks.
[00:29:56.919 --> 00:29:57.279]  Get ready.
[00:30:01.502 --> 00:30:06.725]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[00:30:06.725 --> 00:30:18.191]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:24.735]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this crucial time.
[00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:25.115]  I think?
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.421]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:02.634]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:02.634 --> 00:31:04.655]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:07.555]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:07.555 --> 00:31:13.617]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:13.617 --> 00:31:22.798]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:24.999]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself.
[00:31:25.299 --> 00:31:30.346]  Your co-workers, your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:38.376]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.376 --> 00:31:39.358]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:43.920]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.061]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.061 --> 00:31:54.763]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:54.763 --> 00:31:58.864]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:01.195 --> 00:32:03.036]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:03.036 --> 00:32:09.638]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:09.638 --> 00:32:12.799]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:22.582]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:22.582 --> 00:32:23.423]  Caveman.
[00:32:23.423 --> 00:32:28.484]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:28.484 --> 00:32:30.605]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:34.047]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:34.047 --> 00:32:39.191]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:39.191 --> 00:32:47.336]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:47.336 --> 00:32:55.122]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:55.122 --> 00:32:59.945]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLive.com today.
[00:33:07.998 --> 00:33:14.081]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[00:33:14.081 --> 00:33:16.983]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.983 --> 00:33:25.448]  Let me tell you some of the folks that are on the broadcast today.
[00:33:25.448 --> 00:33:34.893]  We have David Horowitz, who was brought up by a communist, who understands why they're working with radical Islam, why they want to overthrow Trump, and the type of threat we're actually facing.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:42.042]  We're also going to have Dr. Steve Pchenik pop in, Roger Stone, and I'm also working on some other guests today.
[00:33:42.042 --> 00:33:52.107]  I also intend to open the phones up and take some of your phone calls here.
[00:33:52.107 --> 00:33:56.889]  I want to get to the big news, and I'll do that in about 5-10 minutes.
[00:33:56.889 --> 00:33:58.750]  Dealing with the Democrats' admitted plan
[00:34:01.266 --> 00:34:02.686]  Hold a new election.
[00:34:02.686 --> 00:34:06.908]  And they say in their own internal documents that that's what they're planning to do.
[00:34:06.908 --> 00:34:12.269]  And I'm sitting here warning everybody about it.
[00:34:12.269 --> 00:34:14.770]  And people pay attention.
[00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.291]  They believe me.
[00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:17.931]  And they can go read our news articles about it.
[00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:21.672]  But even our own news articles kind of just bury it in there in the rest of the news.
[00:34:21.672 --> 00:34:23.513]  This is so big.
[00:34:23.513 --> 00:34:25.153]  How are they going to maneuver us to this point?
[00:34:25.153 --> 00:34:26.354]  How are they going to announce it?
[00:34:26.354 --> 00:34:29.035]  They're getting ready to announce it.
[00:34:29.035 --> 00:34:30.035]  They're debating doing it.
[00:34:31.209 --> 00:34:38.054]  While the President's out of the country to make him look bad on the world scene.
[00:34:38.054 --> 00:34:41.597]  And they're planning snubs by world leaders.
[00:34:41.597 --> 00:34:43.499]  It's horrible what's happening in this country.
[00:34:43.499 --> 00:34:46.001]  We're under 21st century military attack.
[00:34:46.001 --> 00:34:48.543]  We're in a war for our future survival right now.
[00:34:48.543 --> 00:34:49.623]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:34:49.623 --> 00:34:54.808]  That's not nomenclature.
[00:34:54.808 --> 00:34:57.990]  That's the reality and it's so big I can't even believe it.
[00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.232]  So that's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:35:03.072 --> 00:35:06.773]  Now, before I go any further, listeners had this idea.
[00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:09.654]  I think Roger Stone had this idea.
[00:35:09.654 --> 00:35:19.518]  We are selling Trump t-shirts at cost, even though they're hot right now because folks realize the president is under attack and this just shows his bona fides that he is under such globalist assault.
[00:35:20.279 --> 00:35:28.441]  And he has done things like kill TPP and get the Supreme Court justice in and is trying to build a wall and trying to get tax cuts and they have started the repeal of Obamacare.
[00:35:28.441 --> 00:35:34.583]  That we saw Jared Kushner and Ivanka kind of in there pushing their globalist agenda and really hurting the president.
[00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:45.326]  And so we had the idea, it's a limited edition, we're doing one run of a shirt that says InfoWars.com in red on the back.
[00:35:45.326 --> 00:35:49.507]  Big red letters to meet like-minded people, to trigger folks.
[00:35:52.366 --> 00:35:55.028]  To spread the word, not let the bullies push you around.
[00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:59.391]  In most areas, you'll just get your dinner bought for you or have folks pat you on the back.
[00:35:59.391 --> 00:36:02.894]  But in real communist and anti-freedom areas, you might get spit on.
[00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:08.518]  I voted for the Donald, not Ivanka.
[00:36:08.518 --> 00:36:13.302]  I think Stone's idea was, I love the Donald, not Ivanka.
[00:36:13.302 --> 00:36:17.005]  But I voted for Donald, not Ivanka.
[00:36:17.005 --> 00:36:18.066]  It's a limited edition shirt.
[00:36:18.905 --> 00:36:20.767]  And when it's gone, it's gone.
[00:36:20.767 --> 00:36:23.170]  You buy it, you support the broadcast.
[00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:25.113]  It's at regular cost $19.95.
[00:36:25.113 --> 00:36:29.198]  That way we get like 15 bucks to help fund the operation and we need it.
[00:36:29.198 --> 00:36:30.519]  So thank you for your support.
[00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:34.484]  Now we have the Trump is my President shirt.
[00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:35.325]  Trump Pants 2020 shirt.
[00:36:38.126 --> 00:36:40.027]  In three different variants.
[00:36:40.027 --> 00:36:42.949]  If you don't like Pence, we've got two shirts that don't have Pence's name on it.
[00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:43.909]  Trump is my president.
[00:36:43.909 --> 00:36:44.649]  New design.
[00:36:44.649 --> 00:36:45.490]  Navy blue.
[00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:47.151]  Red, white, and blue flag.
[00:36:47.151 --> 00:36:49.892]  Keeping America great since 1776.
[00:36:49.892 --> 00:36:51.113]  Keeping America great on the back.
[00:36:51.113 --> 00:36:52.494]  Infowars.com.
[00:36:52.494 --> 00:36:52.774]  Red.
[00:36:52.774 --> 00:36:57.136]  Infowars.com on the right shoulder.
[00:36:57.136 --> 00:37:00.017]  Really one of the best looking shirts you'll ever see out there.
[00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:00.678]  Political shirts.
[00:37:03.652 --> 00:37:08.294]  $4.95, that is at cost or below, because XXLs and bigger costs is like $6 or more.
[00:37:08.294 --> 00:37:11.855]  We have 4Xs we sell that are like almost $7.
[00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:13.136]  So it's a loss leader.
[00:37:13.136 --> 00:37:15.057]  I just want to see free speech out there.
[00:37:15.057 --> 00:37:16.217]  It's a piece of history.
[00:37:16.217 --> 00:37:17.138]  Get yours today.
[00:37:17.138 --> 00:37:17.658]  And finally...
[00:37:19.909 --> 00:37:41.409]  We have the new Z-Shield toxic metal and chemical defense support formula, made with zeolites, made with shilajit and a bunch of other concentrated herbs into oil form, cold pressed, 25% off retail, out of the gates, introducing Z-Shield proprietary toxic metal and chemical defense support formula, now available at Infowarslife.com in the very limited first run.
[00:37:42.029 --> 00:37:49.256]  Countless studies show our food, water and air is loaded with toxic metals and chemicals that are known to be wreaking havoc on our bodies.
[00:37:49.256 --> 00:37:53.721]  Even the EPA has admitted that more than 800 million pounds of pesticide is dumped in the U.S.
[00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:54.422]  every year.
[00:37:54.422 --> 00:37:57.505]  And 80% of these pesticides are used on cops.
[00:37:57.505 --> 00:37:58.986]  Or crops.
[00:37:58.986 --> 00:38:02.029]  Now they're trying to kill the cops too.
[00:38:02.029 --> 00:38:03.471]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:38:04.454 --> 00:38:09.498]  No matter what you do, it's virtually impossible to avoid all these toxic metals and chemicals.
[00:38:09.498 --> 00:38:16.725]  Our team of doctors, PhD herbalists, and chemists have spent years testing and developing the proprietary technology used to create Z-Shield.
[00:38:17.486 --> 00:38:22.027]  This is without a doubt one of the most game-changing formulas ever, released by mfullworkslive.com.
[00:38:22.027 --> 00:38:32.310]  Z-Shell contains organic ingredients known to help support the body in the fight against toxic metals and chemicals, like cilantro, shilajit, milk thistle, super-concentrated zeolites, and much, much more.
[00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.471]  And we will sell out of that in the next few weeks, but hopefully we'll have some more runs.
[00:38:36.471 --> 00:38:41.793]  We'll just use that as, you know, some pitch, like, oh, we're gonna sell out of DNA Force, or sell out of X2, or sell out of...
[00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:50.693]  These products, a lot of these are organic, well they're all organic, but they have to pass California standards, which is nearly impossible to do.
[00:38:50.693 --> 00:38:57.216]  And so we keep testing batches of the ingredients and sometimes it goes six months or longer before we can put the stuff out.
[00:38:57.216 --> 00:39:03.359]  We do have the Vitamin Mineral Fusion fruit punch drink back in stock as well.
[00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:06.261]  Separately, Emrix Essentials products are now in.
[00:39:06.261 --> 00:39:08.702]  This is one of the top organic brands in the country.
[00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.411]  They've allowed us to private label it.
[00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:14.832]  It's 20% off retail for this high quality line.
[00:39:14.832 --> 00:39:15.653]  It's already discounted.
[00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:19.374]  You get an additional 25% off on auto ship.
[00:39:19.374 --> 00:39:24.597]  Sign up every 14 days, every month, every two months, every three months, every six months, every nine months.
[00:39:24.597 --> 00:39:27.678]  Cancel any time.
[00:39:27.678 --> 00:39:29.959]  And you get 25% off.
[00:39:29.959 --> 00:39:33.701]  On top of 20%, that's 45% off on Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:36.442]  Amazing, healthy, organic, quality,
[00:39:37.563 --> 00:39:47.406]  Shampoo, body wash, 10 to 1 concentrated, mouthwash, natural, high-quality B.O.A., bug spray.
[00:39:47.406 --> 00:39:48.066]  It's a cream.
[00:39:48.066 --> 00:39:49.487]  It's all the very, very best.
[00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:54.608]  Big discounts on top of that when you buy multi-packs or you buy the super pack and get it all.
[00:39:54.608 --> 00:39:56.049]  Can't wait to see your reviews.
[00:39:56.049 --> 00:40:01.150]  No reviews yet, but here in the office in my own family, they say, this is incredible.
[00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.711]  And a lot of people go, wait a minute, I already buy this.
[00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:05.374]  This is a big national brand.
[00:40:05.374 --> 00:40:06.414]  I recognize the label.
[00:40:06.414 --> 00:40:06.975]  I recognize it.
[00:40:06.975 --> 00:40:08.075]  I already buy this.
[00:40:08.075 --> 00:40:09.396]  And it is 20% off.
[00:40:09.396 --> 00:40:10.957]  Yes, it is.
[00:40:10.957 --> 00:40:17.700]  Which is fine for the national maker because they're selling it for, you know, 40% of what it is retail.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.041]  So they're making almost nothing.
[00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:24.044]  We buy it, pay more than big stores do.
[00:40:24.044 --> 00:40:25.204]  You know, we're a big market.
[00:40:25.204 --> 00:40:33.329]  I know we're paying more than Whole Foods does, but it doesn't matter because they're making more when they sell it to us because we don't put them over a barrel and then we can sell it to you for less.
[00:40:36.286 --> 00:40:40.371]  Now down the road, who knows what leverage I'll have to even get it cheaper, but I'm not the type of guy that does that.
[00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:47.480]  We've got a really good deal on this, and we're so happy that we waited this long to get one of the best national brands in the country that's known to be organic.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.823]  And if you're watching on TV, you go, yeah, I've seen that bottle.
[00:40:49.823 --> 00:40:50.905]  I've seen that design.
[00:40:50.905 --> 00:40:52.146]  They even let us use their same design.
[00:40:52.998 --> 00:40:55.860]  They just, we just changed the name to Emmerich Essentials.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:01.844]  So this is a big blessing, and what I thought is happening, it's all selling very well.
[00:41:01.844 --> 00:41:06.847]  Well, it needs to, because this discounted, we're not making very much on this.
[00:41:06.847 --> 00:41:15.653]  We're making zero on the t-shirts, probably losing money, but we changed the world, and people meet like-minded folks, and InfoWars.com gets out there, so it's all worth it.
[00:41:17.486 --> 00:41:21.808]  Big Advantage, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:21.808 --> 00:41:26.571]  That's kind of a big plug, but I've been forgetting to plug a lot of them in the first hour, so thank you.
[00:41:26.571 --> 00:41:28.792]  Please support our local affiliates as well.
[00:41:28.792 --> 00:41:30.553]  Become a sponsor of them.

[00:41:33.226 --> 00:41:34.127]  Send them a donation.
[00:41:34.127 --> 00:41:42.912]  I mean, we're in a war in this country and the stations carrying this broadcast deserve your prayers and your support and putting a billboard on the side of your business, whatever it takes.
[00:41:42.912 --> 00:41:47.355]  You're not going to save the world putting a billboard up, but all of us together, we are with God's help.
[00:41:47.355 --> 00:41:48.976]  So this is an epic time.
[00:41:48.976 --> 00:41:49.116]  Okay.
[00:41:49.116 --> 00:41:50.817]  I'm not going to play the whole report.
[00:41:50.817 --> 00:41:51.757]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:41:51.757 --> 00:41:52.758]  I just want to get refocused.
[00:41:52.758 --> 00:41:55.339]  Catch my breath here because this subject is so big.
[00:41:55.339 --> 00:41:55.880]  I need to kind of
[00:41:57.096 --> 00:41:57.977]  Get really focused.
[00:42:19.184 --> 00:42:19.424]  It is.
[00:42:19.424 --> 00:42:20.905]  I mean, I'm not just saying this for effect.
[00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.605]  I'm very stressed out with this information.
[00:42:22.605 --> 00:42:24.786]  I don't feel worthy to be bringing it to you.
[00:42:24.786 --> 00:42:26.026]  I know I'm very annoying.
[00:42:26.026 --> 00:42:26.907]  I can't stand my voice.
[00:42:26.907 --> 00:42:27.847]  A lot of people love it.
[00:42:27.847 --> 00:42:28.767]  I think it's horrible.
[00:42:28.767 --> 00:42:29.808]  I hired Nico Acosta.
[00:42:29.808 --> 00:42:33.769]  Let me see it.
[00:42:33.769 --> 00:42:35.089]  What was it, like four or five years ago?
[00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:37.910]  He was very honest.
[00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.211]  He said, I think your voice is grating.
[00:42:40.711 --> 00:42:42.013]  But I like what you're talking about.
[00:42:42.013 --> 00:42:42.654]  He's our head producer.
[00:42:42.654 --> 00:42:43.736]  He does a great job.
[00:42:43.736 --> 00:42:45.679]  The point is, I'm very honest about myself.
[00:42:45.679 --> 00:42:48.323]  So it isn't all about, oh, Alex Jones, this is exclusive.
[00:42:48.323 --> 00:42:50.066]  Oh, this is... We're under attack.
[00:42:50.066 --> 00:42:51.468]  They're trying to destroy us.
[00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:53.031]  They're trying to bring us down right now.
[00:42:56.601 --> 00:42:58.182]  If they can bring us down, they're going to bring you down.
[00:42:58.182 --> 00:43:00.483]  That's all I'm saying is we are important.
[00:43:00.483 --> 00:43:01.724]  We are in the front line.
[00:43:01.724 --> 00:43:03.165]  We are damaging the enemy greatly.
[00:43:03.165 --> 00:43:08.588]  We're under massive attack right now because we are on the front line kicking their ass.
[00:43:08.588 --> 00:43:11.689]  It's like we're a battleship that just sunk five or six battleships.
[00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:17.433]  They got three more coming at us and ten destroyers and they got fighter bombers flying over shooting missiles at us.
[00:43:17.433 --> 00:43:21.955]  I mean, if you take action politically, it's like ten more battleships pop up.
[00:43:21.955 --> 00:43:22.716]  You understand?
[00:43:22.716 --> 00:43:24.457]  We are in a total war.
[00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:26.293]  Here's another allegory.
[00:43:26.293 --> 00:43:37.141]  We just took the machine gun nest on the side of the hill, and 100 of us went up the hill, like 20 are left, and coming over the hill are another 100 people firing at us.
[00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:41.265]  We need to take the hill completely, ladies and gentlemen, but we're now under attack.
[00:43:41.265 --> 00:43:47.410]  They now know we took the machine gun nest, so they've got their real attack now launching.
[00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.893]  They're hysterical to bring us down to bring you down.
[00:43:50.893 --> 00:43:51.674]  They hate Trump.
[00:43:51.674 --> 00:43:54.316]  They hate Infowars because they hate America.
[00:43:54.316 --> 00:43:55.177]  They hate you.
[00:43:55.177 --> 00:43:56.038]  Do you understand?
[00:43:56.038 --> 00:43:57.800]  They call you bitter clingers.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.921]  They want to defeat you.
[00:43:58.921 --> 00:43:59.962]  They want to crush you.
[00:43:59.962 --> 00:44:00.943]  They want to run your life.
[00:44:03.416 --> 00:44:06.297]  So, coming back after this, but it all ties together.
[00:44:06.297 --> 00:44:14.041]  Here is former senior CIA analyst, burst the Comey memo controversy on BBC, Michael Schroer, who I want to get back on.
[00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:28.328]  And why are every former top CIA guy, or liberal, or real progressives, or black op commanders like Colonel Schaefer, or even Dennis Kucinich, or Glenn Greenwald, or any of these people, why are they for Trump?
[00:44:29.164 --> 00:44:30.585]  Even though they disagree with a lot of his politics.
[00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:37.130]  Because he's the president, and he's under globalist attack, and a shadow government is trying to fully take the country over.
[00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.772]  We're in a tug-of-war.
[00:44:38.772 --> 00:44:43.535]  So they're for the process, they're for America, they're for checks and balances.
[00:44:43.535 --> 00:44:48.199]  And they know the deep state is 50 times worse than Donald Trump.
[00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:51.642]  Donald Trump's got problems, but he isn't out to get ya.
[00:44:51.642 --> 00:44:57.106]  He's a pig-headed American, he's a pig-headed president, and he's our president!
[00:44:57.106 --> 00:44:58.007]  You understand that?
[00:44:59.158 --> 00:45:00.739]  We're not going to get something perfect.
[00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:05.862]  The guy's in a complete battle.
[00:45:05.862 --> 00:45:06.823]  He's bringing it back.
[00:45:06.823 --> 00:45:10.085]  We're presidents of presidents again.
[00:45:10.085 --> 00:45:12.106]  So here's the report and then I'm going to go to break.
[00:45:12.106 --> 00:45:20.492]  I'm going to come back laser focused and I'm going to break down the Democratic plan to hold new elections.
[00:45:20.492 --> 00:45:21.152]  Stay with us.
[00:45:21.152 --> 00:45:21.833]  Here is the report.
[00:45:23.111 --> 00:45:29.897]  What do you make of what James Comey claims President Trump said to him about the Michael Flynn investigation?
[00:45:29.897 --> 00:45:34.340]  And I quote, this is what the New York Times is quoting, I hope you can let this go.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.484]  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.
[00:45:38.484 --> 00:45:39.745]  He is a good guy.
[00:45:39.745 --> 00:45:42.347]  I hope you can let this go.
[00:45:42.347 --> 00:45:43.548]  What does that amount to to you?
[00:45:44.935 --> 00:45:53.452]  It amounts to me to a suggestion that he would like to avoid the bother of something that had very little basis in fact, but he didn't order Comey to do anything.
[00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:54.881]  He didn't!
[00:45:54.881 --> 00:45:56.042]  He didn't order it!
[00:45:56.042 --> 00:45:57.063]  He didn't order it!
[00:46:22.803 --> 00:46:25.605]  Mr. Comey to shut down the investigation?
[00:46:25.605 --> 00:46:26.446]  Did he?
[00:46:26.446 --> 00:46:29.108]  He only needed to lean on him.
[00:46:29.108 --> 00:46:33.732]  I don't think that's, you know, we interpret words differently, sir.
[00:46:33.732 --> 00:46:41.620]  I think if there's any, has been any obstruction of justice, all you need to do is re-review Comey's history.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:46.964]  Comey has abetted the senior people in the Democratic Party to stay out of prison for his whole term.
[00:46:48.856 --> 00:46:55.183]  Again, the president's going to say things privately that can come back to haunt him.
[00:46:55.183 --> 00:46:56.345]  Any president can.
[00:46:56.345 --> 00:46:56.565]  Sure.
[00:46:57.941 --> 00:46:58.842]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:46:58.842 --> 00:46:59.362]  I'm sorry.
[00:46:59.362 --> 00:47:00.723]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[00:47:00.723 --> 00:47:02.605]  You make a very important point there, don't you?
[00:47:02.605 --> 00:47:15.954]  You say, privately, because this discussion apparently happened after a four-way meeting involving the Vice President Mike Pence and the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[00:47:15.954 --> 00:47:20.038]  Now, they had the briefing with Mr. Comey and the President.
[00:47:20.038 --> 00:47:25.121]  The President then asked the Vice President and the Attorney General to leave the room.
[00:47:25.121 --> 00:47:26.863]  And then he made these comments.
[00:47:27.483 --> 00:47:29.126]  To Mr. Comey.
[00:47:29.126 --> 00:47:32.432]  Comey said two months later he didn't try to influence him!
[00:47:32.432 --> 00:47:33.013]  You're caught!
[00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:44.739]  The New York Times said the day after Comey resigned that he had just asked for massive funding for the Russian investigation.
[00:47:44.739 --> 00:47:48.402]  The next day, his successor said he knew of no such thing.
[00:47:48.402 --> 00:47:52.825]  And that request wouldn't go to Congress, it would go to the Justice Department.
[00:47:52.825 --> 00:47:57.068]  So if you're asking me, do I believe the New York Times?
[00:47:57.068 --> 00:47:57.709]  No.
[00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:04.574]  And if Comey produces a memo, I would think it has to come out of the electronic system of the FBI.
[00:48:04.574 --> 00:48:06.015]  If it comes from Comey's phone,
[00:48:06.075 --> 00:48:09.256]  And if he thought it was obstruction, he had to go to the Attorney General?
[00:48:35.363 --> 00:48:42.029]  Well, I certainly did, sir, when I was a senior officer.
[00:48:42.029 --> 00:48:42.749]  You did too!
[00:48:42.749 --> 00:48:47.132]  But they never took them home, and they're available on a computer.
[00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:55.639]  All I'm saying is that if he did write a memo at the time, it would be available on the FBI's electronic communication system.
[00:48:55.639 --> 00:48:59.262]  And if it doesn't come from there, there's no certainty when it was written.
[00:49:01.232 --> 00:49:05.214]  The dollar has fallen to its lowest level in six months.
[00:49:05.214 --> 00:49:24.402]  Investors are concerned that the president, tied up with all this, is not able to push through tax cuts, not able to deal with the economy, and we know that non-farm roles were pretty poor compared to what people thought they would be for the last few months, and also dealing with infrastructure spending and cutting red tape.
[00:49:24.402 --> 00:49:30.125]  His agenda is getting stymied, and the Republicans are getting worried about this because of all this, isn't it?
[00:49:30.385 --> 00:49:32.788]  Republicans are on the same side as the Democrats.
[00:49:32.788 --> 00:49:41.696]  You have to remember that both establishments are anti-Trump and will be until and unless he's able to tame them.
[00:49:41.696 --> 00:49:46.781]  Take, for example, now that idiot McCain you had on there talking about Watergate.
[00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:51.947]  Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, by the way.
[00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:52.787]  Yes.
[00:49:52.787 --> 00:49:53.568]  Seven months
[00:49:54.549 --> 00:50:12.309]  After they started an investigation of this Russia business, the only piece of evidence they have is from the word of a private sector IT company that worked for Hillary Clinton, that the Russians took the emails out of the DNC.
[00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:13.511]  Wasn't true!
[00:50:38.052 --> 00:50:44.594]  That's a former senior CIA officer and someone I don't even know for being conservative, but being a pro-America.
[00:50:44.594 --> 00:50:50.356]  I mean, just everybody who's a professional and well-known and respected says this is wrong what's happened to the president.
[00:50:50.356 --> 00:50:52.457]  They've got all these Democrats now even coming out and admitting it.
[00:50:52.457 --> 00:50:53.597]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:50:53.597 --> 00:50:59.239]  It is just made up total fraud and totalized by a very dangerous group trying to hijack the country.
[00:51:00.615 --> 00:51:03.477]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction.
[00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:09.962]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[00:51:09.962 --> 00:51:20.371]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Lautinger, takes a look at how the Law of Attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[00:51:20.371 --> 00:51:26.055]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.
[00:51:26.055 --> 00:51:29.538]  Get the new book, It's Time to Align, available at Amazon.com.

[00:52:04.978 --> 00:52:05.458]  Great!
[00:52:05.458 --> 00:52:06.599]  Hey, thank you so much.

[00:52:29.286 --> 00:52:29.706]  That's amazing.
[00:52:29.706 --> 00:52:30.706]  That's really incredible.
[00:52:30.706 --> 00:52:33.847]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:52:33.847 --> 00:52:35.228]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:52:35.228 --> 00:52:36.908]  My morning was fantastic.

[00:54:16.684 --> 00:54:21.548]  All right, let me lay out the basic facts right now.
[00:54:21.548 --> 00:54:42.244]  And then I'm going to go through the specific details of it and the proves of this open public criminal conspiracy to overthrow our republic, not just Donald Trump, to end our three branches of government system and to permanently transfer us into an authoritarian program.
[00:54:42.244 --> 00:54:44.146]  The United States has not been perfect its 245 year history.
[00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:51.644]  But we've had checks and balances, and we've been somewhat of a free nation throughout that period compared to others.
[00:54:51.644 --> 00:54:55.886]  And we certainly had lower taxes, and the small guy could actually build his own empire.
[00:54:55.886 --> 00:55:00.607]  We did not have a stratified class structure nationally.
[00:55:00.607 --> 00:55:05.829]  Cities and towns would have their own elites, and people would gravitate towards clubs and golf courses.
[00:55:06.986 --> 00:55:08.047]  Elitism.
[00:55:08.047 --> 00:55:22.255]  But you still had a chance, whether you were a Russian, or whether you were from Africa, or whether you were from Mexico, or Italy, or wherever it was, to come here and have a better shot of actually building a better mousetrap.
[00:55:22.255 --> 00:55:30.860]  That's all being ended under globalism, where multinational corporations establish their own corporate bodies, they then buy off our politicians,
[00:55:32.159 --> 00:55:36.203]  Who shine over our authority to those multinational combines.
[00:55:36.203 --> 00:55:41.789]  This is the modern colonialism, slavery, called globalism.
[00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:47.795]  And the Apples, and the Microsofts, and the General Electrics, they're all for it.
[00:55:47.795 --> 00:55:51.879]  If General Motors isn't for it, they go bankrupt and the government takes it over.
[00:55:55.731 --> 00:55:56.892]  And that's where we're at right now.
[00:55:56.892 --> 00:55:59.834]  In comes Trump trying to bring back the old American system.
[00:55:59.834 --> 00:56:01.596]  She's the sexiest girl around.
[00:56:01.596 --> 00:56:04.718]  She just gets prettier with age.
[00:56:04.718 --> 00:56:07.201]  She's so much better than North Korea or Venezuela.
[00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:08.402]  So much better than Eastern Europe.
[00:56:08.402 --> 00:56:10.483]  So much better than France.
[00:56:10.483 --> 00:56:16.048]  And they don't want you to see her because you'd want her.
[00:56:16.048 --> 00:56:18.890]  She's the prettiest thing there's ever been.
[00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:19.551]  She's a good gal.
[00:56:22.481 --> 00:56:24.042]  In comes Trump, this nationalist.
[00:56:24.042 --> 00:56:26.704]  People are voting for nationalists, whether they're liberal or conservative.
[00:56:26.704 --> 00:56:27.824]  They just want out of globalism.
[00:56:27.824 --> 00:56:29.005]  They want out of the EU.
[00:56:29.005 --> 00:56:30.146]  They want out of the TPP.
[00:56:30.146 --> 00:56:30.906]  They want out of NAFTA.
[00:56:30.906 --> 00:56:31.726]  They want out of GATT.
[00:56:31.726 --> 00:56:32.307]  They don't care.
[00:56:32.307 --> 00:56:34.928]  A lot of liberals, a lot of women came over and voted for Trump.
[00:56:34.928 --> 00:56:35.929]  Record numbers of blacks.
[00:56:35.929 --> 00:56:37.710]  That's why they're so upset.
[00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:40.051]  The very same whites that put Obama in, put Trump in.
[00:56:40.051 --> 00:56:41.692]  They're just sick of it.
[00:56:41.692 --> 00:56:42.573]  They're not racist.
[00:56:42.573 --> 00:56:44.294]  They just want prosperity like everybody else.
[00:56:46.024 --> 00:56:49.727]  So the Democrats start this Russia narrative, thinking that would work.
[00:56:49.727 --> 00:56:57.712]  When they lose, even though they stole a bunch of states, they then keep going with the Russia narrative, and then hope somebody obstructs justice, not complying with the Russia narrative.
[00:56:57.712 --> 00:57:04.437]  And Lindsey Graham now says, oh, it's no longer an espionage thing, because there's none of that, but maybe people committed crimes not answering our questions.
[00:57:05.017 --> 00:57:06.638]  That's how the FBI always gets you.
[00:57:06.638 --> 00:57:12.784]  You didn't really do anything, but they claim that, you know, in some paperwork you didn't tell them the truth, so now you obstructed justice.
[00:57:12.784 --> 00:57:14.165]  That's why the FBI wants to talk to you.
[00:57:14.165 --> 00:57:16.707]  You might be Jesus Christ as clean as a lily.
[00:57:16.707 --> 00:57:17.728]  You just don't say a word.
[00:57:17.728 --> 00:57:21.932]  Because if they want to set you up, they're going to do it, unless you don't talk.
[00:57:21.932 --> 00:57:23.273]  And so now here we are.
[00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.415]  The Democrats tried to obstruct the election.
[00:57:25.415 --> 00:57:27.316]  They had the fake polls.
[00:57:27.316 --> 00:57:28.037]  Here's the big announcement.
[00:57:29.485 --> 00:57:31.867]  Then they tried to steal the election that night.
[00:57:31.867 --> 00:57:32.328]  They failed.
[00:57:32.328 --> 00:57:36.372]  Then they tried to steal the electors and get them to be faithless.
[00:57:36.372 --> 00:57:40.616]  During the election they tried to steal the delegates from Trump.
[00:57:40.616 --> 00:57:43.179]  They did steal them from Bernie on the Democrat side.
[00:57:43.179 --> 00:57:44.120]  So they're hopping mad.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:44.680]  What do they do?
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.185]  They start putting out in their internal discussions, we need to overthrow this election, we need to have a new one.
[00:57:50.418 --> 00:57:51.498]  They then say, how do we do it?
[00:57:51.498 --> 00:58:01.061]  We've got to get a new government ready, we've got to get it set up, so that if Trump tries to say no with his government, we'll claim it's illegitimate and have a war with it!
[00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:07.523]  I had sources on that, told you about it in late 2016, in countless reports and videos.
[00:58:07.523 --> 00:58:14.125]  Then a few months later, they come out in Atlantic Monthly, rewriting the rules of presidential succession, and say word for word,
[00:58:15.908 --> 00:58:19.089]  That that's how they want to do it, but they got to sell the idea first.
[00:58:19.089 --> 00:58:22.409]  And all of this is about selling that idea.
[00:58:22.409 --> 00:58:26.190]  That's why they said, no, no, no, let's back off on impeachment.
[00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:36.012]  That's the New York Times headline that top Dems want the other Dems to back off impeachment because that's not even where they're going quite yet.
[00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:38.832]  They may just outright arrest Trump.
[00:58:38.832 --> 00:58:39.633]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.633 --> 00:58:40.153]  Stay with us.
[00:58:40.153 --> 00:58:40.953]  I'm going to break down.
[00:58:42.139 --> 00:58:46.132]  What they're gearing up to do, everybody needs to tune into this.
[00:58:46.132 --> 00:58:48.419]  The Democrats are preparing to call for a new election.
[00:58:50.885 --> 00:58:58.867]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:58.867 --> 00:59:05.509]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:59:05.509 --> 00:59:13.791]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:59:14.071 --> 00:59:19.937]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[00:59:19.937 --> 00:59:23.100]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:28.845]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:59:29.185 --> 00:59:29.946]  It works!
[00:59:29.946 --> 00:59:38.271]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:48.158]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the Globalists all at the same time!
[00:59:48.158 --> 00:59:53.221]  A total 360 win!
[00:59:53.221 --> 00:59:55.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.495 --> 01:00:13.978]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:13.978 --> 01:00:19.220]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.228 --> 01:00:28.535]  So, what do you do if your multinational corporations have figured out how to use the same corporate systems that control the colonies to take over the Western world?
[01:00:28.535 --> 01:00:36.221]  What do you do when populists start getting elected all over the world, bringing power back to their own people and back to their own governments?
[01:00:36.221 --> 01:00:37.742]  That's what President Trump's doing.
[01:00:37.742 --> 01:00:47.971]  Well, you just call them foreign traitors and you have the deep state, the intelligence agencies, that had already basically taken over the country, go and declare that your president is a foreign enemy.
[01:00:49.315 --> 01:00:52.896]  And then you push that narrative long enough with the public.
[01:00:52.896 --> 01:01:01.037]  You prepare the public to go along with a plan to overthrow the president, claiming that he's illegitimate.
[01:01:01.037 --> 01:01:03.138]  But don't worry, you're not a dictatorship.
[01:01:03.138 --> 01:01:08.298]  You're going to hold a special election in six months run by Homeland Security.
[01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:15.460]  The last executive action of Obama was to hand over all 50 states to Homeland Security in their elections.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:15.920]  And all 50
[01:01:17.853 --> 01:01:27.756]  Governors and Lieutenant Governors and Attorney Generals have written letters, including 25 Democrats, saying, do not do this, unanimously.
[01:01:27.756 --> 01:01:34.659]  This breaks the Constitution, breaks the separation of powers, destroys federalism between the states and the federal government.
[01:01:34.659 --> 01:01:36.999]  What are you doing taking the election over?
[01:01:36.999 --> 01:01:42.001]  Remember Obama, when I was saying he was planning to steal the election for Hillary and was going to try, which they got caught doing?
[01:01:42.001 --> 01:01:42.761]  He said, that's crazy.
[01:01:42.761 --> 01:01:43.962]  That's that guy down there in Texas.
[01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:46.763]  We don't run elections.
[01:01:46.763 --> 01:01:52.685]  You sure tried, and now you want to.
[01:01:52.685 --> 01:01:54.625]  So, there's the big news.
[01:01:54.625 --> 01:02:02.547]  They have gone from in private saying it, to in public saying it a few months ago in Atlantic Monthly, to now preparing to do it.
[01:02:02.547 --> 01:02:05.667]  And I was told yesterday and this morning, watch.
[01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:12.229]  The Democrats are going to come out and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't want impeachment right now, because they haven't played out their propaganda piece yet.
[01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.249]  They don't want to have a real
[01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:16.975]  hearing in the Senate, where they know the facts will come out.
[01:02:16.975 --> 01:02:35.529]  They want to just keep beating this drum that not only President Trump is illegitimate, but if you read the Atlantic Monthly article, and if you read the New Yorker article, all elite publications, they say it's not just him, it's his Supreme Court nominee.
[01:02:35.529 --> 01:02:37.310]  And it's not just- who's now confirmed.
[01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:43.015]  And it's everybody elected is suspect in the last election, all the Republicans,
[01:02:44.215 --> 01:02:51.737]  In the House and Senate and all the state houses and all the governors, they're saying the realignment in our country was a Russian plot.
[01:02:51.737 --> 01:02:57.438]  And so the whole return of America, the whole return of our system, you see, is illegitimate.
[01:02:57.438 --> 01:03:07.760]  And the deep state that already hijacked the country, it has to come back in with even greater authoritarianism and actually submit the authoritarianism in their new rubber-stamped Venezuela
[01:03:09.423 --> 01:03:12.905]  We're entering an inquisition.
[01:03:12.905 --> 01:03:14.526]  We're entering a red scare.
[01:03:14.526 --> 01:03:16.608]  We're entering a total hysteria.
[01:03:39.943 --> 01:03:41.384]  It's a civil war.
[01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:55.994]  And that's why all the black op commanders and all the CIA people and all the patriots are coming out saying, this is a takeover, this is the end of America, this isn't just the overthrow of Trump, as Greenwald is saying, this is the overthrow of our system!
[01:03:55.994 --> 01:04:01.397]  You can read the article by Paul Watson in fullwars.com, updated, and I added some intel with Kit Daniels.
[01:04:01.397 --> 01:04:04.459]  I have the quotes.
[01:04:04.459 --> 01:04:07.922]  I have the quotes here from the March 28th article in The Atlantic.
[01:04:08.857 --> 01:04:14.885]  If the election had been stolen, Pence's place as Vice President would be no more legitimate than that of Trump.
[01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:18.430]  So he can't be there, wrote elitist insider Norm Ornstein.
[01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:24.177]  After Pence, Paul Ryan, the Speaker, followed by Orrin Hatch, the President, wrote Diem, followed by the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.
[01:04:24.177 --> 01:04:25.539]  They all must be removed.
[01:04:25.539 --> 01:04:26.600]  I'm reading from their plan!
[01:04:27.421 --> 01:04:39.861]  If voters collectively desire were subverted by the foreign interference and the party's collusion, none would have been a legitimate claim, especially since the control of the Senate, at least, would have been affected by the Russian role.
[01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:42.304]  So there must be, and they go on a total overthrow of the government.
[01:04:42.805 --> 01:04:47.009]  With Homeland Security overseeing a new government, but only of Republicans.
[01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:52.835]  The Republicans have to be removed, and then have new elections overseen by the Democrats, making sure that doesn't happen.
[01:04:52.835 --> 01:04:59.381]  The Republicans must understand this is a total takeover, ending the two-party system of the desperate Democrats whose party had imploded.
[01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:06.520]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:17.985]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[01:05:17.985 --> 01:05:26.109]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this critical moment.
[01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:29.491]  On Trump's website, he has set up a Drain the Swamp
[01:05:29.611 --> 01:05:31.032]  I'm Millie Weaver reporting.
[01:06:00.612 --> 01:06:06.076]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:06.076 --> 01:06:08.178]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:08.178 --> 01:06:13.461]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:13.461 --> 01:06:17.224]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:06:17.304 --> 01:06:20.767]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:20.767 --> 01:06:23.930]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:27.834]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:27.834 --> 01:06:34.981]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:34.981 --> 01:06:40.386]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:06:40.646 --> 01:06:42.688]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[01:06:42.688 --> 01:06:50.998]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[01:06:50.998 --> 01:06:59.307]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:07:00.447 --> 01:07:08.714]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[01:07:08.714 --> 01:07:09.935]  A 360 win.
[01:07:09.935 --> 01:07:16.500]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:24.046]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:07:24.426 --> 01:07:29.089]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:35.593]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:43.399]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:43.399 --> 01:07:50.603]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:50.603 --> 01:07:51.404]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:07:51.564 --> 01:07:54.005]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:54.005 --> 01:07:55.986]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[01:07:55.986 --> 01:08:05.329]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:06.990]  At your own risk.
[01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.150]  Because it leads to the future.
[01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:12.612]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:08:12.612 --> 01:08:14.853]  This is not a new world.
[01:08:14.853 --> 01:08:18.134]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:08:19.247 --> 01:08:27.669]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:35.731]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:08:35.731 --> 01:08:41.452]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:43.673]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:08:49.039 --> 01:08:51.781]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[01:08:51.781 --> 01:08:58.445]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[01:08:58.445 --> 01:09:03.209]  Because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[01:09:03.209 --> 01:09:07.852]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:37.125]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats are openly calling for a new election and the overturning of the presidential election of Donald J. Trump.
[01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:38.906]  I'm going to say that again.
[01:09:38.906 --> 01:09:48.353]  The Democrats are calling for the overturning of the election of Donald J. Trump and a new election, and they're saying the Vice President, the Supreme Court,
[01:09:52.870 --> 01:10:13.161]  Individual that was nominated and confirmed, Gorsuch, all the House members that were elected, Paul Ryan who was re-elected, they're saying they all got elected because the Russians helped them get elected with no proof, and the Republican leadership wanting to go after
[01:10:15.339 --> 01:10:29.322]  Trump, wanting to delegitimize him, after they'd already tried to steal the nomination from him, Hillary stole it from Bernie Sanders, and after they tried to get the faithless electors to steal the election, they didn't give up!
[01:10:29.322 --> 01:10:43.666]  And so they went along with the whole Russia narrative, led by the Pied Pipers, of Lindsey Graham, and of course John McCain, the deep state operatives, and now they're saying hundreds of state house
[01:10:44.815 --> 01:10:45.295]  Elections, 900.
[01:10:45.295 --> 01:11:03.811]  And all the new conservative governors, and this whole movement to cut taxes, and restore the Second Amendment, and restore Christians not being persecuted by the IRS, and to not let unvetted radical Muslims in, and to kill TPP, and to build a border wall, and to do all this has to be scrapped because it was the Russians.
[01:11:03.811 --> 01:11:11.458]  They did it, and only the Democrats, only the globalists, only the Federal Reserve are the guardians of America.
[01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:12.239]  And only they
[01:11:13.373 --> 01:11:14.134]  Can be in office.
[01:11:14.134 --> 01:11:19.640]  And what's crazy is, I was hearing about this during the election, after the election, from my deep state sources.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.602]  We first broke it and talked about it.
[01:11:21.602 --> 01:11:28.250]  Then in Atlantic Monthly, and in New Yorker Magazine, and other elite publications, they came out and said it!
[01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.432]  And I've gone over those quotes, I'll go over them again!
[01:11:31.812 --> 01:11:33.914]  And now they're really doing it.
[01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:35.255]  But they want to sound reasonable.
[01:11:35.255 --> 01:11:36.316]  Oh, we don't want impeachment.
[01:11:36.316 --> 01:11:41.260]  No, you don't want impeachment because you want to declare the entire election illegitimate.
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.622]  And that's what they're actually preparing in Congress.
[01:11:43.622 --> 01:11:49.967]  And they're going around to Republicans saying, if you go along with this, we'll say your election was kosher.
[01:11:51.291 --> 01:11:55.994]  We're going to need a few Republicans left in here so it's not too obvious.
[01:11:55.994 --> 01:11:58.596]  We're going to need a few conservative talk show hosts to stay on.
[01:11:58.596 --> 01:12:00.397]  Glenn Becker, are you on board?
[01:12:00.397 --> 01:12:01.838]  Sir, yes sir!
[01:12:01.838 --> 01:12:05.660]  May I have another?
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:06.341]  And that's the plan.
[01:12:08.069 --> 01:12:21.646]  And I've laid it out before, and I'm about to lay it out again, because now I've talked to my White House sources, and I've talked to my Congressional sources, and I've talked to my Pentagon sources, and they said, Alex, you are 100% on target again, word for word.
[01:12:21.646 --> 01:12:23.048]  Who do you really work for?
[01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:24.530]  How did you know all this?
[01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:25.150]  I keep getting it.
[01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:27.412]  Who are you with?
[01:12:27.412 --> 01:12:28.974]  I'm with the American people.
[01:12:28.974 --> 01:12:30.535]  I'm Deep State 1836.
[01:12:30.535 --> 01:12:32.797]  I'm Deep State 1776.
[01:12:32.797 --> 01:12:36.981]  I'm Deep State whatever year my family arrived on both sides of the Mayflower.
[01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:40.063]  I'm Deep State 16 whatever it is.
[01:12:40.063 --> 01:12:41.825]  Yes, I am Deep State.
[01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:42.726]  As deep as it goes.
[01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:47.009]  It's true.
[01:12:47.009 --> 01:12:48.491]  Obnoxious.
[01:12:48.491 --> 01:12:49.612]  Angry.
[01:12:49.612 --> 01:12:50.672]  Focused.
[01:12:50.672 --> 01:12:51.813]  Dedicated.
[01:12:51.813 --> 01:12:53.155]  Dependable.
[01:12:53.155 --> 01:12:53.455]  Loyal.
[01:12:57.267 --> 01:13:00.092]  Researched!
[01:13:00.092 --> 01:13:02.937]  And I'll go on to the end.
[01:13:02.937 --> 01:13:07.345]  Whatever the cost may be, because it's now in the New York Times.
[01:13:07.345 --> 01:13:08.086]  It's now in...
[01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:11.542]  Atlantic Monthly again.
[01:13:11.542 --> 01:13:16.805]  It's now in a bunch of publications and the White House is now hearing from people inside the White House.
[01:13:16.805 --> 01:13:18.667]  Well, you better just get ready.
[01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:23.049]  They're going to declare the whole election illegitimate and just make you step down.
[01:13:23.049 --> 01:13:26.752]  A whole new thing where it's not even they impeach the president.
[01:13:26.752 --> 01:13:28.453]  That's not the road they're going on.
[01:13:28.453 --> 01:13:30.274]  They're inventing just a new
[01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:55.444]  System of propaganda outside of the federal system, outside of the three branches, where the media, the fifth of state, all these foreign powers, the Pope, the globalists, the communist Chinese, Hollywood, Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate, just announced, you're a Russian agent, the election was Russian, it's all legitimate, all illegitimate, having a Freudian slip, and
[01:13:56.667 --> 01:14:13.772]  Overturn it, and then have Homeland Security be the guardian from here on out, this unelected fourth branch of government, over the elections to ensure, just like in Venezuela or the old Soviet Union, that they are carried out properly.
[01:14:13.772 --> 01:14:21.594]  That guy down in Texas, Obama, said, he's crazy, saying we're going to take over the elections.
[01:14:21.594 --> 01:14:23.674]  Feds aren't involved in elections.
[01:14:23.674 --> 01:14:25.595]  Not until I sign an executive order in a couple months.
[01:14:28.288 --> 01:14:55.863]  And that's why you've got Dennis Kucinich, and you've got all these former CIA people, and all these former FBI people, and all these academics and experts going, oh my God, they're not just going to overthrow Trump, they're about to overthrow the entire American system, because they know America's going to keep voting for libertarianism, keep voting for lower taxes, keep voting for sovereignty, keep voting to keep the radical Muslims out, keep voting to defend the borders, keep voting to keep Christianity legal,
[01:14:56.966 --> 01:14:59.047]  And they just can't beat our ideology!
[01:14:59.047 --> 01:15:00.488]  They just can't beat our ideas!
[01:15:00.488 --> 01:15:02.369]  They can't beat this culture!
[01:15:02.369 --> 01:15:05.051]  It's why everybody wants to come here, and then bitch about it all day!
[01:15:05.051 --> 01:15:07.692]  Because our slum's better than your slum!
[01:15:07.692 --> 01:15:09.353]  We're the best house in a bad neighborhood!
[01:15:09.353 --> 01:15:10.654]  I didn't say we didn't have problems!
[01:15:10.654 --> 01:15:15.297]  If it was some other better country, I'd be there!
[01:15:15.297 --> 01:15:17.098]  But I love America!
[01:15:17.098 --> 01:15:25.223]  And I know when they have congressional hearings and say, I'm under criminal investigation, but nobody subpoenas me, nobody calls me before them, they say, oh, Jones is being directed by the Russians!
[01:15:27.887 --> 01:15:33.332]  You're being directed by multinational corporations that want to loot this country and think we're all stupid.
[01:15:33.332 --> 01:15:36.875]  You're being directed by being a dishonorable, yellow-bellied trash.
[01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:38.016]  And let me tell you something.
[01:15:38.016 --> 01:15:40.579]  I know we're going to beat you.
[01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:42.120]  I've studied history.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.805]  I've been fighting you for 20-plus years.
[01:15:46.805 --> 01:15:50.688]  And my ancestors beat you over and over again, and I'm going to beat you.
[01:15:50.688 --> 01:15:52.230]  And my listeners are going to beat you.
[01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:53.371]  So you just get ready for that.
[01:15:54.409 --> 01:16:01.036]  Oh, and by the way, if something happens to me, or this operation even gets shut down, don't think that that's a defeat.
[01:16:01.036 --> 01:16:04.779]  Don't think that, oh, they're going to celebrate it if they're able to, aren't they?
[01:16:04.779 --> 01:16:07.762]  Was the Alamo a victory for Santa Ana?
[01:16:07.762 --> 01:16:12.407]  Yeah, for about two weeks.
[01:16:12.407 --> 01:16:14.388]  That's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:14.388 --> 01:16:16.230]  I'm committed 110%.
[01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:18.833]  I will go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[01:16:19.929 --> 01:16:22.471]  Because I understand the globalists can't be dealt with.
[01:16:22.471 --> 01:16:23.933]  They can't be made a deal.
[01:16:23.933 --> 01:16:25.674]  There's no quarter.
[01:16:25.674 --> 01:16:28.256]  They're not there just trying to conquer us so they're in charge.
[01:16:28.256 --> 01:16:30.218]  They want to conquer our spirit.
[01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:31.419]  They want to destroy liberty.
[01:16:31.419 --> 01:16:33.481]  They're evil.
[01:16:33.481 --> 01:16:34.322]  Look at them.
[01:16:34.322 --> 01:16:36.464]  Look at how they're banning mother and father.
[01:16:36.464 --> 01:16:41.168]  Look at how they're banning wood paneling at colleges because that's racist.
[01:16:41.168 --> 01:16:43.269]  Everything is total division.
[01:16:43.269 --> 01:16:44.831]  Everything is an imploded culture.
[01:16:48.505 --> 01:17:16.475]  And now we're laying out the plan that they have the intelligency of being brainwashed with right now, that they're preparing everybody in government with, and Congress with, getting their ducks in a robe, and then just continuing to lie about the President, and lie about his supporters, and try to foam in as much cop-killing as possible, and as much de-industrialization as possible, and trying to shut down the economy, and trying to stop the Trump recovery, so that the economy goes down, and things get really bad, something they already had planned when Hillary got in,
[01:17:16.755 --> 01:17:17.896]  They were going to bring in martial law.
[01:17:17.896 --> 01:17:18.936]  That's all admitted now.
[01:17:18.936 --> 01:17:20.757]  She was going to shut down the independent press.
[01:17:20.757 --> 01:17:22.778]  They were going to implode the borders.
[01:17:22.778 --> 01:17:24.378]  Bring in UN.
[01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:25.499]  Loretta Lynch said so.
[01:17:25.499 --> 01:17:26.880]  Strong Cities Initiative.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.901]  I mean, they were going to trigger race riots, you name it, once Hillary got in.
[01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:36.064]  But see, Trump got in because the intelligence agencies and the American people said no in a desperate last gasp.
[01:17:36.064 --> 01:17:43.167]  But just because we pulled up out of the waves and got some air for a minute didn't mean we didn't get sucked right back under by that globalist giant squid.
[01:17:47.762 --> 01:17:50.726]  And the minions of globalism, they don't care if the economy implodes.
[01:17:50.726 --> 01:17:52.869]  They don't care if it hurts 99% of people.
[01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:57.595]  Because they don't even care if they end up losing their job in a couple years.
[01:17:57.595 --> 01:18:00.639]  They really do want to destroy America.
[01:18:00.639 --> 01:18:03.804]  Even their servants that don't get power out of this, but for a season.
[01:18:04.957 --> 01:18:06.218]  For a short time.
[01:18:06.218 --> 01:18:08.100]  Because it's their God.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.402]  It's their God of this world.
[01:18:09.402 --> 01:18:10.583]  It's what they're into.
[01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:11.804]  They're into destruction.
[01:18:11.804 --> 01:18:13.245]  They're into pulling things down.
[01:18:13.245 --> 01:18:16.949]  Because if you look at the Podestas, or you look at other globalists, they're all ugly.
[01:18:16.949 --> 01:18:19.392]  Either young or old, they're all ugly.
[01:18:19.392 --> 01:18:20.973]  They look mentally ill.
[01:18:20.973 --> 01:18:22.395]  They look completely crazy.
[01:18:22.395 --> 01:18:23.836]  They look completely unhappy.
[01:18:23.836 --> 01:18:26.199]  And of course they're all into all sorts of weird stuff.
[01:18:28.351 --> 01:18:40.138]  Of course they're into all sorts of crime, because they're fallen, twisted, ugly, hateful, demon people that all they know is hurting anything that's beautiful.
[01:18:40.138 --> 01:18:42.219]  Like the old fairy tale for Sleeping Beauty.
[01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:50.284]  You don't invite the witch to the birthday party, you don't invite her to the wedding, so she just destroys the whole town.
[01:18:50.284 --> 01:18:52.686]  Puts everybody under her sleep, under her curse.
[01:18:54.198 --> 01:18:56.399]  She kills the woman and the man.
[01:18:56.399 --> 01:19:02.022]  She puts them in a suspended animation so that the magic of the man and woman together can't create the future and can't procreate.
[01:19:02.022 --> 01:19:03.682]  She attacks humanity itself.
[01:19:03.682 --> 01:19:04.823]  She tells you it's ugly.
[01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.004]  She tells you it's fallen.
[01:19:06.004 --> 01:19:07.304]  She tells you it's bad.
[01:19:07.304 --> 01:19:12.326]  So that you don't ascend on the stairway to heaven that God has ready for us.
[01:19:12.326 --> 01:19:15.528]  You are sabotaged by their cultural evil.
[01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:24.977]  And that's Trump's greatest crime, is he wants to see wealth and success and empowerment for humanity, and that, to the Satanist, is satanic.
[01:19:24.977 --> 01:19:37.731]  And so now they're shopping around and getting ready, and even in the news, with their own people, saying, suspend the election, overthrow the entire realignment, overthrow all the Republicans, all the Libertarians, the populists, stop them, bring in authoritarianism, just like they're doing in places like Greece.
[01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:40.098]  That's their answer.
[01:19:40.098 --> 01:19:46.700]  And so we have to say no and point this out because they think we're so stupid they're operationally talking about all this now in public.
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.922]  But they don't want to debate in the general public about it until they've created the consensus.
[01:19:50.922 --> 01:19:59.546]  We have to stop it before the consensus comes out by exposing it as pure authoritarianism or they will package it like pumpkin pie or bubblegum.
[01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:03.250]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.

[01:21:00.492 --> 01:21:02.313]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:21:02.313 --> 01:21:08.878]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:21:08.878 --> 01:21:12.040]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:21.766]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:21:21.766 --> 01:21:22.607]  Caveman.
[01:21:22.607 --> 01:21:27.671]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:21:27.671 --> 01:21:29.752]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:21:30.072 --> 01:21:33.195]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:21:33.195 --> 01:21:38.319]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:21:38.319 --> 01:21:46.365]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:21:46.365 --> 01:21:54.191]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:21:54.191 --> 01:21:58.995]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:06.273]  The 300 Blackout is an incredible rifle, and Infidel Body Armor is giving one away in just a few days.

[01:22:29.568 --> 01:22:36.332]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:22:36.332 --> 01:22:40.595]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[01:22:59.286 --> 01:23:02.989]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension or 401k?
[01:23:02.989 --> 01:23:08.133]  Then I hope you're prepared to lose 30, 40, 50% or more of your retirement savings.
[01:23:08.133 --> 01:23:10.996]  Because it's not a question of if the market crashes again.
[01:23:10.996 --> 01:23:12.337]  It's a question of when.
[01:23:12.337 --> 01:23:13.898]  It's going to happen.
[01:23:13.898 --> 01:23:19.182]  Did you know there is a way you can protect and grow your wealth safely and predictably every single year?
[01:23:19.182 --> 01:23:23.586]  The people using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or 2008.
[01:23:23.586 --> 01:23:26.208]  And they won't lose a penny in the next crash.
[01:23:26.528 --> 01:23:33.391]  In fact, their money will continue to grow safely year in and year out, even when stocks, real estate, and other investments tumble.
[01:23:33.391 --> 01:23:36.732]  A free report detailing this savings program is now available.
[01:23:36.732 --> 01:23:44.076]  This free report shows how you can get guaranteed growth, safety, and wealth building power without risking your retirement in the Wall Street casino.
[01:23:44.076 --> 01:23:47.337]  This is the best way to have a 100% secure retirement.
[01:23:47.337 --> 01:23:50.958]  It far outperforms any IRA or 401k.

[01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:30.592]  David Horowitz joins us until about 40 after.
[01:24:30.592 --> 01:24:36.255]  Then we've got Michael Schneider with some critical economic news joining us.
[01:24:36.255 --> 01:24:38.577]  David Horowitz is our guest for the next 15 minutes or so.
[01:24:38.577 --> 01:24:44.620]  He, of course, is the best-selling author of FrontPageMagazine.com.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:50.004]  And the reason I wanted to get him on again is he has several best-selling books out right now that basically predicted what's happening.
[01:24:50.004 --> 01:24:53.746]  But he's been quoted as saying, the Democrats want to secede from the Union again.
[01:24:54.893 --> 01:24:59.617]  And he's used Nazi parallels, but also Bolshevik parallels.
[01:24:59.617 --> 01:25:01.599]  And if you pull back from this, his parents were communists.
[01:25:01.599 --> 01:25:02.900]  It's how he woke up to all this.
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:10.086]  It's how he's been so accurate about the left working with Islam, political Islam, that I thought was crazy when I first read about it in his book, Unholy Alliance, 16, 17 years ago.
[01:25:12.028 --> 01:25:20.912]  But I see them in Atlantic Monthly and other elite publications saying, don't just overthrow Trump, set aside the whole 2016 election and remove Paul Ryan, everybody.
[01:25:20.912 --> 01:25:22.412]  And then I talked to the White House this morning.
[01:25:22.412 --> 01:25:24.853]  I talked to some congressmen last night.
[01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.434]  They said, no, you're right, Alex.
[01:25:26.434 --> 01:25:27.634]  I talked about this months ago.
[01:25:27.634 --> 01:25:31.276]  They're now floating the idea around to stop this American realignment.
[01:25:32.588 --> 01:25:39.831]  To just declare everyone a Russian agent who isn't a globalist, or a socialist, or an islamicist, and people say, oh, they'll never get away with that.
[01:25:39.831 --> 01:25:43.473]  Well, they keep getting all the Republicans to denounce Trump as a Russian.
[01:25:44.619 --> 01:25:45.059]  We'll see.
[01:25:45.059 --> 01:25:47.341]  Then this witch hunt begins, suddenly they're being denounced.
[01:25:47.341 --> 01:25:49.322]  That's how these inquisitions work.
[01:25:49.322 --> 01:25:52.124]  And the leftism is a religion, as Horowitz has pointed out.
[01:25:52.124 --> 01:25:54.346]  It's the new, you know, the new cult.
[01:25:54.346 --> 01:26:05.934]  So, sir, you've kind of hinted at this, but can you directly speak, if you haven't seen it, to the Atlantic Monthly and all the rest actually saying overthrow the whole election, have new elections, and the Democrats and Homeland Security will oversee it all?
[01:26:05.934 --> 01:26:09.217]  I mean, this looks like an authoritarian realignment.
[01:26:12.426 --> 01:26:19.729]  This is the second time the Democratic Party has decided to secede from the Union in its history.
[01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:21.890]  The other time, of course, was in 1860.
[01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:31.934]  And there, too, you had an incoming president, Abraham Lincoln, and war was declared on Lincoln before he ever got to do anything.
[01:26:31.934 --> 01:26:33.475]  And this is what's happened to Trump.
[01:26:33.475 --> 01:26:35.776]  I mean, I'm talking about impeachment on day one.
[01:26:37.469 --> 01:26:38.690]  They were attacking the election.
[01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:40.471]  They tried to have the faithless electors.
[01:26:40.471 --> 01:26:42.712]  They tried to stop him even getting seated.
[01:26:42.712 --> 01:27:00.684]  And the reason behind it, I believe, is when you have a civil war situation, when you have somebody actually not participating in the American political framework that we have, we've had honeymoons for incoming presidents.
[01:27:00.684 --> 01:27:03.166]  It's the peaceful transition of power.
[01:27:03.166 --> 01:27:05.247]  It says that we're all part of one nation.
[01:27:06.042 --> 01:27:08.725]  Uh, even though campaigns are divisive.
[01:27:08.725 --> 01:27:10.707]  They've thrown all of that out the window.
[01:27:10.707 --> 01:27:17.635]  Um, along with, you know, our national motto, which is E Pluribus Unum, out of many one.
[01:27:17.635 --> 01:27:22.240]  And the reason is, I mean, identity politics.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.841]  This is cultural Marxism.
[01:27:23.841 --> 01:27:25.163]  That's the way they describe it.
[01:27:26.424 --> 01:27:40.777]  The American idea is that regardless, we're a country formed by people who came from diverse countries, diverse ethnicities, conflicting religious communities.
[01:27:40.777 --> 01:27:46.762]  But when they came to America, in the Declaration of Independence, they said we're all equal.
[01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:51.246]  And the Marxists use our strength, as you've written, against us, that we actually are open and inclusive.
[01:27:51.246 --> 01:27:52.828]  They use that to create total division.
[01:27:54.077 --> 01:27:54.937]  Exactly.
[01:27:54.937 --> 01:28:03.324]  But what drives their hatred, look, it happened, I have this in my book, Big Agenda, Trump's Plan to Save America.
[01:28:03.324 --> 01:28:13.994]  In the second debate, Trump turned to the 50 million people in the television audience and he said, you have to understand, Hillary has tremendous hatred.
[01:28:14.784 --> 01:28:16.385]  In her heart.
[01:28:16.385 --> 01:28:20.168]  And he was referring to the basket of deplorables.
[01:28:20.168 --> 01:28:23.871]  And she's identified who's in that basket.
[01:28:23.871 --> 01:28:27.394]  Racist, sexist, homophobes, Islamophobes, xenophobes.
[01:28:27.394 --> 01:28:39.664]  Well, there isn't a conservative listening to this show or a conservative in Christendom who hasn't been called a racist, sexist, homophobe, Islamophobe for disagreeing with a Democrat.
[01:28:41.432 --> 01:28:52.321]  The Democrats have an anti-American ideology, which is identity politics or cultural Marxism, in which the world is divided into oppressors and oppressed.
[01:28:52.321 --> 01:28:57.846]  And white people, and religious people, and straight people, they're the oppressors.
[01:28:57.846 --> 01:29:08.955]  And everybody else is oppressed, even if they're Islamic beheaders in Syria, or Maharajas in India, or the descendants of the Spanish conquistadors in Mexico.
[01:29:09.858 --> 01:29:14.402]  That's why they, why are they protecting Mexican criminals?
[01:29:15.256 --> 01:29:17.177]  Because they're oppressed!
[01:29:17.177 --> 01:29:19.579]  They are an oppressed people!
[01:29:19.579 --> 01:29:22.361]  Who you have to have certain sensitivities towards.
[01:29:46.198 --> 01:29:48.381]  The globalist big agenda is to take us down.
[01:29:48.381 --> 01:29:48.842]  We'll be back.
[01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:49.824]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.824 --> 01:29:51.206]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.206 --> 01:29:53.730]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:56.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:06.625]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:18.076]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[01:30:18.076 --> 01:30:24.582]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this critical time.
[01:30:24.622 --> 01:30:24.962]  We're good.
[01:30:44.343 --> 01:30:46.104]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[01:30:46.104 --> 01:30:48.346]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:31:07.276 --> 01:31:07.716]  Great!
[01:31:07.716 --> 01:31:08.837]  Hey, thank you so much.

[01:31:22.505 --> 01:31:23.526]  Wow, thank you.

[01:31:25.867 --> 01:31:27.428]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?

[01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:36.831]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[01:31:36.831 --> 01:31:38.492]  My morning was fantastic.

[01:33:13.261 --> 01:33:28.228]  Alright, David Horowitz is our guest.
[01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:31.349]  We may be able to keep him for the rest of the hour because so much news is breaking.
[01:33:31.349 --> 01:33:40.554]  I was going to bring this up later, the whole Comey clip that we discovered and that listeners discovered two days ago, and then on May 3rd,
[01:33:42.421 --> 01:33:44.443]  Saying, no, there was never any obstruction of justice.
[01:33:44.443 --> 01:33:45.483]  Nobody tried to influence me.
[01:33:45.483 --> 01:33:51.808]  And then we have a memo two months before where he says Trump basically tried to do this.
[01:33:51.808 --> 01:34:02.357]  And notice as soon as this video came out, Schiff and people on the Intelligence Committee started to back off saying maybe we shouldn't have impeachment because they know this is having a big effect.
[01:34:02.357 --> 01:34:07.341]  But what was crazy is our listeners find the clip.
[01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:08.582]  Cernovich found it as well.
[01:34:09.994 --> 01:34:10.675]  We put it out.
[01:34:10.675 --> 01:34:12.857]  We make it, you know, a big story.
[01:34:12.857 --> 01:34:17.462]  It gets read a couple million times on our website.
[01:34:17.462 --> 01:34:20.505]  And then the media has to figure out how to handle this.
[01:34:20.505 --> 01:34:24.469]  And so the Daily Beast and others come out with this headline.
[01:34:24.469 --> 01:34:29.114]  Stock Surge As Trading Floors Watch Breaking Info Wars Video.
[01:34:29.114 --> 01:34:31.876]  It was two weeks old and wrong.
[01:34:31.876 --> 01:34:32.117]  Okay.
[01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:33.995]  So here's the deal.
[01:34:33.995 --> 01:34:42.403]  It was ignored that two weeks ago he said Trump hadn't tried to influence him because the big news hadn't broke that Comey's memo said he had.
[01:34:42.403 --> 01:34:46.446]  But just because it's two weeks old doesn't mean it's false.
[01:34:46.446 --> 01:34:54.694]  So then they go in to the article and don't even ever tell you what Comey actually said.
[01:34:55.942 --> 01:35:00.870]  Or show you the video where Comey says Trump or nobody else tried to influence him.
[01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:02.752]  That's pretty big news, right?
[01:35:02.752 --> 01:35:06.799]  Because if his memo does say he did it, then he purged himself to Congress on May 3rd.
[01:35:06.799 --> 01:35:11.325]  Their answer is, though, it's fake without ever showing it's fake.
[01:35:12.372 --> 01:35:14.193]  And again, I'm guilty of the crime.
[01:35:14.193 --> 01:35:15.414]  I want the stock market to go up.
[01:35:15.414 --> 01:35:18.956]  Well, yes, the latest witch hunt did drive it down, what, 300 plus points?
[01:35:18.956 --> 01:35:22.077]  Then it kind of went back up, I guess, when this came out.
[01:35:22.077 --> 01:35:24.959]  It turns out they did show this in the stock exchange in New York.
[01:35:24.959 --> 01:35:27.360]  They got excited because they know Trump's good for business.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.301]  Three plus trillion in the stock market.
[01:35:29.301 --> 01:35:33.163]  If they take him out, we'll go back to high taxes and regulations, so people get excited.
[01:35:33.163 --> 01:35:35.624]  And here's my crime as an evil Russian agent.
[01:35:35.624 --> 01:35:38.086]  I'm trying to get the stock market up because it affects our economy.
[01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:43.792]  And we kill socialism and communism by having productivity and a successful culture.
[01:35:43.792 --> 01:35:46.736]  You have to outperform the socialists.
[01:35:46.736 --> 01:35:49.539]  You have to outwin them.
[01:35:49.539 --> 01:35:57.128]  And you read the article, it's how bad Kit Daniels is, my writer, and how evil I am, and how bad you are as listeners.
[01:35:57.128 --> 01:35:58.730]  They never say where we're wrong, though.
[01:35:59.821 --> 01:36:02.322]  They just say, oh, it's an old clip, so it doesn't matter.
[01:36:02.322 --> 01:36:03.622]  But it is Comey saying that.
[01:36:03.622 --> 01:36:10.125]  So I'm going to play the clip and then get David Horowitz, his author of Big Agenda, put out by the great folks at Newsmax.com, get his take on this.
[01:36:10.125 --> 01:36:12.246]  But this is new level spin, folks.
[01:36:12.246 --> 01:36:15.207]  Here it is.
[01:36:15.207 --> 01:36:25.371]  So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:27.832]  In theory, yes.
[01:36:27.832 --> 01:36:28.472]  Has it happened?
[01:36:29.625 --> 01:36:30.926]  Not in my experience.
[01:36:30.926 --> 01:36:37.610]  Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:43.394]  Oftentimes, they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[01:36:43.394 --> 01:36:47.517]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason.
[01:36:47.517 --> 01:36:49.258]  That would be a very big deal.
[01:36:49.258 --> 01:36:51.160]  It's not happened in my experience.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:58.465]  So, they interview senior traders that say, yes, we read InfoWars, it's got the polls of the people, it said that Comey did this, stock market went up.
[01:36:59.338 --> 01:37:02.199]  Until the media came in and said it wasn't true and it went back down.
[01:37:02.199 --> 01:37:02.779]  It is true.
[01:37:02.779 --> 01:37:04.800]  He did say that on C-SPAN.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:08.341]  We have the full two-hour testimony posted.
[01:37:08.341 --> 01:37:14.524]  And imagine being the Daily Beast and everybody else cheerleading against Trump and the stock market.
[01:37:14.524 --> 01:37:21.266]  David Horowitz, you've got the floor to talk about this and what you think Trump should do to counter this avalanche of Saul Alinsky lies.
[01:37:21.266 --> 01:37:27.088]  Well, the media is... We don't have a news media anymore.
[01:37:27.088 --> 01:37:28.289]  It's a broken system.
[01:37:29.053 --> 01:37:38.856]  I mean, they're just trench warriors for the left that wants to impeach Trump because Trump represents America.
[01:37:38.856 --> 01:37:42.496]  Trump represents a traditional American way of viewing things.
[01:37:42.496 --> 01:37:46.918]  You judge individuals on their merits, not according to their origins.
[01:37:49.246 --> 01:37:51.627]  That's why they hate him.
[01:37:51.627 --> 01:37:54.067]  And he's our greatest asset.
[01:37:54.067 --> 01:37:55.928]  You're asking how we can fight back.
[01:37:55.928 --> 01:38:05.811]  The biggest factor here is that Donald Trump doesn't back down and goes for their jugular every time.
[01:38:05.811 --> 01:38:09.532]  That's our greatest asset.
[01:38:09.532 --> 01:38:11.993]  Our weakest is the Republican Party.
[01:38:14.224 --> 01:38:17.605]  Who call for impeachment should be thrown out of the party.
[01:38:17.605 --> 01:38:19.146]  Absolutely, he's disgusting.
[01:38:19.146 --> 01:38:24.168]  This is a problem that we have in Paul Ryan.
[01:38:24.168 --> 01:38:27.129]  You know, lukewarm.
[01:38:27.129 --> 01:38:29.910]  But Republicans should know this.
[01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:40.714]  If Donald Trump is impeached, and Mike Pence, whom I adore, is a wonderful man, he's got good conservative politics, but if Mike Pence becomes the president,
[01:38:41.474 --> 01:38:46.575]  The Trump people will leave and the Republicans will go down in flames.
[01:39:03.075 --> 01:39:10.661]  It's the most absurd thing that's ever happened in American political life at this level, the Russian conspiracy.
[01:39:10.661 --> 01:39:11.441]  It's ludicrous.
[01:39:11.441 --> 01:39:16.445]  I mean, the Russians are criticizing Trump today for the serious strikes.
[01:39:16.445 --> 01:39:18.347]  I mean, it's just unreal.
[01:39:18.347 --> 01:39:26.413]  I mean, if there's collusion, it's Podesta who's colluding with the Russians and the Clintons because they're making money off them.
[01:39:26.413 --> 01:39:28.354]  But there is no Russian conspiracy.
[01:39:31.727 --> 01:39:39.429]  McCarthy, what he's accused of is 100 times less than what the Democrats are doing.
[01:39:39.429 --> 01:39:42.730]  Because there was a conspiracy in McCarthy's day.
[01:39:42.730 --> 01:39:44.570]  The Russians released the documents 10 years ago.
[01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:46.130]  McCarthy was on target.
[01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:47.591]  My parents were part of it.
[01:39:47.591 --> 01:39:48.391]  I know that.
[01:39:48.391 --> 01:39:51.432]  They all wanted the Russians to win the Cold War.
[01:39:51.432 --> 01:39:53.472]  They were seditious.
[01:39:53.472 --> 01:39:56.133]  McCarthy exaggerated here and there.
[01:39:56.573 --> 01:40:00.015]  But that's nothing to inventing the whole thing out of old cloth.
[01:40:00.015 --> 01:40:03.697]  Well, it's the Democrats that the Russians admittedly helped in two elections on record.
[01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:07.599]  It's the Democrats that were always in bed with the Communists because they liked the ideology.
[01:40:07.599 --> 01:40:10.601]  Now the Democrats hate Russia because they're getting right-wing and Christian.
[01:40:11.581 --> 01:40:13.602]  Yeah, the Democrats are communists.
[01:40:13.602 --> 01:40:15.423]  It's the party of Bernie Sanders.
[01:40:15.423 --> 01:40:23.207]  He would have been the nominee if the crooked Clintons hadn't fixed the primaries with the help of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile.
[01:40:23.207 --> 01:40:26.388]  And Bernie Sanders is a lifelong supporter of communism.
[01:40:26.388 --> 01:40:30.930]  Well let me ask you this thing, because I know Trump's obviously got a big agenda, because I hear it quoted word for word out of his mouth.
[01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:33.992]  And some of the insiders, the word is Trump has read your book.
[01:40:33.992 --> 01:40:36.113]  Obviously you're all over Fox, so he watches you.
[01:40:36.693 --> 01:40:37.874]  What do you want to say to the President?
[01:40:37.874 --> 01:40:39.796]  Because he does end up watching all these clips.
[01:40:39.796 --> 01:40:41.037]  What do you advise him to do now?
[01:40:41.037 --> 01:40:43.199]  Because I can't help but love him more.
[01:40:43.199 --> 01:40:46.582]  A lot of people say they don't support him because he's so embattled.
[01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:48.744]  No, this is when I do support him.
[01:40:48.744 --> 01:40:50.926]  He is under such incredible attack.
[01:40:50.926 --> 01:40:53.948]  This is called the law of unintended consequences.
[01:40:53.948 --> 01:40:57.752]  Hopefully, conservatives and Republicans will rally around
[01:40:58.376 --> 01:41:00.178]  They're targeted leader.
[01:41:00.178 --> 01:41:04.161]  And what I would advise Trump is he needs to work with Congress.
[01:41:04.161 --> 01:41:07.084]  He needs to get those guys in line.
[01:41:07.084 --> 01:41:11.388]  And then he needs to go out to the people, the people who elected him.
[01:41:11.388 --> 01:41:14.090]  That's the, you know, the ace in the hole.
[01:41:16.213 --> 01:41:24.816]  He's got to have a nationwide rally to point out the treason and say, no matter what the scum say in the media, we're going to restore the republic, we're going to cut your taxes, we're together.
[01:41:24.816 --> 01:41:30.678]  He's got to, after this foreign trip, I agree, change the subject in a nationwide tour.
[01:41:30.678 --> 01:41:32.618]  I think he should arrest Hillary too.
[01:41:32.618 --> 01:41:33.378]  Oh, I agree.
[01:41:33.378 --> 01:41:38.860]  What would happen if Sessions was allowed, we have total evidence, to go ahead and indict Crooked Hillary?
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:39.800]  I think that would be great.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.041]  It would be a rallying for all the troops.
[01:41:42.674 --> 01:41:44.195]  Look, this is a war.
[01:41:44.195 --> 01:41:50.379]  And the more our side recognizes that it's a war, I mean, the Democrats, they understand it.
[01:41:50.379 --> 01:41:52.060]  It's in their blood.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:58.965]  The more our side recognizes that it's a war and fights like it's a war, the better chance we have of prevailing.
[01:41:58.965 --> 01:42:04.629]  And David Horowitz, of the best-selling book, everybody should read, that's been your whole message for decades.
[01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:10.453]  And again, like I said, I read one of your books 16 years ago and thought, you know, part of this is true, but part of this is crazy.
[01:42:10.453 --> 01:42:11.134]  It all came true.
[01:42:12.256 --> 01:42:13.857]  Revelation or something, it's crazy.
[01:42:13.857 --> 01:42:17.659]  So now I read everything you say, and now I go to Front Page Magazine and really listen.
[01:42:17.659 --> 01:42:22.262]  Now I'm like, read stuff you guys wrote about me 15 years ago, and I go, it's actually true, I was an idiot back then.
[01:42:22.262 --> 01:42:28.845]  I mean, I was pure-hearted and right on some things, but wrong on others, being manipulated by a leftist agenda, you know, at least 25%.
[01:42:28.845 --> 01:42:34.128]  But now I look at it, I just underestimate it, because I don't mean to be mean, like you said, my parents weren't communists.
[01:42:34.128 --> 01:42:38.591]  I mean, go back to the roots of the ideas of this, and what we're facing, and what
[01:42:39.331 --> 01:42:41.852]  Because conservatives just want to work and be normal.
[01:42:41.852 --> 01:42:43.572]  Exactly.
[01:42:43.572 --> 01:42:45.073]  That's the big problem, Alex.
[01:42:45.073 --> 01:42:46.813]  Conservatives are decent people.
[01:42:46.813 --> 01:42:48.353]  They're creators.
[01:42:48.353 --> 01:42:50.174]  They have real lives.
[01:42:50.174 --> 01:42:51.894]  They're building businesses.
[01:42:51.894 --> 01:42:55.055]  They're trying to reach out to as many people as possible.
[01:42:55.055 --> 01:42:57.396]  Whereas the left, they're warriors.
[01:42:57.396 --> 01:42:58.276]  They're missionaries.
[01:42:58.732 --> 01:43:02.074]  They want to wreck this system and replace it.
[01:43:02.074 --> 01:43:07.817]  Kamala Harris and Howard said that we have to define what it means, what our country is.
[01:43:07.817 --> 01:43:08.477]  No!
[01:43:08.477 --> 01:43:11.699]  Our country was defined in the founding documents.
[01:43:11.699 --> 01:43:15.641]  Anybody who wants to define it now is a traitor, basically.
[01:43:15.641 --> 01:43:20.764]  And when I first came into the right from the left, the first thing I said is,
[01:43:21.414 --> 01:43:23.734]  Where's the ground army?
[01:43:23.734 --> 01:43:27.015]  You know, where's the SDSs, the student organizations?
[01:43:27.015 --> 01:43:32.196]  Where are the, all the things you see in the streets, the Occupy Wall Street people?
[01:43:32.196 --> 01:43:41.277]  Not until Obama inspired the Tea Party has there been really a grassroots movement on the Republican side.
[01:43:41.277 --> 01:43:44.378]  And I agree, and I'm very proud of the M4's listeners.
[01:43:44.378 --> 01:43:46.918]  Even mainstream media admits we're seen as the ground army.
[01:43:46.918 --> 01:43:50.499]  That's why the left says they're attacking me so much, is they see our listeners everywhere.
[01:43:51.147 --> 01:43:55.691]  It definitely started with talk radio and then social media.
[01:43:55.691 --> 01:43:58.853]  But you have to have the troops.
[01:43:58.853 --> 01:44:05.178]  So you're saying the answer is, conservatives of every race, color, and creed, we need to get on the streets?
[01:44:05.178 --> 01:44:06.419]  Yeah, get into the war.
[01:44:06.419 --> 01:44:07.820]  It's a war!
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:09.121]  Fight it like it's a war!
[01:44:09.121 --> 01:44:12.404]  Republicans are crazy!
[01:44:13.777 --> 01:44:21.601]  Look, he gave the information about the computer bombs to the Russians.
[01:44:21.601 --> 01:44:22.261]  Good!
[01:44:22.261 --> 01:44:26.704]  He's trying to take the Russians into camp to fight ISIS.
[01:44:26.704 --> 01:44:29.645]  And Obama and all them are allied with radical Muslims.
[01:44:29.645 --> 01:44:33.027]  Of course they don't want the US and Russia teamed up to take out the radical Islam.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.624]  Yeah, another reason is that they're people of color.
[01:44:37.624 --> 01:44:39.186]  People of color are oppressed.
[01:44:39.186 --> 01:44:42.209]  They're oppressed by white people.
[01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:44.291]  You've got to fight this like a war.
[01:44:44.291 --> 01:44:48.735]  And when that starts happening, it hasn't quite happened yet.
[01:44:48.735 --> 01:44:51.118]  When that starts happening on the right, particularly
[01:44:52.018 --> 01:44:54.299]  It's gotta happen in the Congressional leadership.
[01:44:54.299 --> 01:44:55.699]  It's gotta happen in the party.
[01:44:55.699 --> 01:45:01.841]  Sure, let me ask you this, David Horowitz, because again, you're a smart guy, a sage at history and understanding things.
[01:45:01.841 --> 01:45:06.083]  When your whole life's arc in research, at your gut level where things are now,
[01:45:06.823 --> 01:45:08.224]  Do you think Trump's going to make it?
[01:45:08.224 --> 01:45:09.804]  I do, but I think he's very close.
[01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:15.386]  If he doesn't get aggressive, doesn't do what you said, rally the troops, if we don't rally, they're not going to just take him out.
[01:45:15.386 --> 01:45:18.668]  The socialists and communists realize they're losing.
[01:45:18.668 --> 01:45:20.769]  If they take Trump out, they're going to go for broke.
[01:45:20.769 --> 01:45:23.210]  I think we're going to have a civil war.
[01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:25.450]  Yeah, well, it's not just the economy.
[01:45:25.450 --> 01:45:27.131]  I mean, the economy is huge.
[01:45:27.131 --> 01:45:34.234]  When you think of what Trump has done, it's all been driven off the front pages by these wretched non-reporters.
[01:45:34.827 --> 01:45:47.312]  I mean, I hope that he closes down those press briefings and does some himself, and cuts off members of the press that are offensive and just liars.
[01:45:47.312 --> 01:45:48.553]  And there are so many of them.
[01:45:48.553 --> 01:45:51.074]  I mean, I can't even watch CNN.
[01:45:51.074 --> 01:45:53.375]  Oh, they say, kill him, get rid of him, he's horrible.
[01:45:53.375 --> 01:45:54.916]  Then he says, I don't like you.
[01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:56.156]  And they're like, oh, you're so mean.
[01:45:56.156 --> 01:45:57.517]  It's so crazy.
[01:45:57.517 --> 01:45:59.978]  If he's making the action, he'll survive.
[01:46:04.164 --> 01:46:09.666]  He's got to do it, and he's got to have all the support that the rest of us can give him.
[01:46:09.666 --> 01:46:11.787]  Well, I've been asking the question, David Horowitz.
[01:46:11.787 --> 01:46:13.308]  Big agenda.
[01:46:13.308 --> 01:46:19.731]  Spend three or four minutes in closing on other topics, issues you want to, you know, relay to at least a million and a half people that are watching right now.
[01:46:19.731 --> 01:46:23.912]  They drowned the story of Seth Rich's murder.
[01:46:23.912 --> 01:46:28.634]  I mean, this blows their Russian conspiracy theories sky high that he supplied 44,000 documents to WikiLeaks.
[01:46:32.571 --> 01:46:34.132]  And then who murdered him?
[01:46:34.132 --> 01:46:40.695]  And you know, it's like a return of the Clinton administration, when you have all these dead bodies around.
[01:46:40.695 --> 01:46:42.376]  It's time to be really aggressive.
[01:46:42.376 --> 01:46:45.757]  That's what they should be investigating.
[01:46:45.757 --> 01:46:48.759]  And of course, the leaks, which are treasonous.
[01:46:48.759 --> 01:46:51.920]  And you have to indict, you have to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.281]  She violated the espionage.
[01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:53.841]  I agree.
[01:46:53.841 --> 01:46:54.682]  The key is indict her.
[01:46:54.682 --> 01:46:55.542]  Yeah.
[01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.363]  I agree.
[01:46:58.502 --> 01:47:15.172]  So, I mean, I have to tell you that I'm very encouraged because, as I say, when I came into the Reich 30 years ago, everybody was so well mannered that people weren't noticing the communists all around.
[01:47:15.172 --> 01:47:19.275]  They were letting the Democrats get away with murder.
[01:47:19.275 --> 01:47:23.197]  Now I see fighters since the Tea Party.
[01:47:23.197 --> 01:47:25.699]  We actually have conservative demonstrations.
[01:47:26.708 --> 01:47:38.295]  I don't think I'm revealing too much when I say that Milo Yiannopoulos and I and Coulter are going back to Berkeley and we're just going to occupy.
[01:47:38.295 --> 01:47:40.316]  So you've got to take the battle.
[01:47:40.316 --> 01:47:43.958]  In my book, Big Agenda, I set out many things that could be done.
[01:47:43.958 --> 01:47:51.523]  I mean, they need a sunset, the Ford Foundation, all these giant foundations that fund the communist causes.
[01:47:51.523 --> 01:47:52.463]  That's another subject.
[01:47:52.463 --> 01:47:53.204]  Why don't we put up with
[01:47:53.944 --> 01:47:56.847]  300 billion in these foundations, waging war.
[01:47:56.847 --> 01:48:03.632]  What is weirdo Henry Ford that was pro-Hitler, how does his wealth fight America, and did he even want that?
[01:48:03.632 --> 01:48:10.337]  Like, what is, it's so weird, like, weirdo Jordan Soros, a Nazi collaborator, and weirdo Ford money, a Nazi?
[01:48:10.337 --> 01:48:17.002]  My grandfather's almost died fighting Nazis, they call me a Nazi all day, meanwhile Nazi money is financing the left.
[01:48:17.002 --> 01:48:18.403]  It's like, what is going on?
[01:48:18.403 --> 01:48:21.706]  Well, actually, Henry Ford II, the son,
[01:48:22.887 --> 01:48:30.680]  Who wasn't a Nazi, denounced the foundation for funding all these anti-capitalist communist causes.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.762]  Sure, so that's what I'm saying.
[01:48:31.762 --> 01:48:34.086]  How did a Nazi then found something that funds the left?
[01:48:34.086 --> 01:48:34.587]  What's going on?
[01:48:35.789 --> 01:48:37.230]  They're accountable to no one.
[01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:45.636]  I wrote a whole book on this called The New Leviathan, which conservatives ignored, but it shows that they outfund the right.
[01:48:45.636 --> 01:48:46.876]  No, I know you wrote a book on it.
[01:48:46.876 --> 01:48:54.681]  What I'm asking you is how did hundreds of billions of dollars get put in the hands of crazy leftists by rich industrialists?
[01:48:54.681 --> 01:49:01.466]  Oh, because Henry Ford II, I wrote a book on the Fords with Peter Collier.
[01:49:03.177 --> 01:49:08.180]  He was trying to rescue the Ford Motor Company, which was in the hands of a monster.
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:13.243]  And so he turned it over to the head of Studebaker, Paul Hoffman, who happened to be a liberal.
[01:49:13.243 --> 01:49:17.626]  And then the left, the left, as I said, they're missionaries.
[01:49:17.626 --> 01:49:19.327]  They go into fields.
[01:49:19.912 --> 01:49:24.597]  That, you know, missionaries in the Middle Ages would have gone into.
[01:49:24.597 --> 01:49:32.226]  They go into journalism, they go into teaching, they go into politics, and they also go into philanthropy.
[01:49:32.226 --> 01:49:41.236]  So all the philanthropoids, the administrators of these foundations who wind up eventually on their boards, are leftists.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.201]  Well, you've got to come on.
[01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:45.363]  I haven't read that book of yours, but I've studied some history.
[01:49:45.363 --> 01:49:46.404]  I know that's accurate.
[01:49:46.404 --> 01:49:53.250]  How amazing you've got a weird Nazi foundation, then leftist hijack it, and then do even worse.
[01:49:53.250 --> 01:49:54.371]  It's just crazy.
[01:49:54.371 --> 01:49:55.892]  David Horowitz, Big Agenda is the book.
[01:49:55.892 --> 01:49:57.333]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:49:57.333 --> 01:49:59.475]  I really appreciate you joining us, but I agree with you.
[01:49:59.475 --> 01:50:03.018]  Whatever happens to Trump or myself or anybody, we're now fighting back.
[01:50:03.018 --> 01:50:06.181]  We're finally founding our, you know, sea legs, and good things are starting to happen.
[01:50:06.837 --> 01:50:07.697]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:07.697 --> 01:50:12.098]  I hope your listeners... I created the only encyclopedia of the left.
[01:50:12.098 --> 01:50:15.659]  It's called discoverthenetworks.org.
[01:50:15.659 --> 01:50:17.100]  It's all in there.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:19.000]  Well, please come back whenever you want.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.361]  I'm about to launch a whole larger radio TV network.
[01:50:21.361 --> 01:50:23.942]  Join us whenever you want to help us.
[01:50:23.942 --> 01:50:25.202]  So, thank you so much, David Horowitz.
[01:50:25.967 --> 01:50:26.307]  Thank you.
[01:50:42.042 --> 01:50:44.063]  Like a restaurant, or clothes, or music.
[01:50:44.063 --> 01:50:45.324]  It's whatever people like.
[01:50:45.324 --> 01:50:48.306]  They have free will, they choose it, and then it makes it all better.
[01:50:48.306 --> 01:50:49.948]  Not North Korea, or by starving to death.
[01:50:49.948 --> 01:50:54.050]  I mean, the problem with free market, though, is it creates a bunch of spoiled rotten people.
[01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:57.893]  It creates a bunch of decadent people, who then get conned by communists.
[01:50:57.893 --> 01:51:00.255]  We'll be back with big breaking news, more guests, stay with us.
[01:51:00.595 --> 01:51:05.378]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:05.378 --> 01:51:11.262]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:51:11.262 --> 01:51:17.786]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:51:17.786 --> 01:51:21.809]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[01:52:00.052 --> 01:52:05.500]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.583]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:52:07.583 --> 01:52:12.851]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:16.576]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:52:16.676 --> 01:52:20.099]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:52:20.099 --> 01:52:23.261]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:52:23.261 --> 01:52:27.124]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:52:27.124 --> 01:52:34.269]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:52:34.269 --> 01:52:39.613]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:52:39.893 --> 01:52:41.914]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[01:52:41.914 --> 01:52:50.180]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:58.426]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[01:54:04.005 --> 01:54:05.626]  Take a look out that window.
[01:54:05.626 --> 01:54:09.848]  There's a scene you'd like to catch.
[01:54:09.848 --> 01:54:11.408]  My late uncle wanted me to play this.
[01:54:11.408 --> 01:54:13.249]  It's bumper music.
[01:54:13.249 --> 01:54:13.910]  Ten years ago.
[01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:22.253]  Man's got his hand outstretched.
[01:54:22.253 --> 01:54:26.375]  Could be the local priest.
[01:54:26.375 --> 01:54:29.477]  Sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
[01:54:34.494 --> 01:54:39.075]  First he's in the back, now he's in the front.
[01:54:39.075 --> 01:54:46.057]  Yeah, you know, sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
[01:54:46.057 --> 01:54:49.818]  Alright, let's get into the news here.
[01:55:03.806 --> 01:55:08.628]  I've got a clip I want to play because Tommy Robinson is going to join us in the next hour.
[01:55:08.628 --> 01:55:12.951]  This is a guy who's just a nationalist and doesn't want Muslims raping people.
[01:55:12.951 --> 01:55:17.333]  The police all over the news won't even stop Muslims raping women and little kids.
[01:55:17.333 --> 01:55:18.594]  They're just allowed to.
[01:55:18.594 --> 01:55:20.154]  That's in the news.
[01:55:20.154 --> 01:55:21.235]  We've covered it here.
[01:55:21.235 --> 01:55:23.576]  We'll cover it when he comes up in the next hour.
[01:55:23.576 --> 01:55:26.297]  But now Tommy Robinson is out there.
[01:55:26.297 --> 01:55:27.038]  This is on video.
[01:55:29.224 --> 01:55:40.169]  We're set upon by a gang after confronting a Labour Party political member who gave a charter reference for a convicted pedophile.
[01:55:40.169 --> 01:55:42.330]  And so under Islam, pedophilia is being legalized.
[01:55:42.330 --> 01:55:43.570]  Here is the video.
[01:55:43.570 --> 01:55:45.211]  He's joining us.
[01:55:45.211 --> 01:55:47.032]  Sorry, you've seen the video anyway.
[01:55:47.032 --> 01:55:51.674]  But the worrying thing is the links that the council has with the gangs, the street level gangs.
[01:55:55.578 --> 01:55:56.700]  We were in Rochdale.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.883]  We were in Rochdale to see Councillor Hussain.
[01:55:58.883 --> 01:56:00.245]  He's a Labour councillor.
[01:56:00.245 --> 01:56:07.174]  You've all watched the documentary for Free Girls, which shows the rape and prostitution of a generation of kids in Rochdale by Muslim gangs.
[01:56:07.174 --> 01:56:11.981]  Councillor Hussain went to court to defend and give a character reference for one of those men.
[01:56:12.702 --> 01:56:17.104]  Who is now convicted in prison as part of a gang who raped 98 young English kids.
[01:56:17.104 --> 01:56:19.064]  He's still part of the Labour Party.
[01:56:19.064 --> 01:56:22.146]  We went there to ask him and to tell him he has to resign.
[01:56:22.146 --> 01:56:24.506]  Out of respect to the victims, he has to resign.
[01:56:24.506 --> 01:56:27.087]  He should not be involved in British politics.
[01:56:27.087 --> 01:56:30.809]  When we got there to see him, there were cars waiting.
[01:56:30.809 --> 01:56:32.069]  Straight away they tried to block the road.
[01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.809]  There were four cars.
[01:56:32.809 --> 01:56:33.610]  They tried to block the road.
[01:56:33.610 --> 01:56:36.231]  Unfortunately our camera wasn't even rolling because we hadn't even got out of the car.
[01:56:37.111 --> 01:56:38.212]  So they tried to block the road.
[01:56:38.212 --> 01:56:40.434]  I had to go up on the pavement to get away.
[01:56:40.434 --> 01:56:43.276]  Then you'll see, in the footage you'll see, that's where it starts.
[01:56:43.276 --> 01:56:46.678]  Where I pull up, a car pulls up next to me and I ask them, why are you trying to block the road?
[01:56:46.678 --> 01:56:48.060]  Why are you trying to block us in?
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:49.861]  Why are you all jumping out of cars?
[01:56:49.861 --> 01:56:52.543]  At that point you'll see our car window was smashed.
[01:56:52.543 --> 01:56:53.864]  I then drove on.
[01:56:53.864 --> 01:56:58.127]  You'll see another young Muslim try and punch through the window.
[01:56:58.127 --> 01:57:02.270]  And then we've been proceeding in a bit of a car chase with some cars full of Muslims.
[01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:03.792]  That's pretty much it.
[01:57:03.792 --> 01:57:06.293]  And then there was a little bit of ramming on the road as well.
[01:57:06.293 --> 01:57:06.454]  So,
[01:57:07.697 --> 01:57:08.799]  This doesn't change anything.
[01:57:08.799 --> 01:57:14.806]  Councillor Hussain, if you think that you can get your street gangs, and this is the worrying thing for me, is that...
[01:57:15.578 --> 01:57:23.121]  You have street-level gangs who are drug dealers, and who are pimping and prostituting young English girls, and then you have Labour representatives going to court.
[01:57:23.121 --> 01:57:26.603]  The ex-mayor, who is a Muslim, went to court to defend these gangs.
[01:57:26.603 --> 01:57:30.644]  And when we go up to question them as journalists, who comes out to attack us?
[01:57:30.644 --> 01:57:32.785]  All the gangs, all the street-level gangs.
[01:57:32.785 --> 01:57:37.547]  So that cooperation between the political leaders in the Islamic community and the gangs is a big worry.
[01:57:37.547 --> 01:57:38.208]  It's called mafia.
[01:57:39.208 --> 01:57:43.073]  But it doesn't change much because Councillor Hussain, I'm going to find you.
[01:57:43.073 --> 01:57:45.156]  You're going to end up on Rebel TV.
[01:57:45.156 --> 01:57:46.738]  Everyone's going to see your face.
[01:57:46.738 --> 01:57:51.263]  Everyone's going to see who you are and you're going to have to answer the questions I ask you.
[01:57:51.263 --> 01:57:53.286]  Asking you why you defended Peter Fowles.
[01:57:53.286 --> 01:57:54.347]  Why you defended these men.
[01:57:55.368 --> 01:58:01.277]  And the easiest solution for you, the easiest thing for you to do, Councillor Hussain, would be to resign.
[01:58:01.277 --> 01:58:03.881]  Because if you don't resign, we're not going to let up.
[01:58:03.881 --> 01:58:07.786]  And anyone who wants to see this, firehussain.com is a website.
[01:58:07.786 --> 01:58:09.950]  You can sign a petition, get behind this, support it.
[01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:15.551]  If you want to help those young girls and help make sure it never happens again, the Labour Party have to show their serious values.
[01:58:15.551 --> 01:58:24.994]  You have a general election coming up and you have a councillor who defended Muslim men who destroyed 48 young children's lives, probably more, in the town of Rochdale.
[01:58:24.994 --> 01:58:27.255]  Your councillor went to court and defended them.
[01:58:27.255 --> 01:58:28.015]  He has to resign.
[01:58:28.015 --> 01:58:31.076]  It's too dirty to be involved in British politics.
[01:58:31.076 --> 01:58:35.657]  And then you show up at his office and you're attacked, as if that's going to intimidate us.
[01:58:35.657 --> 01:58:38.658]  It's only going to be these attacks that ignite the spirit.
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:40.601]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:40.601 --> 01:58:41.442]  Tell everybody to tune in.
[01:58:41.442 --> 01:58:43.143]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:58:43.143 --> 01:58:45.025]  If you don't do it, you're aiding the globalists.
[01:58:45.025 --> 01:58:45.585]  We all know that.
[01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:47.567]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.655 --> 01:58:56.060]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:58.902]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:58:58.902 --> 01:59:00.884]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:59:00.884 --> 01:59:05.908]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:59:05.908 --> 01:59:08.010]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:59:08.010 --> 01:59:09.291]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:59:09.291 --> 01:59:14.415]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:59:14.415 --> 01:59:17.778]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:59:17.918 --> 01:59:18.418]  We're good to go.
[01:59:45.546 --> 01:59:53.248]  At Infowarslife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:59:53.248 --> 01:59:55.889]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:10.444 --> 02:00:13.126]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:13.126 --> 02:00:18.210]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:21.532]  Alright, we got Tommy Robinson, you just saw.
[02:00:21.532 --> 02:00:24.114]  You just tuned in to that incredible clip.
[02:00:24.114 --> 02:00:32.280]  Trying to go to the office of the Member of Parliament, who is involved reportedly covering up for people who have been convicted of rape.
[02:00:33.618 --> 02:00:37.140]  In the Islamic tradition of putting women into sex slavery, that's just a fact.
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:43.623]  I mean, hell, there's mainstream news about sex slavery in Rwanda, and sex slavery in Sudan, and sex slavery in Libya.
[02:00:43.623 --> 02:00:48.004]  Now the Gaddafi got kicked out of selling women as sex slaves.
[02:00:48.004 --> 02:00:49.845]  He's going to be joining us.
[02:00:49.845 --> 02:00:52.467]  Dr. Steve Pchenik joins us.
[02:00:52.467 --> 02:00:57.609]  Pchenik put out a video last week of Turkish men taking little girls and cutting their organs out.
[02:00:57.609 --> 02:00:59.670]  I thought, God, I hope that's not true, and I went and looked at, like,
[02:01:00.646 --> 02:01:10.717]  Dozens of BBC, Reuters, AP, Daily Mail articles where they are grabbing little kids and killing them and cutting their organs out and selling them.
[02:01:10.717 --> 02:01:16.984]  And I'm like, I wouldn't take an organ if somebody was going to die, if it was going to kill me.
[02:01:16.984 --> 02:01:19.327]  And I guess I'm like a wimp.
[02:01:19.327 --> 02:01:20.548]  I'm not a hero.
[02:01:20.548 --> 02:01:20.989]  I'm a wimp.
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:23.561]  I'm so afraid of God.
[02:01:23.561 --> 02:01:25.241]  That's what they call God-fearing.
[02:01:25.241 --> 02:01:28.683]  I'm not a bad person in like, oh, I'd do it, but God's there.
[02:01:28.683 --> 02:01:34.826]  It's like I feel so horrified at the idea of killing some kid and taking their organ that I wouldn't do it.
[02:01:34.826 --> 02:01:36.127]  I just have a basic governor.
[02:01:36.127 --> 02:01:37.588]  I'm not a psychopath.
[02:01:37.588 --> 02:01:39.309]  I'm not a sociopath.
[02:01:39.309 --> 02:01:41.370]  And I just can't believe we've gotten to this point.
[02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:44.556]  We just showed what was happening in England.
[02:01:44.556 --> 02:01:49.417]  I mean, these Muslims, I'm not saying all of them, but whatever happened to Muslims, I don't want to be part of it.
[02:01:49.417 --> 02:01:52.318]  I mean, there's just so many evils just come out of that.
[02:01:52.318 --> 02:01:55.439]  I'm just wondering, we need a reformation for this religion, don't we?
[02:01:55.439 --> 02:01:56.539]  Or is it the inbreeding?
[02:01:56.539 --> 02:01:57.620]  Or what is it?
[02:01:58.933 --> 02:02:03.695]  There's Nigel Farage, Savages, Jean-Claude Juncker, one of the main heirs of the Nazi fortune.
[02:02:03.695 --> 02:02:06.897]  His grandfather took over Luxembourg, still runs it.
[02:02:06.897 --> 02:02:11.259]  This guy, this Nazi's lecturing us how to overthrow the U.S., you know, get rid of Trump.
[02:02:11.259 --> 02:02:18.023]  I'm like, Juncker, I'm not a violent person, but man, you should be pushing daisies, shooting your big fat Nazi mouth off.
[02:02:18.023 --> 02:02:18.403]  Here it is.
[02:02:19.266 --> 02:02:36.399]  Imagine you invited a very important guest round for dinner, and you made all the preparations, and there was some very important confidential conversations that needed to be had, and you thought everything had gone well, and yet, within hours, your guest had told the outside world that you, the host, were deluded!
[02:02:37.259 --> 02:02:40.721]  That you were living in a different galaxy.
[02:02:40.721 --> 02:02:47.144]  And then, all the contents of the conversation were blabbed to an opposition newspaper.
[02:02:47.144 --> 02:02:52.506]  And to add insult to injury, you say the food wasn't actually very good either.
[02:02:52.506 --> 02:03:02.771]  And then, a few days later, in a display of extreme petulance, you even deride the national language of the host, which by the way is looking a bit silly.
[02:03:03.351 --> 02:03:12.076]  Because last Saturday's extravaganza, known as the Eurovision Song Contest, saw 90% of the songs sung in English.
[02:03:12.076 --> 02:03:24.142]  Now, if you were the host, and you'd been treated like that by somebody that you thought was important, and somebody you thought you could trust, I think you'd be asking yourself, were you dealing with a reasonable person?
[02:03:24.142 --> 02:03:28.364]  Now, I don't know, Mr Juncker, whether this is how you carry on in Luxembourg.
[02:03:28.364 --> 02:03:29.005]  I doubt it.
[02:03:29.645 --> 02:03:37.112]  Because in any other part of the civilized world, frankly, that behavior would be considered to be bloody rude, and the act of a bully.
[02:03:37.112 --> 02:03:38.613]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[02:03:38.613 --> 02:03:40.394]  I'll tell you something.
[02:03:40.394 --> 02:03:44.638]  Your attempt to bully the Brits through this negotiation is not working.
[02:03:44.638 --> 02:03:49.903]  68% now of the British people want Brexit to happen.
[02:03:49.903 --> 02:03:51.024]  And all of that on top.
[02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:59.750]  of a ludicrous ransom that Monsieur Barnier wants that I'm told has now doubled to 100 billion euros.
[02:03:59.750 --> 02:04:09.317]  Either we get some grown-up, reasonable demands from the European Union or the United Kingdom will be forced to walk away before the end of this year.
[02:04:09.317 --> 02:04:11.599]  We can't spend two years with this farce.
[02:04:11.599 --> 02:04:14.281]  There is a big, big world out there and I'm beginning to think
[02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:31.190]  But perhaps, I very rarely agree with Marxists, but perhaps Mr Varoufakis is right when he says about negotiating with the EU, it is a technocracy that is desperately clinging on to its own exorbitant and illegitimate power.
[02:04:31.190 --> 02:04:35.493]  You may have crushed Greek democracy two years ago, you ain't gonna do it to us.
[02:04:37.389 --> 02:04:38.190]  And that's the thing.
[02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:41.993]  We're not selling some utopia like communists or globalists or technocrats.
[02:04:41.993 --> 02:04:44.495]  We just want to have free market run our own world.
[02:04:44.495 --> 02:04:49.019]  And their arrogance only intensifies their downfall.
[02:04:49.019 --> 02:04:54.925]  I mean, the Daily Beast documents that we set the stock market up in the hope that Trump can stay in office.
[02:04:54.925 --> 02:04:58.187]  You act like we're traitors because we want a good economy?
[02:05:01.161 --> 02:05:06.404]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[02:05:06.404 --> 02:05:17.850]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:24.174]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this
[02:05:24.534 --> 02:05:24.874]  I think?
[02:05:44.481 --> 02:05:45.302]  We're good to go.
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.501]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:02.501 --> 02:06:09.125]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:09.125 --> 02:06:12.266]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:12.266 --> 02:06:22.052]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:06:22.052 --> 02:06:22.892]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.892 --> 02:06:27.975]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.975 --> 02:06:30.076]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:30.376 --> 02:06:33.518]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:33.518 --> 02:06:38.660]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:46.724]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.724 --> 02:06:54.608]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:54.608 --> 02:06:59.410]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[02:07:01.311 --> 02:07:06.814]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:07:06.814 --> 02:07:07.634]  I take this.
[02:07:07.634 --> 02:07:08.775]  My family takes this.
[02:07:08.775 --> 02:07:13.057]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:07:13.057 --> 02:07:17.519]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:07:17.659 --> 02:07:22.301]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:23.422]  I don't feel good.
[02:07:23.422 --> 02:07:27.184]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:07:27.184 --> 02:07:29.885]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:07:29.885 --> 02:07:35.668]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:07:35.668 --> 02:07:38.629]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:42.171]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:07:42.171 --> 02:07:44.412]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:07:44.412 --> 02:07:44.772]  I love it.
[02:07:44.932 --> 02:07:47.713]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:07:47.713 --> 02:07:48.734]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:48.734 --> 02:07:53.456]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine.
[02:07:53.456 --> 02:07:54.697]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:54.697 --> 02:07:56.578]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:07:56.578 --> 02:07:57.799]  It's a win-win.
[02:07:57.799 --> 02:08:00.720]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:01.620]  Paul, guess what?
[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:02.041]  What?
[02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:04.562]  We bugged Mr. Blake's sale and we heard him talking to his lawyer.
[02:08:04.562 --> 02:08:06.763]  You see, we took the mic and we hit it up in the sale window.
[02:08:06.763 --> 02:08:08.044]  Wait a minute.
[02:08:08.044 --> 02:08:09.204]  What are you talking about?
[02:08:09.204 --> 02:08:10.525]  We bugged Mr. Blake's sale.
[02:08:11.519 --> 02:08:12.459]  You what?
[02:08:12.459 --> 02:08:14.560]  We bugged the cell with Arlen's tape recorder.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.580]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:16.620]  I can't listen to that.
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:17.141]  But Paul!
[02:08:17.141 --> 02:08:18.621]  Opie, I can't listen to that.
[02:08:18.621 --> 02:08:19.981]  I'm not permitted.
[02:08:19.981 --> 02:08:21.702]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[02:08:21.702 --> 02:08:24.363]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:26.543]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[02:08:26.543 --> 02:08:28.004]  But Paul, this is different.
[02:08:28.004 --> 02:08:28.944]  Yes, it's worse.
[02:08:29.696 --> 02:08:32.998]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[02:08:32.998 --> 02:08:34.819]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[02:08:34.819 --> 02:08:38.682]  But, Paul, if you just listen to this... Opie, I can't listen.
[02:08:38.682 --> 02:08:39.942]  Paul, you're erasing the tape!
[02:08:39.942 --> 02:08:43.145]  That's what I mean to do.
[02:08:43.145 --> 02:08:47.387]  You bugged a conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[02:08:47.387 --> 02:08:51.670]  Now, that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[02:08:51.670 --> 02:08:53.851]  But, Paul... No buts.
[02:08:53.851 --> 02:08:58.234]  But if it helps the law... Opie, the law can...
[02:09:02.071 --> 02:09:05.733]  And we're back live for the next 25 minutes or so.
[02:09:05.733 --> 02:09:16.720]  Dr. Steve Pchenik, co-author with Tom Clancy, State Department, Psychological Warfare, different agencies, you name it, really smart guy, joins us because I like to get him on at least once a week for the State of the World.
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:21.222]  I don't want to make this show about ourselves, but I'll tell you this.
[02:09:21.222 --> 02:09:25.605]  It makes The Globalist really pathetic and freaks me out, quite frankly.
[02:09:27.503 --> 02:09:34.068]  That for 24 hours they ignored the big story we put out yesterday and then finally the last few hours have the new response.
[02:09:34.068 --> 02:09:41.634]  It's a hoax, it's not real, and we're bad people because we're now manipulating the stock market.
[02:09:41.634 --> 02:09:50.701]  And so this is the deep state through the Daily Beast, formerly Newsweek, trying to get the stock market not to read InfoWars.
[02:09:50.701 --> 02:09:54.444]  What do they think it does when they go tell them, don't read InfoWars?
[02:09:55.779 --> 02:10:02.103]  There was a Pentagon order after 9-11 in 2002, and I'd had Dr. Steve Pachetnik on, strangely enough, it was because of him.
[02:10:02.103 --> 02:10:07.947]  He was in the Council on Foreign Relations, helping write books with Clancy as his technical advisor.
[02:10:07.947 --> 02:10:12.190]  And they put an order out to the Marines and Army, they said, you will not listen or watch Alex Jones.
[02:10:12.190 --> 02:10:17.314]  Well, pretty soon the local non-commissioned officers watched it and would make jokes.
[02:10:17.314 --> 02:10:23.418]  They'd get up in front of the Marines or whatever, they'd say, whatever you do, you don't go to Infowars.com or listen to Alex Jones.
[02:10:23.418 --> 02:10:24.839]  Became the big joke, so we went from
[02:10:26.337 --> 02:10:29.759]  Maybe a million people a week, but we weren't that big then.
[02:10:29.759 --> 02:10:34.442]  Overnight, I was like, why do I have this Army audience, this Marine Corps audience, and intelligence agencies listening?
[02:10:34.442 --> 02:10:41.286]  Suddenly I had all the feeds from the intelligence agencies giving me stuff, all because the intelligence agencies on top said, don't look at Alex Jones.
[02:10:41.286 --> 02:10:42.847]  So quite frankly, I was never that smart.
[02:10:42.847 --> 02:10:51.312]  I said, everybody, you know, engineers and former NSA people and Dr. Sheepachinick, you know, CFR and high-level CIA, you name it, give me all the data.
[02:10:51.312 --> 02:10:53.254]  So it's not about me, it's about the platform.
[02:10:53.254 --> 02:10:54.534]  But that's what they're so scared of.
[02:10:54.534 --> 02:10:55.135]  Look at this headline.
[02:10:56.107 --> 02:10:57.828]  Bull market!
[02:10:57.828 --> 02:10:59.389]  Bull crap.
[02:10:59.389 --> 02:11:03.191]  And of course the market after $3 trillion plus from Trump and exuberance over lower taxes.
[02:11:03.191 --> 02:11:04.211]  Real intel.
[02:11:04.211 --> 02:11:10.995]  People buying more, wanting to believe in it, wanting to certify it and say that they were backing it and hiring more people.
[02:11:10.995 --> 02:11:12.216]  That's what exuberance is about.
[02:11:12.216 --> 02:11:14.597]  It's what confidence is about.
[02:11:14.597 --> 02:11:17.679]  They come out and interview all these high-level stock market people.
[02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:32.315]  And they say in here, it's true, they read Infowars, and they saw the clip from two weeks ago of Comey saying that he believed Trump hadn't done anything wrong, and that Trump never tried to influence him, and no one else did.
[02:11:32.315 --> 02:11:35.597]  So then the Daily Beast spins it, and this is the blueprint.
[02:11:35.597 --> 02:11:37.598]  Now there's a bunch of other stories doing the exact same thing.
[02:11:38.908 --> 02:11:48.453]  That I said it was a new clip, and that Comey had just come out and said Trump didn't do it, and so it was an attempt for me to manipulate the market and lie.
[02:11:48.453 --> 02:11:50.154]  No, that's not what I did, and they know it.
[02:11:50.154 --> 02:11:51.635]  They think you're stupid.
[02:11:51.635 --> 02:12:02.461]  Two months before, in February, he met with Trump, wrote this memo saying he tried to influence him, didn't tell the Justice Department, which itself is obstruction of justice, then they tried
[02:12:03.646 --> 02:12:06.629]  To then later say that he never told him this.
[02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:11.133]  I was saying that he had perjured himself and that either way he was lying.
[02:12:11.133 --> 02:12:11.974]  So how do they fix it?
[02:12:11.974 --> 02:12:14.617]  They spin it and say, Jones said it was a new clip.
[02:12:14.617 --> 02:12:15.858]  But being fake news, it wasn't.
[02:12:15.858 --> 02:12:16.999]  It was two weeks old.
[02:12:16.999 --> 02:12:23.025]  So Comey didn't say that Trump had come out and never asked him for favors because he has said it now in the memo.
[02:12:23.025 --> 02:12:25.687]  But the memo was two months plus before that!
[02:12:26.539 --> 02:12:27.699]  So they think you're stupid.
[02:12:27.699 --> 02:12:29.100]  They think you don't see this.
[02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:32.341]  Well, if you're in the Darwin Awards and don't see this, you don't count.
[02:12:32.341 --> 02:12:33.121]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:33.121 --> 02:12:42.744]  People that do have time-space continuum understanding and a context know that two months before, he writes a memo saying Trump tried to obstruct justice.
[02:12:42.744 --> 02:12:44.845]  Two months later, May 3rd, he says he didn't.
[02:12:46.089 --> 02:12:53.433]  We write a story, because listeners pointed it out, our human intelligence, you the eyes and ears, hey Alex, was the email, why haven't you covered this?
[02:12:53.433 --> 02:12:55.594]  Comey said he never tried to obstruct justice.
[02:12:55.594 --> 02:12:56.515]  I'm like, excuse me?
[02:12:56.515 --> 02:12:57.015]  I missed it.
[02:12:57.015 --> 02:12:58.536]  Thank you, listener.
[02:12:58.536 --> 02:13:00.096]  We put a big story out.
[02:13:00.096 --> 02:13:01.397]  We attacked it.
[02:13:01.397 --> 02:13:05.839]  They ignore it until today, and now the talking point is it's fake.
[02:13:05.839 --> 02:13:07.060]  It's a fake video.
[02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:10.122]  Three days ago they said it was fake, that if he didn't give Comey
[02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:15.686]  Well, you know, I'm a little confused as to who did what to whom, but the reality is, Alex, you've earned
[02:13:37.208 --> 02:13:42.911]  You've done a brilliant job of keeping the alternative right on course.
[02:13:42.911 --> 02:13:49.515]  And this grew way, way before some of the pundits said.
[02:13:49.515 --> 02:13:50.696]  This really grew out of 9-11.
[02:13:52.252 --> 02:13:53.893]  And you were essential to this.
[02:13:53.893 --> 02:13:59.214]  And that's why I have to go back to that episode and the collusion that occurred.
[02:13:59.214 --> 02:14:04.716]  Because in a way, Trump has opened up the door once again to the 9-11 crowd.
[02:14:04.716 --> 02:14:10.077]  What you're seeing here is 9-11 people on both sides of the aisle.
[02:14:10.077 --> 02:14:11.517]  You have Comey.
[02:14:11.517 --> 02:14:17.999]  He was involved as a junior individual in the Justice Department.
[02:14:17.999 --> 02:14:21.240]  You certainly have Mueller, who was very much involved.
[02:14:21.770 --> 02:14:27.594]  In 9-11, you know, the classical white Anglo-Saxon Protestant who could do no evil.
[02:14:27.594 --> 02:14:39.762]  I do congratulate him on serving in the Vietnam War, but I do not congratulate him as a director of the FBI because he tainted himself, he tainted the FBI, as did Comey and as did Freese.
[02:14:39.762 --> 02:14:46.307]  So the FBI is a marked, marked institution that really has very little value.
[02:14:46.874 --> 02:14:48.475]  We have the Secret Service.
[02:14:48.475 --> 02:14:51.737]  We have all kinds of other domestic entities.
[02:14:51.737 --> 02:14:57.941]  So one of the things that Trump did unwittingly or wittingly, he was a Trojan horse.
[02:14:57.941 --> 02:15:02.563]  He opened up the door to every one of the people who worked with Bush Jr.
[02:15:02.563 --> 02:15:06.586]  And the tip of the arrow was Elliott Abrams, John Bolton.
[02:15:06.586 --> 02:15:11.769]  Then you get a whole bunch of people who worked for Ted Cruz, Kellyanne Conway, blah, blah, blah.
[02:15:12.150 --> 02:15:13.511]  And they all receive money.
[02:15:13.511 --> 02:15:25.161]  The reality of this show, as I understand it, and as you have come forth without any explanations from the former extreme left, which has switched to the right, i.e.
[02:15:25.161 --> 02:15:34.129]  David Horowitz or the boys from Los Angeles, whom I know, you really were the speaker and the spearhead of what 9-11 is about.
[02:15:36.191 --> 02:15:50.665]  9-11 has never been forgotten by your audience and over 70% of the people now understand that everything that's being said by officials, including the President of the United States, with possible exception of Trump,
[02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:52.824]  It's becoming a lie.
[02:15:52.824 --> 02:15:56.287]  And that's the problem that we're having in the system.
[02:15:56.287 --> 02:16:00.770]  New York Times, The Washington Post, they all have been co-opted through 9-11.
[02:16:00.770 --> 02:16:02.952]  They're co-opted now.
[02:16:02.952 --> 02:16:18.503]  What we're not talking about, and this is a pretty much of a deep state diversion, which is what the intelligence system wants you and our people to do, is not to talk about the wars that have been going on in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan.
[02:16:18.897 --> 02:16:27.665]  In Africa, I have repeatedly stated that under no condition has Trump the right to send our troops into combat.
[02:16:27.665 --> 02:16:36.953]  He has neither the legal right, nor does he have the judicial or the popular right to send men into war for reasons that we don't agree with.
[02:16:37.851 --> 02:16:47.959]  And what I'm trying to say again to you, Alex, and to our people, as we're wasting trillions of dollars on generals who were involved in 9-11.
[02:16:47.959 --> 02:16:57.066]  Mattis went out there in Iraq and he did whatever he did, which isn't all that impressive to me, but he garnered his own reputation on the basis of that.
[02:16:57.066 --> 02:17:01.470]  These boys are not modest, these generals, because they like to self-inflate.
[02:17:01.954 --> 02:17:03.375]  Same thing with McMaster.
[02:17:03.375 --> 02:17:05.236]  He turned out to be a disappointment.
[02:17:05.236 --> 02:17:09.119]  But again, he inflated his own accomplishments.
[02:17:09.119 --> 02:17:17.584]  What has not been inflated is the reality that we're going to lose men and women to wars that don't belong to our national security.
[02:17:17.584 --> 02:17:18.664]  That's my next question.
[02:17:18.664 --> 02:17:20.546]  What do you make of US forces striking?
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:30.670]  Yesterday, 18 miles and a 35 mile exclusion, no go, no war zone, approaching a Shiite base supposedly.
[02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:32.933]  Let me tell you what I'm making of this.
[02:17:32.933 --> 02:17:38.098]  And I said it to you before, but I don't expect you to kind of absorb it right away.
[02:17:38.098 --> 02:17:39.180]  Not because you can't.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.922]  I've said it repeatedly.
[02:17:41.922 --> 02:17:53.532]  If the CIA created another war, which they are doing in Syria, and I've had the good fortune and misfortune to have been interrogated by Bashar Assad's own people and security,
[02:17:54.193 --> 02:18:06.004]  And I was kept intact and for 18 days I traveled around the country to report back to my intelligence individuals that this was not a regime you want to play with.
[02:18:06.004 --> 02:18:08.487]  And the reason I said that... No, no, it's sunk in.
[02:18:08.487 --> 02:18:08.947]  I'm not dumb.
[02:18:08.947 --> 02:18:10.368]  You're saying they're dug in.
[02:18:10.368 --> 02:18:11.810]  But I'm saying something else.
[02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:16.795]  What I'm saying is there should be no American soldiers on the ground and I will tell you why.
[02:18:17.665 --> 02:18:25.929]  Hezbollah, which has been already recognized as a quasi-legitimate entity, as was Hamas and as was PLO.
[02:18:25.929 --> 02:18:27.789]  They are in the real estate business.
[02:18:27.789 --> 02:18:30.671]  They are incredible businessmen in Lebanon.
[02:18:30.671 --> 02:18:42.136]  But you do not mess with young men, 8,000 of whom have been in combat day in and day out for seven years because you're only 10 minutes away from their house in Lebanon.
[02:18:42.136 --> 02:18:47.018]  In other words, you've got to look at these Hezbollah fighters as we did patriots.
[02:18:47.498 --> 02:18:55.563]  I'm not saying they're great people, I'm saying these are young men who are willing to fight and kill to make sure that we don't get into their territory.
[02:18:55.563 --> 02:18:58.324]  And Syria comes close to Lebanon.
[02:18:58.324 --> 02:19:05.228]  On top of that, we have never... No, and as a patriot you're saying we shouldn't be there backing a bunch of jihadis to take over a country that didn't attack us.
[02:19:05.228 --> 02:19:06.409]  We shouldn't be attacking anybody.
[02:19:06.409 --> 02:19:10.551]  This is a war created by our CIA, our military... To overthrow Assad.
[02:19:10.551 --> 02:19:13.613]  So we shouldn't be there, but the argument is get rid of Assad.
[02:19:13.613 --> 02:19:14.814]  So why are you saying I wouldn't get that?
[02:19:15.609 --> 02:19:17.111]  No, I didn't say you wouldn't get that.
[02:19:17.111 --> 02:19:21.136]  I said from day one, we shouldn't have been Saddam Hussein, throw him out.
[02:19:21.136 --> 02:19:22.458]  We shouldn't have been taking Noriega.
[02:19:22.458 --> 02:19:24.060]  Well, you were saying in general people wouldn't get it.
[02:19:25.029 --> 02:19:27.989]  That's correct, and nobody's saying anything about it.
[02:19:27.989 --> 02:19:33.230]  I don't hear one word about the fact that we are spending trillions of dollars... No, I agree, but we've got to come back from break.
[02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:38.691]  I'm asking you then, why do you think this convoy got blown up 18 miles from some Shiite base?
[02:19:38.691 --> 02:19:43.152]  Because the convoy was just a target of opportunity.
[02:19:43.152 --> 02:19:47.793]  And what I'm saying is that the Shiites basically are going to defeat us.
[02:19:47.793 --> 02:19:49.593]  I'm going to say it repeatedly.
[02:19:49.593 --> 02:19:51.173]  You have the irrevolutionary... No, I understand.
[02:19:51.173 --> 02:19:54.654]  So we just blew up a convoy going up against the Shiites, or is that intel wrong?
[02:19:55.807 --> 02:19:58.208]  The intel isn't relevant anymore.
[02:19:58.208 --> 02:20:01.330]  What I'm trying to say is... Again, it's all just a big monkey, you know what?

[02:24:10.693 --> 02:24:18.839]  Alright, Steve McShannock, SteveMcShannock.com is our guest for one more segment.
[02:24:18.839 --> 02:24:25.765]  Paul Watson put out an article this morning that shows New Yorker Magazine, Atlantic Monthly,
[02:24:27.253 --> 02:24:32.996]  All the blue blood East Coast establishment people saying, we don't want impeachment.
[02:24:32.996 --> 02:24:36.838]  No, no, we want the whole election overturned, something new.
[02:24:36.838 --> 02:24:40.180]  And all the Republicans that were elected out, people say, oh, that's crazy.
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:42.781]  They'll never do it.
[02:24:42.781 --> 02:24:51.085]  I was told yesterday that Congressman Peter Schiff is going to come out and call for backing off impeachment now because they want the whole thing.
[02:24:51.085 --> 02:24:52.046]  They believe they have the media.
[02:24:52.887 --> 02:24:54.088]  They believe they have the foreign banks.
[02:24:54.088 --> 02:25:04.496]  They believe they have a lot of Republicans that don't want to be removed in this witch hunt because they're already blackmailed for having sex with their interns and worse.
[02:25:04.496 --> 02:25:09.820]  So the story is top Republicans coup attempt against Trump being led by GOP insiders.
[02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:12.082]  I've had the headline out today.
[02:25:12.082 --> 02:25:16.125]  Democrats openly announcing they want to overturn election and have a new one.
[02:25:17.446 --> 02:25:21.789]  In their own intelligentsia publications, they're selling that idea.
[02:25:21.789 --> 02:25:23.911]  It's not just confidence building to get donations.
[02:25:23.911 --> 02:25:24.811]  They're doing it.
[02:25:24.811 --> 02:25:25.632]  They mean it.
[02:25:25.632 --> 02:25:29.274]  And if we're so passive and so weak, I think they'll push it.
[02:25:29.274 --> 02:25:30.996]  Steve Pachetnik, what do you think about that?
[02:25:30.996 --> 02:25:33.557]  What do you think Trump needs to do to stop this?
[02:25:36.058 --> 02:25:39.440]  I think one of the things he has to do is what I said a long time ago.
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.202]  Number one, he has no reason to have the press in the White House.
[02:25:43.202 --> 02:25:44.662]  He can do whatever he wants.
[02:25:44.662 --> 02:25:49.525]  You've been saying that for a year, before he even got elected, and now he's saying, maybe I should kick him out.
[02:25:49.525 --> 02:25:56.408]  Well, you know, Trump had very good instincts from day one, and he had to rely on a lot of people whom he couldn't trust.
[02:25:56.408 --> 02:25:59.590]  Many of them were Republicans who came out of the Heritage Foundation.
[02:26:00.276 --> 02:26:05.599]  He never really reached into our group, into the alternative media group.
[02:26:05.599 --> 02:26:11.603]  I mean, Breitbart was perhaps one of it, but Steve Bannon came in pretty late.
[02:26:11.603 --> 02:26:13.844]  And he's been isolated from the beginning.
[02:26:14.528 --> 02:26:28.239]  Well, yes, but the reality is Trump has to wake up to realize that it was we, you, me, and a bunch of others, who from very early on, we were looking for a candidate, and we chose him.
[02:26:28.239 --> 02:26:34.404]  Now, if he opens up the door, and I said it's the Trojan horse, and he picks Republicans who are in the Bush Jr.
[02:26:34.404 --> 02:26:36.545]  administration, he's self-destructing.
[02:26:36.545 --> 02:26:37.266]  And he's starting to do it.
[02:26:38.291 --> 02:26:50.820]  Well, the one thing I was against, and quite frankly, I was going to say it earlier, but I didn't have the time and it was nothing to do with you, is I was going to write that Trump should not have gone on a foreign affairs trip.
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:56.485]  There's no reason for him to go to Italy or Belgium or Israel or Saudi Arabia now.
[02:26:56.485 --> 02:26:58.286]  It does nothing for him.
[02:26:58.286 --> 02:27:00.988]  If anything, it leaves it behind.
[02:27:00.988 --> 02:27:04.811]  The king has left and you've got four or five generals sitting at home.
[02:27:05.331 --> 02:27:07.812]  Just waiting to see what would happen.
[02:27:07.812 --> 02:27:15.214]  During that period of 9 to 14 days, in any other era, there would have been a de facto military coup.
[02:27:15.214 --> 02:27:20.715]  Now, I'm not saying there is one, I'm just saying, historically, that's what happens.
[02:27:20.715 --> 02:27:26.277]  At the same time, as much as he thinks he's in control from afar, he's not.
[02:27:26.277 --> 02:27:27.357]  He's not even... No, I got it.
[02:27:27.357 --> 02:27:31.298]  He thinks he's changing the subject, but they've already launched this thing before he left.
[02:27:31.934 --> 02:27:33.495]  Way before he left.
[02:27:33.495 --> 02:27:36.056]  And it's not coming just from the liberals or the Democrats.
[02:27:36.056 --> 02:27:36.856]  So that's what you're saying.
[02:27:36.856 --> 02:27:38.276]  I had that feeling a few days ago.
[02:27:38.276 --> 02:27:42.738]  They're heating this up before he leaves to pull something while he's gone.
[02:27:42.738 --> 02:27:44.258]  You hit it, Alex.
[02:27:44.258 --> 02:27:50.481]  And one of the reasons why I wanted to come on the show now was to tell him, but it's a little late, not to go overseas.
[02:27:50.481 --> 02:27:52.942]  That is a very bad decision.
[02:27:52.942 --> 02:27:56.223]  It's a very poor strategic choice.
[02:27:56.223 --> 02:27:57.883]  The Saudis don't need $110 billion worth of
[02:27:59.964 --> 02:28:00.985]  Lockheed Martin.
[02:28:00.985 --> 02:28:05.269]  Right now what we need is a consolidation of power in the White House.
[02:28:05.269 --> 02:28:10.473]  Get rid of all the Republicans who came in through the Ryan factory.
[02:28:10.473 --> 02:28:12.795]  By the way, even Rupert Murdoch has flipped to Trump.
[02:28:12.795 --> 02:28:16.158]  I guess feeling sorry for him and told him that Sunday.
[02:28:16.158 --> 02:28:18.720]  Everybody's telling him, fire everybody, don't leave.
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:19.441]  But he still did it.
[02:28:20.586 --> 02:28:22.328]  Well, I agree with Rupert.
[02:28:22.328 --> 02:28:23.870]  I mean, I don't know Rupert Murdoch.
[02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:28.496]  I knew Roger Ailes, and I've tracked Rupert Murdoch, and I have respect for his business acumen.
[02:28:28.496 --> 02:28:30.218]  But if you want to be in control...
[02:28:31.007 --> 02:28:37.790]  You know, trust is good, but as Zizinski, the father of the KGB or the NKVD said, control is better.
[02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:41.892]  And one thing Trump is not doing, he's not in control.
[02:28:41.892 --> 02:28:45.493]  And that's one of the reasons why he feels very anxious.
[02:28:45.493 --> 02:28:50.596]  He's got his son-in-law who really doesn't offer anything and is acting as an intercessor.
[02:28:50.596 --> 02:28:51.936]  Very weak.
[02:28:51.936 --> 02:28:52.697]  Very weak.
[02:28:52.697 --> 02:28:55.918]  He's got a daughter who, you know, his lovely daughter, but very weak.
[02:28:56.298 --> 02:28:58.540]  You got Reince Priebus, very weak.
[02:28:58.540 --> 02:29:00.261]  You've got Spicer, very weak.
[02:29:00.261 --> 02:29:02.042]  Kellyanne Conway, very weak.
[02:29:02.042 --> 02:29:08.327]  By the way, he's rejected all their Supreme Court people, all their new federal judges, their new FBI.
[02:29:08.327 --> 02:29:09.708]  Who should he appoint those positions?
[02:29:09.708 --> 02:29:11.489]  Or is that putting the cart before the horse?
[02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:18.395]  The Supreme Court and the FBI is secondary to the fact of, let's look at Nixon.
[02:29:18.395 --> 02:29:30.606]  Despite the fact that he had been ill and he was out of power and we had a soft coup, I have to commend Henry Kissinger for having created a group of us to maintain the stability at a time when we
[02:29:30.606 --> 02:29:34.827]  I'll tell you what, let's talk about what happened back then when that coup took place and what you did.
[02:29:34.827 --> 02:29:37.987]  Because it's true, people criticize me for saying Trump's good at having Kissinger there.
[02:29:37.987 --> 02:29:42.248]  Kissinger behind the scenes actually wants to make a deal with Russia, doesn't want a war with China.
[02:29:42.248 --> 02:29:45.129]  As bad as he's been in the past, he's nothing compared to current globalists.
[02:29:45.129 --> 02:29:46.009]  At least he knows the players.
[02:29:46.009 --> 02:29:49.650]  Let's talk about that and the way out for Trump and America straight ahead.
[02:29:49.650 --> 02:29:53.250]  On the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.249 --> 02:30:06.491]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[02:30:06.491 --> 02:30:17.934]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[02:30:17.934 --> 02:30:23.996]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at

[02:32:23.706 --> 02:32:27.589]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[02:33:03.346 --> 02:33:04.206]  The British are coming!
[02:33:04.206 --> 02:33:07.028]  The British are coming!
[02:33:07.028 --> 02:33:24.495]  Now the ride of Paul Revere Set the nation on its ear And the shock at Lexington Heard round the world When the British fired in the early dawn The war of independence had begun The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled
[02:33:26.238 --> 02:33:51.470]  And on to Concord, marched the foe To seize the arsenal, there you know Waiting folks, searching all around Till our militia stopped them in their tracks At the old North Bridge, we turned them back To chase those Redcoats back to Boston Town And a shout around the world Was the start of the revolution The men, men were ready on the move
[02:33:57.088 --> 02:34:11.078]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they'd put a light up in this high church steeple, and Paul went down there to look.
[02:34:16.303 --> 02:34:19.825]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out.
[02:34:19.825 --> 02:34:23.086]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[02:34:23.086 --> 02:34:24.527]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[02:34:24.527 --> 02:34:33.251]  That old horse with his ears laid back and his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine, feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[02:34:33.251 --> 02:34:36.872]  Paul holding on for dear life and a hollering at the top of his lungs.
[02:34:36.872 --> 02:34:38.513]  He says, the British is coming!
[02:34:38.513 --> 02:34:39.794]  The British is coming!
[02:34:39.794 --> 02:34:42.255]  Get your gun, we gonna have us a revolution!
[02:34:43.098 --> 02:34:47.661]  And them farmers come a-piling out of the hay like bees out of beehive.
[02:34:47.661 --> 02:34:49.042]  Minute men, they's called.
[02:34:49.042 --> 02:34:50.283]  What's minute mean?
[02:34:50.283 --> 02:34:51.384]  Minute men?
[02:34:51.384 --> 02:34:53.806]  They's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[02:34:53.806 --> 02:35:02.232]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[02:35:02.232 --> 02:35:09.497]  And when the British come a-prancing along all dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it.
[02:35:09.497 --> 02:35:10.818]  It was a sight to see.
[02:35:12.452 --> 02:35:14.053]  And then it happened.
[02:35:14.053 --> 02:35:15.693]  They fired the gun!
[02:35:15.693 --> 02:35:17.694]  They fired the gun.
[02:35:17.694 --> 02:35:23.817]  And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[02:35:23.817 --> 02:35:27.378]  Oh, get out!
[02:35:27.378 --> 02:35:28.639]  That's the way this country started.
[02:35:35.421 --> 02:35:38.762]  All right, we're back live.
[02:35:38.762 --> 02:35:40.863]  No one can deny this country's in a crisis.
[02:35:40.863 --> 02:35:43.904]  No one can deny that special interests are arrogant and out of control.
[02:35:43.904 --> 02:35:59.569]  And I want to ask Dr. Steve Pichetting, here in closing, if we look at where Trump is, we look at the attacks, we look at where the whole world's going, hell, I'd ask you one question to stay over and I forget what it was, but there's just so much to cover here.
[02:35:59.569 --> 02:36:01.810]  What should people know about this historical time we're alive in?
[02:36:03.123 --> 02:36:07.365]  Number one, Trump has to understand he has to get in control of the White House.
[02:36:07.365 --> 02:36:09.727]  Number one, he should fire everybody there.
[02:36:09.727 --> 02:36:11.988]  Number two, get rid of the newspaper.
[02:36:11.988 --> 02:36:18.772]  Number three, bring in Newt Gingrich, who understands how, uh, I said Hollywood, but it's about the same.
[02:36:18.772 --> 02:36:20.312]  He understands the party.
[02:36:20.312 --> 02:36:22.013]  He understands what has to be done.
[02:36:22.013 --> 02:36:23.494]  He's effective.
[02:36:23.494 --> 02:36:30.558]  At the same time, bring in guys like myself and others who've literally, we've chopped down agencies and we leave.
[02:36:30.558 --> 02:36:31.558]  We don't stay there.
[02:36:31.558 --> 02:36:32.399]  We don't get paid.
[02:36:32.939 --> 02:36:35.201]  We don't get honorariums.
[02:36:35.201 --> 02:36:36.443]  We're not part of the news.
[02:36:36.443 --> 02:36:43.369]  What I get called in for is to take down an institution, reorganize it, and it doesn't exist anymore.
[02:36:43.369 --> 02:36:45.091]  And that's what this country needs.
[02:36:45.091 --> 02:36:47.453]  If we don't do that, we're lost.
[02:36:47.453 --> 02:36:48.994]  Look at the arrogance of these bureaucracies.
[02:36:48.994 --> 02:36:51.417]  The question I had, I remember now, was Kissinger.
[02:36:51.417 --> 02:36:52.578]  Kissinger's done a lot of bad stuff.
[02:36:52.578 --> 02:36:53.699]  Big globalist.
[02:36:53.699 --> 02:36:55.601]  But he even knows we don't want war with China.
[02:36:56.101 --> 02:36:58.824]  Well, I don't have a problem with it.
[02:36:58.824 --> 02:36:59.704]  I worked for Henry Kissinger.
[02:36:59.704 --> 02:37:03.688]  I had my differences, but one thing you've got to say about Henry, number one, he was in counterintelligence.
[02:37:03.688 --> 02:37:05.590]  Number two, he served our military.
[02:37:20.843 --> 02:37:25.086]  Unlike the neocons, number three, he knows the world extremely well.
[02:37:25.086 --> 02:37:36.677]  Number four, he was exceedingly popular at a time when we needed a man who could take over for the fact that Nixon was ill and actually Kissinger's greatest contribution to our history.
[02:37:37.139 --> 02:37:46.804]  Is that during a time when we didn't have a president of the United States, he stood very tall and strong and made certain that the Chinese and the Russians couldn't take advantage of us.
[02:37:46.804 --> 02:37:48.865]  We don't have that opportunity right now.
[02:37:48.865 --> 02:38:00.651]  That's why I was glad to see Henry Kissinger counsel Trump, because despite all the other issues, and I was against it, I was against the war in Vietnam, but nevertheless, I participated.
[02:38:00.651 --> 02:38:02.772]  He still was a brilliant strategic
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:09.463]  Analyst, and he was very effective in implementing something for a brilliant president, who was Nixon.
[02:38:09.463 --> 02:38:15.707]  And despite what happened to Nixon, you cannot take away the achievements that he accrued.
[02:38:15.707 --> 02:38:21.690]  And thanks to Frank Kissinger and his staff, he had one of the most brilliant staff I'd ever seen.
[02:38:21.690 --> 02:38:26.853]  Winston Lord in China, Chas Freeman, a whole bunch of guys who were never called back.
[02:38:27.443 --> 02:38:30.126]  And when you have somebody, you know, they're still out there.
[02:38:30.126 --> 02:38:37.192]  The Foreign Service officers who served us exceedingly well, they're retired, but there's no reason not to go back to them.
[02:38:37.192 --> 02:38:38.614]  I'm not talking about myself.
[02:38:38.614 --> 02:38:44.840]  I'm talking about Frank Wisner, who was our ambassador to Egypt, and we called him in when we needed him.
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:46.581]  Obama didn't know how to use him.
[02:38:46.581 --> 02:38:49.184]  A man like Chas Freeman, who came under the Bush Jr.
[02:38:49.184 --> 02:38:49.945]  administration.
[02:38:50.445 --> 02:38:56.947]  And the Jews, or as Jim said, got rid of him because they didn't feel he was pro-Israel?
[02:38:56.947 --> 02:38:58.287]  That's nonsense!
[02:38:58.287 --> 02:39:02.548]  We have a lot of talented people who are considered... Sure, bottom line, and then I'm going to end this.
[02:39:02.548 --> 02:39:06.710]  We've got our next guest here, Dr. Steve Schenkel, but everything you're saying is obviously historically important.
[02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:08.490]  Why are the elites so against Trump?
[02:39:08.490 --> 02:39:12.731]  That endears me to him, but I see the economy booing under Trump.
[02:39:12.731 --> 02:39:18.493]  I see major newspapers mad that we're trying to prop Trump up, saying, it's Jones's fault the stock market didn't plunge.
[02:39:19.073 --> 02:39:21.494]  And I'm like, it's a cartoon.
[02:39:21.494 --> 02:39:23.614]  I would write that to discredit myself.
[02:39:23.614 --> 02:39:27.036]  They're openly trying to crash the stock market?
[02:39:27.036 --> 02:39:30.237]  No, what's happening is they're intimidated by you.
[02:39:30.237 --> 02:39:32.117]  They're intimidated by what we say.
[02:39:32.117 --> 02:39:34.558]  They can't get a control on any of this.
[02:39:35.046 --> 02:39:35.926]  That's a current.
[02:39:35.926 --> 02:39:38.848]  This did not occur through the mainstream media, i.e.
[02:39:38.848 --> 02:39:41.489]  the mainstream media is no longer in existence.
[02:39:41.489 --> 02:39:43.530]  It is neither mainstream nor is it media.
[02:39:43.530 --> 02:39:45.571]  It's a ghost.
[02:39:45.571 --> 02:39:48.412]  Well, it's not only a ghost, it's a dead entity.
[02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:51.454]  And it's kind of cringing from the grave.
[02:39:51.454 --> 02:39:54.675]  It's billions of dollars went underneath the post.
[02:39:54.675 --> 02:39:56.856]  All the iconic papers have gone.
[02:39:56.856 --> 02:39:58.397]  They're all propped up by drug dealers.
[02:39:59.312 --> 02:40:01.774]  Yeah, well in that case it's Slim, that's the case.
[02:40:01.774 --> 02:40:04.876]  But it's Bezos in one case, it's another issue in another.
[02:40:04.876 --> 02:40:06.717]  Well that's a CIA contract!
[02:40:06.717 --> 02:40:08.138]  What a scandal!
[02:40:08.138 --> 02:40:11.340]  The Washington Post is paid for with a taxpayer contract?
[02:40:12.312 --> 02:40:13.292]  That's correct.
[02:40:13.292 --> 02:40:16.373]  But the CIA underwrites a lot of other stuff.
[02:40:16.373 --> 02:40:17.553]  We don't want to get into that.
[02:40:17.553 --> 02:40:20.213]  I don't want to get caught in the CIA Machiavellian.
[02:40:20.213 --> 02:40:23.994]  What I want to say basically is, Alex, you have to continue on.
[02:40:23.994 --> 02:40:28.215]  We have what we have, and basically Trump has to listen.
[02:40:28.215 --> 02:40:30.275]  He's either in control or he's not.
[02:40:30.275 --> 02:40:31.696]  There will be no excuses.
[02:40:31.696 --> 02:40:39.017]  If he cannot garner control, namely get rid of everybody, that he doesn't feel comfortable... By the way, all the experts are telling him that.
[02:40:40.182 --> 02:40:42.525]  They're always saying, get rid of everybody.
[02:40:42.525 --> 02:40:51.818]  It doesn't take a psychiatrist to say, look, Trump, you came in on your instincts, you're going to come out on your instincts, or you're going to regret the fact that you didn't trust your instincts.
[02:40:51.818 --> 02:40:54.262]  But you shouldn't be- Come back with your shields or on it.
[02:40:55.302 --> 02:40:56.383]  That's correct.
[02:40:56.383 --> 02:40:58.204]  He's going to lose it one way or the other.
[02:40:58.204 --> 02:41:04.828]  There are those of us who are willing to come in for nothing and just do what we have to do for the Republican League.
[02:41:04.828 --> 02:41:12.354]  Those are the ones who are loyal to him, not the ones who get millions of dollars from the Mercers or the Super PACs, all that nonsense.
[02:41:12.354 --> 02:41:18.198]  Yeah, there's those of us that aren't sociopaths that actually care about the idea versus a sociopath.
[02:41:18.198 --> 02:41:18.878]  This is incredible.
[02:41:18.878 --> 02:41:20.199]  All right, stevepchenik.com.
[02:41:20.199 --> 02:41:21.080]  Thank you so much, Doc.
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:21.420]  Amazing.
[02:41:22.031 --> 02:41:26.735]  You keep going and have the sense of humor that you've always had and keep attacking.
[02:41:26.735 --> 02:41:27.436]  I will, brother.
[02:41:27.436 --> 02:41:28.076]  I will do it.
[02:41:28.076 --> 02:41:33.141]  I just want to have a prosperous free market country and a future for my kids and not a bunch of scum running things.
[02:41:33.141 --> 02:41:35.403]  We're going to play this clip and then go to our next guest.
[02:41:35.403 --> 02:41:37.625]  Paul Watson has a video out that went viral.
[02:41:37.625 --> 02:41:41.188]  Like 10 million views total.
[02:41:41.188 --> 02:41:49.495]  Of just last week, a guy has a sign saying we should support free speech and he's by 10 Downing Street and Black Lives Matter and these Muslim groups, they all beat him up.
[02:41:51.598 --> 02:41:53.740]  I played that yesterday.
[02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:55.381]  And the police stand there while they get beat up.
[02:41:55.381 --> 02:42:01.146]  Well, I'll play this clip and then go to him.
[02:42:01.146 --> 02:42:09.733]  You've got Tommy Robinson ambushed for confronting a Muslim counselor who did represent and support, reportedly, pedophiles.
[02:42:09.733 --> 02:42:17.659]  You've got these cases in the council houses, the government estates, you know, the Section 8 housing, where the Muslims are just raping everybody and it's covered up.
[02:42:17.659 --> 02:42:20.382]  It happens here, it happens in Europe, it happens everywhere.
[02:42:21.564 --> 02:42:28.955]  So Tommy, a prominent nationalist in England, used to be on the outside, now people really respect him, everything he said came true.
[02:42:28.955 --> 02:42:32.160]  He goes down there to try to go to the offices of this guy and talk.
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:34.904]  They attack him and beat their car up and knock their windows out.
[02:42:35.865 --> 02:42:37.246]  This is so incredible.
[02:42:37.246 --> 02:42:42.069]  And I watched the police while these Islamists and others beat up people outside 10 Downing Street.
[02:42:42.069 --> 02:42:45.091]  They're like there to serve this.
[02:42:45.091 --> 02:42:48.353]  Imagine what it's like being there with the Muslims above the law.
[02:42:48.353 --> 02:42:50.294]  So here's the Tommy Robinson video.
[02:42:50.294 --> 02:42:52.395]  I had to go up on the pavement.
[02:42:52.395 --> 02:42:53.336]  Yeah, let's roll that video.
[02:42:53.336 --> 02:42:53.956]  Go ahead.
[02:42:53.956 --> 02:42:57.418]  ...times where they tried to block me and prevent the vote.
[02:42:57.418 --> 02:42:59.219]  So you'll see the video anyway.
[02:42:59.219 --> 02:43:03.862]  But the worrying thing is the links that the council has with the gangs, the street level gangs.
[02:43:07.796 --> 02:43:08.897]  We were in Rochdale.
[02:43:08.897 --> 02:43:11.058]  We were in Rochdale to see Councillor Hussain.
[02:43:11.058 --> 02:43:12.438]  He's a Labour councillor.
[02:43:12.438 --> 02:43:19.361]  You've all watched the documentary for Free Girls, which shows the rape and prostitution of a generation of kids in Rochdale by Muslim gangs.
[02:43:19.361 --> 02:43:24.164]  Councillor Hussain went to court to defend and give a character reference for one of those men.
[02:43:24.904 --> 02:43:29.307]  Who is now convicted and in prison as part of a gang who raped 98 young English kids.
[02:43:29.307 --> 02:43:31.268]  He's still part of the Labour Party.
[02:43:31.268 --> 02:43:34.351]  We went there to ask him and to tell him he has to resign.
[02:43:34.351 --> 02:43:37.052]  Out of respect to the victims, he has to resign.
[02:43:37.052 --> 02:43:39.274]  He cannot be involved in British politics.
[02:43:39.274 --> 02:43:41.916]  When we got there to see Councillor Usain, there were cars waiting.
[02:43:43.027 --> 02:43:44.268]  Straight away they tried to block the road.
[02:43:44.268 --> 02:43:45.008]  There was four cars.
[02:43:45.008 --> 02:43:45.808]  They tried to block the road.
[02:43:45.808 --> 02:43:49.310]  Unfortunately our camera wasn't even rolling because we hadn't even got out of the car.
[02:43:49.310 --> 02:43:50.411]  So they tried to block the road.
[02:43:50.411 --> 02:43:52.632]  I had to go up on the pavement to get away.
[02:43:52.632 --> 02:43:55.493]  Then you'll see, in the footage you'll see, that's where it starts.
[02:43:55.493 --> 02:43:58.875]  Where I pull up, a car pulls up next to me and I ask them, why are you trying to block the road?
[02:43:58.875 --> 02:44:00.255]  Why are you trying to block us in?
[02:44:00.255 --> 02:44:02.056]  Why are you all jumping out of cars?
[02:44:02.056 --> 02:44:04.737]  At that point you'll see our car window was smashed.
[02:44:04.737 --> 02:44:06.058]  I then drove on.
[02:44:06.058 --> 02:44:08.099]  You'll see another young Muslim try and punch through the window.
[02:44:09.877 --> 02:44:14.460]  And then we've been proceeding in a bit of a car chase with some cars full of Muslims.
[02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:15.301]  That's pretty much it.
[02:44:15.301 --> 02:44:18.482]  And then there was a little bit of ramming on the road as well.
[02:44:18.482 --> 02:44:20.984]  So, this doesn't change anything.
[02:44:20.984 --> 02:44:26.988]  Councillor Hussein, if you think that you can get your street gangs, and this is the worrying thing for me, is that
[02:44:27.779 --> 02:44:35.303]  You have street-level gangs who are drug dealers, and who are pimping and prostituting young English girls, and then you have Labour representatives going to court.
[02:44:35.303 --> 02:44:38.805]  The ex-mayor, who is a Muslim, went to court to defend these gangs.
[02:44:38.805 --> 02:44:42.847]  And when we go up to question them as journalists, who comes out to attack us?
[02:44:42.847 --> 02:44:44.988]  All the gangs, all the street-level gangs.
[02:44:44.988 --> 02:44:50.931]  So that cooperation between the political leaders in the Islamic community and the gangs is a big worry, and it should be a big worry for everyone.
[02:44:51.391 --> 02:44:55.256]  But it doesn't change much because Councillor Hussain, I'm going to find you.
[02:44:55.256 --> 02:44:57.339]  You're going to end up on Rebel TV.
[02:44:57.339 --> 02:44:58.941]  Everyone's going to see your face.
[02:44:58.941 --> 02:45:03.447]  Everyone's going to see who you are and you're going to have to answer the questions I asked you.
[02:45:03.447 --> 02:45:05.490]  Asking you why you defended Peter Fowles.
[02:45:05.490 --> 02:45:06.551]  Why you defended these men.
[02:45:07.572 --> 02:45:13.134]  And the easiest solution for you, the easiest thing for you to do, Councillor Hussain, would be to resign.
[02:45:13.134 --> 02:45:16.055]  Because if you don't resign, we're not going to let up.
[02:45:16.055 --> 02:45:19.977]  And anyone who wants to see this, firehussain.com is a website.
[02:45:19.977 --> 02:45:22.558]  You can sign a petition, get behind this, support it.
[02:45:22.558 --> 02:45:25.039]  If you want to help those young girls and help make sure it never happens again,
[02:45:25.319 --> 02:45:28.521]  Now Tommy Robinson has a lot of courage to go out there and put up with that and to deal with that.
[02:45:52.537 --> 02:45:53.677]  We're lining him up right now.
[02:45:53.677 --> 02:45:56.238]  Skype was just breaking up.
[02:45:56.238 --> 02:46:00.260]  We have these open Western societies that are about inclusiveness.
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:02.001]  That's where we want to live.
[02:46:02.001 --> 02:46:05.222]  They use our strength against us and say, oh, you're not open.
[02:46:05.222 --> 02:46:06.202]  You should put up with this.
[02:46:06.202 --> 02:46:11.224]  And it's truly numeric to see this.
[02:46:11.224 --> 02:46:15.606]  So as soon as we get Tommy on, we'll talk to him about this.
[02:46:15.606 --> 02:46:18.727]  But I want to play a couple of clips here.
[02:46:18.727 --> 02:46:20.148]  We have Lavaroth,
[02:46:21.553 --> 02:46:24.114]  Russian Foreign Minister on Syria convoy strike.
[02:46:24.114 --> 02:46:27.855]  We're going to cover that, but we've got Mr. Robinson right now.
[02:46:27.855 --> 02:46:36.037]  Tommy Robinson joins us via Skype to talk about being attacked, going to the Member of Parliament's house, who's been connected to all of this.
[02:46:36.037 --> 02:46:37.077]  Wow, this is crazy.
[02:46:37.077 --> 02:46:40.838]  You've got a lot of courage, my friend.
[02:46:40.838 --> 02:46:41.798]  Tommy, you've got a lot of courage.
[02:46:41.798 --> 02:46:42.918]  Tell us what happened.
[02:46:42.918 --> 02:46:44.399]  Oh, hi Alex.
[02:46:44.399 --> 02:46:49.140]  So, there's been a documentary this week about the city of Rochdale.
[02:46:49.921 --> 02:47:02.496]  Now in Rochdale you had 48 young English girls that were identified and masses of Muslim men that were basically taking them off their families.
[02:47:02.496 --> 02:47:05.159]  The social services did nothing, the police did nothing.
[02:47:05.159 --> 02:47:06.100]  Kidnapped!
[02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:09.524]  So the cover-up's imploding of the giant kidnapping sex ring?
[02:47:10.450 --> 02:47:11.110]  Massive.
[02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:12.850]  At an unbelievable level.
[02:47:12.850 --> 02:47:20.072]  Now, when these men got to court... So, when the girls went to the police, first of all, in 2009, they were not believed.
[02:47:20.072 --> 02:47:24.632]  Not that they weren't believed, but they were trying to hide it, so they didn't prosecute the men.
[02:47:24.632 --> 02:47:31.994]  So then, finally, they go again in 2012, with the support of other people, and they get the charges against these men.
[02:47:31.994 --> 02:47:34.134]  These men are then taken to court.
[02:47:34.134 --> 02:47:39.035]  Now, the local Labour councillor and the ex-Muslim mayor, both Muslims,
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:49.626]  When these young girls were in court, their local political representatives went to court not to support them or help the girls.
[02:47:49.626 --> 02:47:56.049]  They went to court to say what great men the Muslims were.
[02:47:56.049 --> 02:48:01.873]  This one Labour councillor, so he was the man who got this taxi driver
[02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:07.532]  His license from the council, he went as a reference to get him his license.
[02:48:07.532 --> 02:48:19.478]  Once the Muslim man got his taxi license, he then used that taxi to ferry and traffic all these young white English girls around the country to other gangs of Muslim men to rape them.
[02:48:19.478 --> 02:48:31.105]  Now, this is a sad... Then this man, when he's now in... These men are now in jail, but the Labour councillor went to court to say what a great man he was, what a lovely bloke he was, how he's known him for all these years.
[02:48:32.743 --> 02:48:34.485]  No, he hasn't had to resign.
[02:48:34.485 --> 02:48:35.485]  He hasn't quit.
[02:48:35.485 --> 02:48:36.766]  He's still in power.
[02:48:36.766 --> 02:48:39.669]  In fact, he's been given a promotion.
[02:48:39.669 --> 02:48:41.150]  He's been given a promotion.
[02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:41.290]  Wow.
[02:48:42.938 --> 02:48:44.139]  And this is now our political system.
[02:48:44.139 --> 02:48:45.660]  That's what people have to understand.
[02:48:45.660 --> 02:48:46.801]  But they've got a problem.
[02:48:46.801 --> 02:48:53.126]  They've gone from calling you a racist and all this made up stuff 10 years ago to this is now a big fact because the Muslims are going crazy.
[02:48:53.126 --> 02:48:56.189]  And I'm sad for the Muslims living under their own oppressive assistance.
[02:48:56.189 --> 02:48:58.510]  But I mean, you know, we're against it obviously.
[02:48:58.510 --> 02:49:00.332]  Like we're against the Nazis or whatever.
[02:49:00.332 --> 02:49:02.614]  So what's the point it's reached now?
[02:49:02.614 --> 02:49:05.116]  Now that you have credibility, now there's a big debate.
[02:49:05.116 --> 02:49:08.939]  What are they doing?
[02:49:08.939 --> 02:49:10.300]  I'm in court Monday again, Alex.
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:15.081]  I'm in court on Monday about what I was doing.
[02:49:15.081 --> 02:49:23.183]  What they've started to do with these mass Muslim rapes, our mainstream media now don't report them.
[02:49:23.183 --> 02:49:30.145]  If there's a massive court case, for example, there was one last week with 29 Muslim men and 118 young white English girls.
[02:49:34.776 --> 02:49:47.978]  What I started to do then with Rebel is I'll go to each one of the court cases, I'll confront the paedophiles, I'll get images of them, and then I'll tell everyone back home and around the world, this is what's happening today in this court.
[02:49:47.978 --> 02:49:50.759]  Now I've been to three court cases and done that.
[02:49:50.759 --> 02:50:01.201]  I now face... I'm in court on Monday and I'm gagged by the... I'm gagged, essentially, that I'm not allowed to talk about it yet.
[02:50:01.201 --> 02:50:04.021]  Unfortunately, I don't expect to be here Tuesday.
[02:50:04.924 --> 02:50:05.805]  I expect.
[02:50:05.805 --> 02:50:10.688]  And so... And by the way, you've been in jail before for this.
[02:50:10.688 --> 02:50:11.889]  I've been in jail before.
[02:50:11.889 --> 02:50:15.091]  So this essentially now is... I don't know.
[02:50:15.091 --> 02:50:16.392]  I don't want to say anything again.
[02:50:16.392 --> 02:50:18.253]  I can't really... No, I understand.
[02:50:18.253 --> 02:50:24.598]  Why is the British political system defending the most dirty Islamic sex slavers ever?
[02:50:24.598 --> 02:50:24.918]  Why?
[02:50:24.918 --> 02:50:28.160]  Because we know they supported Savelle and pedophilia.
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:28.761]  What is this?
[02:50:28.761 --> 02:50:31.443]  Is it like a fetish to cuckold young British girls?
[02:50:32.742 --> 02:50:38.944]  They're defending them and hiding them.
[02:50:38.944 --> 02:50:42.766]  Let me ask you this, we're not calling for violence, but what of these islamicists?
[02:50:42.766 --> 02:50:48.168]  Doesn't the government get if they keep pushing, these islamicists are going to be met in the street?
[02:50:48.168 --> 02:50:53.050]  And the bullies are going to actually meet, you know, a piece of metal upside the head?
[02:50:53.050 --> 02:50:59.933]  I keep asking myself, when will the point come that English men stand up to this?
[02:51:00.954 --> 02:51:07.443]  Um, and again, this is a problem about what we need to do is make sure that everyone knows what's happening, which is what I see our role in.
[02:51:07.443 --> 02:51:07.964]  No, I agree.
[02:51:07.964 --> 02:51:10.727]  Ringing the alarm is the most important mission.
[02:51:10.727 --> 02:51:11.528]  Yeah.
[02:51:11.528 --> 02:51:18.017]  There's another city, there's another town, which you'll see something from us coming up on this soon, there's another town called Blackpool in the north of England.
[02:51:18.695 --> 02:51:27.126]  Now, the police identified one Muslim takeaway that was actually grooming, 70 young children were groomed through this takeaway.
[02:51:27.126 --> 02:51:31.412]  One young girl, no, two young girls have never been found from this, yeah, never been found.
[02:51:31.412 --> 02:51:31.992]  Never found?
[02:51:31.992 --> 02:51:32.633]  One of the girls.
[02:51:32.633 --> 02:51:34.836]  We're talking about girls never found.
[02:51:34.836 --> 02:51:35.297]  I mean, wow.
[02:51:36.181 --> 02:51:47.245]  One of the girls, in tape recordings, the Muslim men admitted that they chopped her up into the kebab mincing machine.
[02:51:47.245 --> 02:51:49.845]  But they've never been to jail, they're still well in that same state.
[02:51:49.845 --> 02:51:51.706]  Say that again, they admitted they chopped her up?
[02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:57.361]  They chopped her up and fed her, they chopped her up and put her into the kebab mincer machine.
[02:51:57.361 --> 02:52:12.686]  And then when the girl's mum went in, this has all come out, when the girl's mum went into the kebab shop, because that's where her daughter used to hang around near these shops, so when she went in to ask where her daughter was, they gave her mum and dad's free kebabs.
[02:52:12.686 --> 02:52:19.068]  So they chop her up, she's a caffer, she's a Christian, she's an animal, they chop her up and feed her to their parents.
[02:52:19.932 --> 02:52:24.313]  Muslims fed their dead daughter to her at kebab shop.
[02:52:24.313 --> 02:52:25.353]  You can look this up.
[02:52:25.353 --> 02:52:29.334]  The young girl I've met, her mum and dad, the young girl's name was Charlene Downs.
[02:52:29.334 --> 02:52:39.996]  Now, when the Muslims were taken to court, they got off on a technicality and they were awarded £250,000 compensation.
[02:52:39.996 --> 02:52:42.157]  So when they're taken to court, the court rules for them?
[02:52:45.082 --> 02:52:54.329]  And then the point is, the police in this undercover, in this document that came out, the police have identified 70 girls just for that one shop had been ruined.
[02:52:54.329 --> 02:52:58.313]  They identified up to another 100 Muslim businesses in that town.
[02:52:58.313 --> 02:53:03.977]  Why doesn't England create a new business where you feed British girls into kebab machines?
[02:53:03.977 --> 02:53:05.419]  Can we do that?
[02:53:05.419 --> 02:53:06.780]  Well, we already are.
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:09.042]  I wonder how many other places it's happening.
[02:53:09.042 --> 02:53:13.085]  And that's what this latest court case, what I'm going to be in court for on Monday,
[02:53:14.065 --> 02:53:20.353]  I'm only... I'm not in confidence... Well, I shouldn't even... I probably can't even talk too much about it.
[02:53:20.353 --> 02:53:22.175]  I'll be able to talk about it after Monday, hopefully.
[02:53:23.385 --> 02:53:24.966]  This is going across our country.
[02:53:24.966 --> 02:53:28.108]  And Muslim businesses are used as honey pots.
[02:53:28.108 --> 02:53:28.808]  So we know this.
[02:53:28.808 --> 02:53:32.170]  Well, maybe a new multiculturalism to prove you're not a racist.
[02:53:32.170 --> 02:53:35.072]  Maybe you should have a daughter and feed her into a kebab machine.
[02:53:35.072 --> 02:53:43.597]  I hate to be... I mean, I'd rather not be sick, but maybe that's the new symbol of not being a bad person, because you take your child, slit their throat, and then throw them into a meat grinder.
[02:53:43.597 --> 02:53:45.178]  How's that sound?
[02:53:45.178 --> 02:53:46.939]  And even these men, when they are arrested,
[02:53:47.805 --> 02:53:52.808]  So this case coming up in Leeds, 29 men, they're all on bail.
[02:53:52.808 --> 02:53:54.009]  They're not in prison.
[02:53:54.009 --> 02:53:55.630]  They're all walking around the streets.
[02:53:55.630 --> 02:54:00.113]  In fact, many of them are still working in the same takeaways that they're using to groom the young girls.
[02:54:01.687 --> 02:54:08.833]  So, I feel that the British public being let down, even when they're arresting these people, they're still not guaranteeing safety.
[02:54:08.833 --> 02:54:09.934]  Here's my question.
[02:54:09.934 --> 02:54:12.956]  What in the hell are British families doing?
[02:54:12.956 --> 02:54:16.239]  I get there at school, they're off buses, I see it in the news, it's all confirmed.
[02:54:16.239 --> 02:54:22.644]  Letting their kids get around the Islamist slavers.
[02:54:22.644 --> 02:54:25.847]  Most of these girls that they target, what they do is they choose the victims.
[02:54:26.656 --> 02:54:35.864]  They choose, so, and it starts, so say you've got an 11, 12 year old young white English girl, then she'll be befriended by 11 and 12 year old young Muslim boys.
[02:54:35.864 --> 02:54:41.269]  Them boys will then notify the elder boys, yeah, of which girls are good targets.
[02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:48.996]  As in, which girls... Sure, just like folks in a white van use kids to get other kids to get in the car with the candy or the puppy, it's a standard deal.
[02:54:48.996 --> 02:54:49.677]  Yep, standard deal.
[02:54:49.677 --> 02:54:51.979]  But they find out which girls don't have a father.
[02:54:52.802 --> 02:54:54.703]  Which girls come from a broken home?
[02:54:54.703 --> 02:54:57.325]  Which girls have difficulties in their life?
[02:54:57.325 --> 02:54:58.325]  All of these things are found out.
[02:54:58.325 --> 02:55:02.528]  So when they go for the girl and the victim, a lot of the time, they're girls with problems.
[02:55:02.528 --> 02:55:11.133]  They're girls with parental problems, they're girls with home problems, and they're girls that are already... You're just like Sandusky and the troubled kids at Penn State.
[02:55:11.133 --> 02:55:12.774]  And by the way, this is in the news.
[02:55:12.774 --> 02:55:14.776]  You talked about it five, six years ago.
[02:55:14.776 --> 02:55:18.538]  Hundreds of rape kids, major council crises.
[02:55:18.538 --> 02:55:20.559]  This is in the news for new viewers.
[02:55:20.559 --> 02:55:21.640]  This is confirmed now.
[02:55:23.358 --> 02:55:25.300]  Every single bit of this is confirmed.
[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:27.582]  The only problem we have is they're still...
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:32.823]  We keep going to Rotherham where we can hear 1,400 girls.
[02:55:32.823 --> 02:55:36.185]  Rotherham is nothing compared to the other towns and cities.
[02:55:36.185 --> 02:55:40.148]  We only have those figures because we had a charity who kept records for all the girls.
[02:55:40.148 --> 02:55:46.753]  Sure, so you have trendy liberal parents that go, here's my 10-year-old daughter with a bunch of Muslim men, let her get on the bus with them.
[02:55:46.753 --> 02:55:49.015]  It's liberal to have grown men take my daughter.
[02:55:49.015 --> 02:55:50.236]  It's trendy.
[02:55:50.236 --> 02:55:51.496]  After all, they're not British.
[02:55:51.496 --> 02:55:52.437]  They must be good.
[02:55:52.437 --> 02:55:53.338]  Give my daughter to them.
[02:55:54.212 --> 02:55:57.975]  Well, most of the time, the people who are liberal don't live where this is.
[02:55:57.975 --> 02:55:58.756]  That's the reality.
[02:55:58.756 --> 02:55:59.237]  Exactly.
[02:55:59.237 --> 02:56:02.419]  They're the elites.
[02:56:02.419 --> 02:56:07.564]  The people saying that all these liberal views and how great Islam is, they live out in the countryside.
[02:56:07.564 --> 02:56:10.306]  Their children won't come into contact with these mental groups.
[02:56:10.306 --> 02:56:10.667]  It's ours.
[02:56:11.391 --> 02:56:12.032]  It's ours.
[02:56:12.032 --> 02:56:29.847]  And then the most horrifying thing, for example, I watched on the news as the Rotherham case unfolded, and I saw a young girl who I knew standing outside the police station on the report from the news reporter, and what he turned around, he said, now you've got all the far right turning up.
[02:56:29.847 --> 02:56:32.790]  Now, I looked at her, I know that girl.
[02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:34.051]  I've sat down with her.
[02:56:34.051 --> 02:56:37.754]  She's been gang-raped time and time again as a child.
[02:56:37.754 --> 02:56:38.635]  That's a real person.
[02:56:39.913 --> 02:56:41.335]  So I know her story, sir.
[02:56:41.335 --> 02:56:52.189]  Here she is gang-raped and now here's some elitist media calling her far-right because she dares to come out and speak about what's happened to her.
[02:56:52.189 --> 02:56:54.933]  So if they're a victim once, a victim twice, they'll be a victim again.
[02:56:58.195 --> 02:57:01.777]  Well, the good news is, thanks to you and others, this is starting to come out.
[02:57:01.777 --> 02:57:05.379]  Clearly, I don't think, at least we're like rising against this.
[02:57:05.379 --> 02:57:06.880]  Where is it going in Europe?
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:09.501]  Where is it going in England as the world awakens to this?
[02:57:13.168 --> 02:57:16.891]  I don't know what's going to be that bang, but there will be a bang.
[02:57:16.891 --> 02:57:20.994]  And I don't think we're in control of knowing what it will be or when it will be.
[02:57:20.994 --> 02:57:23.236]  But at some point, people are going to rise up.
[02:57:23.236 --> 02:57:23.916]  They have to.
[02:57:23.916 --> 02:57:24.697]  They have to.
[02:57:24.697 --> 02:57:25.718]  It's the only inevitable outcome.
[02:57:25.718 --> 02:57:26.238]  No, I agree.
[02:57:26.238 --> 02:57:28.260]  Let me go to break, come back and do five more minutes with you.
[02:57:28.260 --> 02:57:28.640]  Can you do it?
[02:57:29.411 --> 02:57:30.032]  Yeah, of course honey.
[02:57:30.032 --> 02:57:34.836]  Because they're telling me I didn't even plug stuff last hour or this hour because I get so caught up.
[02:57:34.836 --> 02:57:35.577]  It's true.
[02:57:35.577 --> 02:57:36.999]  I get so caught up in this.
[02:57:36.999 --> 02:57:41.463]  I got three daughters that it makes me I'm not a violent person.
[02:57:41.463 --> 02:57:43.885]  I just it really gets me where I'm very upset.
[02:57:43.885 --> 02:57:46.908]  Please financially support us so we can expose all this.
[02:57:46.908 --> 02:57:48.410]  We got a lot of great products.
[02:57:48.410 --> 02:57:51.393]  We go out and find the big national maker of organic shampoo and
[02:57:51.913 --> 02:57:55.215]  Sunscreen and bug spray, and we just get it discounted.

[02:58:05.082 --> 02:58:08.023]  I'm not saying I'm a great guy.
[02:58:08.023 --> 02:58:10.145]  I actually feel dirty that other people won't do this fight.
[02:58:10.145 --> 02:58:13.167]  I can't believe there's not other people fighting back.
[02:58:13.167 --> 02:58:14.247]  But we're here.
[02:58:14.247 --> 02:58:16.249]  We need your financial support.

[02:58:39.028 --> 02:58:42.349]  We'll be back with the fourth hour to finish up with Tommy Robinson.
[02:58:42.349 --> 02:58:45.470]  And then we've got, who's coming in the rest of the fourth hour?
[02:58:45.470 --> 02:58:46.390]  Roger Stone.
[02:58:46.390 --> 02:58:46.830]  Stay with us.
[02:58:50.911 --> 02:58:58.395]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:55.222]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.759 --> 03:00:05.280]  Google!
[03:00:05.280 --> 03:00:07.902]  Or use Bing or whatever you'd like.
[03:00:07.902 --> 03:00:10.943]  The term international sex slaves.
[03:00:10.943 --> 03:00:11.964]  Somalia.
[03:00:11.964 --> 03:00:15.866]  Coming to you from the former United States of America.
[03:00:15.866 --> 03:00:18.187]  From deep in the heart of Texas.
[03:00:18.187 --> 03:00:19.888]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.888 --> 03:00:20.409]  That's right!
[03:00:21.429 --> 03:00:34.815]  If you go to any search engine and type in sex slave Libya, sex slave Sudan, sex slaves Syria, sex slaves Saudi Arabia, you'll see the blocks where the women go up naked and are sold.
[03:00:34.815 --> 03:00:38.297]  They ain't wearing hoods then because that's a slave.
[03:00:38.297 --> 03:00:43.960]  And you cover it, the media says, oh it's not happening, even though it's in International Business Times, you name it.
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:44.700]  So here's the deal.
[03:00:46.095 --> 03:00:54.258]  In Islamic country, if your woman or your daughter or your sister isn't wearing a hood over their head, they're fair game.
[03:00:54.258 --> 03:00:59.600]  And so we bring in millions of people, this is their culture, your daughters are gone.
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:06.222]  Five years older, older, they're not wearing a hood over their head, they're going to be in some house with some Muslim raping them.
[03:01:06.222 --> 03:01:09.303]  And Tommy Robinson's exposing that, he's forcing it out.
[03:01:09.303 --> 03:01:11.124]  British papers don't have to admit it's going on.
[03:01:11.624 --> 03:01:12.865]  That's got to make them mad.
[03:01:12.865 --> 03:01:21.411]  I watched Paul Watson's video last week where Muslims are just beating people up and others are that try to just stand in front of 10 Downing Street saying Britain has free speech.
[03:01:21.411 --> 03:01:26.255]  I mean, this is the most howling, arrogant, evil group.
[03:01:26.255 --> 03:01:29.157]  And the government is advancing them and protecting them.
[03:01:29.157 --> 03:01:35.662]  So, Tommy, in general, though, it's got to at least have some satisfaction for you that the worm's turning.
[03:01:35.662 --> 03:01:38.224]  Things you warned about a decade ago are now being admitted to.
[03:01:40.089 --> 03:01:47.191]  Yeah, I sense even in the last three to six months there's a huge change happening in the public.
[03:01:47.191 --> 03:01:49.772]  I sense that on the reaction I'm getting everywhere I'm going.
[03:01:49.772 --> 03:01:54.594]  I'm getting a real, everyone is crying out for this.
[03:01:54.594 --> 03:01:59.595]  Everyone is wanting to support something that's highlighting it.
[03:01:59.595 --> 03:02:01.956]  I can't take any sadness.
[03:02:01.956 --> 03:02:06.938]  When I know all the things we've warned about for so many years, I think the first time I brought this up was in 2004.
[03:02:08.900 --> 03:02:10.723]  About the grooming of our girls.
[03:02:10.723 --> 03:02:15.310]  In 2004, and I think how many victims there's been since then, and allowed to have been.
[03:02:15.310 --> 03:02:19.297]  Another case, I don't know, if you look at a case in the city of Oxford.
[03:02:20.973 --> 03:02:25.398]  They changed the name of the road, the Muslim community did there, to Manzul Way.
[03:02:25.398 --> 03:02:31.586]  Now, Manzul translates as mosque, but all us stupid kafar idiots, we don't know, they've just named it Mosque Way.
[03:02:31.586 --> 03:02:39.055]  Now, where they've got a massive mosque, one young English victim was being raped repeatedly in the house directly opposite the mosque.
[03:02:39.515 --> 03:02:55.453]  What they did is, they got on iron rods – this is all now fact, it's all come out in the courts – they got on iron rods with the letter M, and they burned it and burned it, and then scolded her bum, aged 11, because she was the property of Mahan.
[03:02:55.453 --> 03:02:56.214]  That is no joke.
[03:02:56.992 --> 03:02:58.233]  That's what's happened.
[03:02:58.233 --> 03:03:05.880]  One of the other girls in the city of Oxford, when people think of Oxford, as I said, they think of architecture, they think of the world's best university, they think of all these things.
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:06.861]  Think again.
[03:03:06.861 --> 03:03:11.064]  There's another young girl, they got a tongue out on a table, they nailed it to a table.
[03:03:11.064 --> 03:03:11.705]  This is real.
[03:03:13.218 --> 03:03:17.540]  It's like, it's not even just like they're raping them, they're torturing these young children.
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:26.946]  And that's what radical orthodox Islam is, is slave ships, and burning, and marks, and branding, and nailing.
[03:03:26.946 --> 03:03:28.626]  I mean, that's who they are.
[03:03:28.626 --> 03:03:35.130]  Eating hearts, devil worshipping, cutting up victims, making them eat people, selling girls into sex slavery.
[03:03:35.130 --> 03:03:37.351]  That's Islam.
[03:03:37.351 --> 03:03:42.294]  Well, when you look through, exactly what these men are doing, exactly what these gangs are doing,
[03:03:43.157 --> 03:03:44.998]  The Prophet Muhammad did.
[03:03:44.998 --> 03:03:47.359]  So, of course they see no wrong.
[03:03:47.359 --> 03:03:49.720]  And you can see they see no wrong in what they're doing.
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:52.721]  By their reactions in court, all of them.
[03:03:52.721 --> 03:03:56.003]  Their family's reactions, always supporting them.
[03:03:56.003 --> 03:04:01.805]  Their community's reactions, blaming the girls for being slags, age 12.
[03:04:01.805 --> 03:04:05.087]  This is an entire culture based on feeding on women.
[03:04:06.172 --> 03:04:06.732]  Feed non-women.
[03:04:06.732 --> 03:04:09.674]  And obviously, especially non-Muslim women.
[03:04:09.674 --> 03:04:14.116]  So the feminists then support it because they're anti-woman, anti-family.
[03:04:14.116 --> 03:04:15.597]  Alright, Tommy Robinson.
[03:04:15.597 --> 03:04:18.718]  TommyRobinson.co.uk, TheRebelMedia.com.
[03:04:18.718 --> 03:04:21.160]  Thank you so much and for your courage.
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:25.882]  Next time I go over to the UK, let's go out together, you, me, and you and I, and Paul Watson.
[03:04:25.882 --> 03:04:28.724]  I want to document this for myself, but I gotta apologize.
[03:04:28.724 --> 03:04:33.266]  If a guy's trying to attack the car, I may actually... You don't mind if I give him a... I know you've done this yourself a couple swings.
[03:04:33.266 --> 03:04:35.087]  I mean, is that okay, or will I get put in prison?
[03:04:35.859 --> 03:04:36.700]  No, that's fine, mate.
[03:04:36.700 --> 03:04:37.440]  That's fine.
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:38.240]  Well, go out.
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:39.641]  I look forward to coming over, Alex.
[03:04:39.641 --> 03:04:40.582]  Well, I'll run my mouth.
[03:04:40.582 --> 03:04:41.623]  We'll see how tough I am.
[03:04:41.623 --> 03:04:44.784]  A couple of these Muslims in their little, you know, puma outfits.
[03:04:44.784 --> 03:04:49.567]  I may have to beat a little bit of a... I mean, will it be okay if I kind of give them a couple of swings?
[03:04:49.567 --> 03:04:51.548]  You can give them a couple of swings.
[03:04:51.548 --> 03:04:52.829]  Alright, you're awesome.
[03:04:52.829 --> 03:04:53.650]  Tommy Robinson.
[03:04:53.650 --> 03:04:55.891]  Alright, Roger Stone coming up straight ahead.
[03:04:55.891 --> 03:04:57.252]  Good God, it makes me sick.
[03:04:57.252 --> 03:04:58.693]  But thank God he's there opposing it.
[03:05:01.181 --> 03:05:06.385]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[03:05:06.385 --> 03:05:17.872]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[03:05:17.872 --> 03:05:25.978]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this critical moment.
[03:05:25.978 --> 03:05:29.360]  On Trump's website, he has set up a Drain the Swamp
[03:05:29.500 --> 03:05:30.900]  I'm Millie Weaver reporting.
[03:06:00.413 --> 03:06:05.818]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:06:05.818 --> 03:06:08.680]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:06:08.680 --> 03:06:10.662]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:06:10.662 --> 03:06:15.686]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:06:15.686 --> 03:06:17.788]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:06:17.788 --> 03:06:19.069]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:06:19.069 --> 03:06:24.194]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:06:24.194 --> 03:06:27.557]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:06:27.677 --> 03:06:31.059]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:06:31.059 --> 03:06:34.040]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:37.742]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:06:37.742 --> 03:06:44.645]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:06:44.645 --> 03:06:52.149]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[03:07:37.062 --> 03:07:37.722]  That's right.
[03:08:13.895 --> 03:08:20.951]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:20.951 --> 03:08:23.877]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:08:26.863 --> 03:08:31.825]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.
[03:08:31.825 --> 03:08:35.047]  History is repeating itself.
[03:08:35.047 --> 03:08:44.251]  What we're seeing in Washington is a repetition of the deep state coup which removed President Richard Nixon from office in 1974.
[03:08:44.251 --> 03:08:45.211]  And the parallels are eerie.
[03:08:49.773 --> 03:08:55.740]  Nixon ended the war in Vietnam on a faster track than the Pentagon wanted.
[03:08:55.740 --> 03:09:03.889]  He reached arms limitation agreement with the Soviets and he opened the door to China.
[03:09:03.889 --> 03:09:09.294]  He deeply offended the deep state because they favored war.
[03:09:10.270 --> 03:09:24.506]  We now know that the Pentagon had infiltrated the Nixon White House and was spying on the President, that a yeoman named Radford was going through desks
[03:09:35.573 --> 03:09:51.442]  We know that the Watergate burglary team had been infiltrated by the CIA, and that at least two members, and perhaps three, were still on the agency payroll reporting everything going on back to their case officers.
[03:09:52.162 --> 03:10:02.567]  We know that Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski, the Watergate special prosecutors, were meeting illegally with Judge John Sirica.
[03:10:02.567 --> 03:10:14.394]  We also know that Sirica, in the Watergate burglars trial, was already in touch with the appeals court, ensuring that the burglars would have no appeal.
[03:10:15.214 --> 03:10:18.136]  Richard Nixon was brought down.
[03:10:18.136 --> 03:10:19.717]  Now the parallels.
[03:10:19.717 --> 03:10:26.142]  Donald Trump, like Nixon, was a man of peace, is a man of peace.
[03:10:26.142 --> 03:10:29.965]  And he favors peace with the Russians.
[03:10:29.965 --> 03:10:35.729]  And therefore, we have had extraordinary events in the last seven days.
[03:10:35.729 --> 03:10:38.491]  Seven days in May, if you will.
[03:10:39.272 --> 03:10:57.977]  First, there was the phony New York Times story telling us that the president had blurted out classified information when he told the Russian foreign minister and ambassador that he was concerned about the ISIS
[03:10:59.517 --> 03:11:07.724]  Planning technology that would turn laptops into bombs and they would be smuggled on planes.
[03:11:07.724 --> 03:11:19.594]  The fact that this information had appeared in dozens of newspapers, including the New York Times, seemed to make no difference to those seeking to smear the president.
[03:11:19.594 --> 03:11:25.619]  Then we learned breathlessly from the New York Times that the president
[03:11:26.925 --> 03:11:53.295]  Had been in a conversation, allegedly, with FBI Director Comey, and had, according to Mr. Comey's memo, which none of us have seen, and is not authenticated in any way, that Mr. Comey claimed the President tried to interfere with his investigation into alleged Russian collusion.
[03:11:53.955 --> 03:11:58.638]  And specifically into General Michael Flynn.
[03:11:58.638 --> 03:12:11.965]  This, despite the fact that the FBI director, the acting director, says there is no evidence of interference with the investigation by President Trump.
[03:12:11.965 --> 03:12:22.551]  Now we learn from Judge Andrew Napolitano that Mr. Comey was directly involved in essentially commissioning the fake
[03:12:23.271 --> 03:12:43.565]  Dossier by a British intelligence agent claiming falsely that Donald Trump dallied with prostitutes and watched them urinate on a bed that had supposedly been inhabited by Barack and Michelle Obama when they visited Moscow.
[03:12:43.565 --> 03:12:47.969]  We now know this to be a total fabrication.
[03:12:48.689 --> 03:13:01.875]  Today, shockingly, we learn that Mr. Comey has an agent out promulgating this myth that he was always uncomfortable with the President.
[03:13:01.875 --> 03:13:10.199]  That in a White House meeting, he sought to blend into the curtains and avoid shaking the President's hands.
[03:13:10.199 --> 03:13:17.823]  Folks, we have here an exact duplicate of the deep state coup that took down Richard Nixon
[03:13:18.443 --> 03:13:22.366]  And now seeks to take down Donald Trump.
[03:13:22.366 --> 03:13:22.967]  Why?
[03:13:22.967 --> 03:13:25.469]  Because Donald Trump is a man of peace.
[03:13:25.469 --> 03:13:34.456]  Because he prefers negotiation and detente with the Russians over thermonuclear war over Syria.
[03:13:35.177 --> 03:13:41.140]  This is the most serious threat that the country faces today.
[03:13:41.140 --> 03:13:50.544]  And as we will discuss later in the program, the attempts for the president to survive are hampered by the fact that he has peopled an administration.
[03:13:51.587 --> 03:14:07.051]  That is completely staffed with quizlings, with people who did not support his candidacy, who do not support his agenda and are not committed to his presidency.
[03:14:07.051 --> 03:14:18.715]  He is hampered by a universally hostile mainstream media, but he is particularly hampered by a concerted effort
[03:14:19.455 --> 03:14:37.310]  Financed by George Soros, authorized by the federal government due to an attachment to the defense authorization in 2016 to silence the alternative media that seeks to defend our president.
[03:14:37.870 --> 03:14:59.524]  Yes, Infowars, Breitbart, The Daily Caller, Stone Cold Truth, Town Hall, and so many others, like our friend Mike Cernovich, find themselves being censored through highly technical techniques that limit our reach to you.
[03:14:59.524 --> 03:15:06.349]  In other words, they seek to strip away the voices that would defend a President Trump.
[03:15:07.819 --> 03:15:18.106]  We are in the fight for our lives, which is why it's more important than ever that you go to the Infowars.com store.
[03:15:18.106 --> 03:15:25.170]  It's actually Infowarsstore.com, and you get some of the fine products that are offered there.
[03:15:25.170 --> 03:15:28.393]  You see, we don't have the deep pockets of Google.
[03:15:29.193 --> 03:15:34.296]  We don't have the deep pockets of Amazon or Yahoo.
[03:15:34.296 --> 03:15:37.317]  We can only depend on you.
[03:15:37.317 --> 03:15:48.583]  We can only depend on liberty-minded patriots who keep Infowars.com afloat and who support all these other fine alternative news sites.
[03:15:48.583 --> 03:15:50.925]  Now, I highly recommend immediately
[03:15:51.746 --> 03:15:57.960]  The new Z-Shield toxic metal and chemical defense support formula, which right now is 25% off.
[03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:10.262]  This is a proprietary toxic metal and chemical defense formula that's available and will be for only a very short period of time.
[03:16:10.262 --> 03:16:13.503]  Folks, we are being poisoned.
[03:16:13.503 --> 03:16:24.146]  Countless studies show that our food, our water, and our air is loaded with toxic metals and chemicals that are reaping havoc on our immune systems and our bodies.
[03:16:25.106 --> 03:16:35.254]  Even the EPA admits that they're dumping more than 800 million pounds of pesticide into our air, into our water, into our crops every year.
[03:16:35.254 --> 03:16:39.038]  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:16:39.038 --> 03:16:46.704]  No matter what you do, it's virtually impossible to avoid all of these toxic chemicals and dangers.
[03:16:46.704 --> 03:16:48.705]  And therefore, a team of herbalists
[03:16:49.466 --> 03:17:00.069]  PhDs and chemists have spent years testing and developing this proprietary brand using a technology that created Z-Shield.
[03:17:00.069 --> 03:17:03.050]  Folks, this is a great product.
[03:17:03.050 --> 03:17:08.111]  Do it, get it for your own benefit, because it's a win-win situation.
[03:17:08.111 --> 03:17:15.913]  You're not only going to help your own health, but you're going to boost us here at InfoWars in the fight for freedom.
[03:17:16.753 --> 03:17:27.438]  We are fighting an uphill battle, folks, because their pockets are deeper than ours, and they seek to kneecap us through a program of censorship.
[03:17:27.438 --> 03:17:42.466]  Later on in the program, we visit with Andrew Torba from Gab, who is going to outline exactly how these weasels seek to censor our right to free speech and kill a free press in America.
[03:17:42.466 --> 03:17:44.207]  And make no mistake about it.
[03:17:44.847 --> 03:17:49.731]  InfoWars is known to the left as the tip of the spear.
[03:17:49.731 --> 03:17:54.755]  InfoWars is the voice that they want most to silence.
[03:17:54.755 --> 03:17:58.218]  InfoWars is leading this fight.
[03:17:58.218 --> 03:18:01.540]  But we cannot win without your help.
[03:18:01.540 --> 03:18:10.647]  We cannot succeed in heading off the deep state coup to remove Donald Trump from office without your assistance.
[03:18:11.388 --> 03:18:12.989]  The time is now.
[03:18:12.989 --> 03:18:14.651]  The stakes are high.
[03:18:14.651 --> 03:18:16.632]  The threat is grave.
[03:18:16.632 --> 03:18:32.004]  Please go to TheInfoWarStore.com and get a Z-Shield or one of the great new t-shirts, including the Trump-Pence 2020 t-shirt, or get a copy of my book, The Making of the President 2016.
[03:18:34.025 --> 03:18:40.929]  There's many other fine products there, folks, but help us now because we are outgunned.
[03:18:40.929 --> 03:18:42.610]  Our spirit is greater.
[03:18:42.610 --> 03:18:48.293]  We're ready for the fight, but we cannot do it without you.
[03:18:48.293 --> 03:18:58.979]  Later in the program, we're going to talk about the latest on the Seth Rich investigation, the investigation that seeks to bring down Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:18:58.979 --> 03:19:01.140]  We're going to talk about the
[03:19:02.421 --> 03:19:15.704]  The fact that the Swedish government has decided to drop the totally framed, trumped up sexual assault and rape charges against Julian Assange.
[03:19:15.704 --> 03:19:28.166]  We're going to talk about that great patriot, Roger Ailes, the founder of Fox News, a good friend, a communications genius, and a true patriot.
[03:19:28.746 --> 03:19:30.508]  You're in the right place.
[03:19:30.508 --> 03:19:34.073]  This is Info Wars on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:34.073 --> 03:19:38.498]  I'm Roger Stone, and folks, we're just warming up.
[03:19:38.498 --> 03:19:41.282]  So stand by for a great program.
[03:19:41.282 --> 03:19:42.043]  I'll be right back.
[03:20:00.404 --> 03:20:04.105]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension or 401k?
[03:20:04.105 --> 03:20:09.247]  Then I hope you're prepared to lose 30, 40, 50% or more of your retirement savings.
[03:20:09.247 --> 03:20:12.108]  Because it's not a question of if the market crashes again.
[03:20:12.108 --> 03:20:13.449]  It's a question of when.
[03:20:13.449 --> 03:20:14.549]  It's going to happen.
[03:20:14.549 --> 03:20:20.291]  Did you know there is a way you can protect and grow your wealth safely and predictably every single year?
[03:20:20.291 --> 03:20:24.693]  The people using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or 2008.
[03:20:24.693 --> 03:20:27.314]  And they won't lose a penny in the next crash.
[03:20:27.654 --> 03:20:34.519]  In fact, their money will continue to grow safely year in and year out, even when stocks, real estate and other investments tumble.
[03:20:34.519 --> 03:20:37.861]  A free report detailing this savings program is now available.
[03:20:37.861 --> 03:20:45.206]  This free report shows how you can get guaranteed growth, safety and wealth building power without risking your retirement in the Wall Street casino.
[03:20:45.206 --> 03:20:48.469]  This is the best way to have a 100% secure retirement.
[03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:50.450]  It far outperforms any IRA or 401k.

[03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:09.996]  I was making great progress on building my savings, but then I get hit with an unexpected car repair bill.
[03:22:09.996 --> 03:22:15.963]  Keeping a close eye on my credit score allowed me to buy my first house, but an unexpected medical emergency set me back.
[03:22:16.263 --> 03:22:18.547]  When the unexpected happened, Avant was there to help.

[03:24:05.265 --> 03:24:09.612]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:24:09.612 --> 03:24:14.140]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:24:14.140 --> 03:24:17.405]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:24:20.183 --> 03:24:26.125]  We've got this cast of characters that have, to varying degrees, ties with Russia.
[03:24:26.125 --> 03:24:28.446]  We've got Roger Stone, for example.
[03:24:28.446 --> 03:24:33.168]  Roger Stone, political mentor and former campaign advisor.
[03:24:33.168 --> 03:24:40.931]  Roger Stone declared, trust me, it will soon be Podesta's time in the barrel, end quote.
[03:24:41.605 --> 03:24:45.946]  Obviously, I think he and others need to be questioned.
[03:24:45.946 --> 03:24:50.608]  There's no doubt that Mr. Stone was closely associated.
[03:24:50.608 --> 03:25:00.310]  So, Senator Mark Warner, who's head of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, okay, he, the first thing out of his mouth the other day when he was asked about this, he said, there's clearly a lot of smoke.
[03:25:00.310 --> 03:25:01.771]  And then he said, an individual.
[03:25:02.791 --> 03:25:03.571]  That would be me.
[03:25:03.571 --> 03:25:04.191]  That's you.
[03:25:04.191 --> 03:25:10.233]  He said, associated with the Trump campaign, accurately predicted the release of hacked emails before it happened.
[03:25:10.233 --> 03:25:17.435]  This same individual, you, also admits to being in contact with Guccifer 2.0.
[03:25:17.435 --> 03:25:19.676]  I'm not asking for immunity.
[03:25:19.676 --> 03:25:24.237]  I was maligned by a number of members of the committee who said things that were patently false.
[03:25:24.237 --> 03:25:27.538]  And in a free society, I should have a chance to respond in the same forum.
[03:25:27.538 --> 03:25:28.578]  In the same forum.
[03:25:28.578 --> 03:25:29.759]  No one would disagree with that.
[03:25:29.759 --> 03:25:30.639]  And I don't need a subpoena.
[03:25:31.559 --> 03:25:35.041]  I don't need immunity, but I want it to be in public, not behind closed doors.
[03:25:35.041 --> 03:25:35.862]  Let's go, I'm ready.
[03:25:35.862 --> 03:25:42.286]  Because I think a lot of people would not like me to testify because I will put the lie to this Russian myth.
[03:25:42.286 --> 03:25:45.068]  I never had any contacts with the Russian state.
[03:25:45.068 --> 03:25:49.031]  To my knowledge, no one else in the campaign did.
[03:25:49.031 --> 03:25:53.994]  I think perhaps the Democrats could get over the fact that they spent about $2.5 billion, Trump spent about $278 million, and they lost.
[03:25:53.994 --> 03:25:54.735]  That's what this is really about.
[03:26:04.903 --> 03:26:07.045]  There you have it, folks.
[03:26:07.045 --> 03:26:22.061]  Today was the day in which the Senate gave me a deadline for the production of documents pursuant to the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into alleged Russian collusion.
[03:26:23.302 --> 03:26:33.865]  And I have complied fully turning over all of the documents in my possession that met their criteria.
[03:26:33.865 --> 03:26:36.766]  That would be none.
[03:26:36.766 --> 03:26:48.129]  As the president says, this is a fairy tale, a falsehood, a false narrative first invented by John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary's campaign.
[03:26:48.969 --> 03:27:02.721]  As a distraction from the fact that Bill and Hillary and John and Tony Podesta made millions out of their association with the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[03:27:02.721 --> 03:27:10.467]  What better way than to point a false finger at Donald Trump and his associates?
[03:27:10.467 --> 03:27:14.330]  So when, you might ask, will I be allowed to testify?
[03:27:15.271 --> 03:27:16.472]  I'm ready.
[03:27:16.472 --> 03:27:19.033]  I'm more than ready.
[03:27:19.033 --> 03:27:26.317]  I want to confront Senator Feinstein, and Senator Warner, and Senator Franken.
[03:27:26.317 --> 03:27:36.903]  And I'd particularly like Senator McCain, who's not a member of the committee, to sit in for the hearing, as he has the right to do as a senator.
[03:27:36.903 --> 03:27:41.386]  Because I want to confront them about their exact words.
[03:27:41.946 --> 03:27:44.047]  Let's get to the important point.
[03:27:44.047 --> 03:27:54.751]  This entire Russian narrative is the centerpiece of a deep state coup designed to take down our president.
[03:27:54.751 --> 03:27:57.432]  History is repeating itself.
[03:27:57.432 --> 03:28:03.794]  As I said in the previous segment, they could not beat Donald Trump at the ballot box.
[03:28:04.514 --> 03:28:19.921]  Because of the ferocious campaign that was waged by Infowars and Breitbart and Daily Caller and so many others in a vibrant, robust, alternative media.
[03:28:19.921 --> 03:28:27.505]  Now they not only seek to silence us through a comprehensive and sophisticated campaign of censorship,
[03:28:28.280 --> 03:28:44.147]  But they also seek to remove our president through a series of leaks and false stories undermining his leadership and destabilizing his presidency.
[03:28:44.147 --> 03:28:46.929]  We have no intention whatsoever
[03:28:47.569 --> 03:28:50.150]  of letting this happen.
[03:28:50.150 --> 03:29:01.493]  So my message to the Senators, my message to Congressman Adam Schiff, a man so full of Schiff, his eyes are brown.
[03:29:01.493 --> 03:29:02.374]  Let's get it on!
[03:29:03.214 --> 03:29:06.436]  You don't seem to mind maligning me in public.
[03:29:06.436 --> 03:29:09.438]  Let me testify in public.
[03:29:09.438 --> 03:29:13.840]  You've accused Alex Jones of being a Russian spy.
[03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:23.025]  You have said that the bots are out promulgating the info wars links are paid for by Russia.
[03:29:23.025 --> 03:29:25.927]  Put up or shut up.
[03:29:25.927 --> 03:29:27.628]  Where's the evidence?
[03:29:27.628 --> 03:29:29.409]  Where's the beef?
[03:29:29.409 --> 03:29:30.729]  Where's the proof?
[03:29:31.886 --> 03:29:36.190]  I know what you're holding in your hand, and it's not evidence.
[03:29:36.190 --> 03:29:38.552]  It's time for the truth.
[03:29:38.552 --> 03:29:43.516]  Let Roger Stone, let Alex Jones, let us testify.
[03:29:43.516 --> 03:29:49.581]  I'm Roger Stone, the Alex Jones Show, and I'll be right back.
[03:29:49.581 --> 03:29:53.524]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.524 --> 03:29:56.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.255 --> 03:30:06.458]  Trump put out a statement saying, what you are seeing is sabotage.
[03:30:06.458 --> 03:30:17.944]  The fake news media is working hand in hand with Washington's corrupt bureaucracy to try to slow and block out our America First agenda.
[03:30:17.944 --> 03:30:26.049]  With so many forces out to ruin us, we are turning to you and our most trusted supporters at this critical moment.
[03:30:26.049 --> 03:30:29.431]  On Trump's website, he has set up a Drain the Swamp
[03:30:29.571 --> 03:30:30.972]  I'm Millie Weaver reporting.
[03:31:00.450 --> 03:31:09.513]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:09.513 --> 03:31:17.616]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:17.916 --> 03:31:22.799]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:22.799 --> 03:31:29.582]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:29.582 --> 03:31:36.766]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:36.766 --> 03:31:43.629]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:43.789 --> 03:31:48.270]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:48.270 --> 03:31:51.651]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:51.651 --> 03:31:57.953]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:57.953 --> 03:31:59.634]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:32:00.754 --> 03:32:02.575]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:32:02.575 --> 03:32:09.197]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:32:09.197 --> 03:32:12.338]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:12.338 --> 03:32:22.122]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[03:32:22.122 --> 03:32:22.962]  Caveman.
[03:32:22.962 --> 03:32:28.044]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[03:32:28.044 --> 03:32:30.145]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:32:30.445 --> 03:32:33.606]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:32:33.606 --> 03:32:38.748]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:32:38.748 --> 03:32:46.811]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[03:32:46.811 --> 03:32:54.733]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[03:32:54.733 --> 03:32:59.475]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and fullworthslime.com today.
[03:33:04.403 --> 03:33:15.386]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:33:15.386 --> 03:33:16.946]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:22.802 --> 03:33:23.963]  Welcome back.
[03:33:23.963 --> 03:33:28.326]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for my friend Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.326 --> 03:33:31.088]  Make no mistake about it, folks.
[03:33:31.088 --> 03:33:42.035]  We, and when I say we, I mean the Trump White House, we here at InfoWars, the folks at Stone Cold Truth, we are under siege like never before.
[03:33:43.657 --> 03:33:53.245]  The internet giants, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Yahoo, they seek to kneecap us.
[03:33:53.245 --> 03:33:56.867]  They seek to silence our voices.
[03:33:56.867 --> 03:34:04.853]  They seek to silence those who would defend our president in the upcoming deep state coup.
[03:34:05.794 --> 03:34:13.039]  You see, they couldn't beat Donald Trump at the ballot box, despite the fact that they massively outspent him.
[03:34:13.039 --> 03:34:20.183]  Despite the fact that they rigged both the old media and the new media against him.
[03:34:20.183 --> 03:34:24.025]  And therefore, we need your support more than ever before.
[03:34:25.086 --> 03:34:34.592]  I want to speak of a product that is a particular favorite in the Stone household, a favorite for my 19-year-old grandson, Nicholas.
[03:34:34.592 --> 03:34:43.779]  Now, Nick is very popular with the girls, and I think one of his secrets is a gleaming white smile.
[03:34:43.779 --> 03:34:54.346]  He has become a total devotee of the super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, which you can get only at the InfoWars store.
[03:34:55.046 --> 03:34:59.411]  Now, folks, this is not going to be in stock for very long.
[03:34:59.411 --> 03:35:04.957]  It's one of the most popular products, Alex told me, that InfoWars has ever had.
[03:35:04.957 --> 03:35:08.601]  And right now, there is a limited time price of just $9.95.
[03:35:11.468 --> 03:35:21.250]  Really, research across the board indicates that the health of your gums can contribute to a development of heart disease and heart attacks.
[03:35:21.250 --> 03:35:24.271]  So it's more than just cosmetic.
[03:35:24.271 --> 03:35:35.394]  Although, Mrs. Stone tells me when it comes to a bright white smile, this beats any of the products you can buy at your local drugstore.
[03:35:35.394 --> 03:35:40.715]  And because some people find the original peppermint flavor strong,
[03:35:41.235 --> 03:35:42.816]  Although I favor it.
[03:35:42.816 --> 03:35:49.542]  We now have a bubble gum flavor, which is great for children.
[03:35:49.542 --> 03:35:54.326]  Believe me, folks, you can get this product now, and it's a win-win.
[03:35:54.326 --> 03:35:56.508]  You'll help the fight for freedom.
[03:35:57.048 --> 03:36:09.292]  You will bolster those who are prepared to defend and fight for our president and you can get a gleaming white smile and terrific oral health.
[03:36:09.292 --> 03:36:12.154]  Go to the store and grab this now.
[03:36:12.154 --> 03:36:14.274]  Help the fight for freedom.
[03:36:14.274 --> 03:36:16.015]  And now we're going to talk about
[03:36:16.255 --> 03:36:22.363]  The censorship campaign that is being run against alternative media.
[03:36:22.363 --> 03:36:26.669]  And joining me is Andrew Torba from Gab Media.
[03:36:26.669 --> 03:36:30.154]  Andrew, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:36:30.154 --> 03:36:32.317]  Pleasure being here as always, Roger.
[03:36:32.317 --> 03:36:33.478]  I appreciate you having me on.
[03:36:34.628 --> 03:36:40.452]  So I know that you had a terrific segment with Alex Jones a couple weeks ago.
[03:36:40.452 --> 03:37:01.066]  I watched and you started to outline for us exactly what's going on with these giant media companies and the various techniques that they are using to hamper our reach to our followers and hamper our reach to the uncommitted.
[03:37:01.066 --> 03:37:04.488]  And you sent me some incredible information about Reddit.
[03:37:05.129 --> 03:37:05.249]  Okay.
[03:37:21.894 --> 03:37:38.141]  Sure, Roger, so essentially what's happening is a combination of government-forced regulation on quote-unquote hate speech, special interests also pushing this regulation by pushing it to the social networks like Facebook, like Twitter, etc.
[03:37:38.141 --> 03:37:41.603]  to stifle what they would call quote-unquote hate speech, which
[03:37:42.023 --> 03:37:45.005]  As we know is very subjective and in the eye of the beholder.
[03:37:45.005 --> 03:37:50.748]  So there have been a laundry list of things that have happened over the past year on Reddit specifically.
[03:37:50.748 --> 03:37:59.012]  I mean, their CEO came forward and actually admitted to personally editing the content of Trump supporters who were critical of him.
[03:37:59.772 --> 03:38:13.999]  Reddit was forced to change their algorithm on their front page because the pro-Donald Trump subreddit, The Donald, got so popular and so powerful that they started to actually dominate the entire website.
[03:38:13.999 --> 03:38:26.805]  Another example is Reddit's ads product displayed that this subreddit, which is, by the way, one of the most popular and largest subreddits on the entire website, had upwards of 6 million total subscribers
[03:38:27.265 --> 03:38:27.565]  We're good.
[03:38:57.005 --> 03:38:57.185]  I'm good.
[03:39:15.663 --> 03:39:28.548]  Now I understand Facebook has a new program that they're going to be using to further stifle free expression and try to hamper the voices of liberty and freedom.
[03:39:28.548 --> 03:39:29.629]  Can you tell us about that?
[03:39:30.672 --> 03:39:45.825]  Sure, so it actually came out last May, a whistleblower on Facebook's Trending Topics product, which is the news product, the quote-unquote news product on the right-hand side column of Facebook, that's used by over a billion people every single month.
[03:39:45.825 --> 03:39:47.346]  It came out that they were actively
[03:39:47.466 --> 03:39:48.427]  We're good to go.
[03:40:13.102 --> 03:40:13.683]  Thank you so much.
[03:40:37.116 --> 03:40:40.422]  So let's go through some of these techniques, if we may.
[03:40:40.422 --> 03:40:42.986]  Explain shadow banning to us.
[03:40:44.446 --> 03:40:52.532]  Sure, so shadowbanning is a way to essentially hide content from people who aren't necessarily following you.
[03:40:52.532 --> 03:40:55.775]  It's used on Twitter, as an example.
[03:40:55.775 --> 03:41:13.329]  When you look under the President's tweets and you see a lot of the negative replies from what appear to be a lot of people that are upset with the President or don't agree with what he's doing, Twitter is using the guise of hiding quote-unquote what they call abusive tweets
[03:41:13.769 --> 03:41:16.833]  And actually fully removing them from the thread.
[03:41:16.833 --> 03:41:32.831]  So even, you know, large personalities like Paul Joseph Watson, for example, when he gets in there and replies instantly right to the president and, you know, has hundreds of retweets and favorites on his post, he ends up getting dethreaded or he ends up getting bumped very far down on the reply list.
[03:41:33.331 --> 03:41:34.812]  Explain search filtering to us.
[03:41:53.027 --> 03:41:53.307]  Sure.
[03:41:53.307 --> 03:41:59.031]  So as you know, Google controls what you're seeing at the top of the page.
[03:41:59.031 --> 03:42:02.073]  One result is really the critical spot.
[03:42:02.073 --> 03:42:05.135]  That's where most people are going to see the majority of their content.
[03:42:05.135 --> 03:42:20.025]  And what's happening now is Google is highlighting certain publishers like InfoWars as quote-unquote fake news and burying them down further in the search results or hiding them completely from the search results.
[03:42:20.365 --> 03:42:25.628]  And the amount of power that this has in terms of driving traffic back to websites is astronomical.
[03:42:25.628 --> 03:42:38.236]  So it's really crazy to me that a select handful of companies in Silicon Valley control all of what we're seeing, all of the way that we communicate, the way that we get information, the way that we get news.
[03:42:38.236 --> 03:42:45.881]  And now that patriots are rising around the globe and this rise of populism is happening on a global scale,
[03:42:46.421 --> 03:42:49.443]  Yeah, I've been particularly concerned about fake news flagging.
[03:42:49.443 --> 03:42:52.744]  It seems to me that they have armies of trolls blocking our content.
[03:42:52.744 --> 03:42:53.505]  Explain to us how that works.
[03:43:06.243 --> 03:43:15.826]  Yeah, so Facebook actually just came out and said that they hired about 3,000 employees to view different flagged posts.
[03:43:15.826 --> 03:43:26.610]  And obviously, we have third party special interests such as Media Matters and their conglomerate, ShareBlue, which is a David Brock's organization.
[03:43:26.610 --> 03:43:32.192]  And they actually, you know, came out and during the election and had
[03:43:32.432 --> 03:43:37.415]  You know, these paid trolls on Twitter, on Reddit, we've seen them even on Gab on our end.
[03:43:37.415 --> 03:43:57.249]  And these people are actually paid, you know, per post to, you know, attack positive replies and go after, you know, different posts on the internet and try to create this psychological, you know, perception that things are actually different or people have a different opinion than the majority of people on the internet.
[03:43:58.982 --> 03:44:08.285]  So, I know you are the founder of Gab, which is an alternative, conservative social media organization.
[03:44:08.285 --> 03:44:12.907]  I know you've got some new TV and streaming features, which I'm very excited about.
[03:44:12.907 --> 03:44:16.048]  Why don't you preview those for the InfoWars audience?
[03:44:17.268 --> 03:44:17.748]  Yeah, sure.
[03:44:17.748 --> 03:44:27.233]  So Gab is a social network that believes in defending free speech, individual liberty, and the ability to have a free flow of information.
[03:44:27.233 --> 03:44:33.176]  We don't want to act like Big Brother and decide what you as the user should or should not see.
[03:44:33.176 --> 03:44:44.362]  And we believe that there is a really big demand for high quality streaming content that is scheduled that people can tune into from a lot of the voices that are being silenced across other channels.
[03:44:44.982 --> 03:45:01.473]  For example, you see the demonetization of a lot of content creators on YouTube where they wake up and 30, 40, 50, 75% of their monthly revenue is completely gone overnight because advertisers are pulling their ads from YouTube.
[03:45:03.094 --> 03:45:21.426]  It's crazy to me that on the internet you're not allowed to be critical, you're not allowed to have comedy, you're not allowed to use facts and data and real information to get news and cover things that are important in the world anymore.
[03:45:23.754 --> 03:45:31.058]  The one that aggravates me, I guess, is throttling, because you think you're reaching far more people than you are.
[03:45:31.058 --> 03:45:34.059]  They put a cap on your reach.
[03:45:34.059 --> 03:45:37.681]  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, they're all guilty.
[03:45:37.681 --> 03:45:47.225]  It seems to me that when the network identifies a post that's going viral, they clamp down immediately to stop its spread.
[03:45:47.225 --> 03:45:50.487]  It's amazing how many of my followers contact me and say,
[03:45:51.127 --> 03:45:52.689]  Aren't you posting anymore?
[03:45:52.689 --> 03:45:54.471]  I never see anything from you.
[03:45:54.471 --> 03:45:57.454]  Have you stopped posting?
[03:45:57.454 --> 03:46:00.857]  And then you've got these social justice warrior puppets.
[03:46:00.857 --> 03:46:02.780]  This is even entertaining.
[03:46:02.780 --> 03:46:09.327]  It seems to me Facebook is very aggressive about taking down fake identities, fake
[03:46:10.247 --> 03:46:11.707]  I don't think so.
[03:46:33.272 --> 03:46:52.493]  If you look at any of the comments on Facebook or Twitter about Get Me Roger Stone, the terrific Netflix documentary that features yours truly and the important role of InfoWars in the rise and election of Donald Trump,
[03:46:53.234 --> 03:47:07.339]  You will find a torrent of hate, a torrent of obscenity, a torrent of attacks, and you'll find almost none of our supporters.
[03:47:07.339 --> 03:47:14.201]  This, I guess, we get to the bottom line is, how will we solve this, Andrew?
[03:47:14.201 --> 03:47:19.563]  What do you think the solution to this assault on our free expression is?
[03:47:20.632 --> 03:47:26.193]  Sure, so the solution is that alternatives like Gab, like others, are going to rise.
[03:47:26.193 --> 03:47:39.817]  There's going to be a fragmentation of the social networking ecosystem, of the online ecosystem, and there are alternative technology platforms for everything, for search, for Wikipedia, for social networking, for image hosting.
[03:47:40.937 --> 03:47:45.319]  Patriot technology leaders are rising up and are building these alternatives.
[03:47:45.319 --> 03:47:50.142]  You talk about bots, there are over 45 million plus bots on Twitter.
[03:47:50.142 --> 03:47:54.924]  There's over 100 million plus bots on Facebook.
[03:47:54.924 --> 03:47:57.645]  Essentially, what's going on is there's this double standard.
[03:47:57.645 --> 03:48:03.528]  So the way that the left in Silicon Valley works is anytime they use a rule against us,
[03:48:03.988 --> 03:48:07.370]  You know, they can just say, well, we're enforcing our rules.
[03:48:07.370 --> 03:48:18.739]  But anytime a rule isn't being enforced against someone on their side, they can just say, well, there's no possible way that we can reach all of the offenders because there's just far too many people.
[03:48:19.159 --> 03:48:23.802]  So it's this issue of a double standard in how they're actually enforcing their rules.
[03:48:23.802 --> 03:48:25.283]  And they do this on purpose.
[03:48:25.283 --> 03:48:34.789]  They use very subjective, very ambiguous phrases like hate speech or harassment or abuse, you know, things that can be defined in many different ways.
[03:48:34.789 --> 03:48:42.654]  And it gives them this broad, ambiguous scope to selectively enforce the rules, selectively enforce what they want the
[03:48:42.654 --> 03:48:43.134]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:49:07.058 --> 03:49:11.620]  We sit back and we see all of these things happen and yet we continue to use these products.
[03:49:11.620 --> 03:49:13.261]  We continue to make money.
[03:49:13.261 --> 03:49:16.762]  We continue to give our personal data to these people.
[03:49:16.762 --> 03:49:18.043]  Why are we doing that?
[03:49:18.043 --> 03:49:21.484]  Why is nobody stepping up and building an alternative?
[03:49:21.484 --> 03:49:26.406]  And that's really what inspired me to step up and start building an alternative myself.
[03:49:27.958 --> 03:49:35.519]  Seems to me that one of the answers would be an antitrust action by the Trump Justice Department.
[03:49:35.519 --> 03:49:56.303]  One of the things I want to talk to Alex Jones about is putting a petition here at InfoWars to the President, asking him to direct the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust to examine and bring a prosecution against the Silicon Valley big boys.
[03:49:57.603 --> 03:50:00.244]  To me is one of the answers.
[03:50:00.244 --> 03:50:14.208]  We must, of course, hope that they haven't burrowed in in their efforts to wine and dine Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump in their efforts to subvert and put the administration to sleep.
[03:50:14.868 --> 03:50:22.312]  Swift legal action by the Trump Justice Department is the best solution to this problem.
[03:50:22.312 --> 03:50:28.556]  Andrew Torba, thank you for joining us here on InfoWars and on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:28.556 --> 03:50:39.922]  And let me remind you the single best way to fight those who would limit our free expression and a free press is to go to the InfoWars.com store and load up
[03:50:40.442 --> 03:50:42.766]  On the fine products there.

[03:52:05.205 --> 03:52:08.047]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:52:08.047 --> 03:52:10.008]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for Lister's.
[03:52:10.008 --> 03:52:15.012]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.

[03:52:33.302 --> 03:52:36.983]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[03:53:57.431 --> 03:53:58.192]  Effective.
[03:54:15.840 --> 03:54:18.122]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:54:18.122 --> 03:54:23.766]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for my friend, the great Alex Jones.
[03:54:23.766 --> 03:54:28.449]  Roger Ailes, the founder of Fox News, passed away at age 77 this week.
[03:54:31.152 --> 03:54:39.574]  I met Roger Ailes when I was 22 years old at the 1970 Republican State Convention in Hartford, Connecticut.
[03:54:39.574 --> 03:54:58.117]  Ailes was there to film conservative Congressman Tom Mesco, whose campaign advertising Roger Ailes handled and who Ailes catapulted into the governor's mansion, perhaps the last conservative to serve as governor of the nutmeg state.
[03:54:59.295 --> 03:55:13.100]  Ailes was a communications genius who, as a young man, was the producer of the Mike Douglas Show, a very popular variety show of its day.
[03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:19.403]  And on one occasion, former Vice President Richard Nixon was a guest on that show.
[03:55:20.797 --> 03:55:38.627]  Ailes was in the green room before Nixon's turn, and they were shooting the breeze, and Nixon said to him, you know, it's a shame that a guy has to submit himself to a gimmick like TV in order to get elected.
[03:55:38.627 --> 03:55:48.252]  Television is no gimmick, the 22-year-old Ailes said to the former vice president, and if you think it is, you're going to lose again.
[03:55:49.420 --> 03:56:07.787]  In fact, rather than be aggravated, Nixon immediately hired Ailes, who remade Nixon's image through a very concerted effort to show Nixon in a better light, and to make him more likable and more human on television.
[03:56:08.687 --> 03:56:17.810]  It was the beginning of a career that would bring Ailes to being the key man in the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and George Bush in 1988.
[03:56:23.246 --> 03:56:26.107]  Roger Ailes was a patriot.
[03:56:26.107 --> 03:56:29.487]  He was a communications genius.
[03:56:29.487 --> 03:56:48.871]  And sadly, he died with his reputation in tatters, based on what I believe were a series of false allegations against him by those in the Fox News network who claimed that he had been guilty of sexual harassment.
[03:56:49.531 --> 03:56:55.793]  A charge that was never brought in a court of law and was never proven.
[03:56:55.793 --> 03:57:09.056]  Knowing Roger Ailes and his wife Beth, I believe that this was a vicious lie meant to remove Roger Ailes from Fox at a crucial moment in the 2016 campaign.
[03:57:11.377 --> 03:57:20.180]  But Ailes would resurface to advise candidate Donald Trump how to handle Hillary Clinton in the upcoming debates.
[03:57:20.180 --> 03:57:28.263]  And thus, one final act of patriotism may have helped save this country.
[03:57:28.263 --> 03:57:33.825]  And therefore, I say, rest in peace, Roger Ailes, friend.
[03:57:34.755 --> 03:57:38.958]  He's a patriot and communications genius.
[03:57:38.958 --> 03:57:51.468]  He remade Fox, or I should say he made Fox into a monolith that has long surpassed CNN and set the standards for cable news.
[03:57:51.468 --> 03:57:56.291]  And now, sadly, we see Fox being deconstructed.
[03:57:56.291 --> 03:57:59.374]  We see conservative commentators leaving.
[03:58:00.174 --> 03:58:09.962]  Only to show up elsewhere and only to drive the Fox listeners to us here at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:09.962 --> 03:58:17.849]  A fond farewell to a great American patriot and a true lifelong friend, Roger Ailes.
[03:58:17.849 --> 03:58:20.831]  God bless you and rest in peace.
[03:58:20.831 --> 03:58:27.257]  I'm Roger Stone here at InfoWars.com and I say to you, victory or death.
[03:58:42.782 --> 03:58:46.779]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
