[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:26.680]  Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams on this
[00:26.680 --> 00:33.600]  Monday July 16th filling in for Alex today and we have a whirlwind of
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.200]  information to bring you today straight from the studios here in Austin Texas
[00:38.200 --> 00:41.680]  we've got a lot of great guests lined up for you today we've got Jim Mars joining
[00:41.680 --> 00:46.520]  us at the bottom of this hour to discuss the UN small arms treaty and the
[00:46.520 --> 00:50.320]  implications of that and whether he thinks they can even try to pull that off
[00:50.320 --> 00:55.120]  in America where the Second Amendment of course is written right into the Bill
[00:55.120 --> 00:58.560]  of Rights that's going to be an interesting situation but Jim Mars
[00:58.560 --> 01:02.680]  joins us to talk about that also some news that has been breaking recently is
[01:02.680 --> 01:09.280]  the so-called Monsanto Protection Act this is a legislative effort to grant
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.240]  Monsanto a type of immunity and we'll get into more details on that later
[01:13.240 --> 01:17.800]  concerning experimental genetically modified crops that are planted all
[01:17.800 --> 01:22.480]  across the country we've got Darrell Rogers from Alliance for Natural Health
[01:22.480 --> 01:28.880]  joining us in the second hour for that segment that's going to be oh wow you're
[01:28.880 --> 01:31.600]  going to learn some things there that will absolutely blow your mind about
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.800]  corporate influence over the legislative process and the regulatory
[01:36.800 --> 01:40.400]  process in the United States of course if you're a regular Alex Jones listener
[01:40.400 --> 01:44.400]  you already know that America is experiencing sort of a runaway
[01:44.400 --> 01:49.240]  corporate fascist thug mafia government so that's not a surprise to you but
[01:49.240 --> 01:53.360]  some details that are going to be revealed here today will probably
[01:53.360 --> 01:56.680]  surprise you even if you already know all that so so be sure to stay with us
[01:56.680 --> 02:02.280]  on the second hour we've also got to ask Alex Jones segment coming up for the
[02:02.280 --> 02:07.800]  third hour this is from PlanetInfoWars.com people are asking Alex questions
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.800]  and he is working to answer them 50 questions is his goal in this hour I
[02:12.800 --> 02:15.960]  don't I don't think he's gonna quite make it to 50 but he'll I'm sure he'll do
[02:15.960 --> 02:19.640]  a good job answering some questions and if we have time right before that in the
[02:19.640 --> 02:24.320]  second hour I'd like to take some calls and let you ask me some questions a
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.480]  little impromptu ask the health rangers section that'll be in the second hour so
[02:29.480 --> 02:34.280]  we've got all that coming up plus a lot of news on drones and we're going to get
[02:34.280 --> 02:37.600]  into the drone news right in right at the beginning of the next segment but
[02:37.600 --> 02:40.760]  let me go over some of the breaking news that's just hitting the internet and
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.720]  hitting the airwaves today because some of this again okay here we have from the
[02:46.720 --> 02:52.600]  economic collapse website these 12 quote hell holes are example of what the
[02:52.600 --> 02:57.920]  rest of America will look like soon and it then goes on to quote 12 cities and
[02:57.920 --> 03:03.560]  towns Gary Indiana Detroit Michigan I'm sure Chicago is in here somewhere as
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.280]  well the murder rate is skyrocketing in Chicago as the citizens are completely
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.720]  disarmed and unable to defend themselves against predators who are of course
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.880]  armed criminal gangs and sometimes just armed individuals who are willing to
[03:17.880 --> 03:21.160]  commit violent crimes against innocence that they know cannot protect
[03:21.160 --> 03:25.120]  themselves because of the disarmament system there in Chicago Detroit of
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.600]  course has become a black hole of the economy nothing against people in
[03:30.600 --> 03:33.920]  Detroit many great people living there in fact we've covered some of them in
[03:33.920 --> 03:38.800]  the past who've done amazing things innovative things courageous things and
[03:38.800 --> 03:44.000]  so on but as as a whole Detroit's economy of course has imploded for many
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.680]  many years the city is just a shadow of what it used to be services are being
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.120]  cut back even street lights are being cut back in in Detroit and of course part
[03:53.120 --> 03:59.480]  of this is because of the the socialist more like communist political agenda at
[03:59.480 --> 04:05.120]  the top of the country that is moving our jobs overseas on purpose using for
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.640]  example billions of dollars of taxpayer money to ship jobs from General Motors
[04:09.640 --> 04:15.440]  over to China thereby denying American workers access to what we're decent
[04:15.440 --> 04:20.160]  paying jobs where you could actually you know live a decent life tap into the
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.080]  American dream but that's gone now the American dream has been offshored and in
[04:25.080 --> 04:31.120]  this place we're going to have a drone surveilled police state a monitoring of
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.000]  all your email of everything you say on the telephone we're going to have
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.680]  economic implosion now everybody's on food stamps instead of being able to
[04:38.680 --> 04:43.600]  have an honest job it's all that and it's it's getting crazier by the day so
[04:43.600 --> 04:46.560]  we've got those reports and much more coming up straight ahead right here on
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.880]  the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams and we'll be right back after this break

[06:03.120 --> 06:07.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.480 --> 06:11.640]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.640 --> 06:15.680]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.680 --> 06:19.560]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.560 --> 06:23.840]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.840 --> 06:28.000]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.320]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.320 --> 06:36.040]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:36.040 --> 06:40.200]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:40.200 --> 06:43.600]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[08:18.120 --> 08:22.840]  Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex today we've got a whirlwind of
[08:22.840 --> 08:27.440]  news ahead to cover and some great interviews coming up as well of course a
[08:27.440 --> 08:31.840]  lot always happening in the realm of liberty and the economic implosion of
[08:31.840 --> 08:37.760]  America before the break we were just speaking about the the 12 quote hell
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.200]  holes economic hell holes are examples of what the rest of America will look
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.360]  like soon this is an article out of the economic collapse a very very important
[08:46.360 --> 08:50.040]  article and a lot of warning signs of what's happening but here's something
[08:50.040 --> 08:53.840]  else that's happening that I want to get into here and oh by the way we've got
[08:53.840 --> 08:57.840]  Jim Mars coming up at the bottom of this hour to talk about the UN small arms
[08:57.840 --> 09:03.160]  treaty a great interview expected there with mr. Mars right out of Texas as
[09:03.160 --> 09:07.600]  well and of course we're coming to today live from Austin Texas behind enemy
[09:07.600 --> 09:11.800]  lines as the bumper often says we've also got Daryl Rogers from the Alliance
[09:11.800 --> 09:15.720]  for Natural Health joining us in the second hour to discuss the so-called
[09:15.720 --> 09:21.960]  Monsanto Protection Act and why why is the government and these regulators like
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.800]  the FDA and the USDA in particular in this case why do they continue to
[09:25.800 --> 09:29.320]  protect corporate interests instead of protecting the people aren't they
[09:29.320 --> 09:32.720]  supposed to regulate corporations so that the people are protected against
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.000]  let's say genetic pollution or dangerous pharmaceuticals or runaway
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.800]  chemical pollution of the rivers and and waterways and things like that why
[09:40.800 --> 09:43.520]  aren't they doing their jobs why are they always selling out to the
[09:43.520 --> 09:46.320]  corporations we're going to talk about that in the second hour with Daryl
[09:46.320 --> 09:52.440]  Rogers from a in h-usa.org that's a nonprofit focused on natural health
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.640]  and health freedom as well also in the third hour today we've got Alex Jones
[09:56.640 --> 10:03.320]  with his Ask Alex segment that's from PlanetInfoWars.com and he attempts to
[10:03.320 --> 10:08.200]  answer 50 questions posed by readers and I say attempts because you know one of
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.400]  the one of the curses of having so much knowledge as Alex does is that you
[10:12.400 --> 10:15.160]  start to answer one question but it brings in all these details from all
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.760]  these other areas and and it becomes you know an in-depth explanation of the big
[10:19.760 --> 10:23.840]  picture so that's why it's hard for Alex to just answer one question very
[10:23.840 --> 10:26.480]  briefly he's got to actually bring in all his knowledge and all everything that
[10:26.480 --> 10:29.200]  he knows about it and that could take time so anyway we'll see how many
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.080]  questions he he does get to out of 50 in the third hour today also by the way
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.800]  plugging tomorrow a great show lined up for you tomorrow right here on the Alex
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.840]  Jones show I'm hosting it again doing a back-to-back hosting situation here which
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.800]  is the first time I've ever done that for Alex Jones tomorrow we've got a major
[10:48.800 --> 10:55.040]  interview a a worldwide exclusive interview with a whistleblower a key
[10:55.040 --> 11:00.800]  whistleblower deep inside one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.760]  world and that's all I'm going to say about that I don't want to share too
[11:04.760 --> 11:09.320]  many details yet but I promise you it will be an explosive interview with
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.840]  information that you've never heard on radio or the internet or anywhere that's
[11:13.840 --> 11:17.440]  going to be a very hard-hitting interview so make sure you tune in
[11:17.440 --> 11:22.880]  tomorrow for that now getting to the news that's happening right now want to
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.000]  share something fun with you I was walking around Austin the city of
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.880]  Austin yesterday and I saw this stop sign and for those of you watching on
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.480]  prisonplanet.tv you can see this I'll explain it for those of you listening
[11:35.480 --> 11:39.440]  on the radio it's a stop sign a regular stop sign that you see on the road but
[11:39.440 --> 11:44.320]  someone has painted in some very legible white paint underneath the word stop
[11:44.320 --> 11:49.760]  they wrote the police state and it's very visible I've got a picture showing on
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.600]  the screen right now for those of you watching and I just thought isn't this
[11:53.600 --> 12:00.040]  great you know in Austin there's this this sort of just this vibe of people
[12:00.040 --> 12:03.880]  wanting freedom people wanting to be free and I know this is true all over the
[12:03.880 --> 12:07.640]  country and other cities I know that all many of those listening are out there
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.440]  putting posters up our running website blogs and posting videos on YouTube and
[12:12.440 --> 12:16.640]  really just talking about freedom and liberty and why we shouldn't live in a
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.600]  society where we're monitored 24-7 we're supposed to have basic privacy we're
[12:21.600 --> 12:24.800]  supposed to have basic free speech we're supposed to have the rights to go
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.280]  protest without being arrested for it by the way without having to ask for
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.840]  permits from the King oh please King can we beg you for a permit to go protest
[12:33.840 --> 12:36.600]  your policies I mean that's the kind of thing that happens in America and it
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.000]  makes no sense but along the lines of surveillance here's what else is really
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.280]  happening right now the drones we've got major news for you here on the drones
[12:46.280 --> 12:52.280]  here's an article to lead this off this is from EFF.org the FAA has now released
[12:52.280 --> 12:58.920]  thousands of pages of drone records and what they reveal is that flights of
[12:58.920 --> 13:04.240]  drone flights in the United States are frequent and these records reveal where
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.840]  they're flying and how long they are flying how long they stay in the air in
[13:08.840 --> 13:15.880]  fact their locations the frequency the 125 drone certificates and accompanying
[13:15.880 --> 13:21.080]  documents that says the FAA released today total thousands of pages and
[13:21.080 --> 13:24.360]  were released in response to the EFF's Freedom of Information Act lawsuit now
[13:24.360 --> 13:30.800]  what this shows is that drones are being deployed everywhere I mean all across
[13:30.800 --> 13:34.960]  the country major cities and major universities and we're gonna bring you
[13:34.960 --> 13:38.760]  some information right now that is there you go there's a story up on the
[13:38.760 --> 13:41.680]  screen for those of you watching I mean this is information out of Texas A&M
[13:41.680 --> 13:45.880]  Texas State University Miami Dade Police Department Mississippi Department of
[13:45.880 --> 13:51.000]  Marine Resources North Little Rock Police Department Cornell University and
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.760]  many many more University of Connecticut for example so I thought we need to take
[13:56.760 --> 14:03.640]  a serious look at what is the drone near future situation I put together an
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.360]  analysis last night in anticipation of being here today and I want to bring you
[14:07.360 --> 14:09.880]  this analysis because it's got a lot of important information I don't know if you
[14:09.880 --> 14:17.640]  can get a shot of this we're gonna talk about some drone protection fabrics right
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.960]  here on on my left in the studio here is a Mylar space blanket we're gonna talk
[14:21.960 --> 14:26.480]  about why this might be useful to protect yourself from drones you might
[14:26.480 --> 14:29.400]  say why do why do we need to be protected from drones what's that all
[14:29.400 --> 14:35.240]  about well here's the deal drones of course are remote controlled systems the
[14:35.240 --> 14:40.040]  question is who is controlling them now if a if a local police department that
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.080]  respects the Constitution is controlling them that's arguably not a bad thing they
[14:44.080 --> 14:47.720]  can actually fight crime help keep the peace and so on but what about if the
[14:47.720 --> 14:51.680]  US military is controlling them and using them against civilian populations in
[14:51.680 --> 14:57.680]  the United States even worse even worse what if they get hacked by China for
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.280]  example we know that the Chinese government has invested literally billions
[15:02.280 --> 15:07.720]  of dollars in hacking resources they even have a hacking university where they
[15:07.720 --> 15:14.960]  train the top the the brightest students in computer malware development social
[15:14.960 --> 15:18.200]  engineering that leads to hacking you know discovery of passwords and things
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.360]  like that and of course there's the Stuxnet and the flame virus that was
[15:22.360 --> 15:26.480]  co-developed by the United States and Israel according to reports that is a
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.880]  very advanced very advanced what if China got its hands on that kind of code or
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.320]  something similar the question is could the drones let's say there's 5,000 drones
[15:36.320 --> 15:40.880]  flying above US cities on any given day in the next five years and that's that's
[15:40.880 --> 15:46.000]  not out of the realm of what could really happen even based on what the FAA has
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.760]  approved by the way I think they they approve something like laws that would
[15:49.760 --> 15:54.120]  allow 30,000 drones to be deployed across the country so what if there are
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.480]  thousands of drones that are flying over the United States and what if some of
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.560]  them are armed because now Raytheon is working on a small missile sort of like
[16:03.560 --> 16:08.160]  a small hellfire missile that can be carried and deployed by the drones and
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.560]  it's a self-guided missile it locks on target it's got its own navigation
[16:12.560 --> 16:15.960]  system it's got its own cameras it's got its own guidance systems its own
[16:15.960 --> 16:21.040]  propellant and so on so a drone can fly into any area and then launch a missile
[16:21.040 --> 16:25.160]  onto a target whatever target is selected by the drone operator so again
[16:25.160 --> 16:31.360]  what if the drone operator becomes a hacker group from China or North Korea
[16:31.360 --> 16:37.360]  theoretically or what if it's a rogue group of hackers from anywhere that just
[16:37.360 --> 16:40.520]  takes it over because the security is so bad now you might say this could never
[16:40.520 --> 16:45.440]  happen but you'd be wrong because of course Iran already use a GPS spoofing
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.880]  attack to intercept the navigation of a US drone I believe that was a predator
[16:50.880 --> 16:55.560]  drone and to land it on a runway in Iran where they then took possession of
[16:55.560 --> 16:58.840]  that technology and began to take it apart and decode it and try to figure
[16:58.840 --> 17:03.120]  it out that was a simple GPS spoof and recently in Texas I don't know which
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.720]  university I think it was just a Texas State University someone can correct me
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.720]  if I'm wrong but it was a university in Texas recently I think just two months
[17:10.720 --> 17:16.680]  ago also did a spoofing attack exercise to show that you could spoof the drone
[17:16.680 --> 17:20.880]  and make it land wherever you want it to land or make it fly wherever you want
[17:20.880 --> 17:26.840]  it to fly so so we know that these drones can be taken over by hackers or a
[17:26.840 --> 17:31.080]  ground-deployed spoofing force and why does this matter to you and why do you
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.240]  need to know how to potentially protect yourself from drones because again what
[17:35.240 --> 17:39.840]  happens if we've got 5,000 drones in the sky a foreign hacker group or even a
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.000]  domestic enemy hacker group that just declares war on the American people
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.960]  decides to just unleash the drones on the people and unleash the the small
[17:48.960 --> 17:53.120]  hellfire type of missiles or deploy surveillance against the American
[17:53.120 --> 17:57.080]  people how do you protect yourself against those drones so in order to
[17:57.080 --> 18:00.000]  help answer that question I put together some information here for you
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.760]  talking about what the drone payloads could be and the surveillance payloads
[18:04.760 --> 18:08.680]  now we know drones can have regular visible cameras infrared cameras which
[18:08.680 --> 18:12.520]  sense body heat which means if you're walking around at night you're going to
[18:12.520 --> 18:15.960]  be able to be picked up by these drones and targeted by them again they could be
[18:15.960 --> 18:20.360]  in the hands they could be controlled by a destructive force or an enemy force
[18:20.360 --> 18:24.440]  or a hacker force they can deploy radiation sensors and microphone sensors
[18:24.440 --> 18:29.120]  now in terms of payloads here are the drone payloads that we I think are going
[18:29.120 --> 18:33.560]  to see in the next few years number one miniature missiles that can just target
[18:33.560 --> 18:39.040]  individuals vehicles or structures buildings for example and this article
[18:39.040 --> 18:42.440]  by the way this is on natural news.com right now I don't know yet if it's
[18:42.440 --> 18:47.360]  up on info wars.com probably will be soon if it's not already drones can also
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.160]  have high explosive satchel payloads where they simply drop the satchel it
[18:51.160 --> 18:56.560]  explodes on contact drones can have radioactive dirty bomb payloads this is
[18:56.560 --> 19:00.240]  easy for them to do they just get a bunch of radioactive dust which can be
[19:00.240 --> 19:02.840]  collected from a variety of sources I'm not going to give out the details
[19:02.840 --> 19:05.240]  because I don't want to encourage anybody to try this it's very dangerous
[19:05.240 --> 19:09.160]  obviously and only a true terrorist would try to do something like this or
[19:09.160 --> 19:14.200]  or someone trying to set up a terror type of event for whatever reason they
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.400]  might have in mind but they could drop radioactive dust on a city at a medium
[19:18.400 --> 19:24.040]  altitude and create just a total chaos in that city and that would be a terrible
[19:24.040 --> 19:28.760]  situation to see happen drones can also have self-destruction bombs where if
[19:28.760 --> 19:34.640]  they are captured or if control is lost they can self-destruct so evading these
[19:34.640 --> 19:38.800]  drones is going to be crucial now right after this break when we come back I'm
[19:38.800 --> 19:44.120]  going to give you some tactics and techniques to evade drones and this is
[19:44.120 --> 19:47.640]  a skill that all of us may need to use some day if we want to stay alive if
[19:47.640 --> 19:51.640]  these drones get taken over by bad people so we'll talk about that on the
[19:51.640 --> 19:54.600]  other side stay right with us here on the Alex Jones show we'll be right back
[19:54.600 --> 19:57.280]  after this break
[19:59.760 --> 20:04.320]  for more than six years I've talked on the air about creating a social network

[24:11.680 --> 24:15.800]  Terminator music which is very appropriate today as we are discussing
[24:15.800 --> 24:21.120]  ways to avoid the rise of the machines in other words to protect yourself from
[24:21.120 --> 24:25.160]  the drones you know it turns out that the rise of the machines depicted in the
[24:25.160 --> 24:29.600]  original term Terminator movies is pretty accurate except they're not going
[24:29.600 --> 24:33.360]  to be bipedal machines that is machines running around on the ground with legs
[24:33.360 --> 24:37.600]  they're going to be flying machines it turns out it's a lot easier to automate
[24:37.600 --> 24:41.320]  navigation of the air than it is the ground the ground you know ground is
[24:41.320 --> 24:45.480]  very complex if you've ever looked into robotics navigating the ground is very
[24:45.480 --> 24:51.600]  complex but the drones are very easy to deploy in both the ocean because water
[24:51.600 --> 24:57.680]  is is an easy medium in into which drones can navigate and the air and so
[24:57.680 --> 25:00.240]  you're going to see Navy drones and you're going to see a lot of then of
[25:00.240 --> 25:03.320]  course airborne drones which we're already starting to see and they're
[25:03.320 --> 25:06.920]  going to be weaponized very soon Raytheon again is already tested and is
[25:06.920 --> 25:13.080]  about to make available a small missile a small missile system that will be
[25:13.080 --> 25:16.440]  carried by drones and will be able to be fired of course the predators already
[25:16.440 --> 25:20.280]  fire certain types of weapons but we're talking about we're talking about
[25:20.280 --> 25:24.000]  domestic drones being able to carry weapons including potentially small
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.600]  arms fire you know can you imagine your local police department having a drone
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.160]  that can peer into your windows and fire you know two to three rounds into your
[25:32.160 --> 25:38.000]  into your bedroom if they if they think you're cooking meth or something I mean
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.800]  what if they get the wrong address how many times do they raid the wrong house
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.400]  anyway we are talking here on the Alex Jones show and by the way thank you for
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.200]  joining us got a lot of great interviews coming up just straight ahead and this
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.400]  is Mike Adams filling in in case you're wondering where's Alex you know he he's
[25:52.400 --> 25:56.880]  he's he'll be back of course but I'm filling in for him today and tomorrow but
[25:56.880 --> 26:01.320]  now getting to drone defenses this is critical during the daylight you're
[26:01.320 --> 26:05.960]  going to want to use of course a and again let me set the context here okay
[26:05.960 --> 26:09.920]  this is if the drones get taken over by bad people which could be a foreign
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.720]  government with a hack attack it could be a rogue element of an of an existing
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.560]  government it could be who knows what somebody trying to set up a false flag
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.840]  attack somewhere and use a drone to make something happen whatever the case may
[26:22.840 --> 26:26.960]  be you may find yourself in a situation where you need to avoid the drones in
[26:26.960 --> 26:29.640]  order to stay safe protect your family protect your community protect your
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.960]  liberty and so on to do that first let's start with the visual element right here
[26:33.960 --> 26:41.080]  and I brought this this is an a tax pattern camo and the reason that this
[26:41.080 --> 26:45.640]  matters for drone protection and the pattern is called a tax or advanced
[26:45.640 --> 26:52.080]  tactical a dash TACS and the company this is a a licensed trademark pattern
[26:52.080 --> 26:57.360]  and it's you'll see it deployed on a lot of you know military uniforms and things
[26:57.360 --> 27:01.120]  like that these days this pattern is a fractal pattern which is a pattern
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.840]  within a pattern which means that even when you look at it up close you guys
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.240]  get a shot of it there for those of you listening on the radio you can check this
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.640]  out on prisonplanet.tv and see what I'm talking about this is a pattern
[27:12.640 --> 27:16.720]  within a pattern which means if you zoom in and look at it closely it still
[27:16.720 --> 27:21.120]  looks like camo the image is kind of blurry but even from a long ways away
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.760]  zoomed out it still has a larger fractal pattern that confuses vision
[27:26.760 --> 27:32.720]  recognition systems of automated drones now I did a little bit of work in my
[27:32.720 --> 27:38.760]  history not even going to go into detail but I I have a technology background
[27:38.760 --> 27:41.560]  as as many of you know from the software industry and I did a little bit of work
[27:41.560 --> 27:46.760]  in vision recognition systems now vision recognition systems look to to find
[27:46.760 --> 27:50.640]  edges and for example vision recognition systems going to try to find a
[27:50.640 --> 27:57.480]  straight line a straight a square corner an obvious shape like a circle like the
[27:57.480 --> 28:00.840]  the edge of a person's hat or the edge of a person's head for example sharp
[28:00.840 --> 28:05.760]  contrast between colors things like that this kind of pattern this atax pattern
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.200]  confuses vision recognition systems because they can't find any edges in it
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.880]  so this kind of pattern or netting over vehicles and things like that can protect
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.080]  you from being seen by a drone that might be controlled by bad people with
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.960]  bad intent now moving on to nighttime drones we've got this show and tell time
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.080]  here on the Alex Jones show this is a you can probably hear this on the radio
[28:31.080 --> 28:37.040]  this is a mylar space blanket or what's called a thermal blanket and these are
[28:37.040 --> 28:43.120]  available in camping kits and survival kits these block infrared light which is
[28:43.120 --> 28:48.960]  a non-visible spectrum of course and because of that they they keep the heat
[28:48.960 --> 28:52.800]  inside your body the one of the ways your body loses a lot of heat is by
[28:52.800 --> 28:58.000]  radiating infrared wavelengths so this mylar space blanket can keep those in
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.160]  so that you're reflecting heat back to yourself which is why they're useful on
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.360]  a cold night or as an emergency blanket they're also great for preventing you
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.280]  from being seen by infrared or thermal imaging systems and I've tested this and
[29:10.280 --> 29:13.920]  it works great you simply make a poncho out of it or you sew it into another
[29:13.920 --> 29:19.840]  poncho that you can drape over your body and then you can no longer be seen by
[29:19.840 --> 29:25.160]  thermal cameras this is like camo against the terminator is what it is and
[29:25.160 --> 29:29.320]  they're real cheap I think you can get them sometimes for two bucks and you have
[29:29.320 --> 29:32.280]  to sew them in yourself they're not real durable but if you if you have a
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.160]  little bit of sewing skill you can sew them in also practice light discipline
[29:36.160 --> 29:39.920]  if you turn on a flashlight at night you're gonna be seen because the light
[29:39.920 --> 29:43.560]  sensitivity of these drone cameras is very very high so those are some of the
[29:43.560 --> 29:47.280]  techniques that you can use to keep yourself safe from drones controlled by
[29:47.280 --> 29:51.720]  bad people now we'll be right back with Jim March we're on the March the empires

[33:53.080 --> 33:57.360]  gotta tell you so literally running around the office with a pair of scissors
[33:57.360 --> 34:01.640]  which apparently is dangerous I think there's probably a health agency that's
[34:01.640 --> 34:06.080]  gonna cite us for doing that here at the Alex Jones studios all right all
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.640]  comedy aside because we always have to have that element here next is a very
[34:10.640 --> 34:17.400]  definitely not a funny issue which is the oh man it's too funny ah which is the
[34:17.400 --> 34:21.520]  UN small arms treaty and we've got Jim Mars joining us by phone he's the
[34:21.520 --> 34:26.520]  author of numerous books including a book that should have been called a
[34:26.520 --> 34:32.640]  zombie nation but instead it was I'll let Jim tell you the story but he joins
[34:32.640 --> 34:36.200]  us right now by phone to chime in on the UN treaty the small arms treaty and
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.400]  Jim Mars one of my favorite guests to have on knows so much about these these
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.520]  realms and the whole history of the attacks on liberty and freedom he joins
[34:44.520 --> 34:48.400]  right now by phone Jim welcome to show hey Mike it's always a pleasure to be
[34:48.400 --> 34:52.240]  with you hey it's it's great to have you on I always love having you on the show
[34:52.240 --> 34:57.000]  what's on your mind these days what's what's on your radar screen so to speak
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.920]  well I am finishing up the editing on my new book which should be out after the
[35:02.920 --> 35:12.360]  first year call our occulted history occulted history yeah now just so
[35:12.360 --> 35:17.080]  everybody understands I think one of the first senses in the book does now
[35:17.080 --> 35:24.320]  let's get this straight this book is not about werewolves vampires or devil
[35:24.320 --> 35:30.680]  worshippers okay I'm using the word occulted in the astronomical sense when
[35:30.680 --> 35:36.640]  the moon eclipses the sun that's called an occultation and it simply means
[35:36.640 --> 35:44.560]  it or mass so it's what is our history what has been hidden from it and I
[35:44.560 --> 35:50.720]  think it's I think it's gonna be a real I'll be read to a lot of people absolutely
[35:50.720 --> 35:54.160]  I do want to recommend your other books the trillion-dollar conspiracy and of
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.840]  course rise of the fourth Reich your books are just extremely well documented
[35:59.840 --> 36:05.080]  Jim I mean extremely well documented you are one of the best investigative
[36:05.080 --> 36:09.840]  journalists out there today and I I really enjoy your books but let's get
[36:09.840 --> 36:15.320]  right into I'm sorry well I was just gonna say yeah and I think people need
[36:15.320 --> 36:20.080]  understand if you really want to be an educated person forget the newspapers and
[36:20.080 --> 36:26.880]  the TV they're all on control by one of about five major corporations that have
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.040]  interlocking directorship so in other words I have to handful of people are
[36:32.040 --> 36:36.600]  controlling everything you see it here you really want to know what's going on
[36:36.600 --> 36:42.680]  read major books okay and the reason I say this is we haven't got time and you
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.280]  wouldn't even want to hear how many hoops I have to jump through just get
[36:47.280 --> 36:52.560]  published by a major publisher I believe you they have nitpicking editors and
[36:52.560 --> 36:57.480]  they have legal staffs that go through it with a fine-tooth comb how do you know
[36:57.480 --> 37:00.920]  this how do you know that if you got more than one source can you prove this
[37:00.920 --> 37:06.360]  can you prove that okay but that's good because when you read a major book from
[37:06.360 --> 37:11.040]  a major publisher and it's got an index it's got footnotes then you'd know that
[37:11.040 --> 37:13.880]  it's been gone over by a number of people and you're probably getting the
[37:13.880 --> 37:21.480]  straight stuff yeah there are a number of websites now that out send us your
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.720]  press release and we'll make sure it gets to the whole media I could name off
[37:25.720 --> 37:29.200]  for you but you know what I'm sure about Mike right oh yeah and most of the time
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.600]  the media just rewrites the corporate press releases slaps their own name on
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.480]  it and releases it as factual news without checking a single fact that was
[37:36.480 --> 37:40.320]  my point I was reading the other day a fellow who works for one of these
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.120]  outfits and he says it used to be that they would at least rewrite these press
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.880]  releases that come in from corporations and companies he said but he's noticed
[37:49.880 --> 37:54.280]  and lately that he sees his own press releases and he knows there is because
[37:54.280 --> 37:58.880]  he wrote them and they're in his words and they're just being repeated by the
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.160]  so-called news media word-for-word it is absolutely incredible but that's how we
[38:04.160 --> 38:09.360]  get news on on the TV of things like mercury and vaccines is good for your
[38:09.360 --> 38:13.000]  children didn't you know it it boosts their immune system we should have more
[38:13.000 --> 38:18.000]  mercury and a little will last for 10 more or two yeah exactly and you know
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.960]  what some of the stuff is probably true like a little ascertainment I heard
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.640]  you but the problem is it's cumulative it just keeps building up your system
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.560]  until your system just right well sure I mean there's so many myths out there
[38:32.560 --> 38:35.720]  that the that the mainstream media pushes and by the way we're gonna get to
[38:35.720 --> 38:38.600]  this UN treaty in just a second but I have a comment here you know one of the
[38:38.600 --> 38:42.840]  myths is that war is great for the economy it's great so you know I always
[38:42.840 --> 38:46.760]  say to people who and a lot of people believe that people who are smart
[38:46.760 --> 38:50.560]  enough to know better I always say to them well great then why don't we just
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.560]  bomb all our own cities and we'll experience total abundance by rebuilding
[38:55.560 --> 39:02.320]  them hey that's true that's true be a instant urban renewable program yeah you
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.520]  start with some cluster bombs and cutter charges and then you go in and you
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.360]  start rebuilding everything yeah yeah it's just such a such a fallacy but let's
[39:11.360 --> 39:16.840]  let's get to the big issue today that garms thing yeah just for one thing I'm
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.640]  sure your listeners are probably well aware of this small arms treaty and the
[39:21.640 --> 39:28.080]  fact that they're still negotiating up in New York but I can guarantee you that
[39:28.080 --> 39:34.640]  just like City Hall when they have a City Council meeting and they come out
[39:34.640 --> 39:38.760]  and they say we've approved this we haven't approved that we're looking into
[39:38.760 --> 39:44.080]  this that's all been done ahead of time okay sure real negotiations going on
[39:44.080 --> 39:49.320]  behind the scenes somewhere and so but anyway I'm sure that you and your
[39:49.320 --> 39:53.600]  listeners pretty well aware of what's happening in Hawaii but let's talk about
[39:53.600 --> 39:57.840]  you know let's look a little deeper and see what's really going on here there
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.280]  are those who are arguing well it's no big thing it only talks about is they're
[40:02.280 --> 40:07.120]  only trying to curb the illegal international arms trade whatever that
[40:07.120 --> 40:09.760]  means right that's the cover story it won't affect
[40:09.760 --> 40:18.920]  law-abiding firearms and the thing is at one level and and in technicality that
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.760]  that may be true okay but this is just another foot the door have we all
[40:23.760 --> 40:30.640]  forgotten when they first came up with NAFTA okay free trade association and
[40:30.640 --> 40:34.080]  they're going oh it'll be good for business and it'd be good for jobs and
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.320]  it's not gonna be any big deal and yada yada and they ran that on through and
[40:38.320 --> 40:43.560]  now and of course there was a handful of voices such as Ross Perot who's saying
[40:43.560 --> 40:49.240]  there's gonna be a giant sucking sound and all the jobs are going to Mexico and
[40:49.240 --> 40:53.640]  heading south you know and everybody said oh what a conspiracy theorist you
[40:53.640 --> 40:58.480]  know what a paranoid well turns out he's true he was right exactly right and
[40:58.480 --> 41:02.000]  this is the same thing this just another foot the door oh it's not a big deal
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.760]  well right now it's not but then another year or two and I mean first off you go
[41:06.760 --> 41:11.520]  back you find out that the Republicans and during the time of the George W.
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.720]  Bush administration back to up till 2009 they said no we're only part of this
[41:17.720 --> 41:22.960]  this is infringing on our sovereignty and that it will eventually you know
[41:22.960 --> 41:29.760]  emasculate second amendment now Hillary Clinton and Obama in 2009 they said no
[41:29.760 --> 41:35.560]  no well yeah we'll talk you know and I think to give them you know all do
[41:35.560 --> 41:41.080]  credit and to try to try to lean towards their side as much as I can they
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.480]  may have thought that well we'll go ahead and participate with this and that way
[41:44.480 --> 41:49.320]  if we're participating in it we can help guide it if we can help see to it that
[41:49.320 --> 41:53.880]  you know nothing too untoward happens but but of course I think you and I both
[41:53.880 --> 41:58.920]  know that's not it well there their their intentions are to disarm the public
[41:58.920 --> 42:03.400]  in fact every world government says if you really ask them if they answer
[42:03.400 --> 42:07.640]  honestly often behind closed doors that private ownership of firearms is a
[42:07.640 --> 42:12.040]  threat to the domination and the monopolization of power of that nation's
[42:12.040 --> 42:15.880]  government they don't want anybody to be armed exactly that's what it's all
[42:15.880 --> 42:23.120]  about and in fact this is now the biggest stumbling block to the plan for a
[42:23.120 --> 42:28.200]  new world order is the fact that so many Americans have gone but I'll tell you
[42:28.200 --> 42:32.800]  something here's what's really dark about all this is that it what it's gonna
[42:32.800 --> 42:37.800]  lead to is violent and it's gonna lead to perhaps even civil war I mean if they
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.120]  if they try to actually take away try to implement it you know yeah when people
[42:42.120 --> 42:46.120]  are gonna hunker down I know right here in Texas and you know as well as I did
[42:46.120 --> 42:49.600]  there are people here in Texas when they come to take their guns you can be
[42:49.600 --> 42:55.720]  firefight okay oh absolutely it's gonna be Waco to the 20th power but what
[42:55.720 --> 43:00.280]  about the the foreign troops issue so a lot of people think well US troops and
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.560]  and US National Guard won't engage in that and there's a lot of evidence that
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.160]  at least half of the people won't but the foreign troops would do it foreign
[43:09.160 --> 43:14.440]  troops in this country right now right right after the East German army okay
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.800]  when it went communism collapsed did they just all go home no they were still
[43:18.800 --> 43:23.440]  in army bottom came over here they're in New Mexico what about Russian spasnes
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.120]  troops they're over here too but how many troops are really here I've never
[43:27.120 --> 43:31.360]  seen personally reliable figures on how many are here I mean it would take
[43:31.360 --> 43:35.600]  millions at some point it would seem like no no it wouldn't take millions all
[43:35.600 --> 43:43.160]  we got to do is just corral a big city and that's why if armed violence does
[43:43.160 --> 43:51.280]  take place I see it the urban centers versus the suburb in a rural area and
[43:51.280 --> 43:55.720]  that's why they're making all this preparation to turn the cities into
[43:55.720 --> 44:00.680]  the concentration camps essentially homeland security's come around and
[44:00.680 --> 44:07.000]  funneling money billion to the state and to the transport state transportation
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.080]  departments to put in traffic lights where there used to be a four-way stop
[44:11.080 --> 44:16.320]  sign well don't don't forget the DHS bulletproof checkpoint booths and all
[44:16.320 --> 44:20.360]  the hollow point ammo and all that but and you know you say oh that's good we
[44:20.360 --> 44:25.600]  got a new traffic light here but if you look you also got RFID chip readers and
[44:25.600 --> 44:31.320]  cameras and facial recognition software it's all accompanied that okay so that
[44:31.320 --> 44:34.680]  you're not going to be able to go two blocks from your home without them
[44:34.680 --> 44:39.280]  knowing where you are what you're doing also Jim in Texas they're stringing up
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.760]  all these these cables in between the median of the highway so you can't
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.400]  turn around if you come up on a checkpoint exactly that's going in all
[44:48.400 --> 44:51.640]  over the past all you gotta do is ask yourself hey wait a minute government's
[44:51.640 --> 44:56.480]  broke half people are broke everybody's hurting for money why are they spending
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.840]  these millions and millions and millions of dollars to putting up these steel
[45:01.840 --> 45:07.040]  cables and concrete dividers so that you can't turn around on a freeway yeah
[45:07.040 --> 45:11.320]  that's a good I haven't no I don't bet you maybe I'm wrong but I haven't noticed a
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.960]  huge problem with people trying to make it you turn in a freeway no there's no
[45:15.960 --> 45:18.720]  I've never seen it happen even in the areas where they're putting up the
[45:18.720 --> 45:25.240]  cables let me ask you this so Larry Bell from Forbes magazine recently wrote
[45:25.240 --> 45:30.480]  that that this UN small arms treaty quote if passed by the UN and ratified by
[45:30.480 --> 45:35.400]  our Senate would almost certainly force the US to do these following five
[45:35.400 --> 45:39.320]  things and he lists five things and of course one of them is to ban the trade
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.400]  sale and ownership of all semi-automatic weapons which is just
[45:43.400 --> 45:47.900]  basically every farmer's rifle and every pistol that is out there you know
[45:47.900 --> 45:52.640]  created an international gun registry override national sovereignty confiscate
[45:52.640 --> 45:59.960]  and destroy all unauthorized civilian firearms so but how I mean I just can't
[45:59.960 --> 46:05.240]  imagine Jim this actually I can't imagine anyone successfully doing this at
[46:05.240 --> 46:09.440]  least not in Texas they could probably get away with it and in maybe Chicago of
[46:09.440 --> 46:14.960]  course or Massachusetts or places like that but not in Arizona not in northern
[46:14.960 --> 46:20.840]  California Oregon not in Montana Wyoming Florida the mid the whole Midwest I
[46:20.840 --> 46:24.720]  mean come on you know people who think that well they'll pass this law and
[46:24.720 --> 46:28.560]  everybody just give us the gun and the local cops that come around and say
[46:28.560 --> 46:32.360]  okay this is illegal now so you have to give me up give me all your guns you
[46:32.360 --> 46:36.440]  know that ain't gonna happen is not gonna happen okay what's gonna happen though
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.360]  is is that they will use this to start a series of raids just like they're
[46:41.360 --> 46:47.800]  doing on unprocessed milk right yes for God's sake yes okay so they they can get
[46:47.800 --> 46:51.480]  armed SWAT teams to go after milk farmers you think they're having troubles
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.120]  in them after somebody's got a big cash of guns all right and of course the
[46:56.120 --> 47:01.040]  people go oh that's terrible but oh well I don't have all I've got the honey
[47:01.040 --> 47:06.400]  rifle and the self-protection pistol you know they won't come after me but
[47:06.400 --> 47:10.200]  when they start doing this then like you said people in the states you mentioned
[47:10.200 --> 47:13.600]  they're gonna start buckling down they're gonna go no and I mean no and
[47:13.600 --> 47:17.080]  there's gonna be gun fights and then there's gonna be civil unrest but that's
[47:17.080 --> 47:20.680]  what they want that's what Alex always explains right they want that then they
[47:20.680 --> 47:25.200]  could declare martial law and all bets are off and then they can say it's the
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.440]  gun owners who are the terrorists it's the gun owners who shot the the police or
[47:30.440 --> 47:34.520]  their sheriff or whoever it was oh they shot Trayvon oh my god so take up
[47:34.520 --> 47:39.760]  their base gun but you know and what they never point out is is that Trayvon
[47:39.760 --> 47:44.840]  Martin that story that went all over the country it's still being covered and
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.040]  then there's just went on and on and on and on and yet since the first year
[47:49.040 --> 47:55.120]  they've been thousands of people who have saved themselves and their property
[47:55.120 --> 48:01.280]  because they had a gun and they fought off a robber or a attacker oh absolutely
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.000]  you never hear those stories you never hear those stories no and I can I can tell
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.880]  you from from being in central Texas and talking to ranchers and interviewing
[48:08.880 --> 48:15.440]  ranchers you know a rifle is a tool on a ranch absolutely it's not a weapon it is
[48:15.440 --> 48:20.360]  a tool you can't raise chickens you can't raise livestock without a rifle to
[48:20.360 --> 48:23.960]  protect them from predators and then there's the whole property theft issue a
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.160]  lot of a lot of ranches they get equipment stolen I mean tractors big
[48:28.160 --> 48:32.480]  equipment and they need they need a rifle they need a pistol they need a
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.240]  shotgun as a tool of farming if they give those things up Jim they're out of
[48:37.240 --> 48:40.520]  business they and their their their herds and flocks will be eaten by
[48:40.520 --> 48:44.240]  predators exactly and you're talking to the choir here because all about the
[48:44.240 --> 48:50.280]  country yeah I know okay and I mean yeah a rifle is as necessary as a shovel
[48:50.280 --> 48:55.280]  absolutely okay and the thing is you can kill somebody with a shovel can't you
[48:55.280 --> 49:00.800]  uh yeah well let's outlaw shovels then you know it's how stupid this whole
[49:00.800 --> 49:05.040]  thing is it's just insane and the thing is that the framers of the
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.400]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights they truly understood all this that's why
[49:09.400 --> 49:15.760]  the Second Amendment has really nothing to do with hunting or sports shooting or
[49:15.760 --> 49:20.560]  or target plunking it has everything to do all you got to do is read the
[49:20.560 --> 49:24.760]  federalist papers read the thoughts letters of those guys who frame the
[49:24.760 --> 49:31.000]  Constitution and they said it is the right and the duty of the public to be
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.760]  armed so that they could resist a tyrannical government
[49:35.760 --> 49:40.360]  exactly but here's the thing I don't get I want to ask you this how on earth
[49:40.360 --> 49:46.080]  would anybody in the US government go along with the UN telling us what to do
[49:46.080 --> 49:49.720]  on this but I mean I know partially I know the answer for example the World
[49:49.720 --> 49:54.000]  Trade Organization just banned the labeling of the country of origin for meat
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.240]  products in US grocery stores how do they do that that's not a US action
[49:59.240 --> 50:04.120]  do you say how the work do they do that listen I've been at it long enough that
[50:04.120 --> 50:10.160]  40 years ago I I would have bet you good money that about half the laws and half
[50:10.160 --> 50:15.040]  the policies and half the things we're doing today could not be done and yet
[50:15.040 --> 50:20.760]  been done because people have been dumbed down people have been cowed and
[50:20.760 --> 50:27.640]  they've been distracted by mass media and and they in fact and without getting
[50:27.640 --> 50:36.440]  to paranoid there's even high-tech gadgetry the harp systems the Gwen
[50:36.440 --> 50:42.680]  Tower oh yeah we were just absolutely actually using advanced technology to
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.160]  mess with our heads we were just talking about drones in the last segment
[50:47.160 --> 50:51.280]  Jim's will you stay with us for one more segment I have more questions for you this

[54:19.440 --> 54:23.840]  in a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept becoming there
[54:23.840 --> 54:28.040]  was nice videos there was a while ago all right continuing here on this Monday on
[54:28.040 --> 54:31.920]  the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams filling in we're joined now by guest Jim
[54:31.920 --> 54:39.480]  Mars author researcher observer of human history and hey Jim do you have your
[54:39.480 --> 54:43.960]  Mylar space blanket poncho to be invisible to thermal imaging cameras on
[54:43.960 --> 54:50.440]  surveillance drones oh yeah yeah actually I do somewhere yeah you might have to whip
[54:50.440 --> 54:54.200]  that out someday we have we have all kinds of interesting props here on the
[54:54.200 --> 55:00.640]  show but well no here's the thing yeah you go back to late last year and the
[55:00.640 --> 55:04.800]  Montgomery County Sheriff's Office north of Houston now that they were buying a
[55:04.800 --> 55:13.000]  $300,000 drone a they call it a shadow Hawk helicopter that that had the
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.160]  capacity had the capability of carrying a weapon yes also carries a camera heat
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.640]  seeking device and they said oh it's only going to use for hunting criminals
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.920]  running from the police you know as well as drug investigations see if it's not
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.800]  protecting women children then it's to fight drugs of course yes and critics
[55:33.800 --> 55:39.200]  immediately said well hey this could prove a hazard to air traffic and possibly
[55:39.200 --> 55:44.480]  even the public on the on the ground never mind the privacy considerations and
[55:44.480 --> 55:51.440]  they said oh no no no I'll be fine and yet early this year they were going to
[55:51.440 --> 55:56.360]  test a police only test in Montgomery County and they lost control of their
[55:56.360 --> 56:02.600]  little drone that smashed into their armor tank called the bear cat okay now
[56:02.600 --> 56:10.080]  but it gets worse all right because just last month in near Salisbury, Maryland a
[56:10.080 --> 56:20.680]  full-scale global Hawk drone one of the belonging to the Navy it's it's a like
[56:20.680 --> 56:28.200]  about a million and a half dollars worth crashed into a tributary of the
[56:28.200 --> 56:36.560]  Nanticoke River near Salisbury, Maryland and they said the Navy said well
[56:36.560 --> 56:44.440]  fatalities or injuries are quote unlikely
[56:44.440 --> 56:50.560]  well there's the article on screen for those watching yeah Navy Navy drone
[56:50.560 --> 56:56.240]  crashes but you know Jim I've seen footage of small drones almost micro
[56:56.240 --> 56:59.040]  drones this is the way they're really going for surveillance is these little
[56:59.040 --> 57:04.680]  micro drones that can actually fly in formation they can construct things like
[57:04.680 --> 57:09.560]  like building almost Legos in cooperation they can fly into your house
[57:09.560 --> 57:14.600]  down the hallway up the stairs and they can transmit camera images live back to
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.520]  headquarters during all this I mean they can actually explore your entire house
[57:18.520 --> 57:24.240]  with a little multi rotor micro drone and that's that's happening today that
[57:24.240 --> 57:29.120]  exists now that is that's off-the-shelf technology it is well you know here's my
[57:29.120 --> 57:33.720]  plan okay if one of these things flies over my house I'm gonna grab a shot gun
[57:33.720 --> 57:37.760]  just bring it down if it comes into my house I'm gonna swat it with a lid
[57:37.760 --> 57:43.560]  fly swatter and when they come and get upset about I'm gonna say well I thought
[57:43.560 --> 57:50.080]  it was something where them e-wraps one of them terrorist I think good Americans
[57:50.080 --> 57:55.680]  wouldn't ever spy on each other with me it's gotta be an enemy device so I just
[57:55.680 --> 57:59.840]  thought I was being patriotic and I took it out there you go well I mentioned
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.800]  you know one of the countermeasures is gonna be what I call drone seeking
[58:03.800 --> 58:09.400]  drones where civilians can build drones that are designed to fly at high speed
[58:09.400 --> 58:13.360]  into the other drone and thereby bring them both down Jim we're almost out of
[58:13.360 --> 58:19.560]  time any final thoughts to wrap it up yeah there's also this the a group of
[58:19.560 --> 58:24.400]  computer researchers at the University of Texas that all Austin had a thousand
[58:24.400 --> 58:27.840]  dollars worth of computer parts and they claim they could hack into a government
[58:27.840 --> 58:33.440]  drone yeah and Homeland Security Department officials said no you prove it
[58:33.440 --> 58:38.080]  and they did got it got around Jim thanks for being on the show Jim that's
[58:38.080 --> 58:41.440]  Jim Mars everybody be right back
[58:42.360 --> 58:48.840]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[58:50.600 --> 58:54.800]  you've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the
[58:54.800 --> 58:57.960]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[58:57.960 --> 59:01.800]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and
[59:01.800 --> 59:05.560]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[59:05.560 --> 59:10.000]  body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.360]  generator not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and
[59:14.360 --> 59:18.720]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[59:18.720 --> 59:23.560]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[59:23.560 --> 59:30.760]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[59:30.760 --> 59:34.920]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the Silver
[59:34.920 --> 59:41.200]  Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs

[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.960]  ask ask the health ranger section or just take your calls have a conversation
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.880]  about a few things but coming up in just a few minutes we're going to be joined
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:21.320]  by Daryl Rogers from the Alliance for natural health an h-usa.org to talk
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.480]  about the Monsanto Protection Act but before that let's go over some of the
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.200]  other headlines that are breaking today the largest natural disaster in US
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.520]  history it says the endless drought of 2012 will bake America well into August
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.960]  here's the the statistic that is shocking about this right now approximately
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:48.000]  61% of the entire nation is experiencing drought conditions and the USDA says
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.160]  that approximately 60% of all the corn in the country is experiencing moderate
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.120]  to extreme drought conditions and if it doesn't end soon the the losses are
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.800]  going to be quote mind-blowing says the story end of the american dream calm
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.080]  it's estimated that farmers and ranchers have suffered billions of dollars in
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.480]  damage how much worse can things get well it's interesting a year ago we had
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.200]  a drought in central texas very bad drought it was worse than a hundred
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.600]  year drought all the rain was happening in the Midwest this year it's the
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:24.680]  opposite Texas is getting drenched and the Midwest is dry as a bone the drought
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.720]  is getting worse there all the time of course I'm sure somebody like mr. Al
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.800]  Gore is going to say well it must it must prove that global warming is real I
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.000]  just think you know weather radicalization is is a real issue and
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.600]  it could be you know harp issues it could be government messing with the
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.760]  environment messing with the atmosphere chemtrails ionization technologies
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.960]  many things like that as well but definitely things are getting radical
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.680]  and the food supply is going to be well let's just say you should get some
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.920]  stored food now you really should because the food price is going to go up
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.960]  and food could become scarce at least in the short term especially corn and
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.880]  corn is in everything it seems like in the grocery store hey I wonder if most
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.600]  of those I bet most of those crops are GMO corn crops so I guess the headline
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.920]  could say GMO crops are two-thirds of GMOs are dying in the fields that might
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.960]  not necessarily be such a bad thing maybe they should plant non GMO and and
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.520]  rebalance the the ecosystem in the environment bring the insects back bring
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.840]  the trees back and we would have actually reliable rain once again that's
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:41.520]  something to think about next article new ethanol blend fuel approved by the
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.480]  EPA can damage car engines warns a group but just a red flag on this the group is
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.320]  the Kansas Petroleum Council so obviously they have an interest in
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:58.800]  petroleum but I also believe that ethanol is a very bad policy the the
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.760]  subsidizing of ethanol the use of corn to make fuel especially at a time when
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.280]  the corn prices are going up and corn supplies are going to be very low so
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.640]  now because of this government policy to push corn into your fuel tank through
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.040]  the use of ethanol that means our corn prices are going to be even higher
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:20.320]  because corn supplies are even lower because we're burning our corn instead
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:26.160]  of eating it that's just that doesn't make sense you know corn is food not
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.280]  fuel you should eat your corn and burn your gas not burn your corn and eat your
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.280]  gas that's that would be insane but I bet that's coming soon from Obama's
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.240]  economic policy advisors who knows what they'll come up with next export jobs
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.720]  have gasoline for breakfast and burn corn in your diesel engine why not I mean
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.120]  it makes as much sense as anything else but anyway straight ahead stay with us
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.360]  here on the Alex Jones show right after this break we've got an interview with
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.560]  Darrell Rogers coming up about the Monsanto Protection Act we'll be right
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:03.520]  back with that let me ask you a question what does freedom mean to you the

[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.600]  all right welcome back to the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams the health
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.080]  ranger filling in today my website is natural news dot com and of course Alex
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.880]  Jones website is info wars dot com and thank you for continuing with us today
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.640]  it's always an honor to be able to sit in here at the command center and bring
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.600]  you this information about liberty and health and much much more for your
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.320]  safety and sometimes your amusement we always do little funny bits from time
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.680]  to time but now we have a very serious issue to talk about the so-called
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:50.280]  Monsanto Protection Act is that that's sort of a loose name that's been assigned
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:55.040]  to some legislative efforts that are being attached to the 2012 farm bill and
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:01.440]  the 2013 agriculture appropriations bill and these would essentially force the
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.080]  federal government to approve GMOs at the request of biotechnology companies
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.600]  and they would prohibit all safety reviews of GMOs from having any real
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.920]  impact on the GMO approval process so this is well how to say this you know
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:22.560]  how the vaccine industry got itself immunity by having the national vaccine
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.480]  injury compensation program so you can't sue for vaccine damage anymore you
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.640]  don't have due process anymore and then the Supreme Court declared this was
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:35.920]  last year I believe that the vaccine injury compensation program has a higher
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.320]  authority than the Supreme Court itself if you can believe that I guess they're
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.280]  not supreme anymore the vaccine court is is more powerful well now Monsanto and
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.440]  the biotech industry is of course influencing legislators and regulators to
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.720]  try to make sure that there are no questions raised no red flags raised
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.800]  about their activities as people are waking up and beginning to question the
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:04.000]  safety of GMOs and demand that it be labeled of course on foods that's a big
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.760]  initiative in California now joining us to help interpret this information and
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.680]  give us some more details well let me let me get mylar man off the desk here
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.120]  he's flapping in the wind over there what's up with that that's from the
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.520]  previous segment but joining us is Darrell Rogers from the Alliance for
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:26.840]  Natural Health A&H-USA.org Darrell Rogers is the spokesperson for that
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.200]  organization which I admire and check out their website frequently he joins
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.400]  us now to give us some more analysis of the so-called Monsanto Protection Act
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.760]  Darrell thank you for joining us and welcome to the show well thank you so
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.280]  much for having me on Mike hey it's great to have you on this is the first
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.400]  time I've ever interviewed you so it's great to be able to meet you this way
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.520]  tell us what give us an overview what what this so-called Monsanto Protection
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:55.480]  Act is really all about sure this is really turning out to be the best
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:00.800]  Congress that genetically modified money can buy Monsanto has asked a few
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.760]  members of Congress to slip in to really big appropriations bills and really big
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.000]  authorization bills some kind of last-minute fly-by-night riders that
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.800]  they that the Monsanto lobbyists had in their pocket and they kind of passed
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.920]  them off to their family members of Congress to insert into these pieces of
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.720]  legislation they're called riders is because they just simply ride on like a
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.640]  parasite these have these this language that Monsanto sponsored language has
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.200]  nothing to do or little to do but the actual bill that they're attached to
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.640]  these are simply gifts to the industry so you were 100% correct Mike there are
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:41.520]  two sets of riders one to the 2012 House Farm Bill and the other one to the 2013
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.440]  the FDA appropriations bill or agricultural appropriations bill and what
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.840]  they would really do and you hit the nail right on the head it would give
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.240]  Monsanto the biotech industry practically a get-out-of-jail-free card
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.240]  if Monsanto has before the USDA approval system so genetically modified
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.200]  plans and you know the Alliance for Natural Health files a lawsuit says hey
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.040]  hey wait Monsanto you can't get these things approved just yet there's a
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.320]  couple other steps you have to go through and the court a federal court
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.040]  says the Alliance for Natural Health is correct Monsanto you know you have to go
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.880]  through these processes Monsanto could just simply go to the GMO funded and
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.960]  GMO friendly USDA and say you can you get these guys off my back these federal
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:30.000]  courts and the USDA can issue to Monsanto and their buddies a you know you do not
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.960]  apply it to the federal judicial system get out of jail free card continue with
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.960]  what you're doing to the courts cannot stop you individuals cannot stop you
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.720]  science cannot stop you you are free to plan and carry out your genetically
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.080]  modified crops and their approval processes without any judicial oversight
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.040]  well I bet a genetic crop holocaust could stop them because that's that's
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.400]  what's at risk here you know just for the record we don't we don't know for
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.920]  sure whether the GMOs would cause a a massive global crop failure or or
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:07.680]  genetic pollution the holocaust of some sort but the the scientists that are
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.960]  pushing this well the biotech industry I should say the the bought and paid for
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.920]  prostitute scientists they don't know either this is all a grand experiment and
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.440]  that's you know hence the need for safety hence the need for the
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.680]  precautionary principle when you're conducting science on such a grand
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:25.400]  scale with unknown outcomes would you agree with that Darrell you're 100%
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.720]  correct me this is really an infant science that is being that in the entire
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:36.600]  US population is an unwilling participant in the scientific experiment
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.920]  I'm it you know genetically modified foods and crops have really only been on
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.120]  the market for past 15 or 16 years and Monsanto knows and they've said it
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.920]  publicly a long time ago that if you put a label on a genetically modified
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.240]  product that the you know ingredients or GMOs inside this piece of food or this
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.360]  food product that it's like putting a skull and crossbones on that product so
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.960]  Monsanto the biotech industry is doing everything they can to make sure that
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.800]  states the federal government individuals do not require the labeling of
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.200]  genetically modified food yeah let's let's plug the labeling initiative is
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.720]  that label it.org or what's the correct website for that it's a CESDA right to
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:22.600]  know.org and also just label it just label it.org okay okay go to those websites
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.640]  folks just label it.org also go to the Alliance for Natural Health website
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.760]  ANH-USA.org and you can find a lot of great news there you know I got to say
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.760]  I'm a big admirer of your website and your crew there you've done some
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.480]  incredible work you're doing some some legal work some investigative work
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.760]  you're really fighting for liberty I'm just truly a great admirer of everything
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.360]  your organization is doing can you tell us a little bit about your group for
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.680]  those who may not be familiar with it. Sure thank you so much Mike for those
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.160]  those very kind words we are a you know a grassroots advocacy organization we're
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.040]  based in Washington DC but we take action all around the country we want
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.560]  to mobilize and turn the 100 million consumers to fighting in a dietary
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.240]  supplement of complimentary alternative medicine we want to turn those 100
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.400]  million consumers into 100 million activists into political activists that
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.640]  are fighting for their access to organic foods divided by dietary
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.160]  supplements to real information about science and health and you know we've
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.480]  kind of passed ourselves with with that mission and we are made up primarily of
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.560]  grassroots consumers we also have practitioners complementary alternative
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.960]  practitioners that align ourselves with us and some of the folks in the
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.760]  natural product industry but 90% of everything we do and who we are our
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.920]  grassroots activists and you can see from our newsletter articles and we have
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.840]  thousands of Facebook likes we have you know some 30,000 people following us on
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.640]  Facebook and Twitter and this is only over the past two years that this is
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.040]  really just balloon we have so many people that want to become involved in
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.200]  keeping you know government and big business out of their decision-making
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.520]  processes when they want to look for healthy alternatives to the cut poison
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.120]  and and and surgery and pharmaceutical methods of health and healing well and
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:14.440]  plus Darrell the sorry to interrupt but the backlash is growing against the
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.760]  the encroachment of our rights and our food and farm freedoms you've got the
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.960]  raids on milk taking place you've got like the city of Tulsa Oklahoma just
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.160]  going in and destroying this woman's garden with over a hundred varieties of
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.440]  edible plants and medicines and foods just destroying it you've got the attacks
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.600]  on nutritional supplements the attacks on free speech about nutritional
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.160]  supplements attorney Jonathan Emore to spoken about that and Jim Turner has
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.560]  spoken about that at great length I know your organization has taken action on
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.520]  many of those issues the backlash is growing man because people are just fed
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:49.400]  up they are offended by this idea that food and and supplements and nutrition
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.640]  is being criminalized by this mafia government they're just fed up with it
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.680]  and I don't blame I'm fed up with it they truly are and what's it with really
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.520]  fantastic is that we are seeing folks come to this issue from so many different
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.720]  past from so many different political stripes you know we have folks that come
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.200]  through the lines for natural health and you probably see them on your website as
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.320]  well natural news that you know they were a long time you know super liberal
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.120]  hippies or they're super conservative you know libertarians crunchy
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.360]  libertarians and people are just simply you know maybe we're just right down the
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.960]  middle independent voter but they happen to fall out and that they might have
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.360]  gotten ill and they look towards kind of the the modern traditional medicine and
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.000]  they realize that there is absolutely nothing here for me and I want to take
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.320]  responsibility for my health and let me have access to the information and
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.680]  products to do that and if I mean that there are more and more roadblocks to
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.840]  access to that information and that health and to get back to the the
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.960]  original points on the the Monsanto I get out of jail free the Monsanto
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.240]  Protection Act and we mentioned the first one which was the Monsanto was
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:59.160]  allowed to ask the USDA for pretty much a whole past to not have to get their
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.880]  crops reviewed by by federal court there's another there's another set of
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:10.040]  these riders that was put in just last week and to the House Farm Bill and
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.040]  these are almost even even more dangerous because particularly within
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:20.280]  those that set of riders that's in the House Farm Bill it removes farmer
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.920]  protection from suing for cross-contamination of GE food just think
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.280]  about how important that is Monsanto and Bayer and other big biotech companies
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.840]  have lost millions and millions of dollars in courts because farmers have
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.920]  sued them for for cross-contamination other GMO crops contaminated their
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.760]  non GMO crops and when these farmers tried to sell their products overseas to
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.520]  Japan and Europe those boats got turned around and sent right back yeah they
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.720]  lost hundreds of millions of dollars potentially because right if it's GMO
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.200]  contaminated they can't sell it or the value drops it's it's it's almost
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.720]  worthless yeah and so the the riders that are attached to the House Bill the
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.120]  House Farm Bill would remove those kind of former protection for cross
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:11.080]  contamination it also requires Congress right you know Congress asked the USDA to
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:16.320]  come up with an allowable limit of transgenic pollution so that the bill
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.840]  would compel USDA to establish a extremely controversial of a national
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.960]  policy on low-level present so if you're organic crops if you're just regular
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:33.240]  traditional crops become contaminated with GE toxins then you do not have
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:38.360]  recourse in the courts because USDA has set this level of X amount of pollution
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.600]  is allowed in your property hold on a second we got to go to break but stay
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.640]  with us continue on the other side of the break but yeah I find this highly
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.360]  offensive oh what's a little bit of GMO what's a little bit of radiation what's
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:53.640]  a little bit of fluoride in in your diet and who cares that's what the USDA says
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.920]  and the FDA and meanwhile you're being poisoned to death we're gonna get the
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.840]  solutions on the other side stay with us on the Alex Jones show we'll be right

[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:37.400]  all right we've got some breaking news just coming in right now this is red
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:43.880]  linked on the top of drudgeryport.com US Navy fires on ship in Persian Gulf one
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.240]  dead an American Navy ship fired on a boat in the Persian Gulf today killing
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.040]  one person and injuring three others aboard the craft and ABC News is
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.480]  reporting this right now we're gonna get to that in just about five five minutes
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:01.040]  or so but it looks like a Gulf of Tonkin potentially type of event trying to
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.880]  have justification for war with Iran as you know in fact Alex just called me
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:09.840]  during the break and reminded me that that Iran had previously announced that
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.040]  they're going to close the Straits of Hormuz roughly around the October time
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:19.000]  frame so maybe this is some kind of a tactic to initiate conflict and
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.960]  thereby justify an invasion we'll get to that later also another breaking story
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:29.080]  on info wars comm an article by Paul Joseph Watson UN gun grab follows
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:34.080]  State Department plan we get to those two stories in just a minute but first we
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.560]  finish up with Darrell Rogers from the Alliance for Natural Health about the
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.440]  Monsanto Protection Act as it's being called it's actually several writers
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.520]  attached to different legislative bills and my question to you Darrell is now
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:51.480]  solution-wise what can individuals and activists do to stop this I noticed that
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.440]  rep I represented Peter DeFazio a Democrat out of Oregon has introduced
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:00.440]  some amendments to try to kill this but what can consumers do Darrell let us
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.520]  know well first off to support DeFazio's and then to let your member of
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.480]  Congress know that you will not put up for Monsanto just carving out for
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:16.260]  themselves exclusions to to the rule of law so our website a and h dash USA
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:20.280]  dot org on the homepage of our website you'll find that action alert and on
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.120]  top of that the our newsletter articles also give you updates on the other GMO
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:28.440]  issues that are important so we want people to take action on those but
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:31.440]  really when it comes down to people ask me this quite frequently what can what
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.760]  can somebody do about this I there's three things that individuals could do
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.080]  one but with your dollar you know don't support the biotech in Monsanto
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:47.640]  industries but shop for your local fresh organic and farmers markets for
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.320]  your produce and for your food secondly to use your social networks to take
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:56.280]  action we have access to hundreds of people sometimes thousands of people
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.760]  online talk to them engage them in issues that you're involved in and that you
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.640]  find important and secondly take political action natural news dot com
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.000]  the lines for natural health a and h dash USA dot org their action alerts up
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.840]  there contact your members of Congress there are other organizations out there
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.520]  that individuals should not only follow but take action that you can contribute
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.040]  to because it's an uphill battle but we've got the we've got the numbers if
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:23.360]  everybody puts in just a little make the fight a whole lot easier and the
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.080]  results will be certainly significant absolutely also want to plug organic
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.880]  consumers dot org Ronnie Cummins heads that up the Organic Consumers
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.560]  Association which has been also at the forefront of this fight you know what I
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.960]  love about all this Darrell is that so many of these groups you know all of us
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.120]  who believe in liberty and freedom and honest information on food labels and we
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.880]  really cooperate we work together it's not like there's any central plan we
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.280]  don't sit in a room and plan all this we just do it because it's the right thing
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:54.080]  to do we just work together we promote each other we work toward the common goal
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.080]  of having honest food that supports sustainable life I mean it's not
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:04.880]  difficult it really isn't and this is an area where everyone's got their kind of
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.120]  their own niche but but all together it's a big umbrella it's a big tent and
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.000]  we're all working just to for the very very basic principles that people
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.680]  deserve the ability to access information healthy food environment and
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:22.720]  minerals without interference from government or Monsanto absolutely and
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:26.640]  I really appreciate the work that you and Gretchen and the others there are

[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.840]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:12.080]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.920]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:19.800]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:24.080]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.240]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.240]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:16.960]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show continuing continuing here
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:21.920]  on this Monday July 16th 2012 on the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams the
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.960]  health ranger the editor of natural news dot com filling in I'll be here today
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:35.080]  and tomorrow the phones are open right now at 1-800-259-9231 again that's 259-9231
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:39.920]  we're taking calls on almost any topic but especially on the breaking news
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.480]  items that are happening right now again the US Navy fires on a ship in the
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.400]  Persian Gulf one dead according to ABC News and this is also linked on drudge
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.000]  report a US Navy official said the offending vessel was a white pleasure
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.560]  craft but a UAE official told ABC News it was a fishing boat with four Indians
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:07.880]  and two Emirates on board US Navy what is it wrap Rapan knock fired a 50 caliber
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:14.040]  machine gun at this small motor vessel and one is dead but one US Navy official
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:18.480]  has said quote I can't emphasize enough that this has nothing to do with Iran so
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.480]  there is an effort to potentially de-escalate the situation there's a
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.240]  nonetheless there has been a request from US Central Command to maintain a
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.640]  two-carrier presence in the Middle East and that is of course believed to be
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.800]  ramping up for possible war with Iran we know that the United States and other
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:44.280]  nations have an agenda to basically take out Iran and they're probably looking
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.640]  for an excuse to do so so with all that in mind let's go to some calls and get
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:52.680]  some comments and questions from our listeners we've got Duane in Texas on
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:35:02.280]  the line go ahead Duane yeah hey it's good to be here yeah absolutely listen
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:07.200]  I just want to tell you you know the big headline news I think for most people
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.160]  to you know aside from all the BMO that's going on we know that slow kill
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:15.400]  and things of that nature and those are very important but what you got to
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:20.440]  understand too is that with the UN gun grab what's going on now I mean that's
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:25.760]  people's basic right to protect themselves sure you know and and and I
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.200]  think that's the big thing that's at hand right now and and and then the
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:35.000]  community that I live in I have talked to peace officers both city police
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.280]  department as well as sheriff and and and even some military that may have been
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:43.200]  here on leave or whatever the case but what I've done is I've actually
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.080]  challenged them with the question say listen you know the UN gun grab and
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:51.440]  most of them are completely oblivious of course yeah but the second thing I do
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:54.400]  is I say hey what do you know when it comes time for you to come round up
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:58.440]  because of these firearms you know well are you gonna do it you know basically
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.320]  posing the question down what is there well you know obviously most of them
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.200]  are are do not like it but you have to understand that the police are not here
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.160]  to protect us and we should know that due to what the Supreme Court calls
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:17.800]  sovereign immunity they don't even have to respond to a 911 call no no of course
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.200]  not I mean you bring up some good points here Dwayne some some good questions
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:26.240]  look the police know and there's many many good police good people men and
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.920]  women in local law enforcement and I know many of them they know that if they
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.280]  try this kind of gun confiscation they're gonna get shot up by people who
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.400]  are not willing to give up that protection because think about it if the
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.600]  honest people give up all their firearms and the criminals are gonna run loose
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.040]  across every city every countryside in America and be able to just invade
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:50.000]  homes and steal and and rape and pillage without being stopped whatsoever
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.240]  because what are you gonna do call 911 really out in the country really when
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.980]  the response time is 25 to 30 minutes forget it now good good points Dwayne I
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:01.200]  appreciate your call I'm glad you brought that up let's go to Keith in New
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.080]  York who's joining us now go ahead Keith you're on the air
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:10.200]  Hey how's it going you guys do a lot of good with getting a lot of pressing issues out and I really think if
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:15.000]  the president goes ahead and signs his comeback ban treaty you guys need to
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.480]  organize a massive march you know it's a call for his impeachment that would
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:25.000]  make you know it makes him a direct threat to the Constitution well I think
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.360]  that's a great idea Keith the thing is there's just so many assaults on our
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:33.320]  freedoms and liberties there's so much going on you know I gotta say Alex Jones
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:37.600]  was here at the studio working until at least 11 o'clock last night on a Sunday
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:44.600]  night the guy is working 24-7 it's ridiculous we're trying to save
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.920]  liberty here and I know you and others are as well there's just so many things
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:52.440]  that have to be done organizing a march is a pretty big deal but I think your
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.840]  idea will will definitely be taken into consideration it's a great suggestion
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.240]  we need to get that kind of idea out there and maybe when the time is right
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.680]  enough people will just coalesce into that kind of a movement let's go to
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.960]  Janine in Minnesota you're on the air Janine thanks for joining us hey Mike
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.360]  it's always good to see your face when you're filling in hey it's great it's
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.320]  great to be here thanks for joining us what do you got a comment or question
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.520]  what's on your mind well both I have two things I have some information on the
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.960]  drones firsthand and then I have a question for you go ahead my son-in-law
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:34.040]  just he's in the Air Force he just started training to be a drone pilot down
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:40.200]  there they shipped him over to Texas so he's training right now it's only he's
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.200]  like second day of training so I don't have a lot of information about what
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:51.240]  exactly it all involved but apparently in the Air Force you know these guys have
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:57.200]  families and they need to feed their families and that the most coveted position
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.320]  there is is to be a drone pilot well sure you don't have to go out onto the
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:08.000]  battlefield you know it's just like playing a video game yeah yeah but yeah
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.960]  that's that's the big the big catch is that you know everybody wants to do it
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.240]  well I guess so I mean plus remember these the young kids that are growing up
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.360]  and going into the Navy and the Army and these other Air Force and so on you
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.440]  know they grew up on video games so to them this is just the next extension of
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.240]  it but you know the downside to that is that they don't see the reality of the
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.280]  damage that they could be causing right they fire a missile into a house or a
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:40.440]  structure or a vehicle they don't see the blood the bodies the screaming the
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.280]  suffering because it's it's distant and yet they can still get medals now
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:48.800]  arguably for doing that so you know a lot of a lot of frontline military guys
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.560]  have a problem with with that going on but I anyway I appreciate your call keep
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.920]  please keep us informed when you find out more about what kind of training he's
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.080]  getting that would be interesting and thank you for your call let's go to
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.760]  Eldon in Washington now Eldon you're on the air on the Alice Jones show thanks
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.360]  for joining us hi Mike glad to hear from you again today nice to see you on the
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.080]  show hey it's always good to be here hey I wanted to speak quickly about a
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.720]  little program they got going in the Philippines with the vaccinations where
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:21.800]  my wife is from imagine just going through some Gardasil information here
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:27.480]  excuse me and about three weeks ago we are web camming my mother-in-law okay
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:32.400]  she has to excuse herself go to the door and this is in a very rural area where
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.920]  we have about five little houses she comes back to the computer and I said
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:41.600]  what's going on mom she said there's people here who want to give us a shot
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:48.520]  I said at your home what are they do you know ask them if it's a thing called
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:53.720]  Gardasil so she goes back and I've got several little sisters there that we
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.840]  don't want touched so they're going around through the Billy Boy and Melinda
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.720]  Gates Foundation through the Catholic Church over there and handing out small
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:09.920]  bags of rice if they can inoculate you know wow not only that my mother-in-law
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:17.800]  is in her early 50s and had a hysterectomy early earlier last year they
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:22.720]  actually wanted to give her the shot but when they went through the quick little
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.920]  card questionnaire she had a hysterectomy they said well this you know it
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:32.520]  doesn't count for you so this is my family overseas who is not cognizant or
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:37.880]  privy to the information we enjoy here getting you know they're attempting to
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.240]  inoculate them in their home and I'm a medical professional and I'd say heck
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.040]  no yeah this is the I'm really glad you called in this is a great point door to
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:50.000]  door vaccinations we've seen this in the US and you mentioned that they were
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.480]  giving them a reward of a bag of rice if they allowed themselves to get the shot
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.640]  that's what we're going to see more and more of is either financial or material
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:03.400]  incentives to agree to be injected with what essentially are experimental and
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.840]  potentially harmful vaccines with all kinds of stealth viruses animal DNA RNA
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.160]  fragments from who knows what source that is some scary stuff I appreciate
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.960]  your call and it's great to bring that up it's also a good defense just to tell
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:19.680]  them hey I've had a hysterectomy and then it doesn't apply to me that's
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.080]  that's something that every female listening should keep in mind if they
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.960]  come to your house and try to give you an injection just say hey I've had a
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.800]  hysterectomy doesn't apply to me maybe that'll make them go away man but
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.880]  probably soon they're going to start bringing the vaccines with firearms
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:37.720]  especially if they can disarm the entire American public then they know that
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.560]  nobody's got any way to defend themselves against these biological
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:45.120]  chemical attacks known as experimental vaccines let's go to Judy in Florida
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.520]  Judy you're on the air thanks for joining us today what's on your mind
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:55.040]  hi Mike thanks for taking my call um I don't know how much it's been you know
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.720]  brought up you know in in your office about what happened in Los Angeles with
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:07.880]  the the art walk where it's a monthly deal where people come and they just draw
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.680]  art from what I understand on sidewalks and it's it's you know just a fun
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:18.680]  monthly thing that people in Los Angeles do well on Friday night there were
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:25.760]  riot police that came and dispersed people it alerted shop owners who came
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:33.520]  out and it was it turned into people getting shot upon and it was a friend
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.360]  of mine that watched the live stream of wait who was doing the shooting who who
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:44.240]  was shooting it was a friend of mine and I can give you his full name no I mean
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:50.240]  when you say people were fired upon people were fired upon if I riot police
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:58.160]  with what my friend said were 40 caliber foam grenade bullets and box news
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:05.480]  covered it and I think it was NBC and also was in the Huffington Post where
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.080]  they I don't know if they actually talked in the articles about people being
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.720]  shot upon okay guys in the control room can you search on that and see if
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:17.480]  there's a video or something about that that incident this is it's called the
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:25.200]  art walk in Los Angeles a monthly event and and they they turned it into in the
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:32.720]  mainstream media a occupy movement it had nothing I see occupy anything well
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:36.120]  no this is this is about showing the people who's in charge here and and
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.800]  thank you for your call that's a really good point look you know art is now
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.200]  probably going to be considered an act of terrorism you know how dare you
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:49.320]  express yourself on a sidewalk using chalk for example you know look who was
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.480]  the artist that was featured here on the show that drew I think Chase or JP
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.480]  Morgan Bank on fire and then was threatened with arrest or even detain
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:00.760]  I don't remember the details but yeah artists are under attack hey we're
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:05.120]  showing the video right now on Prism Planet TV of exactly what you were
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.040]  talking about there so you're exactly right on here here we're seeing
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.480]  protesters there's chalk art on the sidewalk a lot of people filming with
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:19.000]  cameras a lot of lights and probably sirens we can't hear the audio but
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.880]  clearly large number of people collected there the police look like they've
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.880]  formed a line they've got motorcycle cops there with their lights blinking
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:31.840]  protesters with signs here comes the audio so we can hear a little bit of
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:36.960]  what's going on I don't see any I don't see anybody firing the motorcycles are
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:43.120]  now advancing toward the crowd and this apparently took place last night in Los
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.960]  Angeles and this is from a tip of a caller right here on the Alex Jones
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:52.720]  show go I tell you what keep watching that video there guys and if something
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:56.360]  interesting happens come back to me and we will continue with that otherwise I'm
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.160]  going to continue with other callers because all these callers have such
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:03.880]  great information Scott in Idaho is next on the line Scott you're live on the
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:08.040]  Alex Jones show thanks for calling in hi Mike Adams the real pleasure to be on
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:15.440]  the phone with you I want to address the upcoming war with Iran it was
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.360]  concluded at Nuremberg that to initiate a war of aggression is not only an
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.440]  international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:32.360]  other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:38.080]  the whole we've been at war with Iran for some time now with our cyber attacks
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:45.400]  military scyops propaganda and sanctions we're already in Iran killing and yet
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:52.640]  that's right has not declared war which the the United States Constitution says
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.120]  that Congress has that right even though the executive department stole it some
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:01.760]  time ago no well said the executive branch of government now doesn't even
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:07.160]  even talk to Congress anymore it's let's let's just legalize the immigrants
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:12.200]  let's just declare a penalty to force everybody into monopoly controlled
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.600]  health care systems that give money to big pharma which are now total criminal
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.320]  mafia organizations admittedly on the record you're right who consults
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.440]  Congress anymore they just declare war they just declare themselves to be king
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.960]  it's incredible any any other other thoughts on that you bet you James
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:34.400]  Madison and Madison said and I quote of all the enemies to public liberty war
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:39.400]  is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:45.080]  germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these perceived debts and
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:50.560]  taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:57.760]  many under the domination of the few in war to in war to the discretionary power
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:05.000]  of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.040]  and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:16.560]  to those of subduing the force of the people absolutely look this is the
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:20.640]  minute off but this is why this incident that's happened today in the Strait of
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.560]  Hormuz is potentially very very important that the US Navy has fired on a
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:31.200]  ship there with 50 caliber rounds and has killed one one person that's why this
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.040]  is important exactly right that that's a that's a very important quote I'm glad
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.680]  you brought that to us and thank you for your call I do want to go to some other
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:42.480]  callers here Julio in excuse me Julio in Illinois joins us now Julio you're on
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:48.240]  the air go ahead please Mike you do a phenomenal job fan of your work and big
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.600]  thanks to Mark Rice and others that covered Bohemian Grove did a great job
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:56.680]  this weekend I got two things I was covering the CPAC Chicago about a
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:00.840]  couple weeks ago and I haven't released this video yet but there's a freshman
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:06.920]  congressman from Kansas his name is Tim Holst camp I believe his name is I
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.680]  didn't know who he was but during his press conference he mentioned he was a
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.520]  part of the Agriculture Committee so I thought it'd be a great time to ask a
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.040]  congressman a question on GMO labeling whether he agrees with or not little did
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:26.720]  I know that this guy is Monsanto funny oh really I asked him I asked him number
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:31.480]  one you know with Monsanto lobbying taking place in Washington and so many
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.840]  people are concerned with GMOs do you feel that we should have the labeling
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.720]  differentiating differentiating GMO foods to non GMO foods what he said to me
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:47.400]  I mean he admits to me number one that he's a GMO farmer he has a family farm
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:50.840]  out in Kansas I believe he gets government subsidies I'd have to do more
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:56.000]  research on that but number two he admits that we the American people are
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.720]  already eating some form of genetically engineered food again this is a tank
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:07.400]  Kansas Congressman Tim Holst camp he's Monsanto funded you can look up on open
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:12.320]  secrets admits to me in a press conference I'm gonna release this
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:17.160]  video that we eat GMO food and that he grows GMOs and that is perfectly fine
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:22.720]  that's incredible did you shake his hand and find he has seven fingers I mean I
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:29.320]  did not shake his hand it is incredible because he's saying that you know if
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:33.520]  people want to pay more for organic food they can go ahead and pay more but
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:38.040]  again we eat genetically engineered food already and there's no harm to it
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:41.440]  oh that's that's incredible that I mean but what an admission that it's already
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.920]  infiltrated the the entire food supply and that genetic pollution has already
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.520]  taken place and and he's gonna continue to pollute our nation with his own
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.400]  crops as a farmer and try to represent the people even while he's growing
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.660]  corporate property intellectual property seeds give me a break great

[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:39.240]  and also I'll be back tomorrow hosting yet again with some really groundbreaking
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.680]  info we've got a whistleblower inside a major global pharmaceutical company
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:47.880]  that's going to go public with some very eye-opening information about what
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:53.360]  happens behind the scenes in the mafia pharmaceutical industry which we know
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.160]  is well led by criminals that's just a matter of public record now actually
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:01.080]  with these settlements that have been taking place but let's go to some more
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:04.360]  calls we've got David and Georgia on the line David thanks for joining us go
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:09.880]  ahead please yes sir how you're Mike I am doing great David everything going
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:16.880]  alright with you yes good I will I've been awake since the 60s and in the
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:28.600]  70s I read none dare call it conspiracy and in that book it says that well now
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:33.560]  I've lost my train of thought anyway that's a good look we lose our second
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:38.840]  amendment right the rest of our rights will fall like they have fell in oil
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:44.560]  absolutely yeah we have to keep it from happening I completely know we can do it
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:49.200]  but we need to organize something to stop this completely agree with you there
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.040]  David you're absolutely right the second amendment is what makes all the other
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.880]  amendments possible because without the second I mean even with the second still
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.720]  in place the government is trying to take away the fourth the fifth the first
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:05.360]  of course I mean everything you name it they're trying to take it away very good
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:09.720]  point there from David this is why we have to resist that UN treaty effort and
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:14.800]  support those who would you know honor honor the Constitution honor the
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.280]  Founding Fathers what's so hard about that the Bill of Rights let's go to Chris
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.200]  in Oklahoma Chris you're on the air on the Alex Jones show thanks for joining
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:26.440]  us hey help Andrew has it been good it's good here man how about yourself
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.800]  oh pretty good pretty good I was with the 45th Infantry Brigade and Delta Company
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:38.640]  first at the 279 second platoon during Hurricane Katrina I'm kind of calling
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:44.360]  on yesterday's subject I'm sorry about that it's all right but I don't have it
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:48.440]  just I've always wanted to get a hold of you guys and kind of get the word out
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:51.840]  there for those of that still have that slight hesitation in the back of their
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:57.200]  head that gun confiscation can't and won't happen here it already has and I
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:02.320]  was only 21 years old just really gung-ho really dedicated to the Army
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.040]  especially to the infantry and I did whatever I was told and what do they
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:13.200]  ask you to do all right first let's see the first thing we do is we got a three
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.880]  week a book full of three week old 911 phone calls right and then we had to go
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.720]  around and answering all the phone calls so we were like cadaver dogs for
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:25.760]  about three weeks and in between then we would run night missions and here's a
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.400]  thing a lot of people may think that they'll see this on the news or they'll
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:33.480]  have time to to get ready when you know when they when the crap hits the fan or
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:37.280]  whatever it's just it's a truck you know what I mean it's a group of trucks they
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.680]  pull up they stack right on your home as we did and we broke entry yeah we would
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:46.600]  yell out Oklahoma Army National Guard is anybody in need of assistance but that's
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.160]  as we were booting in the door but wait a minute it sounds like you weren't part
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:55.800]  of the Oklahoma National Guard I mean you were you were US military yeah I was

[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:47.120]  go ahead you were saying you were describing how you and your your team
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.520]  were kicking indoors and confiscating firearms from people did anybody resist
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.680]  did anybody ever shoot back what happened well we had we had a couple of
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.960]  people resist verbally and they got stuffed and coughed very violently we
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.240]  throw them in the back of the the 500 the deuce and a half or whatever and then
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:09.000]  we take them out to the Greyhound bus station which was the police station at
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:15.960]  the time we have a thing like before we came up or for the break like I think
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.280]  it was like the second day we were there this redhead lady came up to our
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.360]  platoons area and she said her to our company area she sat on the curb with
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:28.160]  her knees in her chest just rocking back and forth crying uncontrollably she
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.080]  sat there for almost 27 hours just refused to move we you know we talked
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:36.560]  to her we did everything we could just didn't want to you know you tell she had
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:41.120]  been to a notch you've been repeatedly raped by men and NOPD masks and NOPD
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:46.200]  uniforms oh you're kidding me so no yes so we were told you know at that point we
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:50.280]  were told the NOPD obviously isn't our friend we need to start watching them the
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:55.640]  FBI had us out there at Cooter Brown which is the NOPD Sheriff's Brothers bar
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:59.640]  it's like the big cop bar there in New Orleans just so people know NOPD is
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:06.160]  New Orleans Police Department just just for people who know yeah definitely a lot
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:09.800]  of those cops were then just total total rogue I mean we saw a video of some of
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.000]  them going in eluding retail stores and things like that but they were raping
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.960]  women down there definitely raping women they were we've got two two separate
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.480]  women that came to our company alone and when I was there I met cats from the
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:27.440]  California Guardian and Guardian and everybody and but how it was just a
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:31.600]  free for all ever police from all over the country Dallas Dallas County Dallas
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.680]  Texas Saras down there but how did you and your team justify to yourselves and
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:39.480]  each other that gun confiscation would help this situation when it was a free
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:42.760]  for all I mean isn't that a time when citizens need to be able to defend
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.720]  themselves it never you know like I said I was just ignorant as hell and that's
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:50.680]  kind of something that I worry about with it with the kids today you know if
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:54.480]  they really realize what they're doing you know I had no idea the only time it
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:59.840]  ever occurred to me that something may be wrong is we came up we were down by the
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:03.360]  old French district we came up to this man's house he had a big wooden sign it
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.680]  says I'm here alone with my dog and my shotgun looters beware we thought you
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:12.000]  know it's funny everyone stopped took pictures of the sign but eventually we
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:17.520]  took his guns we left him there with nothing I you know so now that you know
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:20.800]  what you know now that you're you're listening to the Alex Jones show and
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:26.520]  you're informed what would you advise people to do if this happens again

[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:18.280]  information and it's I just hope that the military that you know that the
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:22.720]  members of the military say no they refuse to engage in gun confiscation
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:26.200]  because no doubt there could be outbreaks of violence and a lot of
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:29.840]  needless death and bloodshed if that happens but thank you for your call

[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:35.360]  austin texas alex jones
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:44.280]  hi and welcome i'm christie hi tower here from planet info wars i'm here
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:48.680]  with our guest alex jones who's actually answering your questions from the ask
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:54.920]  alex group on planet info wars dot com this is a special edition marathon
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:59.720]  version so we're doing 50 questions we probably cut it up into little parts so
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:04.680]  so that you can stay tuned so let's get started alex now keep that in mind keep
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:09.920]  them short yes ma'am all right um this first one comes to you from chuck and he
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:13.960]  says you recently had webster tarply on your radio show and asked some great
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:19.400]  questions such as are you a communist to which webster replied and elaborated on
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:24.760]  what he believes and explained as a true american political economic system and a
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.480]  lot has been going on and i know that you have numerous issues to cover in very
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:31.960]  little time but i'd be interested in hearing what you think of tarply's
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:37.760]  comments about this political system he speaks of and he takes he takes a part
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:43.120]  on libertarians he had a wealth of information to support his ideas so now
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:46.960]  that's enough yeah no man i cuz i yeah i did the interview so i hadn't read the
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:51.880]  question but i remember it absolutely look it's a difference of views and he
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:56.760]  claims the american system is this state directed system and it really isn't
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:01.320]  yeah some of what he said is true and it's all a philosophy but if you don't
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.640]  have an engaged informed population that demands liberty and freedom you're
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:08.880]  going to have corruption takeover whether it's a libertarian laws a fair
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:13.320]  system whether it's a you know state directed system when the public becomes
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.280]  a bunch of TV had jellyfish everything is going to go to hell in a handbasket and
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:22.080]  so i you know have open debates about a fiat currency run by government or a
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:28.920]  gold or silver back to ron paul von mis view but overall government centralized
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:32.720]  systems get taken over by special interest and become extremely corrupt
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:37.000]  and generally are the worst system so i mean i've thought long and hard about
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.920]  this i've read the literature and history across the spectrum and tarpley's
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:46.480]  great on history and great on power structures and the eugenicist god love
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:49.840]  him and i saw one commenter one time when somebody called in asked about him
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:54.120]  said don't be too faced behind his back telling this to his face it's on the
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.880]  radio and TV this is not behind darby's back but i promise next time he's on i'm
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.120]  gonna say tarpley you've got some blind spots you you think we should all take
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:05.720]  all the vaccines because it's some weird communal proletariat thing you like
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:10.040]  mcdonalds you like aspartame diet coke i mean he's very proud of this he goes
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.280]  what are you gonna do robinson caruso i don't know robinson caruso isn't not
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.200]  taking you know shots and drinking you know aspartame and eating chicken
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.240]  mcnuggets with a silicone in them so so tarpley's a really smart guy almost
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:26.800]  savantish in many ways because i've been around in person he's like five languages
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.800]  fluently but look i'm savantish in a way i'm sure everybody is you know i've
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:37.120]  got some spots that are lacking i like tarpley he's kind of like a you know
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:42.720]  entertaining mascot around here i mean we all like tarpley as a person it's just
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:48.600]  his belief in the state and the state is the arbiter and and is the birth from
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:53.240]  which all goodness flows i think he's asked backwards in history so i
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:57.880]  disagree with him and that's what i have to say about mr. tarpley good question
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:01.800]  had to have a longer answer we've got one question we're one question down here
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:05.560]  at planet info wars dot com folks this is where you meet this is where you get
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:08.320]  involved this is where you take action we're gonna have a letter to the editor
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.400]  section i want to get that set up with the time all right so folks can send not
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.360]  not not things that i'm gonna comment on but we're gonna have christie sit here
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:21.480]  and read and then if you have a comment that's great i think once a week you
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:25.880]  should read maybe 20 letters that'd be awesome or part four paragraphs or less
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:29.720]  gonna have a role on that and then just read them that way your view unfettered
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:33.840]  goes out or i could read them i mean whatever i'd be interested erin could
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:37.440]  read them erin erin over there running the camera right now because he does such
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:41.920]  a darn good job good job has a facebook following actually erin erin's a rock
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:45.320]  star over there of liberty all right go ahead well this next one comes to you
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.640]  from kasha and she says alex if you could go back in time it's kind of a fun
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:52.120]  question actually if you could go back in time and when you're younger but still
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:56.040]  keep all of the knowledge that you have right now what would that look like
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:01.400]  imagine coming home to the first day of kindergarten being a genius oh yeah don't
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:07.160]  we all wish for that i don't say i'm a genius now i've often thought i think
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:10.360]  everybody's thought of they call the mistakes i made what if i knew all that
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:13.440]  gosh you know back then and i think that's where listening to your parents
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.740]  comes from but we almost genetically are designed to want to get out of the
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:20.920]  nest start our own height get out of the system and our parents are telling us
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.360]  things and we're like not listening to them so there's three ways to learn i
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.000]  guess there's my revelation we're just beam into your head there's there's by
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.320]  experience and there's by being taught and an experience is a great teacher
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:35.320]  because you really remember it but it would be better for young folks out
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:39.560]  there even if your old man or mom aren't perfect they're gonna they care
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:43.320]  about you they're gonna give you some overall advice that's good so it's best
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:49.560]  to not you know detest them because in a way you're detesting yourself and so
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:54.360]  boy i wish i knew back then what i know now what there a particular day you
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:14:00.200]  would want to go back to like that you think about i wish that i that when
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:04.360]  some bully started a fight with me that i just learned to back down when i could
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:07.800]  because it was just pointless i like all those brain cells i'm missing from my
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:11.560]  head slamming the concrete and you know going to jail and stuff like that i mean
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:15.960]  i i would have been less confrontational but in a way again that's catch 22
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:19.240]  because i wouldn't be who i am today if i hadn't grown up where i didn't
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:23.480]  dallas and seen the things i saw so whatever i mean there's no going back
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:26.760]  unless you try to teach your children what you've gone through but they haven't
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:29.880]  experienced it yet so they're not going to listen right you know later like oh
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:33.080]  dad mom you were sure right about that man i wish i'd listen to you that's
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.200]  how older you get the more right your parents get you know it's kind of scary
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.280]  actually yeah um all right well this next one comes to you from chris and he
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:44.840]  says alex a question um are things so different here in the uk one thing i've
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:49.080]  noticed from campaigning in the uk is that the us campaigning is so much more
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:54.680]  vitriolic um do you feel you need a louder voice in the us to get noticed or is
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:15:00.040]  it just plain wrong is that wrong he's well i mean you can do stunts in the
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:03.720]  media to get noticed but i've noticed we've inadvertently done stunts before
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:06.680]  where it's the right thing the media picks up but then they still control the
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:09.640]  message it's like it's like you put out something that they're ready to pick up
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.880]  and make big it's because they can spin it to their advantage right so i've never
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:17.560]  really been calculating about what i do you know it's more of i think this is
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.160]  important this is what i'm thinking feeling i like to impart this and some
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:25.160]  of it resonates with people some of it doesn't uh so it is what it is that's
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.920]  why it's important those things like planet info wars dot com that people
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:32.440]  get together there start their own campaigns get involved meet others
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:35.400]  because there are people watching out there right now who are smarter than i
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:39.320]  am or eloquent than i am or informed who've had life experiences that are
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:42.920]  going to be you know bring pieces of the puzzle that i can't cover that's why i'm
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:46.440]  trying to hire all these great reporters and bring in other graphics people and
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:51.080]  expand the capital i've accrued to try to really go to the next level
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:54.600]  because i realized this is a very important position we're in and that's
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:57.960]  why a lot of times it'll be midnight i shoot a video and upload it it's because
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.320]  i realized man we've got this limited window to actually affect change for
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:04.920]  the good the key time in history what question we up to now we're up to number
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:09.400]  four and i'm moving fast i'm moving fast i'm very continue the interrogation
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:14.680]  here it goes this is actually from user tofu clever username uh i'm a former
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:20.040]  active duty marine i live in okinawa japan and i listen to your show every day
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:22.840]  over and over the uh the rebroadcast and all of that
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:27.880]  i believe in you alex so i've woken up a few friends and they listen to me like
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:34.280]  like uh like you do uh when i go on airbase they scan our civilian id cards
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.480]  and i'm a prepper but my friends think i'm a kook which i thought was kind of
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:41.320]  cute language uh do you think things would become bad for american citizens
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:47.560]  living abroad like me statistically in a world's financial collapse that's
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.720]  designed to bring in a world government
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:53.640]  it will be worse to be in areas where you're not indigenous because you don't
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.320]  fit in you don't blend in with the culture when things get rough you'll be
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:00.600]  the first person gets turned on i don't want to geographically say something
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:04.520]  about you know an island off japan because you know more about that area
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:09.560]  than i do because you live there so i think your question states the
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:12.920]  concern and the knowledge you already have
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:18.360]  uh but you know if it does cultural bounds mean nothing as we're all human
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:21.080]  in the final equation if you've got really good friends you've known for
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:24.040]  years uh you know the cultural differences can be
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:27.800]  bridged there it's it's just that uh i don't know the
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:31.640]  japanese are known for being the opposite of lawless so
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:35.000]  depends a pretty good place to be during a crisis you think americans would act
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.920]  that polite and nice during a nuclear meltdown you got nothing come it'd be
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:45.080]  looting mass murder and death and burning cities if we had a something like you
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:48.200]  had i mean instead like crime went down when they
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:51.080]  got hit by tidal waves and had reactors blow up
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:54.600]  instead here it'd be like oh yeah so i mean i don't know now it's from thinking
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:59.640]  about your geographic and cultural locale i even though it's an island
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:02.760]  things are more expensive you're an island off an island he said okinawa
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:05.880]  right um you know that's a problem for cost during a
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.920]  collapse but i don't know i mean there couldn't be a more
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:15.000]  uh kind forgiving people yeah i mean just just orderly focused people too
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.080]  prideful to be crooks on average in the japanese so i
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:22.920]  i'm not going to judge it but it's a mixed bag uh all right this next one
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.760]  comes to you from noah and he says is there any proof that british labor party
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:29.640]  politicians john smith and robin cook were
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:33.880]  assassinated by associates of tony blair i think that kind of alludes to
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:36.920]  there's overwhelming evidence that happened people can look into it when
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:39.400]  they would come out and see al-qaeda's fate the government runs it boom you'd
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:42.840]  have a heart attack next day uh show yeah no i mean they kill people all the
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:46.120]  time i mean i mean you had dr david kelly shed they told me i'll be killed
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:49.160]  and found the woods if i tell you but it's all fake there's no wmd's and then
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:52.440]  a guy walking his dogs he's five guys in black uniforms leaving the body running
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:55.080]  away the the wrists are slit no blood at the scene
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:58.760]  then they say he took pills and died but two undissolved pills were in the stomach
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:01.800]  this one comes to you from forgive me if i can't say it right
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.040]  vethom i think uh alex i've heard you mentioned some things about ronald
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:09.640]  reagan's assassination attempt and the medical care he received afterwards
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:13.480]  that somehow diminished his mental capacity i've been unable to find
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.440]  anything else on this could you expand on the topic a bit
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:21.000]  maybe provide a resource material well here's the good news and the bad news
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.680]  i'm not looking at these questions beforehand sometimes she'll ask me a
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:27.800]  question about one of them because she wants to know before we go to them
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.480]  but i have not seen your questions so i don't have time to go look up the stuff
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:32.920]  because if we did we never even get to this
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:38.440]  yeah um multiple guests over the years i think tv news
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:41.800]  pieces were done at the time that you know reagan was incapacitated a few
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:44.280]  weeks because of some cold blood he was given
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:47.480]  if you do that it can cause kind of like a overall stroke like effect in the
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:50.360]  brain the fact that he would he would be asleep for days and
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:53.480]  suddenly be animated and the word is they use that to kind of get control of
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:56.440]  him medically but we should look into that
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:19:59.080]  perhaps you can do it christie for next time so we can like
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:02.760]  let a star and then come back and say this is alex jones with five good
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:05.640]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:09.480]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:12.360]  bill number two our new energies are wants to
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:15.640]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:19.880]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:23.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:27.960]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:31.800]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:34.920]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:38.840]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:41.720]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:44.840]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:09.880]  this next one comes to you from glenn he says smoking used to be ubiquitous
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:13.800]  it was everywhere tv billboards movies even in comic books
[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:17.640]  smokers are some of the most stubborn people i know in your opinion was
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:21.880]  smoking a beta test for getting rid of an individual's rights
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:25.720]  yes it is i mean it was Edward Bernays and other propagandists that helped sell
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:29.720]  that you know be radical be a feminist smoke cigarettes in the 20s and 30s
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:34.360]  Liberty torches and then the system decided you know for whatever reason
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:37.240]  okay well we can kill them through vaccines and gmo
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:42.120]  let's have the test to ban something that people know is unhealthy
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.160]  and the next it's popcorn milk products and soft drinks and salt
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.240]  now not new york but spreading all over so it's kind of a globalist
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:54.440]  system where they try to get standardized laws all over the world and
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:57.720]  yes it was undoubtedly a beta test i mean they're one of the oldest men in
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.240]  the world over 105 years old smokes a pack of cigarettes every day
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:04.440]  i'm not saying it's good genetically some people can handle it
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.680]  other people it's a death warrant not a good idea to be pulling a bunch of dirty
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:12.360]  smoke it's not just the tobacco they had hundreds of chemicals in those things
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:14.600]  to make them more addictive to make you smoke more
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:18.360]  oh yeah uh so uh you know the weird thing is i've always smoked on her
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:21.480]  off cigars cigarettes you name it i'm a big tobacco guy
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:26.120]  but i one time for six years i quit we're suddenly it's stunk i didn't like it
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:29.480]  and finally again about a year ago i quit and now it stinks and it's horrible
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:33.480]  i have no desire for it so it's like thank god i actually prayed to get me
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:36.520]  off those things and it happened because now when i smell
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:38.680]  somebody smoking a cigarette makes me want to throw up
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:41.560]  nice to wonder why i'd be outside a restaurant or something smoke a cigarette
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:45.080]  and people walk by go oh we gotta smell your smoke i get mad at them
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:48.680]  but now i really get it it's like as i smell it it just smells like
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:51.640]  it's interesting what knowledge does to you too i mean the more you learn about
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:55.160]  how bad something is you you like cultivate this desire to really get
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:59.240]  rid of it i mean the idea of like what it does to your lungs or how it affects
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:00.920]  your body oh it's well it's it's also you know
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:04.280]  many radioactive isotopes are in it oh i don't even i don't i didn't even know
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:08.120]  this but like somehow it's strange the tobacco
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.360]  puts on it's weird people can look it up it sounds crazy but i had a during
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:17.400]  Fukushima i'd already quit smoking so it's over a year now but i had
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:21.480]  nuclear physicist dr bob bowman on the show he was like well don't worry too
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:24.440]  much about Fukushima they're getting a lot of radiation but what we get is
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:26.920]  less than somebody that smokes cigarettes for a few years
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:30.280]  he goes you know you get all these rads off of smoking and i went and i thought
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:34.040]  that's crazy so i'm looking it up i didn't know it was like well known
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.560]  that the tobacco i guess oh but sad issue go ahead to the next point
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:40.760]  yeah no that's fascinating uh we're obviously gonna get through 50 let's do
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:43.640]  20 we'll do we'll do we'll do 25 tomorrow okay
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:46.920]  we'll just what's the next one this one is actually
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.240]  a more complex question it says allied governments are covering up non hiv
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:55.720]  cases and this girl actually her name is Kayla and she says like mine
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:27:00.360]  under the chronic fatigue syndrome and how can hiv deemed
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:04.040]  to cause aids when there are millions of non hiv
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:08.760]  aids cases and i actually researched a little bit of this on my own in 1993
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:14.200]  the um the cbc actually said that if your t-cell count is less than 200
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:21.160]  then you have hiv and so it skyrocketed those number of cases
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:25.000]  so i mean yeah you don't have the virus but you have an autoimmune disorder right
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.280]  which is actually things they've done through different
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:31.720]  vaccines foods and things they're actually
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:34.760]  engineering it and it's a very complex issue and then
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:38.840]  hiv is really the cover for other bio weapons they're running in africa
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:42.200]  i mean why is it they've the bbc even had to admit like a decade ago that they
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:46.600]  went and checked all these women the young women that had uh hiv and and
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:52.440]  and and they checked them and they'd never had intercourse so how did they
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:55.800]  have hiv and they said well it must have been dirty needles in the vaccine
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.720]  process so so how is it that someone in the west
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:03.000]  can have hundreds of partners and not get it but people that haven't ever had
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.560]  any partners i was oh they're having a lot of sex over in africa
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:09.880]  no no no they're shooting them up with it and then and then with it is a trace
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:13.480]  virus hiv which they're always claiming is
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:17.000]  changing it's just a covered excuse for bio weapons operations
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.520]  that are going on so it's a very sophisticated
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:24.040]  very sophisticated topic yeah something about it expanded to like
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:28.280]  pneumonia like all the stds i mean it was like a huge
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.040]  huge situation that'd be an interesting one it's just a general cover name
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:35.160]  and then big pharma sells a bunch of drugs to people that are like chemo
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:37.880]  drugs that kill them yeah azt was actually like the
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:41.880]  number one causing killer for liver like your liver would fail if you took azt
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:45.880]  back in the 80s yeah anyways uh sorry side note uh
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:49.080]  this is actually kind of a combination of questions
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:53.000]  but it's all along the same topic it's from blade runner and authoritarian
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:56.440]  hater uh so when i tell sheeple about
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:59.720]  aspartame and smart meters they all look at me like i'm nuts
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.280]  so their answer to my aspartame warning is yeah right i feel fine i don't have
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:07.560]  rashes headaches etc so how do i explain it
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:10.280]  the the same with the smart meters they don't believe me
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:14.520]  and they say so and then they they tell me to prove it and it seems to me
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:17.640]  like they just want to contradict the idea that it's so
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:21.080]  it's so out there sure they've been given hypnotic programming
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:24.520]  this is on record through the television they're in a near dreamlike state
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:28.120]  when you upset them out of their trance state they get upset and say prove it
[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:30.520]  prove it and even if you prove it they don't want to hear it
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:33.960]  right i mean it's admitted aspartame is causing all these medical problems it's
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:37.800]  not debated back in the 80s when they approved it they knew that
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:40.840]  it's not debated there's a world government but they'll still laugh at
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:45.000]  you and say it doesn't exist even though it's in the newspapers
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:49.880]  and people like that are just damaged goods you got to move on past them

[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:19.240]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:19.240 --> 02:32:23.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:27.320]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:31.240]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:34.360]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:13.880]  uh so when i tell sheeple about astrotame and smart meters they all
[02:33:13.880 --> 02:33:16.760]  look at me like i'm nuts so their answer to my
[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:21.800]  astrotame warning is yeah right i feel fine i don't have rashes headaches etc
[02:33:21.800 --> 02:33:25.880]  so how do i explain it the the same with the smart meters they don't believe me
[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:28.840]  and they say so and then they they tell me to prove it
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:33.240]  and it seems to me like they just want to contradict the idea that it's so
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:36.680]  it's so out there sure sure they've been given hypnotic programming
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:40.040]  this is on records of the television they're in a near dreamlike state
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:43.720]  when you upset them out of their trance state they get upset and say prove it
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:46.040]  and even if you prove it they don't want to hear it
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:49.480]  right i mean it's admitted aspartame is causing all these medical problems it's
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:53.400]  not debated back in the 80s when they approved it they knew that
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:56.360]  it's not debated there's a world government but they'll still laugh at
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:00.600]  you and say it doesn't exist even though it's in the newspapers
[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:05.480]  and people like that are just damaged goods you got to move on past them
[02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:08.440]  because they're so afraid at a subconscious level
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:11.880]  and they've been so programmed they're going to put up a defense
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:15.240]  it's it's like an obsessive compulsive thing
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:18.520]  and a lot of them think you're showing off when you try to warn them because
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:22.040]  they would never try to warn anybody they've got such a low self-image
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:25.560]  that they don't care about warning others so they think you're showing off to
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:29.720]  them and like they're pathetic right and it's also a childlike delusional
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:33.640]  is you know where they think if they deny something magically it goes away
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:37.960]  so there's a lot of psychological things and they are sad little victims
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:42.200]  uh that we got a triage and we try to warn them don't feel bad when they attack
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:46.440]  you move on to the next zombie because some zombies have not succumbed to the
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:50.760]  full zombieosis yet okay and so you have to move on
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:55.080]  from that person to the next person okay this one i can't help i've got to move
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:57.240]  on it's awesome yeah keep moving forward i
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:00.280]  like that but it's not just zombies and there's vampire
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.240]  control agents to use a popular term you know use something
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:06.440]  probably you know who are like into the evil they know something's going on
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:09.560]  like maws to flame they want to serve it as like wrenfield as if they're going to
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:12.520]  get out of it by doing that and they know they can manipulate they know the
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:15.240]  public's asleep and they're swimming around like a
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:18.680]  you know vampire eel around the unconscious person
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:22.360]  going don't wake them up you know like a little bulldog swimming around them
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:26.200]  loving the fact that they're on and they can program them getting off on the
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:29.640]  power they have a sleeping person they can manipulate
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:32.520]  you understand that so many sci-fi movies just popped into my head right now
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:35.720]  well i mean there's so many levels to this but there's a lot of yuppies and
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:40.120]  people that are into the like oh i can make money and be powerful in the system
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.080]  but but but they're they're asleep at another level as well
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.680]  it's only master you know social engineer level that has the whole image in
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:48.760]  their mind it's a desire for truth that i think
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:53.560]  people are truly scared of uh all right so this comes from jisk
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:57.000]  uh he actually wrote an accompanying article for it i'll reference it here in
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.480]  a second he says have you looked into leo
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:03.240]  wanta and these trillions of dollars yeah not true not real
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:06.840]  it's not true not true not really well there you go there you have it
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:13.240]  uh i mean i mean yeah it's not as real uh as the easter bunny i mean you know
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:15.400]  it's not as real i love talking about easter bunnies you know it's a little
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.160]  joke you always make me giggle when you say that
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:20.600]  i know i'll overdo it the point is so ridiculous
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:23.960]  it's as real as those nigerian letters you get in the mail
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:27.880]  okay the scammers idea well maybe they're real i mean
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:30.920]  people i had people call me up and go hey i got this nigerian letter they're
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:33.320]  offering a million dollars i pay them five thousand they want to believe their
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:36.040]  ships come in yeah i go no that's about a 10 year old
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:38.840]  internet scam it's not real and i've had families
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:42.840]  distant families say no my million is here i'm sending my five thousand
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.760]  and then you send your five thousand and then you get the you get the uh email
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:50.200]  back on oh that wasn't quite enough five thousand more is needed
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:54.040]  and sometimes they do four or five payments and you know who they're angry
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:56.840]  at after they get ripped off you for telling them
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:00.680]  they're not angry at the nigerian scammer because they always get emailed at
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:05.480]  prince hobbe got arrested of course i mean it wasn't that he couldn't
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:09.640]  prince hobbe got arrested people once they're getting scammed
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:13.640]  they they just get deeper and deeper into the fraud yeah
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:18.440]  i mean i mean and and and and that's what they want it's what they get
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:22.120]  this next one comes to you from john and he says alex did you know that
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:26.280]  uh in the big reeducation camp pdf that you discovered weeks ago there was a
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:29.560]  section where they talk about the army squatting
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:32.520]  community centers can you clarify what a fema
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:37.240]  drc disaster recovery center actually is there's actually one
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:43.160]  located near me well again there are real disasters there's real reasons for
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:46.280]  this so they they kind of cluster real issues of
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.040]  hurricanes earthquakes within it that's part of it and then it just has takeover
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:53.560]  local government done confiscation it's all
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:57.800]  so there's some legitimate functions and that's how they always sell it
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:00.920]  come like the army does jaws of life for car wrecks like well are you against the
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:03.320]  army being here they're just hoping this poor man
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:07.240]  yeah are you against the air force spraying mosquitoes in florida
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:12.120]  that's our military getting the job done so so there's just this mission creep
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:15.320]  where it's just an acclamation and they they do things that they think are
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:18.360]  going to be popular up front so the troops feel good being in the
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.320]  community the troops being brainwashed too
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:24.680]  so it's just a conditioning process for the police the military the public
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:28.840]  we're all in the same boat yeah well this next one actually comes to you from
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:32.440]  freedom angel uh what do you know about project
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:36.520]  athena how come kathryn i'll breach never talked about it
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:40.440]  being from mit as she had some dealings with them
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:43.720]  i have no idea uh you'll have to look into this i have we will start that
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:46.200]  question yeah i have no i might as well ask
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:50.200]  me about lucky charms or something these times that they jump over the rainbow
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:53.960]  yeah i know i mean all that was greek all right well this next thing comes to
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:56.840]  you from tori and uh she says why do some states like
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.680]  texas have state guards and how powerful are they in relation to the police
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:04.360]  departments the regular military that's a good question yeah you kind of
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:07.800]  touched on that today in today's show i heard you say something about
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:11.080]  state police or something to that effect so well i mean i'm actually trying to
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:14.520]  work on a piece on this it's funny that they asked that question
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:18.680]  that's the original vestigial
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:22.600]  shadow of the state militia because all the state militia was they demonized the
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:27.240]  news was a posse or a civil defense so that if the
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:32.040]  sheriff who's elected needs a group of people for fires or for whatever
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:34.680]  he can go around and find out or she can go around and find out whoever they
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:37.400]  think's good and whoever's willing to get something done
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:41.160]  hey you know you got bulldozers there's fires coming this way get over here
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:44.760]  you know get on the radio get on local radio tv back in the old days you know
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:48.360]  ride on your horse hey get down here we need help you know get your buckets the
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:52.840]  town's on fire and so states have guards and they
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:55.640]  also have the national guard originally it was state guards and they set up
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:58.520]  national guards with some of the governors now they basically federalize
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:00.920]  those for their federal so they're even getting rid of the state
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:04.440]  having its quote national guard and so it's it's really what's left of the
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:07.480]  militia awesome that's actually really
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:13.240]  informative uh the mitz mitzier e is this user what
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:17.160]  do you think about romney saying no congressional approval needed to bomb
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:21.720]  iran and he's not alone in saying that hey he likes obama's healthcare you know
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:24.680]  saying he says he's against it but he helped ride it but then we got to do
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:28.520]  what the supreme court said and the irs taxing this is an attacks
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:32.440]  and it's a standard india he supports secret arrest drone killing
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:36.520]  endless war warrantless wiretappings open borders
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:40.280]  carbon taxes he's bought and paid for by the exact same people
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:43.960]  bane's given double the money that he's part owner of and used to head
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:49.800]  to obama than they even gave him uh mit romney so i mean mit romney is is it
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:52.600]  it's just the fixes in if they don't steal the election they don't need to
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:55.960]  they got mit romney they win whether they steal it whether obama gets in
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:59.640]  whether it's mit romney i mean mit romney might as well be
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:02.360]  i got an idea how about mit romney be vp for obama
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:05.320]  you know joe biden can get out of there and we'll just i mean it's just
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:09.000]  it's like but we're beating obama we're gonna get mit romney in there yeah
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:13.160]  of course do you see that that cartoon we had on info words today it was the
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:16.360]  the sheep and it was like whichever way you choose and it all funneled into the
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:20.200]  same place i didn't see it but yeah it's into that
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:24.040]  vaughn comes to you and he asked alex i'm curious to get your take on the
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:30.920]  inevitable emerging cloning technology and implications on society
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:34.200]  well clones have inherent genetic problems
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:38.200]  and it's all part of humanity playing god uh just like
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.880]  an iphone has tech built into it that you pay for when you buy it
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:46.760]  to spy on you the globalists have said with their
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:49.560]  medical tyranny that they're not going to give us any
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:52.600]  like they sterilize us but then come and say we have a technology so you can have
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:56.760]  a child but then they're going to get rid of traits that are bad in the child
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:02.120]  that means build into it what they want uh and so this whole thing is a medical
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:06.520]  mad scientist tyranny and it it's strap yourselves in we're going to
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:10.440]  see some very very crazy times but we should do a whole special
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:14.120]  on cloning because we're already eating clone meat
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:18.680]  milk from cloned cows they're doing cross species weird clones i mean it's
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:22.600]  the sky's the limit we're living in this planet is like a giant biological
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:27.000]  weapons experiment or something yeah you don't know it's real anymore
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.560]  uh glitch says as a child i read prisoners of power it's a sci-fi book
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:35.400]  written by a russian duo and the the brothers back in the night they wrote
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:38.440]  it in the 1960s since then i've read the book many times
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:43.000]  discovering new aspects of the world that they painted in 2010 and 2011
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.240]  the biggest sci-fi movie ever made in russia came out in two parts
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:51.720]  the name of the movie was inhabited island and essentially the story parallels
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:55.000]  many of today's trends so probably some of the most notable of them are
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  radiation towers affecting people's minds propaganda brainwash etc
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.360]  so uh i'm sorry i kind of lost my question
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:10.440]  can we find other articles that are like that is there any other like sci-fi
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:13.240]  movie or anything else that you've you've seen i've
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:16.360]  i've noticed articles that you know we see a cartoon that it's painted the
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:19.560]  future etc of yeah i mean all these movies and
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:22.760]  cultures show a dystopia it's like just get ready for it that's what
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:25.640]  happens in the future the government says how many kids you can have
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:29.240]  in the future you're going to be watched and controlled because eugenicist
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:31.960]  to develop most the modern technologies we have they steered them they
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:35.480]  controlled them robber barons and royalty believed in all this so
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:39.160]  they've built the culture we're in and this is the world they're taking us to
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:42.200]  i haven't seen that film or read that book but it sounds intriguing
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:45.880]  yeah well maybe we'll follow up with that too
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:50.200]  uh everyone this is from freedom spear and he says everyone knows that having
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:53.960]  present a preventative medicine surgery and dental work whatever
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:57.320]  is not an inalienable right and we actually touched on that in one of
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:00.840]  the last ascolic segments moreover passing a law that mandates
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:04.520]  purchasing such services products anything else is completely unconstitutional
[02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:06.760]  and very illegal we've again we've covered it
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:11.560]  what organization or enforcement arm has the authority to arrest the supreme
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:15.880]  court justices responsible for this illegal activity
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:20.840]  congress can defund them congress it's not really a separation of powers the
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:23.400]  way we've been taught congress is dominant
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:26.360]  then there's the courts then there's the executive
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:30.440]  so there's a separation of powers but because congress is 500 plus people
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:33.400]  it's got the real power and that's why the globalists have
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:37.880]  sold it out and gotten it to be weakened and transferred into nine justices
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:41.400]  they can control in one president and then a bureaucracy
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:45.480]  uh but it's up to the states to nullify and not follow
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:49.560]  and and and find it's up to us individually because it's not like
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:52.600]  they're trying to give free health care to people that others pay for
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:57.240]  it's the these are eugenicists tyrants they're now using this to control
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:02.360]  people so that's the main issue with the health care takeover
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:05.880]  the next one is from thomas and he says what's the bottom and we'll do this
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:09.160]  page we'll do the other half tomorrow oh okay we'll do the 24 that's just about
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:12.520]  half we're it yeah we'll finish this this page
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:16.360]  i said i do 50 but my goodness gracious hey i'm moving quick though
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.000]  very impressed we should be like i'm being interrogated though
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.600]  where's the light right over your head uh if you don't this is from thomas and
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:25.560]  he says if you don't know your history you're doomed to repeat it which i think
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:29.080]  is valid my question is you started talking about vietnam
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:33.240]  Yugoslavian wars etc and what was the real cause i was wondering and i
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:35.800]  understood the breaking news about the new world order
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:39.960]  every day but i would love to hear a history lesson from your perspective
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:43.400]  so well i mean it's not that the communists in
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:47.560]  vietnam were good guys ho Chi Minh came to the cia and the
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:50.200]  u.s government said i want to set up a system
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.680]  with u a free system and they said no we're gonna have the corrupt narcotics
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:57.880]  traffickers in the south still run things we're gonna prop up
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:04.360]  you know the the indo china french model uh and so they turned against us and
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:08.760]  cia stage bombings to blame the north to get the war going and and put advisors
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:13.800]  in in 1960 early 59 and the rest is history but
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:17.320]  doesn't mean you know the communist you know you know you know chinese then
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:21.080]  backing uh the northern vietnamese that doesn't mean they're good it's like
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:24.440]  just because our government's corrupt doesn't mean iran's good it's like
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:29.160]  corruption across the board uh as for you the slavium you have tito who's a
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:31.960]  balancing force they get rid of him they break it up
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:35.320]  they engage in the bombing of belgrade with the depleted uranium i mean it's
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:40.360]  it's all just about destroying nation states that the bankers don't control
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:44.680]  and as bad as Assad is in syria or qaddafi was in libya
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:48.600]  they're putting something far worse in so you hear about oh freedom fighters
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:52.440]  who's trying to protest it's al qaeda blowing up police stations
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:56.200]  and lining up black people in libya and shooting them and the and the media is
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:46:59.160]  like oh this guy might have said a word we better fire him
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.920]  but oh you're lining up blacks and shooting them well that's nice
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:05.880]  and bill gates has a shot for the little black child
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:09.480]  george bush is hugging one the cop child's crying you know it's all just an
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:14.600]  african invasion pr yeah they've done actually studies where the government
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:18.600]  has has proven that you know they had the skepticism of advertising working and
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:22.520]  i i studied a case study in college on it and it was basically they they went in
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.800]  with the idea that it doesn't work but obviously they know it works and
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:30.040]  that you know they show bill like george bush with little children like you
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:33.160]  said and things of that nature anyways side note
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:38.120]  but imagine how ridiculous it would be if you know if if i had a black child
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:42.120]  come in here and then shot a thing with me going
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:45.800]  and if you will be like my god alex this is ridiculous but then it's george
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:48.840]  bush and the photos everywhere meanwhile african is running in just
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:52.040]  slaughtering everybody arming the dictators
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:55.960]  and they're doing it in north african south africa thousands of miles from
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:59.800]  kony who had been seen in five years and they admit oh yeah it's
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:04.920]  transparent i mean it's just like right i mean the un is in africa in
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:09.640]  uganda where they're talking about kony on record lining up people and
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:12.200]  killing whole villages to take their property
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:16.120]  and you go tell a trendy they're like look dude i got tattoos i got all this i'm
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.200]  like okay i don't care if you got tattoos i'm not against those
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:22.040]  they're like loot i'm dressed trendy don't tell me kony's not cool and i'm
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.280]  like but it's slaughtering people they go
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:28.360]  dude your hair does not look like mine right now and i'm just like okay i
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:31.960]  understand you're super trendy and everything but you know i mean come on
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:35.640]  and it's just like and they're like look i choose to believe we're helping african
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:39.160]  i'm just like okay they're like be quiet racist
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:43.400]  yeah and she's like okay all right i mean i it's
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:48.200]  it's buying into the delusion it's like i'm a winner i buy into the propaganda
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:52.360]  the next question comes to you from husband and dad that's the username
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:57.160]  alex you present yourself extremely well as a benchmark of civil disobedience
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:00.760]  and there is a large number there are a large number of activists that would do
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:04.600]  better if they were just a bit more civil so could you in your own words
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:09.400]  define civil disobedience
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:13.240]  well i i don't think i'm the benchmark of anything really
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:17.480]  but maybe alternative media success that's just a minute but a lot of people
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:23.320]  aren't trying civil disobedience just means you're
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:26.760]  not malof cocktailing the police station
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:30.120]  instead you're saying no to things that are clearly wrong
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:34.360]  and kind of peacefully sabotaging the system and putting yourself against the
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:38.920]  machinery very succinct i like that
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:43.240]  charles asks you he says alex my question is could we abolish the fed
[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:46.920]  without the government's help or is it impossible
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.080]  yes just like people are abolishing gmo foods by demanding organic
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.040]  and none of it's perfect but there's a process there voting with dollars
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:56.920]  that's what i want to get a tyranny in because they're scared we just vote
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:00.200]  with our dollars our actions and the little things we do it's over for them
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:05.240]  it's came over absolutely and so
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:07.960]  yes if everybody started doing more barter that's why they're attacking
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:11.400]  all these little farms and omission these community co-ops things that really
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:14.280]  scares them getting back to old-fashioned
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:19.000]  activities in any way women men learning how to make their own
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.480]  clothes that's one of the biggest things scares the system
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:24.520]  i said as you said your mom made that nice nice coat you got
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:28.280]  just a jacket the work sports jacket whatever you call it i mean they're
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:31.160]  really scared of that just the idea of little things
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:34.600]  cuts into their monopoly that's what i like picture the new order is this
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.280]  giant box store that basically resorbs you or absorbs you
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:43.320]  uh show what was the question uh it was just you know how to be civil
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:46.840]  disobedient yeah that's it just just oh no that was the last question i'm so
[02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:50.520]  sorry the this destroying the fed without intervention from the
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:53.800]  government you just criticize it you expose it as a private fraud that it's
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:57.400]  the biggest welfare recipient that's taken over our country in the world
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:51:07.400]  that they brag they've conquered us look how arrogant they are
[02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:37.400]  so
[02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:51.160]  you know how to be civil disobedient yeah that's it just just
[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:54.520]  oh no that was the last question i'm so sorry the destroying the fed
[02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:58.360]  without intervention from the government you just criticize it you expose it as a
[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:01.960]  private fraud that it's the biggest welfare recipient that it's taken over
[02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:05.240]  our country in the world that they brag they've conquered us look how arrogant
[02:52:05.240 --> 02:52:09.400]  they are and using local alternative currencies
[02:52:09.400 --> 02:52:12.440]  they've got all sorts of them in all over the country all over the world
[02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:17.000]  and just realizing they're the enemy you know obama comes where you know
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:21.320]  politicians come and go but still the big fat bankers are sitting there
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:25.640]  like that barter well that's the civil rights movement was a huge part of that
[02:52:25.640 --> 02:52:30.040]  they withdrew from riding the buses and then they started well exactly and
[02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:33.400]  and also supporting local businesses and it
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:36.280]  doesn't mean you're a purist because you can't be i mean
[02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:42.440]  you can't buy a locally made a electro voice microphone i think that's
[02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:45.400]  made in germany or japan i mean this is made in germany
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:48.680]  you and nothing against the germans this is actually a quality product we
[02:52:48.680 --> 02:52:51.560]  actually hire some workers that actually you know get something out of which is
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:57.800]  good they put back in the economy but buying local really does do something
[02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:02.920]  or bartering anders asked how do you how do you alex i like that's very texas of
[02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:07.720]  you anders if fractional reserve banking would be replaced by another system
[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:11.960]  what would it be replaced with for example an interest free monetary system
[02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:17.000]  would that work in practice we debated that it could be interest free from
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.800]  state banks i don't know about a federal bank because that can always get taken
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:23.400]  over but we've had state banks and they've had some big successes with that
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:26.360]  and that's what we talked about in the first question or one of the first was
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:30.200]  this issue of people go well you've got tarply on this for an interest free
[02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:33.960]  you know system but by big federal bank the
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:37.720]  hamiltonian model and then you got ron paul on over here
[02:53:37.720 --> 02:53:42.200]  who is you know talking about gold or silver back so you can't
[02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:45.880]  any of these systems can be manipulated in game it's mainly about a debate and
[02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:50.680]  monetary people being informed monetarily so this is they can corrupt any
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:53.400]  system but the people are informed about monetary
[02:53:53.400 --> 02:53:57.720]  systems that gives a leg up against it knowledge is where you start and then
[02:53:57.720 --> 02:54:01.960]  it's action from that that's leading to uh warwick
[02:54:01.960 --> 02:54:06.600]  asks alex mainstream media is now openly reporting horrific things such as the
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:10.040]  idea of after birth abortion thousands of elderly people being
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:14.120]  intentionally killed uh is this mainstream news
[02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:17.640]  this uh ultimately he's asking is is this
[02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:21.080]  showing that we're winning like they're actually reporting on something that we
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:26.040]  we find to be true or are they just kind of throwing us a bone
[02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:29.880]  i used to think that all this stuff coming out
[02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:34.280]  was victories and i and a lot of it and it's a mixed-back sometimes a reporter
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:37.080]  gets it through an editor says it's the right thing to do
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:40.680]  and i think i don't think i know in the last decade that last five or six years
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:44.760]  that really started where people went out did real reporting the their boss
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:47.480]  backed them because maybe the you know the newspaper
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:50.200]  editors knew world order but now their kids autistic they figure out this is
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:53.240]  important they allow it out so more and more people started
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:56.760]  allowed you know getting the truth out so the system kind of just went okay
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:54:59.720]  yeah we're gonna kill all people what's the big deal they were gonna kill kids
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:04.520]  up to age three if we want so it's people telling the truth and and
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:08.600]  hitting the barb wire to get the truth out oh that's that that is a victory but
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:12.520]  there's also a lot of just acclimating oh oh you want the truth to come out yeah
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:15.960]  open the floodgates and suddenly in hundreds of papers we're run by foreign
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:18.600]  banks we're your slaves you've been conquered by world
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:20.920]  government there's nothing you can do about it
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:24.360]  so see it's kind of like the system's gone from denying all this because they
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:27.640]  realized people weren't listening to them it was just crediting them
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:31.320]  uh denying things so they've kind of just gone to
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:35.000]  and now open the floodgates oh you you think there's some tyranny yeah
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.800]  this is what you didn't know what's going on what you're gonna do about that
