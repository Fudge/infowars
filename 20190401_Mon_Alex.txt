[00:00.000 --> 00:09.760]  It's April 1st, 2019, and the left has pulled a lot of April Fool's jokes on us.
[00:09.760 --> 00:13.680]  They say it's okay that Joe Biden likes to grope women, because it only happened once.
[00:13.680 --> 00:16.320]  The shocking evidence that will bring him down straight ahead.
[00:16.320 --> 00:20.880]  And so much more, ladies and gentlemen, but first, let's get to this key report and look
[00:20.880 --> 00:26.120]  at how everything the globalist is touching is falling apart, just like with AOC.
[00:26.120 --> 00:31.280]  After reading the Green New Deal, I'm mostly afraid of not being able to get through this
[00:31.280 --> 00:33.800]  speech with a straight face.
[00:33.800 --> 00:40.880]  The Green New Deal finally landed its impossible $100 trillion country-killing behemoth on the
[00:40.880 --> 00:42.640]  floor of the U.S. Senate.
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.760]  Its main sponsor, freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, had set the table
[00:48.760 --> 00:55.320]  at a House committee meeting flailing around with Beto-esque zeal AOC passionately pretended
[00:55.320 --> 00:58.440]  to have a grip on the science of climate change.
[00:58.440 --> 01:01.200]  This is not an elitist issue.
[01:01.200 --> 01:03.480]  This is a quality of life issue.
[01:03.480 --> 01:09.160]  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water
[01:09.160 --> 01:10.440]  is elitist?
[01:10.440 --> 01:14.080]  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates
[01:14.080 --> 01:16.360]  of childhood asthma in the country.
[01:16.360 --> 01:19.080]  Even Cortez's asthma claims fell short.
[01:19.080 --> 01:20.720]  I don't think so.
[01:20.720 --> 01:21.960]  I don't think so.
[01:21.960 --> 01:27.920]  Fox Business host Charles Payne cited several studies, including a Columbia University study
[01:27.920 --> 01:33.600]  from 2013 that stated cockroach and mouse allergens are more common in lower-income
[01:33.600 --> 01:38.640]  housing in neighborhoods, as well as a New York Times study from 2003 in which social
[01:38.640 --> 01:44.200]  workers said they encountered furniture and carpets covered in dust in the Bronx and Harlem.
[01:44.200 --> 01:50.120]  These two studies show the likely culprit behind the asthma Cortez was flailing about.
[01:50.120 --> 01:57.120]  This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis, and
[01:57.120 --> 02:02.320]  notably here a founding member of the Super Friends.
[02:02.320 --> 02:10.200]  I draw your attention, Mr. President, to the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding.
[02:10.200 --> 02:14.000]  Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.320]  Now, I'm the first to admit that a massive fleet of giant, highly-trained seahorses would
[02:21.320 --> 02:22.320]  be cool.
[02:22.320 --> 02:25.240]  It would be really, really awesome.
[02:25.240 --> 02:28.960]  But we have to consider a few things.
[02:28.960 --> 02:36.120]  We have no idea about scalability or domestic capacity in this sector.
[02:36.120 --> 02:45.200]  The last thing we want is to ban all airplanes and only then find out that China or Russia
[02:45.200 --> 02:52.260]  may have already established strategic hippocampus programs designed to cut the United States
[02:52.260 --> 02:55.240]  out of the global market.
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.600]  Mr. President, we must not allow and cannot tolerate a giant seahorse gap.
[03:01.600 --> 03:07.400]  Every Democratic Senator who is currently running for president has embraced the Green
[03:07.400 --> 03:08.960]  New Deal.
[03:08.960 --> 03:13.440]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sprung the vote on the reluctant Democrats, some
[03:13.440 --> 03:19.160]  of which including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kirsten Sinema of Arizona,
[03:19.160 --> 03:25.720]  Doug Jones of Alabama and Angus King of Maine, sided with the Republicans by voting no, while
[03:25.720 --> 03:31.400]  43 of the Democrats hid behind procedure by merely voting present, a show of cold feet
[03:31.400 --> 03:38.040]  amongst Senate Democratic presidential candidates with zero guts to back up the madness of Cortez
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.720]  who blamed McConnell for the resounding defeat in a tweet.
[03:41.720 --> 03:48.400]  In the end, AOC's United Nations Agenda 2030 Climate Change Scheme, known now as the Green
[03:48.400 --> 03:54.360]  New Deal, was voted down with zero yeas and 57 nays.
[03:54.360 --> 03:57.120]  You know, we talk about cost.
[03:57.120 --> 04:01.960]  We're going to pay for this whether we pass a Green New Deal or not.
[04:01.960 --> 04:12.160]  A no vote on the Green New Deal is a vote against a government takeover of economy that would
[04:12.160 --> 04:22.160]  stifle economic growth, bankrupt our nation, and endanger the prosperity of all Americans.
[04:22.160 --> 04:30.680]  A no vote is a vote in favor of continuing an open and free economy that has made America
[04:30.680 --> 04:33.440]  the richest country in the world.
[04:33.440 --> 04:42.680]  And we find that the best way to do environmental improvement is to use the wealth of a nation
[04:42.680 --> 04:45.320]  to accomplish that goal.
[04:45.320 --> 04:49.280]  Better luck next time, Cortez, if there is a next time.
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.720]  One year ago, I was waitressing in a taco shop in downtown Manhattan.
[04:54.720 --> 04:56.360]  John Bowne reporting.
[04:56.360 --> 05:00.440]  If you are receiving this transmit.
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.640]  The globalist, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[05:04.640 --> 05:09.320]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant.
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.640]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[05:13.640 --> 05:17.280]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[05:17.280 --> 05:22.120]  They want you to believe you're powerless, but the truth is, it is we the people and
[05:22.120 --> 05:28.360]  our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[05:28.360 --> 05:30.400]  We are the power structure.
[05:30.400 --> 05:32.000]  We are the inventors.
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.320]  We are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand that they
[05:39.320 --> 05:44.280]  are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[05:44.280 --> 05:49.000]  Now to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.280]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[05:53.280 --> 05:58.280]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50%offinforstore.com,
[05:58.280 --> 06:00.880]  something everybody should take advantage of.
[06:00.880 --> 06:06.040]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[06:06.040 --> 06:11.960]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this
[06:11.960 --> 06:18.480]  country is about to be handed over to SCUM, more beholden to SCUM, Russian SCUM.
[06:18.480 --> 06:31.680]  Listen, please listen, if you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the
[06:31.680 --> 06:35.200]  same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you.
[06:35.200 --> 06:43.200]  The function of all life is survival, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[06:43.200 --> 06:53.200]  They're coming, they're coming, help, help, they're coming, they're coming, listen to
[06:53.200 --> 06:59.360]  me, listen, help, you're next, please, please, you're next, they're in danger, please listen
[06:59.360 --> 07:04.200]  to me, something terrible, please, you're next, here they are, they're already here,
[07:04.200 --> 07:09.440]  help you're next, they're coming, they're coming, listen to me, listen to me, the
[07:09.440 --> 07:14.320]  sit down, the seed is planted, sleep, sleep, terror grows.
[07:14.320 --> 07:19.920]  At long distance, wakeup, get you when you sleep, sit up.
[07:19.920 --> 07:22.600]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[07:22.600 --> 07:27.360]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites, is it contagious?
[07:27.360 --> 07:28.900]  It looks real, the homies.
[07:28.900 --> 07:30.900]  It looked right at me.
[07:30.900 --> 07:33.900]  You're looking at it as if it was human, but not human.
[07:34.900 --> 07:38.900]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[07:38.900 --> 07:40.900]  We're being cornered.
[07:40.900 --> 07:43.900]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[07:43.900 --> 07:45.900]  They're barricading the street.
[07:46.900 --> 07:49.900]  Invasion of the body statues.
[07:49.900 --> 08:14.900]  The land of the walking dead.
[08:14.900 --> 08:17.900]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:17.900 --> 08:22.900]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[08:24.900 --> 08:31.900]  If you go up to infowars.com, you'll see articles put together by us.
[08:32.900 --> 08:35.900]  Videos five years ago, six years ago.
[08:35.900 --> 08:38.900]  You'll see all Watson's video from a couple years ago.
[08:38.900 --> 08:41.900]  Creepy Uncle Joe Biden.
[08:41.900 --> 08:46.900]  We first began to point out that Joe Biden can't keep his hands off any little girls or any women.
[08:46.900 --> 08:51.900]  Runs his fingers through their hair, kisses them, rubs their sides, rubs their buttocks.
[08:51.900 --> 08:57.900]  And if you look at the big composite image up on the front page of drugsreport.com, you zoom in.
[08:57.900 --> 09:02.900]  It's all the different faces, or at least some of them, of the girls crying.
[09:03.900 --> 09:06.900]  In one shot, the woman is playing a flute.
[09:06.900 --> 09:08.900]  That's probably one of the most haunting videos.
[09:08.900 --> 09:14.900]  And for several minutes, he's behind her while she's playing rubbing her butt.
[09:14.900 --> 09:22.900]  While he whispers God knows what in his ear and she begins to cry, still playing the flute.
[09:25.900 --> 09:30.900]  There are videos of parents pulling their children away from him, children recoiling,
[09:30.900 --> 09:35.900]  him pulling women down to sit in his lap and then putting his hands on their hips.
[09:38.900 --> 09:40.900]  It's how you get in a fight with somebody.
[09:40.900 --> 09:44.900]  I mean, if somebody's been your buddy for 20 years and he pulled your wife down on his lap
[09:44.900 --> 09:47.900]  when he came over for a beer and started patting on her hips,
[09:47.900 --> 09:52.900]  you might say, hey, Bob, get a little friendly there.
[09:52.900 --> 09:55.900]  Get your hands off my wife's ass.
[09:55.900 --> 09:57.900]  Excuse my French.
[09:57.900 --> 09:59.900]  That is unless you're swingers.
[09:59.900 --> 10:01.900]  Then get your wife over here.
[10:01.900 --> 10:03.900]  You're going to have to share.
[10:03.900 --> 10:09.900]  I mean, the point is, is that this guy's out of control.
[10:09.900 --> 10:18.900]  And Bernie Sanders comes out and Bernie Sanders defends him and says it only happened once
[10:18.900 --> 10:22.900]  because it's on video that there's a very attractive Hispanic lady in the Democratic Party
[10:22.900 --> 10:25.900]  running for a higher office.
[10:25.900 --> 10:26.900]  She's been a state rep.
[10:26.900 --> 10:30.900]  He starts grabbing her on the podium and kissing her and whispering in her ear
[10:30.900 --> 10:32.900]  and rubbing under her chin.
[10:32.900 --> 10:38.900]  I mean, if your wife's not in the mood, if she's not in a good mood
[10:38.900 --> 10:40.900]  and you come over and start doing that to your wife, she's like,
[10:40.900 --> 10:42.900]  hey, I'm not in the mood to leave me alone.
[10:42.900 --> 10:47.900]  I mean, you don't just approach your wife like that.
[10:47.900 --> 10:54.900]  But oh, just do it to random women and people's kids.
[10:54.900 --> 10:57.900]  I mean, if my wife was trying to get groceries out of the car,
[10:57.900 --> 11:02.900]  my wife loves me as always, likes me and is a very attentive wife
[11:02.900 --> 11:03.900]  and very excited about me.
[11:03.900 --> 11:07.900]  But if she's getting groceries out of the car and pulling the baby out of the back
[11:07.900 --> 11:10.900]  and I come over and grab her by the butt, which, you know, I do that kind of stuff.
[11:10.900 --> 11:11.900]  She's like, hey, knock it off.
[11:11.900 --> 11:12.900]  I'm busy right now.
[11:12.900 --> 11:14.900]  It's just not the time for it.
[11:14.900 --> 11:22.900]  Imagine you're playing the flute or you're up on a stage and Joe Biden comes up behind you
[11:22.900 --> 11:27.900]  and starts rubbing your face and rubbing under your chin and then whispering in your ear
[11:27.900 --> 11:32.900]  and then gets behind you and starts rubbing your butt.
[11:32.900 --> 11:35.900]  It's all about a power and control thing.
[11:35.900 --> 11:41.900]  And that you're in this public arena and you don't know what to do.
[11:41.900 --> 11:49.900]  And then he always walks up behind the children and starts rubbing his hands through their hair.
[11:49.900 --> 11:53.900]  Very sexually.
[11:53.900 --> 11:57.900]  Imagine if somebody at a park walked up to your 10-year-old daughter, your 5-year-old daughter
[11:57.900 --> 12:02.900]  and stood up behind him and then started rubbing his hands on your shoulders
[12:02.900 --> 12:05.900]  rubbing the hands on through the hair.
[12:05.900 --> 12:09.900]  I mean, if the kids are running around screaming and yelling in the house like they do sometimes
[12:09.900 --> 12:15.900]  and my wife's over there chopping up onions, say, for a salad, she's busy.
[12:15.900 --> 12:19.900]  She's not in the mode of being approached.
[12:19.900 --> 12:21.900]  I don't know what it is about your wife in the kitchen or something.
[12:21.900 --> 12:23.900]  They're doing things, but, you know, they're cute.
[12:23.900 --> 12:24.900]  They're doing stuff.
[12:24.900 --> 12:26.900]  You come up behind them and start rubbing on them and kissing on them.
[12:26.900 --> 12:28.900]  And, you know, most of the time she's like, okay, great.
[12:28.900 --> 12:30.900]  Let's get in the bedroom in five minutes.
[12:30.900 --> 12:32.900]  Most of the time it's like, hey, I'm busy.
[12:32.900 --> 12:34.900]  It's just not the mode for it.
[12:34.900 --> 12:48.900]  So again, men don't treat their wives on average the way Biden treats women in public.
[12:48.900 --> 12:50.900]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[12:50.900 --> 12:52.900]  And then again, it's bigger than Biden.
[12:52.900 --> 12:55.900]  The front-run of the Democratic Party right now almost all polls show.
[12:55.900 --> 12:58.900]  It's that he gets away with it.
[12:58.900 --> 13:00.900]  He's been known to do this for decades.
[13:00.900 --> 13:08.900]  I know the guy who sold them the property, the wooded property right next to their bar.
[13:08.900 --> 13:17.900]  And he told me some stories, but it just fits in to everything else.
[13:17.900 --> 13:22.900]  It just fits in to everything we know about this guy.
[13:22.900 --> 13:24.900]  And how the Democratic Party is now defending him.
[13:24.900 --> 13:30.900]  Imagine if we had footage of Kavanaugh walking up to random women on stages
[13:30.900 --> 13:33.900]  and standing behind them and clearly rubbing on their butts
[13:33.900 --> 13:35.900]  and running his hands through their hair.
[13:35.900 --> 13:39.900]  We'd say, this guy's a creeper.
[13:39.900 --> 13:42.900]  By the way, I would never even think about doing something like this,
[13:42.900 --> 13:47.900]  but you go out and start touching on people's wives and stuff in public.
[13:47.900 --> 13:51.900]  When you know their husbands are in the audience, it's a good way to get your ass kicked.
[13:51.900 --> 13:55.900]  I mean, let me tell you, if I was sitting there and I was at some public event,
[13:55.900 --> 13:58.900]  I looked 20 yards away and a guy's rubbing his hands through my wife's hair
[13:58.900 --> 14:02.900]  and I walk over and say, is this an old boyfriend? What the hell?
[14:02.900 --> 14:06.900]  Of course, my wife would be like, what are you doing and push the guy away?
[14:06.900 --> 14:08.900]  That's the normal instinct.
[14:08.900 --> 14:13.900]  Yeah, there he is rubbing a woman's stomach up to under her breast.
[14:13.900 --> 14:17.900]  Ugh, so creepy, man.
[14:17.900 --> 14:22.900]  That's a creepy way he does it. I guarantee you women, even if you were married to him, don't like that.
[14:22.900 --> 14:25.900]  So I'm going to go over all this and so much more.
[14:25.900 --> 14:28.900]  The Globals are planning to try to overthrow the president.
[14:28.900 --> 14:29.900]  We've got their next plan.
[14:29.900 --> 14:33.900]  I'm going to exclusively break that down coming up, put out a special report last night on it.
[14:33.900 --> 14:36.900]  It's up until about 8 o'clock for that special report.
[14:36.900 --> 14:39.900]  That's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[14:39.900 --> 14:46.900]  And please don't forget, we're listeners supported and when you don't buy products, we don't exist.
[14:46.900 --> 14:51.900]  If it's an ongoing war, they try to shut us down, but thanks to you.
[14:51.900 --> 14:54.900]  Literally, thanks to you, we're winning the war against the globalists.
[14:54.900 --> 14:59.900]  And we've got the biggest sell of the year, 50% to 60% off all the great supplements,
[14:59.900 --> 15:01.900]  store-wide free shipping, double paid for your points.
[15:01.900 --> 15:05.900]  We've already sold out of four of the best-selling items.
[15:05.900 --> 15:08.900]  So we had to pull those, but we've still got X2.
[15:08.900 --> 15:09.900]  We've still got X3.
[15:09.900 --> 15:17.900]  We've still got no vitality, super silver wound gel, bodies, brain force and infowarsstore.com.
[15:17.900 --> 15:20.900]  Brain force plus 60% off DNA force.

[15:33.900 --> 15:36.900]  And so much more, but you've got to take advantage of it now.
[15:36.900 --> 15:37.900]  You've never got a product from us.
[15:37.900 --> 15:40.900]  They're great products plus you're fighting the info wars.
[15:40.900 --> 15:45.900]  So please, if you get on the fence, take that action, get a t-shirt, get a book, get a video,
[15:45.900 --> 15:47.900]  get some non-GMO heirloom seeds.

[15:48.900 --> 15:53.900]  Infowarsstore.com funds infowars.com.
[15:53.900 --> 15:54.900]  Tomorrow's news today.
[15:54.900 --> 15:55.900]  You'll be right back.
[15:55.900 --> 16:21.900]  Stay wellish.
[16:25.900 --> 16:28.900]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:55.900 --> 16:58.900]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[17:25.900 --> 17:28.900]  Available at Amazon books.
[17:55.900 --> 17:57.900]  Available to survivalistcamps.com.
[18:26.900 --> 18:29.900]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[18:29.900 --> 18:32.900]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[18:32.900 --> 18:37.900]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.900 --> 18:39.900]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:39.900 --> 18:41.900]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.900 --> 18:46.900]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[18:46.900 --> 18:51.900]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.900 --> 18:54.900]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.900 --> 18:59.900]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.900 --> 19:01.900]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[19:01.900 --> 19:02.900]  Go ahead.
[19:02.900 --> 19:04.900]  I just have to say something, man.
[19:04.900 --> 19:07.900]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[19:07.900 --> 19:09.900]  It just gets old, man.
[19:09.900 --> 19:11.900]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[19:11.900 --> 19:14.900]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[19:14.900 --> 19:18.900]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[19:18.900 --> 19:21.900]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[19:21.900 --> 19:24.900]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[19:24.900 --> 19:26.900]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[19:26.900 --> 19:28.900]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[19:28.900 --> 19:29.900]  You know what, Alex?
[19:29.900 --> 19:30.900]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[19:30.900 --> 19:37.900]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[19:37.900 --> 19:41.900]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[19:41.900 --> 19:44.900]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[19:44.900 --> 19:45.900]  You understand?
[19:45.900 --> 19:46.900]  I need your help, Frank.
[19:46.900 --> 19:48.900]  I need your help, Frank.
[19:48.900 --> 19:54.900]  Go to InfowarsStore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[19:54.900 --> 19:55.900]  Do you understand?
[19:55.900 --> 19:56.900]  I need your help, Frank.
[19:56.900 --> 19:58.900]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[20:02.900 --> 20:05.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:13.900 --> 20:15.900]  The year is 1995.
[20:15.900 --> 20:21.900]  And Infowars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[20:21.900 --> 20:31.900]  In a freak mishap, Infowars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems.
[20:31.900 --> 20:35.900]  And returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[20:35.900 --> 20:44.900]  Transdimensionally, over the space time continuum, through false facts, where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[20:44.900 --> 20:49.900]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now real.
[20:49.900 --> 20:56.900]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[20:56.900 --> 21:02.900]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[21:02.900 --> 21:04.900]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[21:04.900 --> 21:05.900]  It's fulfilling.
[21:05.900 --> 21:06.900]  Infowars.
[21:06.900 --> 21:14.900]  Tomorrow's News. Today.
[21:14.900 --> 21:20.900]  Alright, let me tell you some of the big news that's coming up.
[21:20.900 --> 21:31.900]  And again, I don't like to be Gonzo-Termillism, but it's getting pretty crazy at this point, and I'm not even sure what's going on now.
[21:31.900 --> 21:48.900]  But Saturday, Beto O'Rourke, Beto O'Rourke's I really supposed to say it, but I just had fun with it, had rallies in Houston and Dallas, El Paso and a bunch of places.
[21:48.900 --> 21:59.900]  And then at 10.30 at night, he arrived to downtown Austin in front of the Capitol.
[21:59.900 --> 22:04.900]  And around the Capitol, there's some parking lots in areas, and it's very, very dark.
[22:04.900 --> 22:22.900]  And I say that because in the footage we have that we put on infowars.com, you see some of the crazy leftist, but you can't really see that Beto is only about 70 yards from where I am standing.
[22:22.900 --> 22:30.900]  He's probably only got a crowd of about maximum two and a half thousand, so the media called it five, ten thousand.
[22:30.900 --> 22:43.900]  But I thought I could go with just three security guys, and one with O and separately, up to the front, 50 yards away or so, 30 yards away.
[22:43.900 --> 22:48.900]  We were about 60, 70 yards to the side of the stage. I thought I could go up into it.
[22:48.900 --> 22:54.900]  And it was like invasion of the body snatchers. And we have the audio of this we're going to be putting out later, but it's so dark in the crowd.
[22:54.900 --> 22:59.900]  There's so much cussing. And you hear most of us going, oh, look, it's Alex Jones. Look, it's Alex Jones.
[22:59.900 --> 23:06.900]  But then there's a platform of media up above me, and they point and they go, it's him. Get him.
[23:06.900 --> 23:12.900]  And some of this audio is actually in the two videos they've put out, but it's just crazy.
[23:12.900 --> 23:20.900]  And then people start going, get him, get him, get him. And there's women slapping at the security people and trying to get at me.
[23:20.900 --> 23:27.900]  So we get out of the crowd and we get about 70 yards away to the side.
[23:27.900 --> 23:32.900]  And then as soon as Beto gets there, I start bullhorning.
[23:32.900 --> 23:37.900]  Reportedly, you could hear it over him at many points. It was very effective.
[23:37.900 --> 23:46.900]  And a couple of hundred people rush out of the thousands up to where I am on a little bit of an incline and start trying to physically attack us.
[23:46.900 --> 23:51.900]  And I mean foaming at the mouth like I had killed their children.
[23:51.900 --> 23:57.900]  And I'd say, Beto, our work supports killing babies after they're born. And they would just scream, yes, we love it.
[23:57.900 --> 24:00.900]  We love killing babies. FQ, FQ.
[24:00.900 --> 24:07.900]  And just the level of vicious hate was unlike anything I'd ever seen.
[24:07.900 --> 24:14.900]  And that's before I was ever even bullhorning.
[24:14.900 --> 24:23.900]  And again, my security guys got slapped in the head. They slapped me a few times.
[24:23.900 --> 24:29.900]  And it was hard to get footage of any of it because it was just such a melee. They'd also come up behind you.
[24:29.900 --> 24:38.900]  But we got some of it on tape. But just to know the absolute raw hate.
[24:38.900 --> 24:43.900]  Like I used to think it was cheesy when people would chant USA, USA, unless it was the Olympics or something.
[24:43.900 --> 24:47.900]  Because I get there's a USA version out there that means kind of US Empire launch wars.
[24:47.900 --> 24:50.900]  I don't like that USA. I like the real USA.
[24:50.900 --> 24:57.900]  But I learned in the last few years around leftist the radicalization of Obama and the universities is so complete that
[24:57.900 --> 25:01.900]  I would say, hey, America's back.
[25:01.900 --> 25:08.900]  Trump is really getting jobs back. And I learned this about two years ago when I would go out to Democrat events
[25:08.900 --> 25:12.900]  and they would all go into a rage and start screaming and cussing.
[25:12.900 --> 25:16.900]  In fact, I could be in front of a moderately normal liberal cloud.
[25:16.900 --> 25:22.900]  And I'd be speaking or bullhorning at an event that Hillary was going into or what have you.
[25:22.900 --> 25:31.900]  But as soon as I'd say America is back or America is good or we should all love the country.
[25:31.900 --> 25:39.900]  That's what makes these people just go, I mean, we're talking about radicalized people.
[25:39.900 --> 25:45.900]  I don't think the North Koreans with all their brainwashing when they protest the US act like this.
[25:45.900 --> 25:50.900]  In fact, they don't.
[25:50.900 --> 25:59.900]  They just go out and march around. This is beyond 10 minutes of hate in 1984 where they would flash Emmanuel Goldstein,
[25:59.900 --> 26:05.900]  the supposed bad guy up on the screens at these public events you had to go to every day in these movie theaters.
[26:05.900 --> 26:11.900]  And then you would just scream for 10 minutes going.
[26:11.900 --> 26:20.900]  And I've had five people come up to me yesterday and today when I brought it up at the office,
[26:20.900 --> 26:23.900]  people in the meeting this morning were like, yeah, I saw that too.
[26:23.900 --> 26:26.900]  No one watches spectrum news. It's Time Warner. It's CNN.
[26:26.900 --> 26:28.900]  It used to be called News 8.
[26:28.900 --> 26:34.900]  In most cities now they have a local CNN propaganda news group, very low quality.
[26:34.900 --> 26:38.900]  And I don't watch a lot of TV, but we do have spectrum.
[26:38.900 --> 26:42.900]  And I shouldn't have the point is it's the house has it.
[26:42.900 --> 26:46.900]  And I turn it on and my daughter likes to sometimes you know, watch a movie at like eight at night.
[26:46.900 --> 26:52.900]  My middle daughter and I, well, when I watch cartoons with her, so that's what we do.
[26:52.900 --> 26:56.900]  And when you turn on the cable spectrum is on. It's the first channel.
[26:56.900 --> 27:03.900]  And in the last few months, we probably only watch TV 10 times, but every time I turn it on,
[27:03.900 --> 27:08.900]  I'm like, is that a coincidence? It's Alex Jones or I'm on the scroll at the bottom.
[27:08.900 --> 27:12.900]  So Pat Riley, who works here, he broke his foot a few weeks ago.
[27:12.900 --> 27:15.900]  So his wife would have a baby. So they're at home all weekend.
[27:15.900 --> 27:19.900]  And he said, Alex, I just left it on in the kitchen with the sound off.
[27:19.900 --> 27:23.900]  You were on three times an hour to four times an hour.
[27:23.900 --> 27:27.900]  He even taped some of it or DVR it. We're going to folks, I'm on every channel now.
[27:27.900 --> 27:34.900]  I'm on MSNBC every hour, CNN, everywhere. And everything they're saying is twisted or lies.
[27:34.900 --> 27:40.900]  And I don't know what they're building towards because they're almost attacking me as much as Trump now.
[27:40.900 --> 27:46.900]  It's like they've decided I'm Trump and because they can't beat Trump, they think they're going to destroy me.
[27:46.900 --> 27:51.900]  And it's building towards something bad. I mean, there's no doubt that everyone's walking up and going,
[27:51.900 --> 27:54.900]  you're all over TV. It's like you're on everywhere.
[27:54.900 --> 27:58.900]  I had people at a restaurant yesterday at a toy store yesterday.
[27:58.900 --> 28:03.900]  One of my neighbors this morning came over and talked to me. Pat brought it up. People in the meeting brought it up.
[28:03.900 --> 28:07.900]  It's like, man, you're all over TV. I was like at a restaurant and spectrums on.
[28:07.900 --> 28:13.900]  And you were on repeatedly it. Zimmerman saw that.
[28:13.900 --> 28:16.900]  And it's all bull too.
[28:16.900 --> 28:23.900]  Like we had two lawsuits against me of the 20 or so down to like six.
[28:23.900 --> 28:26.900]  We had two lawsuits thrown out last Friday.
[28:26.900 --> 28:29.900]  It was in local news and that's it.
[28:29.900 --> 28:33.900]  But they advanced some of the Sandy Hook stuff.
[28:33.900 --> 28:36.900]  They'll take them years, even if they're successful in their fraud.
[28:36.900 --> 28:42.900]  That is lawyers, the big backer. We now know the big backer is that'll be released soon to be big news.
[28:42.900 --> 28:46.900]  And there was no coverage of us winning those.
[28:46.900 --> 28:50.900]  But the point is something big is coming in. And I think I know what it is.
[28:50.900 --> 28:53.900]  Probably that we come back and we're going to get into all the other huge news.
[28:53.900 --> 29:22.900]  Huge news in Europe. Please stay with us.
[29:22.900 --> 29:26.900]  I am blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.900 --> 29:30.900]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:30.900 --> 29:32.900]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.900 --> 29:59.900]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:59.900 --> 30:03.900]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they can't food during the fall.
[30:03.900 --> 30:05.900]  So they have it during the winter.
[30:05.900 --> 30:08.900]  And that's what I'm talking about at m4store.com.
[30:08.900 --> 30:12.900]  With m4 select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply.
[30:12.900 --> 30:15.900]  One of the top most respected companies out there.
[30:15.900 --> 30:23.900]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[30:23.900 --> 30:28.900]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[30:28.900 --> 30:34.900]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com on m4 select storeable foods.

[30:39.900 --> 30:42.900]  They've got so many great products there.
[30:42.900 --> 30:43.900]  Maybe you got a three year supply.
[30:43.900 --> 30:45.900]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[30:45.900 --> 30:47.900]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[30:47.900 --> 30:51.900]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together.
[30:51.900 --> 30:53.900]  With God's help, we are unstoppable.
[30:53.900 --> 30:59.900]  m4store.com and m4 select high quality storeable foods powered by my patriots supply.
[30:59.900 --> 31:01.900]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[31:01.900 --> 31:03.900]  There is no set stasis.
[31:03.900 --> 31:04.900]  There is no managed system.
[31:04.900 --> 31:06.900]  There is no uncontenual.
[31:06.900 --> 31:09.900]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[31:09.900 --> 31:12.900]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[31:12.900 --> 31:14.900]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[31:14.900 --> 31:15.900]  We'll be here forever.
[31:15.900 --> 31:16.900]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[31:16.900 --> 31:21.900]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say,
[31:21.900 --> 31:23.900]  you know, we struggled here.
[31:23.900 --> 31:24.900]  We made it.
[31:24.900 --> 31:25.900]  And that's really where this goes.
[31:25.900 --> 31:27.900]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[31:27.900 --> 31:32.900]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong,
[31:32.900 --> 31:34.900]  are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[31:34.900 --> 31:39.900]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[31:39.900 --> 31:42.900]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[31:42.900 --> 31:44.900]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[31:44.900 --> 31:48.900]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[31:48.900 --> 31:49.900]  I want to go to the next level.
[31:49.900 --> 31:53.900]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[31:53.900 --> 31:56.900]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[31:56.900 --> 31:57.900]  I want life.
[31:57.900 --> 31:58.900]  I want Jesus.
[31:58.900 --> 32:03.900]  The globalists, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[32:03.900 --> 32:07.900]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant.
[32:07.900 --> 32:13.900]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information
[32:13.900 --> 32:15.900]  so you can make your own decisions.
[32:15.900 --> 32:18.900]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[32:18.900 --> 32:25.900]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do
[32:25.900 --> 32:27.900]  that changes the world.
[32:27.900 --> 32:29.900]  We are the power structure.
[32:29.900 --> 32:30.900]  We are the inventors.
[32:30.900 --> 32:32.900]  We are the trailblazers.
[32:32.900 --> 32:35.900]  And the globalists understand that.
[32:35.900 --> 32:42.900]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[32:42.900 --> 32:47.900]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[32:47.900 --> 32:53.900]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March,
[32:53.900 --> 32:57.900]  we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50%offinforestore.com,
[32:57.900 --> 33:21.900]  so everybody should take advantage of.
[33:21.900 --> 33:47.900]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:47.900 --> 33:57.900]  All you ever do is brag about yourself.
[33:57.900 --> 34:02.900]  Dude, I'm not bragging about myself.
[34:02.900 --> 34:04.900]  I do not like the position I'm in.
[34:04.900 --> 34:05.900]  It's not fun.
[34:05.900 --> 34:10.900]  But I do like the fact that the globalists are in trouble and their system is being exposed.
[34:10.900 --> 34:17.900]  We become one of the main focal news stories by the globalists.
[34:17.900 --> 34:21.900]  They've got a big reason for it.
[34:21.900 --> 34:22.900]  And I figured out the reason.
[34:22.900 --> 34:23.900]  I know the larger plan.
[34:23.900 --> 34:25.900]  And I now know the timeline.
[34:25.900 --> 34:29.900]  And now I'm learning who the parties are and the exact players.
[34:29.900 --> 34:31.900]  And this is how we beat them.
[34:31.900 --> 34:38.900]  You don't think I'm on every news show every day now for no reason.
[34:38.900 --> 34:45.900]  They've got a larger plan to destroy me and then tag it on to the Liberty Movement worldwide
[34:45.900 --> 34:47.900]  in some larger defeat.
[34:47.900 --> 34:51.900]  They are branding me as the villain.
[34:51.900 --> 34:53.900]  I'm going to say this again.
[34:53.900 --> 35:02.900]  Three times an hour, 24 hours a day, most days on Time Warner Cable now change their name to Spectrum.
[35:02.900 --> 35:03.900]  That's the CNN.
[35:03.900 --> 35:07.900]  CNN runs and controls the station.
[35:07.900 --> 35:10.900]  They have Smirk Kanish and all these guys.
[35:10.900 --> 35:12.900]  People say, well, play the clips.
[35:12.900 --> 35:13.900]  There's like 10 of them a day.
[35:13.900 --> 35:19.900]  I can't even spend time watching them.
[35:19.900 --> 35:22.900]  And they say in the clips, he is a premeditated liar.
[35:22.900 --> 35:24.900]  Everything he says is consciously not true.
[35:24.900 --> 35:26.900]  He is a scam artist.
[35:26.900 --> 35:31.900]  And of course, everything he's saying is about himself.
[35:31.900 --> 35:33.900]  They say the same thing about Trump.
[35:33.900 --> 35:37.900]  Oh, he's a liar and they'll show like 20 containers of gumballs.
[35:37.900 --> 35:44.900]  And they go, every one of these gumballs is a liar according to Politifact.
[35:44.900 --> 35:48.900]  And then everything they say Trump's lying about is not true.
[35:48.900 --> 35:53.900]  I've never seen a president deliver this much of what he said he'd do.
[35:53.900 --> 35:57.900]  People said it's not expedient to go after Obamacare at this point.
[35:57.900 --> 35:59.900]  The Republicans are like, why are you doing it?
[35:59.900 --> 36:02.900]  Because it was on the list.
[36:02.900 --> 36:07.900]  It's the next thing on his list.
[36:07.900 --> 36:14.900]  And I watch these hit pieces and it's just, it's bizarre how Trump and I are like bound.
[36:14.900 --> 36:16.900]  They even say that.
[36:16.900 --> 36:17.900]  They say, we're going to get Trump.
[36:17.900 --> 36:19.900]  We're going to get Jones.
[36:19.900 --> 36:30.900]  And they've basically stolen my identity and created this arch-villain that they then are trying to use the captured identity of Alex Jones,
[36:30.900 --> 36:37.900]  this false identity to project on to everyone else that they want to then demonize and attack.
[36:37.900 --> 36:42.900]  So I'm being turned into Darth Vader is the best analogy.
[36:42.900 --> 36:45.900]  And of course, Trump is in propensity.
[36:45.900 --> 36:48.900]  But that is not what's happening here.
[36:48.900 --> 36:58.900]  And then they take the fact that I'm real and I really tell you what I feel and I really tell you what I stand for to make that a weakness.
[36:58.900 --> 37:03.900]  Here's an example.
[37:03.900 --> 37:06.900]  And again, let's put this to Frank and others.
[37:06.900 --> 37:08.900]  I've got incredible news here to cover.
[37:08.900 --> 37:11.900]  I've got big guests coming up.
[37:11.900 --> 37:18.900]  But I was in over, I get the Google alerts, over 500 original news articles that I got alerted to.
[37:18.900 --> 37:21.900]  Most of them got syndicated into newspapers and on the television.
[37:21.900 --> 37:28.900]  No one I know can turn a TV on or go to a restaurant when I'm not on the television most of the time.
[37:28.900 --> 37:35.900]  My kids, everywhere they go, they see me.
[37:35.900 --> 37:39.900]  It's insane.
[37:39.900 --> 37:42.900]  So what is the end game?
[37:42.900 --> 37:43.900]  Why are they doing this?
[37:43.900 --> 37:47.900]  They silence me as much as they can so that I can't speak for myself.
[37:47.900 --> 37:50.900]  And then they create this villain that I'm supposedly am.
[37:50.900 --> 37:55.900]  They don't put out this level of propaganda on something unless they're planning something big.
[37:55.900 --> 38:01.900]  Remember when they started burning a few Hollywood people with the Me Too movement?
[38:01.900 --> 38:04.900]  That was because the Democrats knew they had no credibility because the Clintons.
[38:04.900 --> 38:10.900]  They thought they would distract by persecuting a few leftists and making them resign.
[38:10.900 --> 38:16.900]  And most of them deserved it, but it was still a persecution because it was planned and directed.
[38:16.900 --> 38:26.900]  Like the stupid former senator from Minnesota because he did a funny photo of grabbing a woman's breast and done some jerky stuff.
[38:26.900 --> 38:32.900]  And he probably should resign, but the point is according to a Democratic yardstick, he should go to jail basically.
[38:32.900 --> 38:45.900]  So they had a few of them falling their sword to set the precedent to then remove any Republican in the future that even got accused.
[38:45.900 --> 38:51.900]  And they go, hey, we all resigned, but Kavanaugh didn't because Kavanaugh didn't do anything.
[38:51.900 --> 38:53.900]  It was a fraud.
[38:53.900 --> 38:56.900]  Most women came forward and said they did it for political reasons.
[38:56.900 --> 38:58.900]  They were proud of themselves.
[38:58.900 --> 38:59.900]  They said, he's bad.
[38:59.900 --> 39:03.900]  It's like a lot of folks are defending Smollett saying, well, you know, there are a bunch of white racists.
[39:03.900 --> 39:06.900]  So we got to stage this to show you how bad it is.
[39:06.900 --> 39:12.900]  That's why they dropped charges against him because the prosecutor thinks he's a hero.
[39:12.900 --> 39:22.900]  And we're just supposed to forget about the Kavanaugh kids and Balazi Ford and Smollett and the fake Russiagate and all this crap.
[39:22.900 --> 39:24.900]  And so they need some win.
[39:24.900 --> 39:30.900]  The Democrats need somebody that's fake, somebody that's bad, somebody that's like them.
[39:30.900 --> 39:34.900]  And so what they do is like a senator.
[39:34.900 --> 39:47.900]  They project all of their sins and all of their tactics and the way they behave and the way they connive and the way they lie on to yours truly.
[39:47.900 --> 39:49.900]  And it's the only thing they can do.
[39:49.900 --> 39:52.900]  And they do the same thing on Trump, but it's not working.
[39:52.900 --> 40:00.900]  So they say, Jones has helped relaunch the Americana with this audience, the powerful audience that is the heart of this.
[40:00.900 --> 40:08.900]  Let's take our main enemy that helped get Trump in and let's turn it against Trump and let's make Trump in the 2020 election.
[40:08.900 --> 40:13.900]  That's why they send him all these letters and say, denounce Alex Jones, all these Sandy Hook lawyers and all of them.
[40:13.900 --> 40:17.900]  They create the false straw man and they want me.
[40:17.900 --> 40:25.900]  When Trump denounces me, they want me to denounce Trump and they want my audience to denounce Trump.
[40:25.900 --> 40:28.900]  Well, Trump isn't going to denounce me.
[40:28.900 --> 40:34.900]  But I tell my audience, if he and some Machiavellian in his wisdom wants to denounce me, denounce away, president.
[40:34.900 --> 40:36.900]  I'm ready.
[40:36.900 --> 40:44.900]  I'm playing the part, aren't I, in the real world, the whole world's a stage of the dark night.
[40:44.900 --> 40:49.900]  And so if I've got to get the blame for things to save this country, that's fine.
[40:49.900 --> 40:51.900]  Destroy me.
[40:51.900 --> 40:57.900]  By the way, I've already told the president that and the president is not going to go with it, which I don't think he needs to.
[40:57.900 --> 40:58.900]  I think he's smart.
[40:58.900 --> 41:03.900]  I've just said, I don't blame whoever happens to happen to me, I'm ready.
[41:03.900 --> 41:10.900]  I volunteered for this mission and I'm fully committed to whatever has to happen and I'm not going to question or doubt anything.
[41:10.900 --> 41:15.900]  As long as the president is steadfast in saving the country and the border and the Second Amendment and unborn and already born babies,
[41:15.900 --> 41:20.900]  as long as he keeps carrying out his mission, I'm going to carry out my mission and I'm not going to back down.
[41:20.900 --> 41:25.900]  Because if they think they're going to get me to turn against the president or turn against this country, it's never going to happen.
[41:25.900 --> 41:30.900]  Now, I've said tongue-in-cheek things like, I love the president, I hate the president.
[41:30.900 --> 41:35.900]  I don't like being demonized for my support of the president at a visceral, you know, fleshly level.
[41:35.900 --> 41:39.900]  This is not fun, but I love the president at a spiritual level.
[41:39.900 --> 41:43.900]  In the flesh, I just want to have a good time, be left alone.
[41:43.900 --> 41:46.900]  I'm really a reclusive person in reality.
[41:46.900 --> 41:54.900]  I don't like President Trump because in the straw man they've built of him, I get demonized by Trump's doppelganger.
[41:54.900 --> 41:58.900]  And that's not the real Trump. And the Alex Jones you see out there is not the real Alex Jones.
[41:58.900 --> 42:01.900]  When we come back, I'll play a few of the viral clips.
[42:01.900 --> 42:07.900]  Some I haven't played yet, a three-plus-hour deposition that the media misrepresented.
[42:07.900 --> 42:13.900]  You know, notice most of the headlines use Jones. It says he has psychosis and is crazy.
[42:13.900 --> 42:17.900]  They don't actually show what I said. That's not what I said.
[42:17.900 --> 42:22.900]  And when you hear the video or see the video, hear the audio, when I play this on radio and TV, when we come back,
[42:22.900 --> 42:26.900]  you'll go, I've heard Alex say that 50 times. Exactly.
[42:26.900 --> 42:28.900]  I was being real with you.
[42:28.900 --> 42:34.900]  I was really trying to get everybody out there to really be retrospective and look for the truth of what's going on,
[42:34.900 --> 42:40.900]  not one extreme or the other. And I'll explain that when we come back, what I mean by extreme.
[42:40.900 --> 42:45.900]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice. It's good to be extremely pro-family, pro-God, pro-self-defense.
[42:45.900 --> 42:50.900]  What I mean, extreme is, extremely believing everything you're told or extremely not believing anything you're told.
[42:50.900 --> 42:56.900]  How do you find that balance? How do you trust but verify, as old Ronald Reagan said? Stay with us.

[45:59.900 --> 46:04.900]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems,
[46:04.900 --> 46:07.900]  and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[46:07.900 --> 46:10.900]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[46:10.900 --> 46:13.900]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[46:13.900 --> 46:17.900]  I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana,
[46:17.900 --> 46:21.900]  and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[46:21.900 --> 46:25.900]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[46:25.900 --> 46:28.900]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[46:28.900 --> 46:33.900]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[46:33.900 --> 46:38.900]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products
[46:38.900 --> 46:43.900]  at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation
[46:43.900 --> 46:47.900]  and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[46:47.900 --> 46:51.900]  For myself and the whole info wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[46:51.900 --> 47:09.900]  because without you, info wars is nothing. You are the info war, and I salute you.
[47:21.900 --> 47:43.900]  The globalists are panicking. Humanity is awake to their technocracy.
[47:43.900 --> 47:50.900]  But I've now really discovered and researched exactly why I'm being attacked and demonized
[47:50.900 --> 47:55.900]  second only to President Trump. They have ratcheted up their demonization ahead of 2020
[47:55.900 --> 48:05.900]  to make me a symbol of evil and fraud and lies and fake news to be a icon so they can support censorship,
[48:05.900 --> 48:12.900]  and so they can hype their supporters up into a 10 minutes of hate directly from 1984.
[48:12.900 --> 48:19.900]  And so they can then destroy me and have a fake victory before 2020,
[48:19.900 --> 48:23.900]  because they've been unable to take out Trump. That's why all this is being done.
[48:23.900 --> 48:28.900]  First, I was to be used to hurt Trump in the election. It backfired.
[48:28.900 --> 48:34.900]  Then our Americana got supercharged because of their attacks and entered the bloodstream
[48:34.900 --> 48:45.900]  of national politics even stronger. And now they have turned us into the thousand foot Godzilla
[48:45.900 --> 48:50.900]  that they projected onto us before. Yes, we helped stoke the flames of populism and nationalism.
[48:50.900 --> 48:57.900]  Yes, our audience was of all the great organizations and groups up front with drudge and only a few others
[48:57.900 --> 49:04.900]  in taking the country back. We deserve to be targeted. We earned this.
[49:04.900 --> 49:08.900]  This is a sign of our victory, what we ask for. People always say, take the country back.
[49:08.900 --> 49:12.900]  Well, do you know what that's going to take? Sacrifice. I'm very honored.
[49:12.900 --> 49:18.900]  But now it's gone into 10 times previous attacks.
[49:18.900 --> 49:22.900]  It's foaming at the mouth, almost every talk station.
[49:22.900 --> 49:25.900]  Rock and roll stations will break in and say mean things about me.
[49:25.900 --> 49:28.900]  I'll be listening to XM and they'll just say something horrible about me.
[49:28.900 --> 49:31.900]  You tune into Howard Stern. He's saying something horrible.
[49:31.900 --> 49:39.900]  I mean, it's just the orders have gone out. This man is the devil and he is to be destroyed.
[49:39.900 --> 49:47.900]  And if you understand why they're doing it, you understand the key to their larger game plan.
[49:47.900 --> 49:51.900]  They are making their move.
[49:51.900 --> 49:57.900]  And then once they've trained their followers to hate me and once they radicalize the left even more,
[49:57.900 --> 50:00.900]  they will then turn them loose on everybody else.
[50:00.900 --> 50:07.900]  That's all. I'm like a training toy to give them the taste of blood and to get them to attack
[50:07.900 --> 50:12.900]  me and once they've all gone along with lying about me, then it's everybody else.
[50:12.900 --> 50:18.900]  And here's a few examples. I've always talked about how this is very important.
[50:18.900 --> 50:24.900]  On one end of the spectrum, you've got people with mass Stockholm syndrome who will believe anything corporate media tells them.
[50:24.900 --> 50:28.900]  We've got all the examples of that. There's still folks that think Russia gets real.
[50:28.900 --> 50:34.900]  Two thirds of Democrats do. And on the other end, you've got people that think this is all a simulation and nothing's real.
[50:34.900 --> 50:41.900]  In fact, most big computer heads are like that because they're living inside simulation already in a false reality of zeros and ones,
[50:41.900 --> 50:46.900]  a mathematical construction, and so they start projecting out of the world around them.
[50:46.900 --> 50:49.900]  When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[50:49.900 --> 50:54.900]  So you've got folks that believe everything they're told and don't question the universe or anything.
[50:54.900 --> 51:00.900]  And they have people on the other end who think the earth is flat and who think that maybe this is a simulation and nothing's real.
[51:00.900 --> 51:08.900]  And they have the right to do that. But you're going to get more people on the other end of the spectrum not believing anything, science, anything,
[51:08.900 --> 51:13.900]  because they've been lied to so much.
[51:13.900 --> 51:18.900]  You know, children that get abused by their parents that get lied to, those are the people that get psychosis.
[51:18.900 --> 51:23.900]  Really strong psychosis where they don't know what reality is and what it isn't.
[51:23.900 --> 51:32.900]  And so there's an artificial insanity for everyone. It's like having your windshield fogged up.
[51:32.900 --> 51:38.900]  You normally don't have it fogged up, but when there's all these lies, all this propaganda, all the WMDs,
[51:38.900 --> 51:45.900]  and babies and incubators, and nerve gas attacks that turn out to be ISIS and they said it was Assad,
[51:45.900 --> 51:50.900]  you start to not know what's real and what isn't because you get lied to so much.
[51:50.900 --> 52:04.900]  And so it's an artificial synthetic fog, fog of war that becomes a psychosis because a psychosis is not being able to differentiate reality mentally.
[52:04.900 --> 52:11.900]  And so I said it was almost a form, a form of psychosis. This is my own lay psychology.
[52:11.900 --> 52:18.900]  I don't have a degree in this. I'm just a student of the world, an old school hand of the world.
[52:18.900 --> 52:22.900]  And he let me drive his truck when he was too drunk to.
[52:22.900 --> 52:26.900]  And he'd wink and give me money for the girls.
[52:26.900 --> 52:33.900]  And our lives were like some old western movie, sorry, I'm singing a line from The Highwomen.
[52:33.900 --> 52:37.900]  Same with that song, Desperado's Waiting for a Train. We ought to play that today.
[52:37.900 --> 52:42.900]  I'm digressing.
[52:42.900 --> 52:49.900]  So that's how they operate. And then they take that. Joan says he has a psychosis.
[52:49.900 --> 52:54.900]  Joan says he was crazy when he did this. No, I was saying when they lie to you so much about everything else,
[52:54.900 --> 52:57.900]  it's perfectly normal not to believe anything anymore.
[52:57.900 --> 53:02.900]  But then when people started thinking that I was Bill Hicks or Beau Bridges or Jeff Bridges and really believe it,
[53:02.900 --> 53:08.900]  what's the frequency, Dan? Dan, what's the frequency? Stuff like that happens to you enough.
[53:08.900 --> 53:15.900]  You start seeing how the system lying so much and all the confusion and all the poison and electromagnetic
[53:15.900 --> 53:18.900]  and just everything out there, mental illness is way up.
[53:18.900 --> 53:22.900]  Because people don't know what to differentiate anymore and they crack up.
[53:22.900 --> 53:25.900]  Kind of like an astronaut who's super tough and super smart.
[53:25.900 --> 53:32.900]  But 50 days inside a capsule with weird buzzers going off and stuff, they start going crazy.
[53:32.900 --> 53:37.900]  Temporary, slide into a type of psychosis.
[53:37.900 --> 53:41.900]  That's a really smart statement. It's true.
[53:41.900 --> 53:47.900]  In that everything starts looking like a nail because they've lied so much and then you look at those things
[53:47.900 --> 53:50.900]  and even though you can't prove it one way or another, there's some anomalies, you go ahead and just say,
[53:50.900 --> 53:56.900]  yeah, it probably is. I'm proud of the fact that I've always been honest and always questioned and had courage.
[53:56.900 --> 53:58.900]  But they make that see something evil and then say,
[53:58.900 --> 54:01.900]  Joan admits he has a psychosis, which is not what I said.
[54:01.900 --> 54:07.900]  I said almost a form and I described it. Let's see.
[54:07.900 --> 54:10.900]  Most of these places they tell you, Joan admits he's crazy.
[54:10.900 --> 54:16.900]  They even edit out the almost or they fade the audio down right before so they can put their fraud out and lie to you.
[54:16.900 --> 54:19.900]  Here it is.
[54:19.900 --> 54:28.900]  There's a question that I should have asked you today in deposition that I didn't.
[54:28.900 --> 54:34.900]  That's a good question.
[54:42.900 --> 54:44.900]  I can't take it back.
[54:44.900 --> 54:51.900]  Okay, Mr. Jones, you would agree with me that when some damage happens,
[54:51.900 --> 54:59.900]  when you break something, when you cause something to be lost, when you hurt somebody,
[54:59.900 --> 55:05.900]  whether it's intentional or whether it's a mistake, there's consequences for that, right?
[55:05.900 --> 55:09.900]  People should be accountable for the people they hurt.
[55:09.900 --> 55:14.900]  Objection is to form.
[55:14.900 --> 55:18.900]  Well, sometimes people claim they've been hurt and they haven't been.
[55:18.900 --> 55:21.900]  So you have to look at the agenda behind things.
[55:21.900 --> 55:26.900]  You have to balance things about why has the mainstream media lied so much, why have governments lied so much.
[55:26.900 --> 55:30.900]  The fact that the public doesn't believe what they're told anymore and we're going to criminalize questioning
[55:30.900 --> 55:34.900]  Jesse Smollett or WMDs or babies and incubators.
[55:34.900 --> 55:38.900]  And it really is the fact that we've allowed the government and institutions to become so corrupt
[55:38.900 --> 55:43.900]  that people lost any compass of what's real.
[55:43.900 --> 55:49.900]  And I myself almost had like a pool of psychosis back in the past where I basically thought everything was staged,
[55:49.900 --> 55:52.900]  even though I'm now learned a lot of times things aren't staged.
[55:52.900 --> 55:58.900]  So I think as a pundit and someone giving opinion that my opinions have been wrong,
[55:58.900 --> 56:01.900]  but they were never wrong consciously to hurt people.
[56:01.900 --> 56:06.900]  And so I think it's part of that process of me growing up in Rockwell, Texas,
[56:06.900 --> 56:10.900]  and watching the police steal drugs and then conduct anti-drug programs at the school.
[56:10.900 --> 56:13.900]  I think that shook my opinion of police in general.
[56:13.900 --> 56:18.900]  And I was very anti-law enforcement until I grew up and learned more things and now I'm pretty much pro-police.
[56:18.900 --> 56:21.900]  So it's been a process.
[56:21.900 --> 56:23.900]  And life is a process.
[56:23.900 --> 56:27.900]  Oh, Alex, you questioned Sandy Hook when everybody else was questioning it.
[56:27.900 --> 56:31.900]  I had all these liberals at the Beto rally going, hey, I questioned Sandy Hook.
[56:31.900 --> 56:35.900]  I mean, most people don't buy it for whatever reason.
[56:35.900 --> 56:40.900]  And then once you say, okay, I apologize.
[56:40.900 --> 56:42.900]  If any of this hurt you, they go, oh, we got you.
[56:42.900 --> 56:43.900]  Keep apologizing.
[56:43.900 --> 56:50.900]  And then they turn you into this devil when the New York Times isn't apologizing for lying about WMDs consciously.
[56:50.900 --> 56:54.900]  CNN doesn't apologize for any of their lies about Russiagate.
[56:54.900 --> 56:55.900]  None of them do.
[56:55.900 --> 56:56.900]  They did it on purpose.
[56:56.900 --> 56:57.900]  They get a memo.
[56:57.900 --> 56:58.900]  They put lies out.
[56:58.900 --> 57:00.900]  But oh, the left is all sanctimonious like that lawyer.
[57:00.900 --> 57:03.900]  He's a big leftist sitting there.
[57:03.900 --> 57:05.900]  Aren't you sorry for what you've done?
[57:05.900 --> 57:07.900]  No, I'm not sorry for what I've done.
[57:07.900 --> 57:11.900]  I'm sorry if me having to ask these questions hurt people's feelings.
[57:11.900 --> 57:14.900]  And I'm sorry for tragedies, but I didn't kill those children.
[57:14.900 --> 57:22.900]  But we've had this senator, Murphy or Murray, whatever the hell his name is, up there in Connecticut,
[57:22.900 --> 57:25.900]  come out and say that I killed this guy that died last week.
[57:25.900 --> 57:28.900]  He said I killed him.
[57:28.900 --> 57:29.900]  The Sandy Hook father.
[57:29.900 --> 57:31.900]  That's outrageous.
[57:31.900 --> 57:34.900]  He gets to have his platform and say that, but not me.
[57:34.900 --> 57:37.900]  He just said I killed that man.
[57:37.900 --> 57:41.900]  That's okay because he's an anointed leftist.
[57:41.900 --> 57:45.900]  He said the survival of our democracy depends on banning info wars.
[57:45.900 --> 57:47.900]  The whole system's declared war on me.

[59:52.900 --> 01:00:02.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:08.900]  It's Alex Jones always informative very smart guy.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:17.900]  We're talking about Alex Jones and the fact of the matter is is that the companies that allow people like him conspiracy theorists to be able to
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:25.900]  survey lies have a responsibility. There is no constitutional duty on an Internet company to allow somebody to terrorize
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.900]  parents of mass tragedies like Alex Jones did for so long.
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:35.900]  The Newtown families are proceeding with a court case to try to hold him accountable.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:42.900]  But the companies that allow for this nonsense this garbage to be spread out over the Internet.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:49.900]  Have a responsibility and a duty themselves to do something earlier in the case.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:53.900]  So Sandy Hook hasn't been successful in getting the guns.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:59.900]  CNN's complaining they're going man they took the guns in New Zealand in just a week.
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.900]  We can't get the guns here.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.900]  So it failed to get the second amendment.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:08.900]  So they've got to get our first amendment and that's what that senator is doing.
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:13.900]  Who by the way was heavily involved in his career sucking off of Sandy Hook to get elected.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:18.900]  I've now learned you've got Senator Blumenthal's son that works in law firm that's suing me there.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.900]  I mean this is a Democrat franchise.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.900]  They're the ones that live off the deaths of these kids.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.900]  They're the ones that obsess over it.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:30.900]  And in my name say things I never said and then beat their chest and call for an end of the first amendment.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.900]  What a group of monsters.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:38.900]  Now the always informative and really smart Bob Barnes who's fighting all this with us.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.900]  Chief legal counsel will be joining us the rest of the hour.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.900]  We'll cover a waterfront of news.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.900]  And then Ben Garrison who's also being demonized and taken off the Internet.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.900]  He'll be joining us.
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.900]  We'll have open phones as well.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.900]  And a lot of other world news I haven't hit will cover the start of the next segment.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.900]  But getting back to the deposition.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.900]  This is where the Texas lawyer who is just a puppet.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:05.900]  I mean he's completely run by the Connecticut law firm and Senator Blumenthal's operation and Chris Murphy's operation.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.900]  Where he they just go through buzzwords for the media.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.900]  I mean all this was with sound bite questions for the media.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:18.900]  And they asked about a big bowl of chili and I'm supposed to answer about a big bowl of chili so then they can make me sound stupid.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:23.900]  And this is the type of just weirdness where these people think getting in the news is cool.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.900]  And I mean it does something in this whole bandwagon.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.900]  So here it is.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.900]  That's for my memory not what happens.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.900]  I can't comment on hypotheticals.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:40.900]  So if I was to say to you if somebody was to come along and strike your hand with a hammer would it hurt.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.900]  You can't answer that question.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.900]  I'm not striking anybody with hammers.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.900]  If I asked you if I gave you a big bowl of chili might it affect your memory.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:50.900]  You can't answer that.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.900]  That's hypothetical.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.900]  Correct.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:03:02.900]  You're just not going to answer those kind of questions.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.900]  I'll take it that's now.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.900]  Let's move on.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.900]  I'll take it that wasn't a question.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.900]  Is that a question?
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:08.900]  That's a comment.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.900]  That's not a question.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.900]  This is becoming one of the most harassing of yet.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.900]  This is for TV and for PR.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.900]  Not for a legitimate suit.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.900]  That's what this is.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:16.900]  That's all this is.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.900]  You want to put it on TV.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.900]  This is just a show and it's a bad show at that.
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.900]  To show how not to be a lawyer in deposition of a case show.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.900]  I mean if you want to be fair and you want to ask real questions go ahead.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.900]  But always don't make comments and then try to reinterpret those comments as a question
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.900]  and then try to put words in the mouth of the witness.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.900]  First of your law students should know that.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.900]  What was your objection?
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.900]  The objection was to your comment saying that there was an answer.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.900]  My point was you didn't ask a question so there couldn't have been an answer
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.900]  and I was objecting for the record purposes that no answer was given to a question that
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.900]  had not been asked.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.900]  Do you maybe want to take a break so we can have a few breaths?
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.900]  Yeah, you might need to do that.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.900]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.900]  Maybe you can go back and read how to ask people.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.900]  Okay.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.900]  Then there's this clip at the end where they weren't even supposed to discuss releasing
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:08.900]  it for 30 days but it was released in just about two and a half weeks.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.900]  Here's that clip.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.900]  Please go ahead and respond to that.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:16.900]  So what we have in the protective order is that for the 30 days following any deposition
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.900]  the parties must treat all of the deposition testimony and exhibits
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.900]  and other documents produced at any deposition as attorney's eyes only
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.900]  and so they're marked confidential until that time.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.900]  Thank you.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:31.900]  So no designation of confidentiality has been made today?
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.900]  Absolutely.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.900]  The whole thing is confidential right now?
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.900]  It's presumed until 30 days.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.900]  And we have 30 days to designate confidential.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:39.900]  Absolutely.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.900]  Very well.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.900]  That's good.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.900]  But again, when you're Democrats you can do whatever you want.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.900]  Small it.
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:47.900]  No charges.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.900]  Charges dropped.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.900]  Cabinoc users.
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.900]  All fake.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:51.900]  It's okay though.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:52.900]  Brush the gate.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:53.900]  All fake.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.900]  Tell those you kids.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:55.900]  All fake.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.900]  It's okay.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:02.900]  As the years go by it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.900]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.900]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:11.900]  needed daily.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.900]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.

[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:11.900]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:17.900]  Jones show.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:23.900]  Now that the Mueller investigation is over many questions are falling upon Adam Schiff
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:29.900]  and others who all claimed to have direct knowledge of criminal evidence against President
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.900]  Donald Trump.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.900]  I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.900]  Cold hard evidence.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:41.900]  Have you seen things on the classified side that you cannot tell us about though that is
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.900]  even stronger evidence than what is out there publicly?
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:46.900]  Yes.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:52.900]  Some people are saying they are guilty of treason but the statute for treason specifies that
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.900]  the person levies war against the United States or adheres to their enemies.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:03.900]  And while we may discover that may be true for some there is one statute that seems to
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.900]  apply to many.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:15.900]  Enacted in 1940 as the Alien Registration Act or the Smith Act, 18 U.S. Code 2385 prescribes
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.900]  advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:25.900]  The corrupt establishment was not willing to accept an outlier in the White House and
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:30.900]  their attempt at overthrowing the president with a FISA warrant based on a fake Russian
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:31.900]  dossier.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:38.900]  With no evidence of a crime, the FBI was discussing plans for a coup d'etat.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:45.900]  According to court documents, several mainstream media outlets were hired to report on Russian
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.900]  interference as directed.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:53.900]  And the American people who put their faith in the mainstream media were manipulated and
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.900]  turned against their lawful elected government.
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:03.900]  It all certainly seems to fit 18 U.S. Code 2385.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:11.900]  Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises or teaches the duty, necessity,
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:18.900]  desirability or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government of the United States.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.900]  Government's going to kill this guy.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:26.900]  Whoever with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government, prints,
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:35.900]  publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells, distributes or publicly displays any written
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:41.900]  or printed matter advocating, advising or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:47.900]  or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.900]  You take on the intelligence community.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.900]  They have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:58.900]  Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group or assembly of persons
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:05.900]  who teach, advocate or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:13.900]  or violence or becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society, group or
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.900]  assembly of persons knowing the purposes thereof.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:25.900]  Those found guilty of 18 U.S. Code 2385 can be imprisoned for up to 20 years and perhaps
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:32.900]  further investigations will lead to charges of sedition or even treason.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.900]  The righteous heart wants justice to be served.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:40.900]  For where there is no law, there is no freedom.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:44.900]  Reporting for infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.900]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:14.900]  Until recently, no mainstream media really got into strategies of the Democrat Republican
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:18.900]  parties and who controlled them and what was really going on because both parties were
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.900]  pretty much run by the same groups.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.900]  That's Georgetown political science head, Carol Quigley wrote about it.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:30.900]  It's really uncontested that for the times of Kennedy on until recently, they really
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.900]  had a monolithic party.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:36.900]  They fought over power, but they agreed on the agenda.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:41.900]  Thanks to the internet and shows like this one and Drudge Report and others, but particularly
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:48.900]  this broadcast in this area, we were able to popularize understanding what was in the
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.900]  academic literature, what you'd call conspiracy literature.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:57.900]  You hold up a Carol Quigley book or as a Big New Brzezinski book, they tell the intelligency
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.900]  everything they're doing, but they're in on the global government.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.900]  So they're telling them how it works, but from their perspective, we're like, look,
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.900]  they admit this horrible plan, here's how they do it.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.900]  So we popularized getting into the guts of this and now all over the world, people are
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.900]  looking at the power behind the throne.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.900]  They're looking at collusion by parties and once you do that, it's came over.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.900]  The system was so arrogant, they defeated Barry Goldwater and they'd ignored Ron Paul
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.900]  and they thought they'd contained us, but in the last four or five years, it exploded.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:31.900]  Donald Trump, perfectly man of destiny, rode in on that wave and now the fight is joined.
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.900]  So I want to get into the big report we did last night.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:36.900]  It's been confirmed.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.900]  Trump is going to be one of the deep state.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.900]  He is intending.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.900]  He signaled it.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.900]  My intel and sources.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.900]  It's happening.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:47.900]  We're going to get more into that, that videos on infowars.com and we'll show you that video
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.900]  where it's posted.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.900]  So folks that are watching and listening and go find it easily and share it.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:58.900]  It's up in the video carousel up at the top, but I wanted to ask you, Bob, because you're
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:05.900]  a smart guy, why you think they've chosen me because now the attacks are 10 times what
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.900]  they've ever been.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:12.900]  I mean, it is just insane all over TV, local news, all over the country, total lies, twisting
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]  everything.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.900]  Like I'm a country they're about to invade and it's just ramping up, ramping up, ramping
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.900]  up.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.900]  It's not just about them trying to win these fake lawsuits.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:24.620]  I believe they have to destroy me to set the precedent to create a symbol of fake news
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.540]  that I'm supposedly the symbol of that demonized devil.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.460]  And then with that key, they open every door and shut everyone else down.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.300]  They create the 10 minutes of hate using my image.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.820]  They steal the victory of our Americana populist movement, our listeners super charging it,
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:38.820]  our victory.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:41.100]  They turn a symbol of victory into a symbol of defeat.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:45.780]  They kind of steal the flag and then run and hide it and is that true?
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.780]  And then what else is there?
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:47.780]  And then where does it go?
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:52.940]  Well, basically, they're trying to effectively make it illegal to do anything other than
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.820]  spread institutional narratives.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:59.260]  So if you spread any news that's not the institutional narrative, whether it's big media or the government,
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.180]  then you can be sued into oblivion.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:05.260]  You can be blacklisted off of all of social media and you can be demonized throughout
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.780]  the whole public square.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.540]  And that's really the goal and the objective is to use you as the tell tale example to
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.700]  achieve that objective.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.860]  And the effect of that is basically to destroy the independent free press in the United States,
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.460]  that if you spread any message, that message has to be institutionally approved, has to
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:25.100]  be state sanctioned, has to be media approved, the big media approved.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.100]  And that's why there's double standards in how they're applying law and a wide range
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.380]  of context here.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:33.300]  That's why they're willing to defame you while claiming that there's defamation suits that
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.780]  they can bring against you.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:39.780]  So you're seeing that systematic effort to completely corrode the fundamental First Amendment
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:44.380]  freedoms because those First Amendment freedoms are foundational to the ability of the ordinary
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.860]  everyday person to have meaningful political power in the United States.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:51.740]  Because that power is contingent, independent upon, and independent free press willing to
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:55.420]  share distant messages that are not state sanctioned and that are not institutionally
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.420]  approved.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:59.940]  Because that's the only way in which real change happens and they blame the Trump election
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.700]  on your success.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.300]  And let's explain that and quantify that.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.060]  Everything's about shimbles.
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.020]  Should the globalists aren't targeting our regular listeners or targeting the public
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:13.540]  that doesn't know who we are yet so that when they finally do see us, they self-judge and
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:19.220]  are quote, inoculated against being converted or radicalized as the establishment would
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.380]  call it.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.140]  But there's something that is targeting our listeners to where they get so sick of us
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:30.660]  being demonized that they're scared to promote us and also stop defending so then they won't
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.620]  defend the next people that are brought down.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:33.620]  Precisely.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.180]  It's the same thing that basically Mueller and the Deep State tried to do against Trump.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.660]  Try to get people to be afraid to defend him, afraid to back them up, afraid to support
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:45.860]  him, afraid to stand up for him, afraid to send him messages, afraid because his real
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:50.060]  political power, his real power was completely contingent dependent upon ordinary people
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.300]  giving him that power.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.580]  They were the fuel by which he could do something.
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.020]  Their greatest fear is us communicating with the president.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.020]  Precisely.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.820]  And by doing so, they need to silence that, they need to control that, they need to coerce
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.820]  people through public shaming and public censorship campaigns to achieve an objective
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.340]  they cannot obtain if people have freedom of press and freedom of speech in the United
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.340]  States.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:12.220]  So when we come back, I want to ask you how we counter that because one of the smartest
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.540]  people I know, and then we're going to shift gears into the video that I just showed earlier.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.540]  It's up on infowars.com.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:22.140]  I'm going to have its own article posted at the front page so that people can share
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:26.420]  it, but it's right up there in the top of the carousel where you see the videos.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:31.020]  And again, I'll just show you on my phones how people can find that.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.580]  But it's up on infowars.com.

[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:02.580]  PD stopped eating.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.780]  All of his hair fell out.

[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.260]  No results.
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.660]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.980]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:11.780]  there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:19.260]  and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:24.140]  like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:28.060]  They don't want us to have that victory, they don't want us to remember what political
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:34.500]  action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:39.580]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.020]  sovereignty away.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.780]  This country is in a war, so again, I want to thank you for what you've done but I want
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:49.500]  to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.820]  the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:20:01.340]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, infowarstore.com, thank you.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:18.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:24.140]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:31.180]  So we're breaking down the real agenda, the battle plan and the globalist knew that the
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:38.620]  info war's audience, back on election week, we had 87 million different IP addresses,
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:43.540]  watch video or click on our live stream or on our YouTube or Facebook.
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:50.580]  That was conservative, okay, 87 million people, that's bigger than Super Bowl tune in and
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.820]  they were just like, okay, drop the hammer, they were already censoring before shadow
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.740]  banning, they just, but that wasn't working.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:01.260]  So they publicly banned us and de-platformed everything, that didn't work.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:05.380]  And again, they need to destroy us to have that victory over the First Amendment.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:09.740]  So we've been chosen as the champion, like in the old days, like El Cid's a true story,
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:13.380]  it's a great movie, very accurate, they would have two champions instead of two kingdoms
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:19.740]  going to war in ancient Spain, they would pick two champions to kill each other and
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:26.180]  whoever won that battle instead of having 5,000 soldiers die, you only lost, you know,
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.380]  one soldier because they were fighting the Moors.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.540]  And so we couldn't have, they used to have big wars, but all those kingdoms, Spain had
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:34.660]  like six or seven kingdoms, but after that, they couldn't have many more.
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.580]  And so they want to destroy me, I've been chosen as the champion, I'm not saying I'm
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:44.060]  the champion, I'm not saying I'm perfect, they have chosen me as the symbol of Americana
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.460]  for destruction.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:49.260]  And so now we talked about their plan, Bob, and what they're doing.
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:53.420]  Now we talk about how do we counter that, they were unable to destroy Trump, so now
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:59.780]  they've picked me to destroy as a morale booster and to set the precedent to kill the First
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:02.860]  Amendment and set the precedent to create the Alex Jones statue.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.660]  Precisely, I mean, the goal and the objective is to demonize you to such a degree that they
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:10.460]  can demonize your message and they can demonize your audience and they can demonize anyone
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:12.580]  who ever wants to walk into your shoes.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:15.460]  And so that's the continuous pattern that's taking place here.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:21.300]  And it's a PR campaign that was launched in Hollywood with its caricature that it created
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.660]  in the Homeland Show.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.220]  Then it's launched by the media and the press, then they use the lawsuits for PR purposes
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:31.060]  rather than for legitimate lawsuit purposes, as it's already happening here.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:35.500]  Then on top of that, the media uses what's happening in the lawsuits to try to create
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:40.860]  another false narrative and another fake story to try to further demonize, to further marginalize.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.340]  And it actually reflects an old objective, if you go back and study the cultural portrayal
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:49.700]  of poor whites or African Americans between 1900 and 1970, you'll see a similar demonization
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:54.220]  of entire groups of people in the way they're portrayed in books and movies and film, solely
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:59.260]  to make people afraid of a narrative that's an old Americana narrative, but it's separate
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.660]  and independent from the institutional press.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:05.300]  It's a narrative that challenges and questions the institutional narrative.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:08.700]  It's a narrative that is more foundational and fundamental to American freedoms than
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.300]  the institutional presses.
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:13.220]  And because of that, they need to suppress it, they need to censor it, they need to
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:16.540]  shame it, and in order to achieve that, you're the one they've chosen to be.
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.820]  The target to say, if you do what Alex Jones did, we'll treat you, we'll do what we did
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:21.980]  to Alex Jones.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:22.980]  That's the goal, that's the objective.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:24.980]  So that's it, it's the Alex Jones treatment.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:25.980]  Absolutely.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.380]  It's to say- It's like when they took William Wallace and drawn, quartered him, and torched
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.020]  him to death for everybody, it was a message.
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:34.780]  The most powerful form of censorship, as people like on the left, like Noam Chomsky and others
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.980]  have identified, is self-censorship.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.900]  But how do you get people to self-censorship?
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:41.540]  You get them to believe they're being surveilled all the time, that they can be censored at
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.380]  any time, that they can be shamed for their support at any time.
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.380]  That's how you do it.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:46.380]  That's how you achieve it.
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:47.740]  That's how the objective is accomplished.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.860]  And that's what they're trying to do here.
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:53.900]  They're trying to terrorize the audience and terrorize future Alex Joneses from ever participating
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.820]  in this thought, a free press experience.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.620]  And on YouTube and Facebook, if you're a, quote, conspiracy person, that just means
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:05.580]  questioning the official narrative, if you attack me, they allow you to do it.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.900]  And so they're monetized.
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:11.460]  And so all these people that used to like me, now their business is attacking me, hundreds
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:16.140]  of channels, because suddenly they don't get censored and they get monetized.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:19.300]  And so now all these channels are attack Alex Jones channels.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.980]  So they're hitting me from the questioning angle and they're hitting me from the establishment
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:23.980]  angle.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:27.780]  I've talked to a bunch of family neighbors, crew here, they've got Time Warner, it changed
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:29.860]  his name to Spectrum.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:35.500]  And they have the local news here, run by CNN, literally every 15 minutes, there's an attack
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.540]  piece that just re-rolls.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.700]  And they even use old footage and go, here's Alex Jones losing in court.
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.580]  Here's Alex Jones, who says he's crazy.
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:44.740]  Here's Alex Jones, who's a racist.
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.620]  Jones is being taken off the internet for being anti-Semitic.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:53.340]  And it's like 1984, but really it's not even me, it's that tarot card of Alex Jones.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.580]  They've just, they've just created it.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.700]  And one of the really astute things you point out, because I read a lot of history myself,
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:03.060]  I never get into this stuff, is America's real history was way more rich and way more
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.060]  complex.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.340]  And anytime you talk about real history, they go, oh, you're defending it.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.340]  No, no, no.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:09.340]  It was the time they lived.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.340]  There were blacks that owned slaves.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.860]  There were still slaves in Africa.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.820]  There were all these different forms of systems.
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:21.140]  And you talk about how Hollywood demonized real American history, where New Yorkers and
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:26.740]  people still believe anywhere in the South, there's KKK running around and burning crosses.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.140]  And all of that Hollywood move actually built up the KKK for a while.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.900]  And how they've, again, created this whole false narrative where we're all scared of
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:33.900]  each other.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.900]  Absolutely.
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.300]  Like you go back and you study American history, they've tried to demonize poor white Southern
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.900]  culture in particular, people who think that deliverance is a documentary of the South,
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:44.100]  which was my experience when I was up at Yale.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:47.300]  And the reason that I started to study this phenomenon that happened to both African American
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:51.340]  culture and poor white culture, because they had a narrative of life experience that was
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:55.100]  different than the institutional narrative they spread in the civics books in third grade.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:59.620]  They understood, I mean, you go back and discover that there was a, there was biracial coalitions
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:03.300]  between poor white Southerners and African Americans going back to the 1830s.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.700]  Many of the poor whites in the mountains of East Tennessee and places like that voted
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.980]  against slavery, voted against the civil war.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.980]  Many of them later joined the populist, the original populist movement from where the
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.740]  term originates, the People's Party of the 1890s, then after that, and that's why they,
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.900]  what people don't know is that in fact, not only did they disfranchise most African Americans
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.100]  in the South, but the institutional powers that be disfranchised most poor whites in
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.100]  the South.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:28.260]  And the robber barons from, as you said, the 1830s learned to fear populist coalitions.
[01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:29.260]  Precisely.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:33.300]  Everything you hear about anti-racism is actually making people all hate each other so we don't
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:34.300]  have coalitions.
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.300]  Exactly.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.860]  The Southerners celebrates divisive events rather than events like my case in Milwaukee
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.860]  that brought people together.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:41.700]  Your big case you just won that you can't talk about.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:42.700]  Precisely.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:43.700]  It was a unifying case.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.940]  It was a case when people looked at that, they didn't see the color.
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.500]  They settled in day three of the trial?
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.500]  That's correct.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.020]  And it's a case where the jury and the public didn't see the color of his skin they saw
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.020]  a human being.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:57.260]  And when you get that achievement, you get cross-racial, biracial, cross-political coalitions
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:58.780]  that are humanitarian-based.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.780]  Shared experience.
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:00.780]  Absolutely.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.900]  And that's real power.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.220]  And that's the power they're afraid of.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:04.420]  That's the power they're scared of.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.820]  I mean, you're talking about corporate elites and economic elites who are looking at trying
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:12.900]  to automate large portions of labor and employment, looking at AI as a solution for their future,
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:17.540]  labor needs and other needs who increasingly don't see human beings as human beings.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:20.420]  That's why they can support wars that drop bombs.
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:23.420]  Oh, they say we're replacing you, we're making a post-human era.
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:24.420]  Exactly.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:25.420]  They want a drone-driven era.
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:29.140]  They want, you know, the idea that drones could drop a bomb and kill a bunch of kids
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.740]  in a school doesn't bother them, they don't blink an eye about it.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:36.340]  So it's the lack of humanitarianism within key positions of power around the world that
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:39.740]  is now being threatened by the popular and populist revolutions and rebellions that are
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.380]  taking place, not only across the United States, but across Europe and the world.
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:45.380]  And they're afraid of that, need to oppress that and suppress that.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.940]  What would you call this, this period, because some people I know are like, oh no, the globals
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.980]  are still so powerful, you know, they're still going to win.
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:55.140]  I think they are in deep trouble.
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:58.340]  If they weren't in deep trouble, they wouldn't need to be waging the personal war they're
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:59.620]  waging against you.
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:05.900]  So if they were, in fact, safely ensconced and felt completely as safe as a baby rocking
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:10.220]  in their mother's arms, they wouldn't need to be attacking you, demonizing you, constant
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:14.620]  lawfare waged against you, constant blacklisting on social media against you.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.980]  They wouldn't need to do all of that.
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:19.220]  They need to do all of that because we're in a transitional period, we're in a period
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.300]  where either the people are going to win or the elites are going to win, where the future
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:26.060]  is either going to be little d-democratic or totally capital-A authoritarian.
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.580]  And that's what they know, that's what they recognize, and to their credit, they realize
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:30.580]  that they're up against it.
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:34.460]  They realize that they're on the cusp of losing the power that they've long sought.
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.260]  And that's why they're waging a personal war against you and InfoWars.
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:40.420]  Well, people just heard total veritas, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.420]  That's why it's happening.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.420]  They looked and said, who's Mr. Anti-Globalist?
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:45.940]  They said, he's ground zero.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:46.940]  Get him.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.140]  That's why your support is so critical.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.460]  We'll be back to look at Trump.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:52.260]  He's set to start the indictments and arrest.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.860]  It's really going to happen, folks.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:55.860]  Stay with us, infowars.com.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:59.900]  Ooh, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:05.060]  Bad breath and bad gas, PD stopped eating, all of his hair fell out, itching, licking,
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:11.540]  missing fur, at least $5,000, and fat bills, creams, antibiotics, sprays, no results, everything
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:16.620]  we tried failed except the Dynabyte, D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E, dot com.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.020]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you gotta feed this hungry healthy.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:25.140]  The omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.900]  of regular dog food, Dynabyte is nutrition.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.700]  The shedding is stopped and itching is stopped.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:36.380]  Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy, and shiny, and glossy.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.380]  She's got life.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.380]  She's got energy.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.380]  Tons of energy.
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.380]  No more bad smells.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:41.380]  Dynabyte's the mom.
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:46.700]  Dynabyte is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs, you know, besides me, of course.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.700]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1,000.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:49.700]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1,000.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:50.700]  Dynabyte for life.
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.700]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:30:03.420]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:06.540]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:09.060]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:12.540]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.180]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:19.060]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.420]  simply trying to bring it back.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:24.820]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:28.820]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:32.420]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:37.220]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products

[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.260]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can't food during the fall,
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.740]  so they have it during the winter.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:07.580]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:15.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:24.580]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:54.500]  We're in the midst of a battle between nation-states and capitalist prosperity, and the
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:59.380]  globalists who've used capitalism, crony capitalism for consolidation of power, are
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:03.820]  trying to pull up the ladders so that the public don't have a chance to become middle
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.820]  class.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:10.100]  We're watching an attempt at global governance post-human system, and I'm going to get into
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:16.380]  Trump's plan and his move and the statements he's made that they plan criminal prosecutions
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:19.780]  against the deep state, and Trump doesn't just say something and then not attempt it,
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:22.540]  and most of the time he succeeds, so it's not just our sources.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:26.620]  I played a bunch of these clips yesterday, we did a special report on it that's up on
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:32.700]  Infowars.com that Trump is preparing hundreds of indictments in the next year as he prepares
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.620]  to move against the deep state.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:43.780]  We're talking about how Mr. Trump plans to carry that out, but also how the system plans
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:47.140]  to strike back, so we'll get Bob Barnes' take on that in a moment.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:55.220]  First off, listen, I need the listeners and the viewers that haven't ever gone to InfowarsTour.com

[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:28.780]  got in the next few days, Bob so you heard my preface there, where do you want to take
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.900]  this because you've got a lot of historical knowledge, you've been to a lot of the high-level
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:35.940]  lawyer meetings, you've met with some of the top editors in the country recently, about
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:39.700]  their kill shot on me is a kill shot on the free speech, they don't want to make the kill
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:43.460]  shot on free speech, they go oh it's the bad guy Alex Jones, but while we're debating
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:47.900]  Alex Jones, they take everyone down, that's why we've got to be defended because we've
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:53.740]  been picked as the test case, moving on from that to Trump, and what we just talked about
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:57.420]  and the video that's on infowars.com will put on screen so TV viewers and others can
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:01.500]  go there, find it, and share it, we had 40 minutes on this commercial free last night
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:05.740]  but we're going to recap it now, a condensed version, he says he's going to move, he always
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:10.260]  does what he says, world exclusive, Trump plans to prosecute hundreds of deep staters
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:15.420]  in 2019, A, he says he's doing it, how do you think you should do it, what are the pitfalls?
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:19.100]  But one of the first places that should be a high priority item are all the people who
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:24.740]  gave unauthorized access to the NSA databases that allowed all kinds of illicit searches
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:30.380]  that started happening in late 2015, it didn't get shut down until Rogers shut it down after
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:33.860]  he was appointed by Trump, so that needs to happen, and you look at like, and he came
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:37.620]  and visited the president and said this is illegal sir, and the FISA court covered its
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:41.380]  ass and put out a report saying we were giving illegal searches, it's not like this is a
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:42.380]  secret.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.860]  Exactly, Samantha Powers was doing hundreds of illegal searches, Susan Rice was doing
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:50.620]  all kinds of illegal searches, so these people need to be focused on, they need to be targeted,
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:54.580]  they need to be investigated, and it needs to stop because there needs to be a message
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:59.740]  that when you have the keys to the most powerful surveillance mechanism the world has ever known,
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:03.460]  which is the echelon and other database systems that exist at the national security agency,
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:08.780]  that if they are used for domestic spying and political opposition purposes, heads have
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:10.940]  to roll, there have to be consequences.
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:15.540]  Because that is technocracy, that is total control, look at China, no escape, Chinese
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.020]  VIP jail puts AI monitors in every cell.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:24.020]  Exactly, I mean the Chinese are, the basically what was happening was Obama was using a Chinese
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:30.740]  model on US-American politics, and it was the first time mass scale, wholesale, illicit
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:34.660]  investigations of people without them knowing it, without their knowledge, and sharing it
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:38.100]  widespread, that's one of the reasons why he should pardon General Flynn.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:41.780]  He should pardon General Flynn and say this is the product of illicit surveillance by
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:46.860]  people like Sally Yates, by people like Samantha Powers, by people like Susan Rice, and get
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:51.100]  involved and use it as an opportunity to make sure it can never happen again.
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:54.620]  It's not only about the president getting remedy against those people who have illicitly
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.460]  harmed him, it's about stopping this from reoccurring ever again.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:01.820]  There needs to be a message that, hey, if you do this, you're going to face real consequences,
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:04.940]  and you're going to face consequences worse than Paul Manafort, and Paul Manafort is being
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:05.940]  put on trial.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:06.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:07.940]  And that's what needs to happen.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:11.220]  If Paul Manafort is the only guy that's harshly punished in all of this, then the wrong message
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:12.220]  has been sent.
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:17.580]  Well, when you use the NSA to bring an approach icon global government and implode our borders,
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.780]  that is the definition of using the military power in might, and that's what the NSA is,
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:22.780]  to overthrow your country.
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.020]  It is high treason.
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:25.020]  Absolutely.
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.020]  It's what led to the church committee.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:30.420]  The Senator Frank Church from Idaho was the first person domestically and illicitly spied
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:34.380]  upon by the original national security agency in the late 1960s.
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:38.860]  So after Watergate, he used it as his opportunity to go after them, to expose them to the world.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:42.220]  That's how we found out about the horrible things our government, our own government.
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:43.220]  MKUltra.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.220]  MKUltra.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:45.220]  Tuskegee.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:46.220]  Tuskegee.
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:50.300]  They're doing a nuclear test and not telling people that there's problems with it by going
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.660]  out and having encouraging them to do picnics and watch it.
[01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:53.660]  I mean, they're still old photos.
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:56.380]  By the way, it turned out a lot more just came out.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.060]  They only gave them the least worst stuff, but then there were whistleblowers, so they
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:04.420]  gave them basically some of the files in each project, but something like 95% never got
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.420]  turned over.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:06.420]  Absolutely.
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.420]  And it's become systematic.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:11.260]  So I mean, Duke University today had to pay $100 million fine for faking environmental
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:15.340]  research on U.S. government grants.
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:17.100]  Their whistleblower report that came out.
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:21.460]  So that kind of problematic behavior at the very top with the most powerful law enforcement
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:25.580]  and intelligence operation in the world, misused our five eyes relationships because
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:30.260]  they were using Australian and U.S. sources and U.K. sources to illicitly spy on the
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.740]  president and his allies.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:35.100]  There has to be consequences for that because if there are not consequences for that, they
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.260]  will do it again and they will do it on a broader and more...
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.260]  Absolutely.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.260]  That is true election meddling.
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:43.940]  And now letting big tech that's bigger than the NSA in many ways operate wildly and then
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:48.380]  Trump letting the EU and others with fines basically tacitly take control of Internet
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:53.460]  regulation, Trump must come in with prohibited legislation to free the Internet.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.460]  Absolutely.
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:58.860]  Because one of the great secrets is that the degree to which big tech is deeply in bed
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.220]  with the deep state.
[01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:05.300]  So Google, Facebook, all the social media giants use their algorithms, use their data
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:07.020]  that they're gathering on individuals.
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:10.980]  They're taking direction from the Obama Stay Behind Network and we come back, I'm going
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.700]  to show exclusive proof of who's behind the lawsuits against us in Connecticut who's
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.900]  actually directing it for the CIA.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.900]  Precisely.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.260]  So what you have is you have people who are propagating, who are lead propagandists for
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:25.340]  suppressing speech in this country, for illicit surveillance in this country, who are pushing
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:29.580]  the attempted deep state coup against the president, who are also deeply invested and
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:34.420]  deeply involved directly or indirectly in the law fair and the political warfare they're
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.700]  waging against you.
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:41.260]  We're going to show you the breakaway rogue group inside the government, they, oh, they're
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:42.580]  so scared of this.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:46.140]  Chris Murphy is so scared of us right now that we put this out, so they want us off
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.140]  air.
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:51.540]  So they demanded the platforming because there's an illegal breakaway group still operating
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:57.420]  against America run by Senator Chris Murphy.
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:58.420]  It's simple.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:01.220]  If you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:03.900]  doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:06.380]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.020]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:12.980]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:13.980]  What is the top tumor?
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:18.020]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best lab in the country?
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:19.020]  Okay.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.020]  They're the highest rate.
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:21.020]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:24.740]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:29.940]  And I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later, 90, 95%, no one's ever
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:30.940]  done it.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:34.420]  It costs a bottle that costs $10, no one's ever done that, sir.
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:36.700]  The average competitor is 3 to 5% here.
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.700]  The top brand is 50%.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:40.220]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:43.580]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our information is explosive.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:44.580]  Our fish oil.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.740]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.

[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:52.140]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:55.140]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:56.140]  Never.

[01:46:54.700 --> 01:47:00.860]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:26.860]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:42.140]  I'm your host Alex Jones, thank you for joining us, attorney Robert Barnes is here with us
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:46.460]  in studio, famous, successful First Amendment civil rights lawyer, major litigator, just
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:51.340]  want a big case, one of the biggest in US history for civil rights in Milwaukee last
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:52.540]  week.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:48:01.980]  So we know that Senator Chris Murphy out of Connecticut is one of the key authors of the
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:06.940]  different bills that were attached to the Defense Authorization Act a few years ago.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:10.620]  He's now reintroduced these as well.
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:15.740]  And it is a breakaway group in the CIA and the Defense Department that then interfaces
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:21.380]  with mainstream news, CNN, MSNBC to try to overthrow Trump and shut down free press in
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:22.380]  this country.
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:25.900]  They broke it all down, document cam shot please.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:31.700]  Remember this Obama quietly signs the countering disinformation and propaganda act into law.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:34.900]  Then they just call everyone Russians who's domestic and then they're able to use this
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:41.540]  money to fund hit pieces, lawsuits, and programs to de-platform folks and that's now come out.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:47.460]  Murphy Portman introduced measure to fight propaganda and disinformation.
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:50.500]  And so they already passed it in 2016 as you can see here.
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.540]  This is from his senate.gov website.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.580]  This is directly from the senator.
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:59.300]  He tells you that he did this before, had to put the Defense Authorization Act and then
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:02.300]  Obama signed executive orders as well.
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:07.500]  And these are groups of Democrats in the government with national security clearances working
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.620]  as your truly President Trump and others.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:14.460]  And he was just on television last week saying, I killed one of the fathers of one of the
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:19.580]  Sandy Hook victims because I'm quote terrorizing them and I need to be taken off the air and
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:25.020]  it's quote the democratic democracy depends on Alex Jones and others being taken off.
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:28.060]  And he blamed Google and Facebook and YouTube.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:33.540]  So they're trying to bully them under his control and Trump sitting on the sidelines.
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.500]  All this happens saying we're not going to regulate.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:41.420]  Well you let the Democrats then by the vacuum and the EU and all of them come in with the
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:43.660]  regulation.
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:46.340]  And now you see Zuckerberg saying, yeah, go ahead and regulate me.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:49.420]  That's because they'll have protection of law to censor.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:52.380]  So I'm going to explain that again.
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:56.300]  Trump's done a great job of so many fronts, but this is his only big failure is not fighting
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.300]  the censorship.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:02.900]  He started a few weeks ago with the move to trip the money of public universities that
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:05.380]  engage in this malice brainwashing.
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:07.140]  They're now centers of anti-free speech.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:08.140]  That's good.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:15.220]  But first, Mr. Barnes looking at this and the magnitude of it and that he's at the heart
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:19.220]  of quarterbacking all this and he wants me off the air and then getting into what you
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:20.220]  think Trump should do.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:21.220]  Absolutely.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:24.380]  So I mean, it's part of a coordinated campaign and the fact that Senator Murphy is on both
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:30.020]  sides of these, that he's out there promoting a message about the lawsuits that propagandizes
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:35.340]  his reason to censor, shame and control what people can say, what people can hear, what
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.340]  people can speak, what people can think.
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:40.020]  And he's the one constantly bringing up Sandy Hook, not me.
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.020]  Absolutely.
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:46.020]  So he's using it as his political excuse, his political premise, his political predicate
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:50.020]  in order to engage in the thought control, speech control and press control that he wants
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.020]  to have happen.
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:54.540]  And it's part of an ongoing campaign where they recognize that if people are allowed
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.700]  to get free press, get independent press, get independent-
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:58.700]  He'll lose.
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:50:59.700]  Precisely.
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:01.420]  They can't win in an open debate.
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:02.420]  That's what the real admission is.
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:05.540]  I mean, the reason why we have free speech and free press both together in the First
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:09.220]  Amendment to the United States Constitution is because it's the independent free press
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:13.220]  and the independent free speech of ordinary people and everyday people across the world
[01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:17.140]  that ends up getting us to the best place to protect our freedoms and our liberties.
[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:20.940]  That respects the audience, that respects people to make up their own mind, and that
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:25.900]  respects the power of the idea to be successful, not rely on the power of the person who controls
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.140]  the microphone to be successful.
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:31.500]  And so what he believes and what Senator Murphy believes and a lot of these other Democratic
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:35.460]  politicians believe and Big Tech believes is that the great danger to America is freedom
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:38.460]  of thought, is freedom of speech, is freedom of press.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:41.820]  There's a reason why it's in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, because
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:46.500]  it was necessary to secure every other liberty is independent free press, not the big press,
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:50.220]  the little press, the everyday press, the independent press that is critical and essential
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:51.220]  and fundamental.
[01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:52.220]  And that's getting into the First Amendment.
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:55.820]  I'm going to get back into that you're an expert in, but specifically, one of Trump's
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:52:00.380]  main failings is he can't get people appointed, he can't get into the bureaucracy he's starting
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.380]  to.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.660]  The first thing he needs to do, this is who captains and runs the censorship, is this
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:07.060]  stay behind group.
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:11.460]  And one of the few areas a commander in chief can actually reverse congressional funding
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:13.180]  is how it's designated.
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:16.220]  He should take the money out of this group and put it towards the wall or put it towards
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:20.060]  amputees or something or bonuses for the troops, not billions of dollars.
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:24.700]  So we're $2 billion total now to finance the destruction of the press.
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:25.700]  Absolutely.
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.460]  It's deeply ironic that the very people who supported the seditious activity of the deep
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:34.220]  state against the president are now trying to reclassify and redefine opposition to the
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:37.180]  institutional press and institutional power as itself seditious.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:40.740]  And he shouldn't be any part of supporting it, any part of subsidizing it.
[01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:41.820]  He should defang it.
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:42.820]  He should demonetize it.
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:44.940]  He should do what YouTube has done to everybody who was in the press.
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:48.500]  We have found the reactor shaft on the Death Star.
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.580]  I mean, this takes them out.
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:51.580]  Oh, precisely.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:56.100]  This is their last gasp at social control, at media control, at thought control and at
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:57.100]  press control.
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:01.500]  They're using state tools and state organs to achieve it and to attain it and the president
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.540]  needs to take action to make sure it doesn't happen.
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.020]  We have a CIA body.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:06.540]  This is back to Frank Church.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:07.540]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:14.300]  In fact, were you guys able to grab the trailer for Enemy of the State, like I was asking?
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:15.300]  We had it.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:17.340]  I mean, this is Gene Hackman and Will Smith.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.340]  Great movie.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.820]  Gene Hackman is probably my favorite actor.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.820]  So classy.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:22.700]  Wish he wouldn't retire, but I understand.
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:23.700]  And so it's like a Hollywood.
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.700]  It looks like a North Carolina or something on a ranch.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:28.380]  But this is based on how real stuff works.
[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:35.980]  For the deep state, a breakaway group inside the NSA is using their power to try to bring
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:38.740]  in a police state for the globalist.
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:39.740]  The police aren't bad.
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:40.740]  It's the police state.
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:42.860]  It means bad guys in control, things like this.
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:46.780]  This is a police state and they discovered that they're killing people.
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.980]  They discovered they've killed a senator who's trying to stop them from the illegal spying.
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.420]  And this is actually how the real world works.
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:57.340]  And Chris Murphy is the bad guy in this movie.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:59.060]  He's one of the kingpins.
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:00.900]  It's just outrageously criminal.
[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.100]  Let's go ahead and roll that trailer, please.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:06.100]  Subject entering lingerie store.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.100]  Hi.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.100]  Hey, hi.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.460]  So you want some lingerie for your wife?
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.460]  Uh, yes.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:15.380]  Uh, I'm not really experienced in this.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:16.580]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:17.580]  I mean, I'm experienced.
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:20.180]  You know, I don't want to come in here and look stupid.
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:21.180]  Too late.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.180]  Yeah.
[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:26.180]  I should have gotten her a watch.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:28.380]  Robert Clayton Dean was innocent.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.380]  Freeze there.
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:30.380]  Times 10.
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:34.260]  We have reason to believe that Mr. Zavitz may have passed sensitive materials to you.
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:36.260]  Uh, what kind of material?
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:37.260]  Sensitive soap.
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:38.260]  Let's get into his life.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.260]  We have you bugged it, Mr. Dean.
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:41.260]  Move to audio three.
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:42.260]  He was unsuspecting.
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.260]  Hey, hey.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:44.260]  Find the wrong house.
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:45.260]  Hello.
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:46.260]  Eric.
[01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:47.260]  I'm after Dean.
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:48.260]  He was unaware.
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:53.340]  You are the only woman in the world for me.
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:54.340]  You and Janet Jackson.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:55.340]  I'm hanging up.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:56.340]  I'm on your way over.
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:57.340]  Now, what he doesn't know.
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:54:58.340]  I'd like to report a break.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:01.340]  He could kill him.
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:04.340]  You requested immediate keyhole visual tasking, maximum resolution.
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.340]  He's on your six o'clock.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.340]  You have something they want.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.340]  Two targets, rooftop.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.340]  I don't have anything.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:10.340]  Maybe you're doing it.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.340]  You don't know it.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.340]  You're threatened now.
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:13.340]  Don't.
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.340]  Never when you don't.
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.340]  Target's on the move.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:16.340]  A name, a phone number.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:17.340]  No, nothing.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:18.340]  He didn't give me anything.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.340]  We're not any federal agents.
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.340]  You have to follow your...
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.340]  Stay exactly where you are.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:27.340]  I want to use every means possible to get what we need.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:28.340]  From Jerry Brockheimer.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:29.340]  Get the cat.
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:30.340]  What's the cat's name?
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.340]  Babe.
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:32.340]  Producer of The Rock.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:33.340]  Come here, baby.
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:34.340]  Baby, come here.
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:35.340]  Come here.
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.340]  A film by Tony Scott.
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:38.340]  Target is on 21.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.340]  Director of Crimson Tide.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:40.340]  It's just about me.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.340]  20.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:42.340]  Do they know me?
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:43.340]  19.
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.340]  Who is that?
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.340]  18.
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:46.340]  He jumped to 17.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:47.340]  Do they know me?
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.340]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:50.340]  Will Smith.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:52.340]  You're one of them, aren't you?
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:53.340]  Former conspire.
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:54.340]  Twiggy.
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:55.340]  Twiggy.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.340]  Gene Hackman.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:57.340]  This man.
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:58.340]  This is our problem.
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:55:59.340]  You live in another day.
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:00.340]  I'll be very impressed.
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:04.340]  It's not paranoia when they're really after you.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:08.340]  Don't stop it now.
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:11.340]  Enemy of the state.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:14.340]  A rogue criminal group trying to take the government over.
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:16.340]  That's what always happens in terrible countries.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:17.340]  Now it's happening here.
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:18.340]  They've been caught.
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.340]  The president's talking about it.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:21.340]  He's getting ready to prosecute them.
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:23.340]  Move against Chris Murphy now.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:25.340]  Move against Blumenthal and his son.
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:26.340]  All of them.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:28.340]  Protect the American people, president.
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:30.340]  Our intelligence agencies are good people.
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:32.340]  These are enemies working with the chai comms.
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:34.340]  And that's why they want me off air.
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:35.340]  They're working with the chai comms.
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.340]  Damn it.
[01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:37.340]  Now protect us from these assholes.
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:38.340]  Go ahead.
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.340]  Sorry.
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:43.340]  I mean, basically it's a sort of continuous coordinated effort to control the thought,
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:47.340]  speech and freedom in the United States because because of the success of the independent
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:51.840]  free press, because of the success of people's independent activities politically, because
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:57.240]  they're empowering the president of the United States to reverse this Chinese model of economic
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:02.460]  and political control that the big tech is colluding with the Chinese companies to accomplish
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:03.460]  and achieve.
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:06.980]  And they want to do it here because we are still the source of American freedom and the
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:08.060]  world's freedom.
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:10.580]  We are that beacon of liberty to the rest of the world.
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:14.540]  And so if they could reverse, the fact they could achieve it in China is no surprise that
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:16.840]  that's the nature of the Chinese government, Chinese society.
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:18.900]  Now they're trying it here, as Trump said.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:19.900]  It's treason.
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:20.900]  It is.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:21.900]  I mean, it's...
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:25.420]  Chris Murphy is involved in treason against the country, the First Amendment, and is a
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:26.420]  Chaikom operative.
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:27.420]  It's known.
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:29.260]  And he's scared, really scared of the show.
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:31.540]  He wants us off because we know who you are.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.180]  You dirty traitor.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.180]  You dirty anti-American filth.
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:37.380]  You're not going to beat Texas.
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:40.380]  You're not going to beat me because you are filth.
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:47.300]  God will defeat you.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:49.220]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:50.220]  Go ahead.
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:52.220]  Well, I just have to say something, man.
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:55.940]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:56.940]  It just gets old, man.
[01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:59.900]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:02.140]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.700]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:08.740]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:12.020]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:14.580]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:15.580]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:16.580]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:17.580]  I want to...
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:18.580]  Put him on pause again.
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:19.580]  Hey, Frank!
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:23.100]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:24.100]  We're under attack.
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:25.100]  We need your help.
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:29.420]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:32.460]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:33.460]  Do you understand?
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:34.620]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:36.900]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:42.020]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.220]  Do you understand?
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:44.860]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:48.420]  Free press needs your help, Frank!
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:53.340]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:56.380]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:58.900]  Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:02.420]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:04.060]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:08.940]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:10.460]  simply trying to bring it back.
[01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:14.700]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:18.700]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:22.580]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:27.060]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Info Wars by buying the great products
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:31.500]  at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:36.100]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:40.020]  For myself and the whole Info Wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:43.980]  done, because without you, Info Wars is nothing.
[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:51.900]  You are the Info War, and I salute you.
[01:59:51.900 --> 02:00:08.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:12.300]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.500]  Resistance, Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:18.300]  Well, listen, I mean, I'll use his name.
[02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:22.900]  We're talking about Alex Jones, and the fact of the matter is, is that the companies that
[02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:29.500]  allow people like him, conspiracy theorists, to be able to purvey lies, have a responsibility.
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:35.500]  There is no constitutional duty on an internet company to allow somebody to terrorize parents
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:39.580]  of mass tragedies like Alex Jones did for so long.
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:45.420]  Those Newtown families are proceeding with a court case to try to hold him accountable,
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:51.340]  but the companies that allow for this nonsense, this garbage to be spread out over the internet,
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:56.340]  have a responsibility and a duty themselves to do something earlier than they did in the
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:58.460]  case of Info Wars.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:04.860]  I wish that these parents could shut it all out, but they can't.
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:11.060]  He and the media are the ones constantly promoting it, and I've barely even ever covered it.
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:12.700]  The internet didn't believe a lot of it.
[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:14.300]  That's our right if people want to do that.
[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:17.780]  And now they just won't stop, and it's a synthetic lie.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:21.700]  And then this guy's running a stay-behind group that Obama put in government to shut
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:24.860]  down the press and Trump, and he's just a monster.
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:29.580]  I mean, he used to be indicted for being part of this, and Trump is talking about inditing
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:31.420]  the co-conspirators, including Schiff.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:36.660]  Oh, precisely, I mean, the actual coverage of Info Wars, of course, was 90% that Sandy
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:37.860]  Hook was a real event.
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:42.820]  And the only questions mostly that were raised were about whether there were second shooters
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:48.340]  or third shooters, whether or not Big Pharma's role in giving people SSRI drugs, where it
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:49.340]  was influencing them.
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.340]  Let's be clear, you're the head lawyer.
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:53.100]  You've reviewed, you've done thousands of hours.
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:54.100]  Absolutely.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:56.860]  So you review everything Paul Watson, of course, always believed it was a real event.
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:58.900]  He's the editor-in-charge here of Info Wars.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.220]  So that was always the message from Info Wars was whether or not the government was being
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:05.740]  straightforward, whether the government was being clear, whether the government was doing
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:08.700]  its duty to disclose accurate, honest information.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:12.220]  And of course, ultimately, the Connecticut Supreme Court determined that the law enforcement
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:15.220]  had hid information that they were not supposed to hide.
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:20.260]  And that included the horrifying aspect of this tragedy was that the school system did
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:24.740]  not give the teachers the means to safeguard the school by giving them the means to lock
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:26.260]  the doors from the inside.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:30.300]  That was one of the things that apparently they were trying to cover up by focusing exclusively
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:33.980]  as the only sole culprit of this incident being a gun.
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:35.820]  They didn't want to talk about the role of drugs.
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:37.900]  They didn't want to talk about the role of the school system.
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:41.620]  They didn't want to talk about the role of law enforcement that could have done things
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:44.140]  different that could have protected people's lives.
[02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:47.660]  And that's what, and so as a consequence, you see some of these high-ranking politicians
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:51.580]  in Connecticut try to demonize you and try to demonize Info Wars and try to make that
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:55.420]  the sole source of any particular problem in this particular instance.
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:56.420]  And that's what's happening.
[02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:59.820]  And it's not a coincidence that the exact same Senator, Senator Murphy, that's leading
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:04.980]  this political warfare and is engaging in supporting the law fair that's taking place
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:08.940]  and using his political connections and ties to help accomplish and achieve that, is also
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:12.900]  the same guy that wants to suppress and censor speech across the Internet of anyone who has
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:14.900]  an independent dissident view than his.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:17.700]  And again, our listeners are like, yeah, we know there's censorship.
[02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:20.660]  I understand, folks, this is the whole enchilada.
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:23.940]  This is the one thing Trump hasn't moved on, and I want to come back with Ben Garrison
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:27.060]  and you and talk about the next level of deception where they say they're going to take people
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:30.820]  off for the comments on their page, so we're having to prepare legal actions just to defend
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:31.820]  ourselves.
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:34.780]  I mean, this is a nightmare situation, but it's because, as you said, our speech is
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:35.780]  the truth.
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.260]  It's winning.
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:42.780]  But just briefly, what should the President do in 60 seconds first to stop these people?
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:46.180]  So he should do the same thing he did for universities and colleges and say that grants
[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:50.380]  and other federal funding of these various big tech social media giants will not continue
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:54.140]  unless they support free speech in the First Amendment, and he should propose legislative
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:58.060]  changes to Section 230 of the immunity laws that says unless they comply with the First
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:00.580]  Amendment, they're no longer immune under the law.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:05.340]  And if that could be, those two steps by themselves could reverse the equation in this situation
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:09.500]  and could mean, for example, just yesterday, unplanned, a very popular movie, that's a
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:13.700]  pro-life movie, Twitter completely basically took them off and shadow banned them.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:17.060]  They said you can't promote it and you can't spend money and promote it.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:20.460]  And not only that, when people were trying to follow them, they would be unfollowed five
[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:21.460]  seconds later.
[02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:24.300]  So someone would follow the Twitter feed, then it would magically disappear.
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:25.300]  It's everybody's speech.
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:26.300]  It's absolutely.
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:28.060]  They're not going to stop at Alex Jones.
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:33.660]  They're using Alex Jones as the example to stop and suppress independent speech everywhere.
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:34.660]  It's like he's Germany.
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:35.660]  Precisely.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.740]  It's very much a stasi mentality.
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:38.300]  It's a Soviet mentality.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:40.100]  That's what the New Left believes in.
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:41.100]  They believe in control.
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:43.500]  They don't believe in freedom.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:47.980]  That movie, unplanned, blocked on Twitter hours after release, and I think it was Google
[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:48.980]  banned the ad.
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:49.980]  Yeah, pull that up.
[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:50.980]  I'll talk about that when you come back.
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:51.980]  Google banned the...
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:53.780]  No, we're not taking your money.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:56.580]  Your money's no good here.
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:05:02.420]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:07.340]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the
[02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:08.340]  damage.
[02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:09.340]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:10.340]  We stopped her.
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:12.840]  We got a national stand.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.820]  The nationals are getting elected all over the world right now.
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:15.820]  We are winning.
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:21.260]  But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented
[02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:22.260]  attack.
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:26.660]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:32.020]  This is about who wants it most, and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:33.100]  they've taken, everything.
[02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:34.100]  I am in your hands.
[02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:35.260]  You are in my hands.
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:38.660]  I need financial support, and I got products you and your family need.
[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:39.660]  It's that simple.
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:43.300]  It's thousands of great products, whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:47.300]  folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at m4worshore.com.
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:51.900]  So please, go to m4worshore.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:55.420]  your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical.
[02:05:55.420 --> 02:06:00.420]  Thank you.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:05.580]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:09.020]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:11.220]  This is not a new world.
[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:14.900]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:19.740]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:23.420]  a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:30.020]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:32.140]  of human freedom.
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:38.100]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:45.460]  Take is an enemy, and truth is a menace.
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:50.860]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on Earth.
[02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:55.620]  He's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated, because he is built
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:59.580]  out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:23.180]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:37.540]  I'd play the Red River Valley, and he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry, and run his fingers
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:41.060]  through 70 years of living.
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:49.180]  I wonder, Lord, has ever well I'd drill run dry.
[02:07:49.180 --> 02:08:10.820]  We were friends, me and this old man, like desperadoes waiting for a train.
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:24.140]  He is a drifter and a driller of oil wells, and an old school man of the world.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:33.700]  He let me drive his car when he is too drunk to, and he'd wink and give me money for the
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:34.700]  purse.
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:52.620]  And our lives were like some old western movie, like desperadoes waiting for a train.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:09:12.820]  We were friends, me and this old man, and a driller of oil wells, and a driller of oil
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:13.820]  wells.
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:34.020]  We were friends, me and this old man, and a driller of oil wells, and a driller of
[02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:55.420]  oil wells, and a driller of oil wells, and a driller of oil wells, and a driller of

[02:34:56.020 --> 02:35:00.580]  but other points you'd like to make about this censorship because
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:04.100]  I know that Facebook Twitter YouTube Google they all got everybody in the
[02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:06.820]  last 20 years with their own websites and their
[02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:10.660]  own businesses and their own billboards to point them there
[02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:14.740]  to their Facebook and YouTube pages and Twitter pages
[02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:18.020]  people believing it was theirs and Twitter left it out there and let the
[02:35:18.020 --> 02:35:23.620]  most outrageous stuff go on forever but now they're just cracking down and
[02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:27.540]  you're saying you can't say learn to code there's an article
[02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:32.180]  up on info wars.com the top story right now
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:35.700]  where people are coming out saying what is this I mean the language policing is
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:39.220]  like beyond the worst university you've ever seen
[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:45.780]  where do you think this is all going it's not going to a good place Alex
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:49.700]  we see what's going on in China with their their social credit system and we
[02:35:49.700 --> 02:35:55.700]  already have that in the beginnings of that here
[02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:59.300]  where if you're conservative and you want to speak up and preserve the
[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:02.500]  republic which we're a republic now in form
[02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:06.020]  rather than substance because you know we let a
[02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:09.860]  we let a big bureaucratic authoritarian oligarchy
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:17.060]  take over so but now if you if you you have a low social credit
[02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:20.980]  if you're now if you're just christian or a white or male it seems like or a
[02:36:20.980 --> 02:36:25.300]  heterosexual but if you violate what they see
[02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:30.420]  as you know their guidelines of free speech you could be
[02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:33.780]  you could have you know PayPal pull the plug on you you could
[02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:37.700]  some people are experiencing that they can't do any banking
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:42.260]  so I know as much as I detest Nazis I still think they have a right of free
[02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:46.740]  speech and ACLU actually used to defend Nazis and give them the
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:51.380]  right to speak out in March but now they just go ahead and try to get
[02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:56.820]  and if they if you have a unpopular speech unpopular to the sgw crowd
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:37:00.260]  they go after your employment they did that to me I had somebody write me and
[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:04.020]  say I'm not going to rest until you until you're fired and out on the streets
[02:37:04.020 --> 02:37:06.900]  he didn't know I was self-employed but in effect my
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:10.660]  business was compromised and in fact I got kicked out of the art gallery I was
[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:13.300]  in up here because all the trolls ganged up on the art gallery
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:17.060]  we've lost five of our six bank accounts they don't want you to make money
[02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:21.700]  and if we had if we had no supporters and that's what we turned it around we
[02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:27.140]  turned it around around 2016 and Tina said my wife Tina says I'm
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:30.180]  going to get on social media and I'm going to spread those cartoons better
[02:37:30.180 --> 02:37:33.140]  than the trolls are and she did she made it her full-time job
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:38.100]  and she worked long hours to so that I could regain my own voice
[02:37:38.100 --> 02:37:41.780]  but we could not have had the success we've had recently without
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:46.820]  help from supporters and as reluctant as I was to rattle a tin cup around I said
[02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:49.940]  yeah I can't do it I can't do it by myself I won't be able to draw the
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:54.020]  cartoons without help and fortunately we've had a lot of people who like my
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:58.420]  cartoons um keep us afloat and now we have a
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:02.020]  a book coming out this summer to mark the 10 year anniversary it's called Ben's
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:06.260]  big book of editorial cartoons I want to order a bunch I want to order a bunch
[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:08.900]  so I'm going to get you on the line with my order folks because I want to be
[02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:12.740]  selling them at info wars store.com and I can't wait to put one
[02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:16.740]  on my coffee table because you're the they're pro family they're pro america
[02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:20.100]  they're family friendly I think churches ought to have these I mean the
[02:38:20.100 --> 02:38:23.620]  these are so and people have the money you should buy two copies and donate one
[02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:26.500]  of the library because people understand a book like that's going to get
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:29.860]  checked out hundreds of times and a book like that will wake up
[02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:33.460]  young people as well I love your cartoons because they're timeless
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:38.580]  they're evergreen and they're good for adults and children
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:44.260]  well thank you and I you know I like I said though I mean I couldn't I wouldn't
[02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:46.820]  be here without the supporters I just wouldn't be because I
[02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:51.060]  I have spent the last of our savings in 2014 on a book
[02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:54.340]  and the book was designed to prove to the world that I wasn't a racist
[02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:58.580]  anti-semitic nazi and the book flopped and after that I was ready to throw in
[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:01.540]  the towel I said these cartoons caused me nothing but
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:05.780]  grief and cost me so much money and it cost me my my sanity almost because I
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:09.620]  was walking around white hot mad all the time sure but man isn't it fair to say
[02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:12.740]  that it made you an even better cartoonist and that you are now more
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:17.060]  successful you've ever been yes it did but you know what and now I look back at
[02:39:17.060 --> 02:39:21.140]  it and I can't imagine why I got so so angry now I know I'm able to laugh at
[02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:24.820]  the trolls and when I see places like 4chan that still
[02:39:24.820 --> 02:39:28.420]  deface my cartoons once in a while I even laugh at those it just doesn't
[02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:32.180]  bother me anymore maybe I maybe I just got so callous by the experience well
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:35.540]  you also had mainstream media claiming that that was your cartoons so that
[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:37.700]  they've had to back off down as you fought back
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:42.740]  Bob what will people if we're if we defeat the censorship
[02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:46.260]  what will they call this period that we're alive and right now
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:49.300]  well it's sort of its own form of dark ages potentially and I was it's very
[02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:52.820]  much a transitional time period where either freedom is going to succeed or
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:56.500]  authoritarianism is going to succeed and you're seeing it at a broad scale and
[02:39:56.500 --> 02:39:59.860]  in multiple contexts so you have a big tech engines that are trying to build a
[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:02.740]  Chinese model who really think the Chinese were probably going to dominate
[02:40:02.740 --> 02:40:06.820]  in 2020 30 years and who were building their big tech model for a
[02:40:06.820 --> 02:40:11.460]  social media control censorship and shaming strategies the social credit
[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:15.540]  attributes that Ben is talking about that was going to be worldwide and global
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:18.500]  and it's fighting back against the Chinese model for the future of the
[02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:21.060]  United States and the future of the world and so this is the key
[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:24.100]  transitional time period where either they win or we win and that's why
[02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:26.900]  they're doubling down that's why they're intensifying their attacks
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:29.940]  that's why they're going after info wars and you in particular
[02:40:29.940 --> 02:40:34.020]  because they need to be able to destabilize and shut down the independent
[02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:37.380]  free press in the country that is their true threat to their authoritarian
[02:40:37.380 --> 02:40:39.860]  objectives is the left if they get defeated
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:43.220]  are going to be known like real nazis like embarrassed they were ever nazis
[02:40:43.220 --> 02:40:46.660]  because again the average leftist when you talk they they go yeah we know we're
[02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:49.060]  making it up we're going to get you and kill you
[02:40:49.060 --> 02:40:51.620]  I mean they've converted the average leftist to
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:55.380]  consciously knowing it's all a fraud loving the Jesse Smollett state stuff
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:59.060]  Maddie got caught and now they're still bleeding on liberals that mean well
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:03.140]  but a lot of them have now converted to no we're the ruling class
[02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:06.260]  exactly they want control of thought control of ideas control of speech
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:09.220]  and when you listen to what Ben is talking about where they're the social
[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:12.420]  credit system is labeling people and labeling people in such a way that they
[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:14.740]  can't get employment can't have successful
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:17.620]  mechanisms really it's the old nazi numbering system they're just putting
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:21.380]  numbers on people inside of their arms incredible discrimination precisely
[02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:24.820]  but you know in law don't we really have
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:27.780]  laws against discrimination against people's politics because you know they
[02:41:27.780 --> 02:41:30.260]  say we don't but I mean isn't there mechanisms
[02:41:30.260 --> 02:41:32.980]  there should be and they're supposed to be and there's some laws that on paper
[02:41:32.980 --> 02:41:36.100]  protect us but unfortunately the courts have too frequently and too often been
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:38.100]  close to it so we have because of the way the
[02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:40.740]  lawfare system has worked too much of the judicial branch
[02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:44.580]  it shares the same ideal ideological approach as the left
[02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:48.420]  and that's causing hindrances and being able to achieve a positive outcome
[02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:51.220]  from the court system so it's going to create political pressure in the court
[02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:53.700]  of public opinion to make sure the law reflects what it should be
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:59.300]  I want to explain how bad it is this weekend I went into a restaurant
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:03.860]  slash bar nice little place looked nice with my wife
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:09.300]  and Rob do and we were there and some of the patrons came over and said oh
[02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:12.180]  you're Alex Jones and I shook their hand everything
[02:42:12.180 --> 02:42:15.460]  and they were veto supporters and I said that's fine
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:20.260]  and then the manager comes over and says I want you to leave
[02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:24.500]  and I said why just we're not going to serve you go so that's the level it's
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:27.940]  gotten to that oh we're not going to and they
[02:42:27.940 --> 02:42:31.060]  think it hurts me like i'm a peer pressure sell out like they are no it
[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:33.620]  makes me work harder like man it's getting bad
[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:37.140]  absolutely they would they literally want to put effectively numbers on people's
[02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:40.580]  arms to control whether they have access to the banking system social media
[02:42:40.580 --> 02:42:43.380]  the ability to express speech the ability to have dinner out
[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:46.100]  that's the effect of what they're doing of course you better with me and most
[02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:49.220]  folks are big fans but oh of course but but still these little isolated pockets
[02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:52.020]  just put a sign on your door that we're not welcome we want you to go bankrupt
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:54.900]  we hate you
[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:58.100]  if you're not expanding you're imploding there is no
[02:42:58.100 --> 02:43:01.060]  set stasis there is no managed system there is no
[02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:05.060]  uncontenual the continuum is always launching forward in the future
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:09.220]  so you support us and get creative and get fired up we won't just be here a
[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:11.700]  hundred years we'll be here forever we'll turn the whole thing around

[02:43:23.140 --> 02:43:26.820]  and so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:30.340]  Mao Zedong are you going to really be able to face the other stuff
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:34.020]  because god wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things

[02:47:57.300 --> 02:48:01.620]  mainline md doctors with facebook's about vaccine damage in the fact that
[02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:05.860]  vaccines can really hurt you the inserts say it they're all being banned
[02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:10.980]  so you can see how this has gone into total overdrive
[02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:15.540]  then they use me as a straw man and lie about what i've said and done but to
[02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:19.940]  make the whole debate about me and in the process i just get more and
[02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:23.380]  more and more and more famous but in this crazy world where what i actually
[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:26.500]  say has trouble getting out gets out on these local radio stations and gets
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:29.700]  out at info wars dot com but the average person is so habituated to
[02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:33.460]  facebook twitter or youtube they go man i used to love your show used to watch
[02:48:33.460 --> 02:48:37.220]  it every day on youtube used to used to watch it every day on
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:42.260]  itunes or listen shed your shows off the air they believe mainstream and i go
[02:48:42.260 --> 02:48:47.460]  i'm on the air every day in full wars dot com so alex jones isn't dead the free
[02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:50.420]  press isn't dead free speech isn't a crime
[02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:53.380]  and that's why those of you that are smart enough to know the show's still on
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:56.180]  the air have to keep spreading the word it you in ways
[02:48:56.180 --> 02:48:59.940]  the hardcore audience has gotten bigger and congress the military is listening
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:03.460]  and people all the world are listening people know this is a verboten program
[02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:07.860]  but to the general public that kind of just thinks of things as channels
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:11.220]  they get habituated to the channel they go to
[02:49:11.220 --> 02:49:14.340]  and they don't hear it anymore all like i heart radio wherever we're taking on
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:18.100]  everywhere because you know that's the move that's what you do
[02:49:18.100 --> 02:49:21.860]  yeah he's getting banned we're gonna do it too you're like well i heart radio
[02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:26.100]  that's clear channel there's leftist in everywhere
[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:29.620]  fox news i'm told by high-level fox host the biggest there are
[02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:33.940]  that alex you understand 80% of the staff are leftist
[02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:39.380]  they've taken over there it's just what he was saying earlier
[02:49:39.380 --> 02:49:42.500]  by barnes is they they get in key positions
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:45.780]  like they did with ben garrison to block him out of business
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:50.820]  we started doing his own private uh articles so again it's right it's the
[02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:55.540]  direct patronage of people like you to go to graphics.com
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:50:00.020]  and get a poster or or to go to m4.com and get a book
[02:50:00.020 --> 02:50:04.420]  that's how this is happening and it's it's it's nip and tuck for us i can tell
[02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:08.180]  you so in closing ben i really appreciate you joining us
[02:50:08.180 --> 02:50:12.740]  and it was great you came to austin and hung out with us in sabo
[02:50:12.740 --> 02:50:15.780]  and i and i do want to do some exciting things in the future i do want to carry
[02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:20.180]  a new book when it comes out but again getting back to trump
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:24.020]  i like a lot of what he's doing but hopefully you can do a cartoon if you
[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:28.260]  think of a good way to do it where he's handling all this other stuff great
[02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:33.940]  but he's leaving this one area open of the censorship
[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:38.100]  well you know i i support trump not because he's perfect he's not perfect
[02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:41.460]  i support him because he might be our last best hope
[02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:48.260]  to turn things around i mean i i would like to see him do a lot more i mean
[02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:53.860]  let's let's pardon usage let's uh let's overturn the patriot act along with
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:57.460]  obama care i mean he could do a lot a lot more than he's done but
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:00.580]  the cornerstone is the wall we have to have the wall
[02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:04.100]  i mean i was watching bill marty of the night bill marty says oh these are just
[02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:07.060]  kind people who want to come up here and pick our lettuce what's wrong with that
[02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:11.140]  well they also i read a statistic that they cost the
[02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:16.420]  country a hundred and i think it was 115 billion per year
[02:51:16.420 --> 02:51:19.460]  in social costs and prisons and everything else
[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:22.580]  so they're coming up here to get free stuff they're coming up here so they
[02:51:22.580 --> 02:51:25.620]  could vote vote take away our guns and our liberties
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:30.100]  oh yeah it boils it boils down to this they're calling us extremists now i
[02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:33.140]  get called extremists all the time i lost a lot of my liberal friends because
[02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:37.140]  they think i'm mean because i don't want to allow all these people in here and
[02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:40.500]  also somehow that makes me a hater and i don't even know
[02:51:40.500 --> 02:51:43.780]  that latin america has collapsed they don't understand how deadly dangerous
[02:51:43.780 --> 02:51:49.220]  this is well my my thing is i like that quote
[02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:53.780]  by goldwater he said extremism and the defense of liberty is no vice
[02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:57.540]  so i'm going to stay as i'll be an extremist in the defense of liberty
[02:51:57.540 --> 02:52:01.460]  but the thing that here's that here's what it boils down to alex
[02:52:01.460 --> 02:52:07.140]  is my old liberal friends see the world and they see themselves as good people
[02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:10.500]  they're doing good in the world they want government
[02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:15.380]  to go out and do their bidding which is to solve the world's problem and bring
[02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:20.260]  about a utopia but this this star trek like utopia can't
[02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:24.500]  happen instead what they deliver is a mad max dystopian
[02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:28.020]  world and that's where we're heading if we continue to let
[02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:31.700]  these egalitarian strains of let's get
[02:52:31.700 --> 02:52:35.220]  the government is wise they're intelligent they're so helpful they love
[02:52:35.220 --> 02:52:39.140]  us and they want to help people no we conservatives see government is
[02:52:39.140 --> 02:52:42.740]  something dangerous something that tends to keep growing and get
[02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:46.740]  more corrupt and they steal from the hard working
[02:52:46.740 --> 02:52:51.540]  man they government doesn't produce anything they just take
[02:52:51.540 --> 02:52:56.180]  so that is what i want to try to do with my cartoons is to try to get people to
[02:52:56.180 --> 02:52:59.700]  realize that hey government government is
[02:52:59.700 --> 02:53:02.820]  is is gotten so big and out of control and my next
[02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:06.260]  my next big worry is it going to be mandatory vaccines and if they can
[02:53:06.260 --> 02:53:09.620]  control your health which they already do to a large degree i mean
[02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:13.780]  they got the fluoride in the water and you breathe the chem trails and they
[02:53:13.780 --> 02:53:16.740]  i guess they call it global engineering now but it's
[02:53:16.740 --> 02:53:20.820]  if they can if they can inject mercury and aluminum directly into your brain
[02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:25.780]  then and then simultaneously make sure that you can't sell raw milk well it's
[02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:29.460]  over i we have to make sure that we have control over
[02:53:29.460 --> 02:53:33.140]  our own bodies and so i'm going to i'm going to draw more cartoons that have
[02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:36.820]  to do with this vaccination abuse that we see
[02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:40.820]  so that's my that's my line of the sand and to take your
[02:53:40.820 --> 02:53:44.020]  your paraphrase government is not reason it is not eloquence
[02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:47.780]  it is forced like fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:52.820]  never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action
[02:53:52.820 --> 02:53:56.340]  founding fathers knew this very well and that's why you don't see the word
[02:53:56.340 --> 02:53:59.860]  democracy in our constitution and yet when you turn on the news that's all you
[02:53:59.860 --> 02:54:03.380]  hear from these commentators is our democracy our democracy
[02:54:03.380 --> 02:54:06.660]  they're really saying our socialism our socialism our socialism that's what
[02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:10.100]  that's what that's what they're driving hard to the hoop to bring about is
[02:54:10.100 --> 02:54:13.460]  socialism and they're and you know i'm
[02:54:13.460 --> 02:54:16.900]  going to draw all the cartoons i can to speak out in socialism that all it
[02:54:16.900 --> 02:54:19.620]  forms there is no good form of socialism
[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:23.460]  sweden is not a socialist country it's a heavily taxed country but they say well
[02:54:23.460 --> 02:54:26.500]  let's be like sweden they're socialists why can't we be socialist and they're
[02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:31.060]  going to collapse within a few years it will it always it always
[02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:36.660]  leads to it ends up leading to murder and death and death of millions it always
[02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:42.100]  leads to lazy people a century man you are awesome god bless you let's
[02:54:42.100 --> 02:54:44.900]  talk i'm going to get ten or one of the crew to call you i want to order a whole
[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:48.100]  bunch of that big book because i liked your other book we sold but i said
[02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:51.700]  like a year ago you want to put out a big coffee table and you said i'm doing
[02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:55.380]  just that so is this new book a big old book
[02:54:55.380 --> 02:54:59.380]  it's going to be nine by 12 and we've already upgraded it to hardcover
[02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:03.700]  and and thicker glossy because we keep people keep preordering the book it's
[02:55:03.700 --> 02:55:07.300]  on indiegogo and i mean i couldn't afford to print out a book
[02:55:07.300 --> 02:55:09.540]  that cost you know what i'm saying but now there's so much interest well that's
[02:55:09.540 --> 02:55:11.780]  why i was saying earlier i never got around to it that i could finance you
[02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:14.580]  doing it because i want you to be able to print 50 000 of these we're going to
[02:55:14.580 --> 02:55:19.300]  talk soon ben god bless you and and take care of my friend thank you alex
[02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:22.740]  all right there goes ben garrison and i'm not kidding i'm not
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:26.180]  kissing his butt he was already a guy that did like
[02:55:26.180 --> 02:55:29.460]  magazine covers major stuff for newspapers i mean he was a top guy
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:33.700]  i've already seen his work many times in the last decade
[02:55:33.700 --> 02:55:39.300]  he has become the number one graphics person in the world
[02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:42.980]  i mean you never see anybody stuff really it's all him
[02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:46.820]  so you can get uh his the 2016 presidential election collection by
[02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:51.060]  ben garrison and then fullwarstore.com
[02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:53.780]  but i can't wait till his new one comes out i want to push that heavily because
[02:55:53.780 --> 02:55:56.900]  i really pushed him to put out a big coffee table book
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:56:00.260]  and like so many people like mark dyson he they don't even have the money to do
[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:04.260]  a 10 000 print with a publisher or to go out to a
[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:07.540]  printer they just do it where it's it's print on demand and then the
[02:56:07.540 --> 02:56:11.220]  artist gets almost nothing so but i'm glad that he's gotten a
[02:56:11.220 --> 02:56:14.900]  pre-orders to be able to even upgrade the quality see
[02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:18.100]  as people pre-order he's even able to upgrade the quality that's how this
[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:21.940]  works is it's like a plant you put water on it you
[02:56:21.940 --> 02:56:24.420]  give it you know give it oxygen you you give it
[02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:27.620]  carbon dioxide you give it sunlight it lives you don't it dies that's why i
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:30.180]  tell the listeners
[02:56:30.820 --> 02:56:33.700]  over the years i've maybe plugged once an hour notice i'm plugging like twice an
[02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:37.460]  hour and that's because we need the
[02:56:37.460 --> 02:56:41.140]  funding in the face of all these lawsuits we got
[02:56:41.140 --> 02:56:45.380]  two lawsuits thrown out last week the one in cleveland over the flag burning
[02:56:45.380 --> 02:56:49.140]  or we we got blamed for stuff we didn't do and i'm not going to get into it all
[02:56:49.140 --> 02:56:52.740]  but the point is is that we had folks covering a flag burning and
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:55.780]  that a much it may lay happened and we were obviously not for burning the
[02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:58.420]  flag and it just went sideways but that all got
[02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:01.780]  dropped and then half the suit in virginia got cut out and then the next
[02:57:01.780 --> 02:57:04.660]  phase hopefully the rest will get cut out but that's how those things work
[02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:08.500]  but you don't hear that we've had 16 lawsuits thrown out in a year and a
[02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:12.420]  half at the cost of three million dollars yeah three million dollars
[02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:17.460]  you don't hear that you hear that uh oh alex jones is you know
[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:20.820]  losing he's going under because they want to make us losers they they want to
[02:57:20.820 --> 02:57:23.940]  have wins understand that's three million dollars not three million
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:26.740]  dollars of product sold three million dollars of product is like a
[02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:30.020]  million and a half dollars then you got to spin that to run the operation
[02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:33.620]  three million three million money we lost to not be able to expand we didn't go
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:37.860]  24 hours a day last year because of that i want the money in here

[03:00:07.780 --> 03:00:12.660]  coming to you live from the info wars dot com studios
[03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:38.980]  in the recaptured state of texas it's alex jones
[03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:57.940]  the globalist and tyrants everywhere seek control dumb down masses so they
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:01.540]  can play god the american system of true rugged
[03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:06.100]  individualism the wild wild west everything we've been through
[03:01:06.100 --> 03:01:09.780]  our entire history beating the british empire when no one else had ever done
[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:13.940]  it up until that time and it was ragtag forces that did it
[03:01:13.940 --> 03:01:18.660]  is the stuff of legend and that's why the globalist
[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:22.500]  want to break up our families and demoralize us and give us false histories
[03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:26.580]  about our country so that they can break us down and control us
[03:01:26.580 --> 03:01:30.580]  it's classic military tactics that when you occupy a nation
[03:01:30.580 --> 03:01:34.260]  and the people aren't giving up you demoralize them you teach them that
[03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:38.820]  they're bad people you turn them against each other
[03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:44.500]  but humanity is smarter than that despite all the cultural attacks
[03:01:44.500 --> 03:01:49.060]  all the biological attacks all the gmo all the vaccines
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:53.620]  all of it still humanity is beginning to awaken not just here
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:02:00.900]  but from brazil to japan to the coast of spain
[03:02:00.900 --> 03:02:08.580]  and cattilonia to the great folks in greece right through europe
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:13.620]  in france and into the uk and canada and so the authoritarians are cracking
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:19.380]  down to make us submit and break our will but fighting back is not
[03:02:19.380 --> 03:02:24.100]  something that's a labor it's a pleasure
[03:02:24.100 --> 03:02:29.060]  and the tighter they squeeze the more people are going to wake up and resist
[03:02:29.060 --> 03:02:33.140]  but it's an incredibly dangerous time as well and that's why
[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:38.900]  listeners and viewers have to understand that this is
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:43.860]  very very close they are attacking and savagely destroying
[03:02:43.860 --> 03:02:47.780]  and stabbing you know the the president of brazil on the stomach and
[03:02:47.780 --> 03:02:52.100]  trying to destroy the trump family and coming after me and trying to defeat
[03:02:52.100 --> 03:02:58.900]  anybody they can ahead of major moves they're going to pull
[03:02:58.900 --> 03:03:03.860]  in the next year this is the most critical time in human development
[03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:08.740]  everybody sees it they feel it and that's why i sit up here

[03:10:30.740 --> 03:10:34.420]  and then they just disappear into democrat vans and are shipped off to who
[03:10:34.420 --> 03:10:38.020]  the hell knows where and then a famous reporter shoots this
[03:10:38.020 --> 03:10:42.820]  video she's doing it on her own not where she works
[03:10:42.820 --> 03:10:46.580]  and she sends us this footage
[03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:51.140]  because she's scared her own network won't even put it on
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:54.900]  and it's just like chop liver she's selling her phone
[03:10:54.900 --> 03:11:00.420]  this is catholic charities rgv and you got people saying don't videotape the
[03:11:00.420 --> 03:11:02.900]  border patrol pulling up because they don't want to

[03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:21.780]  so to start the whole show with this this is show bombshell
[03:11:21.780 --> 03:11:25.300]  it's on news wars dot com that doesn't get censored as much
[03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:29.460]  share that link news wars dot com m4 is exclusive video
[03:11:29.460 --> 03:11:33.140]  border patrol being used as illegal immigrant uber service it's worse than
[03:11:33.140 --> 03:11:35.380]  that rob newt stayed up till midnight getting
[03:11:35.380 --> 03:11:38.580]  this out last night with jamie white and rest the crew
[03:11:38.580 --> 03:11:43.140]  my bitching i'm saying we were rag tag man we're working seven days a week a
[03:11:43.140 --> 03:11:45.780]  lot of us 18 hours a day because it's our moral
[03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:50.740]  responsibility we get something like this we don't even get to see our kids
[03:11:50.740 --> 03:11:54.900]  to help me get this damn article out what it should say is
[03:11:54.900 --> 03:11:59.220]  witness border patrol engaged in child smuggling under federal law
[03:11:59.220 --> 03:12:03.140]  think the border patrols happy they're the ones told us about it
[03:12:04.260 --> 03:12:08.180]  they're beside themselves but if they quit it totally collapses
[03:12:08.180 --> 03:12:11.300]  so then they have to be involved in a lesser evil to to stop the total
[03:12:11.300 --> 03:12:16.020]  collapse you see how that works turns out there are lesser evils in there in
[03:12:16.020 --> 03:12:19.940]  this world but what we need to do is is stop congress and
[03:12:19.940 --> 03:12:23.940]  veto and all these traders that are literally aiding and abetting this
[03:12:23.940 --> 03:12:32.180]  here is the censored video only at news wars dot com here it is
[03:12:32.180 --> 03:12:36.180]  you cannot take pictures of this man
[03:12:36.180 --> 03:12:41.380]  why? very simply their family members now know they're here the people who
[03:12:41.380 --> 03:12:45.060]  they borrowed money from know they're here uh-huh and now they'll extort them
[03:12:45.060 --> 03:12:47.540]  for the money so if you want to put them in danger
[03:12:47.540 --> 03:12:53.300]  i do we had to disguise we had to disguise women's
[03:12:53.300 --> 03:12:57.140]  voice it's so recognizable so they're famous reporters for famous
[03:12:57.140 --> 03:13:01.780]  networks that on their vacation are fighting because their
[03:13:01.780 --> 03:13:06.980]  network won't let you see this you can't make this up
[03:13:06.980 --> 03:13:11.220]  this is shot on a female reporter's phone
[03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:16.180]  by herself at the border continue
[03:13:16.180 --> 03:13:23.380]  okay so this is a Catholic Charity's center it's a respite center for the
[03:13:23.380 --> 03:13:28.900]  leaders of the emotional border these are 1, 2, 3, 4, all the control
[03:13:28.900 --> 03:13:32.260]  all the control vehicles here to drop off people and bring them
[03:13:32.260 --> 03:13:37.460]  the ladies came up separate people uh this video of the people who are writing
[03:13:37.460 --> 03:13:41.300]  she said the people know they're here they'll come down because they're going to
[03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:44.260]  extort money from them so that is evidence i guess of the
[03:13:44.260 --> 03:13:48.020]  fact that there's a lot of people also this video knows we don't have seconds

[03:18:10.020 --> 03:18:15.140]  we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty
[03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:18.020]  good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a
[03:18:18.020 --> 03:18:21.780]  supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[03:18:21.780 --> 03:18:25.300]  nasa iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[03:18:25.300 --> 03:18:28.980]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and
[03:18:28.980 --> 03:18:33.300]  secured more of the deep earth crystals of nasa iodine but
[03:18:33.300 --> 03:18:37.060]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[03:18:37.060 --> 03:18:41.300]  three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it
[03:18:41.300 --> 03:18:46.340]  supercharges it and makes it even more bio available

[03:20:32.180 --> 03:20:39.540]  something very simple but the power of word of mouth the power to override the
[03:20:39.540 --> 03:20:45.940]  silicon iron curtain is beyond paramount it is essential
[03:20:45.940 --> 03:20:51.220]  and you the viewer and the listener out of the whole spectrum
[03:20:51.220 --> 03:20:55.700]  of billions of voices and millions of programs around the world
[03:20:55.700 --> 03:20:59.460]  are able to decide that the information we
[03:20:59.460 --> 03:21:03.860]  cover here is important the globalists have already
[03:21:03.860 --> 03:21:07.220]  decided that we are kryptonite to their evil
[03:21:07.220 --> 03:21:11.380]  they've already hit the panic button and said at any cost shut him up
[03:21:11.380 --> 03:21:14.900]  shut info wars down because of the guest and the listeners
[03:21:14.900 --> 03:21:21.620]  and the paul revere service that all of us together provide

[03:21:43.860 --> 03:21:47.460]  and what alex was saying to support info wars
[03:21:47.460 --> 03:21:51.380]  and the wonderful products that they have like those water filters
[03:21:51.380 --> 03:21:56.180]  and here's a story that just came out this weekend
[03:21:56.180 --> 03:22:01.300]  is poland spring water really from a spring
[03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:10.340]  not one drop a lawsuit claims not one drop of poland spring water
[03:22:10.340 --> 03:22:16.980]  actually qualifies as spring water the lawsuit says
[03:22:16.980 --> 03:22:22.740]  is common ground water that has been illegally
[03:22:22.740 --> 03:22:30.500]  mislabeled in order to reap massive
[03:22:30.500 --> 03:22:38.900]  undo sales that's what the lawsuit says so again
[03:22:38.900 --> 03:22:43.140]  you know people are talking about climate change and this and that
[03:22:43.140 --> 03:22:48.580]  how about stopping the poisons that are killing us right now
[03:22:48.580 --> 03:22:52.900]  and that's why you want to buy a water filter
[03:22:52.900 --> 03:22:56.900]  from info wars and other products to keep you healthy
[03:22:56.900 --> 03:23:02.420]  at this time of mass poisoning what they're throwing into the ground
[03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:08.660]  that's polluting our food our water and what they're putting into the air
[03:23:08.660 --> 03:23:14.260]  so these products are very essential not only to keep you healthy
[03:23:14.260 --> 03:23:21.780]  and happy but also to keep info wars to thrive
[03:23:21.780 --> 03:23:25.780]  survive and help you as well
[03:23:25.780 --> 03:23:31.460]  cash in on the benefits of freedom of speech
[03:23:31.460 --> 03:23:36.740]  i want to talk about some international going on at this time
[03:23:36.740 --> 03:23:40.820]  they had an election over there in turkey yesterday
[03:23:40.820 --> 03:23:45.940]  opposition claims victory in Ankara pulls ahead in Istanbul
[03:23:45.940 --> 03:23:51.220]  Istanbul means constant to noble that was a song when i was a kid
[03:23:51.220 --> 03:23:55.380]  so what's going on over there
[03:23:56.020 --> 03:24:01.060]  in economic slowdown the Turkish leader has been getting battered by the US
[03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:04.900]  dollar i mentioned this because this is the
[03:24:04.900 --> 03:24:13.700]  issue of virtually every election around the world except in the USA
[03:24:13.700 --> 03:24:17.060]  where we got all these little candidates
[03:24:17.060 --> 03:24:21.780]  that are running in the presidential reality show
[03:24:21.780 --> 03:24:26.980]  and the fraud of the frauds as i say it you know the
[03:24:26.980 --> 03:24:30.100]  motto with the trends journal think for yourself
[03:24:30.100 --> 03:24:36.340]  is that Beethoven rock which i had forecast on david's night show
[03:24:36.340 --> 03:24:39.860]  back in february that he would be running
[03:24:39.860 --> 03:24:46.020]  and he'd be the leading contender is two months before he announced
[03:24:46.020 --> 03:24:54.260]  so where are we going with this i was listening to him painfully
[03:24:54.260 --> 03:24:58.260]  and what he had to say when he announced his
[03:24:58.260 --> 03:25:02.900]  candidacy officially in al-paso
[03:25:04.660 --> 03:25:11.860]  the challenges before us are the greatest of our lifetime
[03:25:11.860 --> 03:25:16.980]  ready you're kidding me what challenges you're talking about
[03:25:16.980 --> 03:25:23.300]  junior or i should say white obama and don't call me racist or calling a white
[03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:28.500]  cat cat but he ain't a cat i would say he's a pussy
[03:25:28.500 --> 03:25:30.740]  cat
[03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:38.020]  he's a nothing oh he's going all over nothing more than a lot of empty
[03:25:38.020 --> 03:25:43.060]  garbage spewing out of the privileged boy's mouth
[03:25:43.060 --> 03:25:47.940]  who plays like he's the common man oh granddaddy's a billionaire
[03:25:47.940 --> 03:25:50.900]  yeah my daddy he married a rich woman too
[03:25:50.900 --> 03:25:54.580]  runs in the family doesn't it went to a
[03:25:54.580 --> 03:26:01.300]  privileged private school yep and nothing and nobody and here's what
[03:26:01.300 --> 03:26:08.180]  else the white obama blew out when he
[03:26:08.180 --> 03:26:15.460]  announced his candidacy in the presidential reality show
[03:26:15.460 --> 03:26:24.740]  on sunday this is our moment of truth
[03:26:24.740 --> 03:26:29.940]  not your moment of truth what truth are you talking about
[03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:36.660]  hey give me some examples junior i could call him junior when i call obama
[03:26:36.660 --> 03:26:41.060]  junior then i'm racist but i'm not racist anymore
[03:26:41.060 --> 03:26:48.500]  junior i call all little boys junior regardless of race
[03:26:48.500 --> 03:26:55.780]  creed and color or little boys regardless of race creed and color
[03:26:55.780 --> 03:26:59.940]  i'm tired of these little cowards with cajones
[03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:03.940]  much smaller than mothballs playing tough guy
[03:27:03.940 --> 03:27:08.100]  when they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag but send other people to
[03:27:08.100 --> 03:27:12.420]  go do their murderous killing oh yeah you got a track record
[03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:17.460]  their uh bait ho or is it bio
[03:27:17.460 --> 03:27:23.140]  of all those military budgets that you voted for
[03:27:23.140 --> 03:27:29.700]  and nothing anyway going back to elections another one in algeria
[03:27:29.700 --> 03:27:35.140]  they're trying to get rid of this president that's been around since 1999
[03:27:35.140 --> 03:27:39.220]  the cat got a stroke a number of years ago
[03:27:39.220 --> 03:27:44.260]  he has not publicly spoken to the people in six years
[03:27:44.260 --> 03:27:47.700]  and so the flunky crew behind him is running the show
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:52.500]  guess what the people are taken to the streets

[03:34:02.740 --> 03:34:08.580]  as a rock starts campaign i heard alex jones before i got on say
[03:34:08.580 --> 03:34:12.020]  all these people coming over the border you want them to come over
[03:34:12.020 --> 03:34:16.740]  put them in your house feed them that's what we say we did a press release
[03:34:16.740 --> 03:34:22.820]  number months ago wall and no wall let the people vote make it a national
[03:34:22.820 --> 03:34:29.860]  referendum yes i want a wall it will cost
[03:34:29.860 --> 03:34:36.580]  x billions of dollars no i don't want a wall i am willing to
[03:34:36.580 --> 03:34:44.580]  pay more in taxes to take care of the immigrants coming into the country
[03:34:44.580 --> 03:34:48.740]  and put out how much it would cost to each one coming in
[03:34:48.740 --> 03:34:53.540]  so let the people vote on it you want to pay more money and here's what i say
[03:34:53.540 --> 03:34:57.860]  you want to bring them in bring them in house them
[03:34:57.860 --> 03:35:03.860]  feed them clothe them take care of their health care
[03:35:03.860 --> 03:35:08.900]  oh and education oh that's what bo wants to do too
[03:35:08.900 --> 03:35:14.420]  besides uh better health care which i'm all in favor of
[03:35:14.420 --> 03:35:20.580]  he also called for better pay for teachers
[03:35:21.300 --> 03:35:26.260]  let's pay them what they're worth well i'll tell you what i think they're worth
[03:35:26.260 --> 03:35:31.300]  i think they're worth nothing i can't stand the public education system
[03:35:31.300 --> 03:35:35.140]  it's an industrial age map model
[03:35:35.140 --> 03:35:39.540]  beto that's right created by the germans
[03:35:39.540 --> 03:35:44.260]  the beginning of the industrial age took people off all their farms
[03:35:44.260 --> 03:35:47.540]  and hometowns and put them in centralized locations
[03:35:47.540 --> 03:35:50.980]  industrialization taught them how to read right
[03:35:50.980 --> 03:35:55.700]  do a little bit of arithmetic and follow orders
[03:35:55.700 --> 03:36:00.900]  to follow orders that's all this stinking education system does
[03:36:00.900 --> 03:36:05.380]  follow orders a general education sir general education
[03:36:05.380 --> 03:36:08.500]  you've got to learn chemistry biology you have to learn a lot of crap that
[03:36:08.500 --> 03:36:12.340]  you'll never use and you have no mind for because we say so
[03:36:12.340 --> 03:36:16.500]  we're a bunch of arrogant people that you pay a lot of money
[03:36:16.500 --> 03:36:20.500]  particularly these superintendents like the clown we got over here in kingston
[03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:25.220]  that makes all this money and is nothing more than a waste of money
[03:36:25.220 --> 03:36:32.580]  and what in your country or county city and stay more pay do away with the
[03:36:32.580 --> 03:36:37.140]  public education system you want to have kids
[03:36:37.140 --> 03:36:42.260]  you educated me got the internet now you have the alexandrian library
[03:36:42.260 --> 03:36:45.940]  people are bored that they're bored man and
[03:36:45.940 --> 03:36:51.460]  they're on their uh computers are ready that's their life in a new generation
[03:36:51.460 --> 03:36:56.420]  generation z equals generation zero wrote about it one of our top
[03:36:56.420 --> 03:37:00.100]  trends in 2019 they're addicted to these things
[03:37:00.100 --> 03:37:04.020]  they don't have they don't like being social so they don't have to send them
[03:37:04.020 --> 03:37:07.140]  to school and what do these schools look like
[03:37:07.140 --> 03:37:14.980]  prisons they're so damn ugly anyway public education
[03:37:14.980 --> 03:37:21.220]  only for the poorest that's my vote you want to have children
[03:37:21.220 --> 03:37:24.900]  have as many as you want you pay for them
[03:37:24.900 --> 03:37:31.380]  i'll pay some here i am at my age i still got to pay school taxes oh by the
[03:37:31.380 --> 03:37:34.740]  way never had any children
[03:37:36.420 --> 03:37:47.700]  so that's beta more bs from bo and boys the media pumping them
[03:37:47.700 --> 03:37:53.620]  now i want to talk about some other issues i was talking about

[03:38:26.580 --> 03:38:31.380]  passing out cookies over there to the protesters
[03:38:31.380 --> 03:38:35.940]  neo-nazis who over through the government they were going to bring
[03:38:35.940 --> 03:38:39.540]  democracy over there hey you heard that line before
[03:38:39.540 --> 03:38:44.820]  oh yeah you're hearing it now again look at what trump is doing with venezuela
[03:38:44.820 --> 03:38:48.420]  and pompeo and bolton talking about bring a democracy
[03:38:48.420 --> 03:38:54.580]  how about the oil anyway going back to ukraine
[03:38:54.580 --> 03:39:00.340]  you're putting that guy poroshenko right they had an election yesterday
[03:39:00.340 --> 03:39:04.740]  this is before the election nine percent of ukrainians
[03:39:04.740 --> 03:39:08.340]  have confidence in their government
[03:39:08.340 --> 03:39:16.100]  nine percent nine percent all right i'm not good at
[03:39:16.100 --> 03:39:22.900]  math but i could count to ten nine percent
[03:39:23.940 --> 03:39:29.780]  that many and a government that the united states put in there so they had an
[03:39:29.780 --> 03:39:35.140]  election yesterday oh they did and who won the election
[03:39:35.140 --> 03:39:39.380]  well you know who won the election don't you
[03:39:39.380 --> 03:39:46.260]  a comic that's right a clown won the election
[03:39:46.260 --> 03:39:50.500]  they got a run-off coming on but a clown
[03:39:50.500 --> 03:39:57.540]  won ran and won the election and it's no different than in the united states
[03:39:57.540 --> 03:40:03.380]  because what do we have over here do i care what
[03:40:03.380 --> 03:40:08.580]  morlon mayer bill mayer has to say
[03:40:08.580 --> 03:40:14.900]  or the other clowns kimmel and they're reported every day what comics have to
[03:40:14.900 --> 03:40:19.940]  say and that's all saturday night live has become
[03:40:19.940 --> 03:40:23.620]  comics have become political as my good friend

[03:40:31.940 --> 03:40:38.820]  one-sided politics that's what the nation's sunk down to
[03:40:38.820 --> 03:40:43.620]  and that's what's happened clearly as well
[03:40:43.620 --> 03:40:50.580]  in ukraine a comic a comic is in the lead
[03:40:50.580 --> 03:40:55.780]  and name the country and you got the comic leading them

[03:48:15.460 --> 03:48:19.460]  poland spring and i was mentioning also about
[03:48:19.460 --> 03:48:23.940]  joe biden again a disgusting human being can't stand the guy
[03:48:23.940 --> 03:48:29.700]  he's a phony fraud arrogant never worked a day in his life he's been playing as
[03:48:29.700 --> 03:48:33.460]  he's been a lifelong politician another one of those
[03:48:33.460 --> 03:48:38.980]  oh i'm sorry i did that i'm sorry i did that i regret i did that because now i'm
[03:48:38.980 --> 03:48:41.940]  running i may run for office so i'm gonna backtrack
[03:48:41.940 --> 03:48:46.740]  on all the miserable things i did to make people's lives so disgusting
[03:48:46.740 --> 03:48:51.940]  but anyway when he was accused of
[03:48:51.940 --> 03:48:57.380]  blowing on the hair or breathing on the hair of a woman
[03:48:57.380 --> 03:49:01.060]  and then kissing her in the back of the head
[03:49:01.060 --> 03:49:07.780]  that happened what 2015 four years ago oh i was terrified i couldn't say
[03:49:07.780 --> 03:49:11.060]  if that was my mother may have saw rest in peace ready in my hands
[03:49:11.060 --> 03:49:15.860]  they were your son of what the hell are you doing get the hell out of here
[03:49:15.860 --> 03:49:22.500]  they're gonna care less who it was oh no i couldn't say anything oh you know
[03:49:22.500 --> 03:49:26.980]  that's that's why she was running for office she was the perfect politician
[03:49:26.980 --> 03:49:34.100]  man women anyway again one of our top trends in
[03:49:34.100 --> 03:49:41.060]  the trends journal this year 2019 was america puritan 2.0
[03:49:41.060 --> 03:49:47.860]  this is more of the proof say anything prove nothing
[03:49:47.860 --> 03:49:55.460]  and you are guilty anybody can that's not journalism
[03:49:55.460 --> 03:49:59.060]  and that's why subscribe to the trends journal
[03:49:59.060 --> 03:50:04.420]  because that's journalism if you want the current event swarming future trends
[03:50:04.420 --> 03:50:12.900]  support info wars support the media where people take a stand
[03:50:12.900 --> 03:50:17.860]  and aren't told what to do like the prostitutes do
[03:50:17.860 --> 03:50:22.260]  that's such a disgusting story and there's so many more important things
[03:50:22.260 --> 03:50:26.500]  going on and one of them put your money where your
[03:50:26.500 --> 03:50:31.060]  mind is on those markets now they're up 300 points
[03:50:31.060 --> 03:50:39.380]  that's right this is some quarter that this is starting out to
[03:50:40.180 --> 03:50:44.900]  us manufacturing activity expanded last month
[03:50:44.900 --> 03:50:50.900]  rebounding from its lowest level since late 2016
[03:50:51.780 --> 03:50:57.460]  over there in china they had a good time too
[03:50:57.460 --> 03:51:02.180]  their manufacturing purchasing managers index
[03:51:03.220 --> 03:51:10.900]  jumped 50.8 in march over 50 means growth and that's the highest level in
[03:51:10.900 --> 03:51:13.380]  eight months
[03:51:14.020 --> 03:51:19.380]  and it was down they expected it to be at 49.9
[03:51:20.180 --> 03:51:26.740]  so china is also pushing stimulus in there
[03:51:26.740 --> 03:51:35.300]  last wednesday we sent out subscribers a trend alert
[03:51:35.300 --> 03:51:37.940]  that's right
[03:51:38.660 --> 03:51:45.220]  fed can't wait needs to move beyond the accelerating global economic slowdown
[03:51:45.220 --> 03:51:49.780]  we forecast the weakening us gross domestic product which we still do
[03:51:49.780 --> 03:51:53.460]  and lower corporate earnings which we still do
[03:51:53.460 --> 03:51:56.980]  that will require the u.s. fellow reserve to lower interest rates
[03:51:56.980 --> 03:52:03.860]  now before economic conditions markedly deteriorate
[03:52:06.020 --> 03:52:08.980]  and then what happened
[03:52:10.180 --> 03:52:15.860]  we sent that out on wednesday larry kudlow
[03:52:16.580 --> 03:52:21.940]  president chump's chief economic advisor
[03:52:21.940 --> 03:52:28.340]  recommended lower in interest rates now that's right
[03:52:29.060 --> 03:52:33.380]  i guess he reads our trends alerts and subscribes to the trends journal
[03:52:33.380 --> 03:52:38.500]  because we said at first it's right there in print
[03:52:38.500 --> 03:52:44.500]  they have to lower rates now the rest of the world doesn't have that
[03:52:44.500 --> 03:52:49.380]  capacity because much of the world like europe is in negative interest rate
[03:52:49.380 --> 03:52:54.980]  territory as is japan and europe is slowing down
[03:52:54.980 --> 03:53:00.180]  and over there in china they're only could do so much stimulus
[03:53:00.180 --> 03:53:04.660]  they got a 40 trillion dollar debt bubble
[03:53:05.300 --> 03:53:09.700]  and now things are slowing down there yeah this number came out a bit positive
[03:53:09.700 --> 03:53:15.940]  but there are a lot of negatives so in order for this economy to move forward
[03:53:15.940 --> 03:53:22.260]  you have to see interest rates go down am i saying they should go down no
[03:53:22.260 --> 03:53:26.820]  with trend forecasts when we make a statement as to
[03:53:26.820 --> 03:53:33.060]  for example we don't take a side on the border wall we put out the issues
[03:53:33.060 --> 03:53:37.540]  am i personally in favor of not bringing more illegal immigrants in
[03:53:37.540 --> 03:53:43.540]  yes but we leave it to the people have a referendum
[03:53:43.540 --> 03:53:49.220]  on the economy same thing i called for an economic 9-11
[03:53:49.220 --> 03:53:54.180]  when interest rates are going to go up and they signal they would go up
[03:53:54.180 --> 03:53:59.380]  two to three times in 2019 back in september 2018
[03:53:59.380 --> 03:54:04.020]  you saw the markets fall to their worst december they had since the great
[03:54:04.020 --> 03:54:08.420]  depression and i made the forecast of an economic 9-11
[03:54:08.420 --> 03:54:15.060]  the day before september 19th the day before the s&p 500 peaked
[03:54:15.060 --> 03:54:21.060]  so we go with the trends we're not holding on to an ideology
[03:54:21.060 --> 03:54:25.220]  so we were the first when i was on alex jones show
[03:54:25.220 --> 03:54:32.500]  to call the trump rally in 2016 we were the first
[03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:39.220]  in february 2018 to call for a market correction last year
[03:54:39.220 --> 03:54:46.980]  and we were the first this january to call the trump
[03:54:46.980 --> 03:54:53.700]  up no recession but they know that things are slowing down
[03:54:53.700 --> 03:54:58.260]  and that's why larry cudlow came out and said
[03:54:58.260 --> 03:55:03.220]  we've got to lower rates and he's correct we have to lower them because we also
[03:55:03.220 --> 03:55:08.820]  say should the federal reserve rely on its data-based formula
[03:55:08.820 --> 03:55:12.740]  and fail to lower rates ahead of negative trend indicators
[03:55:12.740 --> 03:55:16.740]  we forecast a rapid economic and equity market
[03:55:16.740 --> 03:55:23.220]  downward spiral you go back and you look at the facts
[03:55:23.220 --> 03:55:28.180]  they've been late on it all the time Bernanke never saw the recession coming
[03:55:28.180 --> 03:55:31.780]  when he was fed share the numbers are there the words are there the facts are
[03:55:31.780 --> 03:55:36.740]  there so gold prices are going down now and
[03:55:36.740 --> 03:55:40.420]  they're stuck in that range and you heard me say
[03:55:40.420 --> 03:55:47.140]  but maybe six years you're only going to rise in times when it has to be a
[03:55:47.140 --> 03:55:50.180]  safe haven asset and right now we're not in that
[03:55:50.180 --> 03:55:53.460]  territory so the bottom of gold as we see it is
[03:55:53.460 --> 03:55:59.700]  $1200 has to break above 1385 for it to push forward
[03:55:59.700 --> 03:56:02.900]  and when it pushes forward it has to break 1450
[03:56:02.900 --> 03:56:08.580]  $1450 an ounce when it breaks that mark again i've been saying this for six
[03:56:08.580 --> 03:56:12.820]  years then it's going to go to 2000 hasn't
[03:56:12.820 --> 03:56:18.740]  done that we've been right on target with our forecasts
[03:56:18.740 --> 03:56:23.460]  average americans can't afford a home in 70 percent of the country
[03:56:23.460 --> 03:56:26.740]  is going to be the issue in this coming election
[03:56:26.740 --> 03:56:31.460]  income inequality i told you it was going on over there in
[03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:38.660]  Algeria what's going on in Ukraine it's one country
[03:56:38.660 --> 03:56:44.500]  after another income inequality
[03:56:44.500 --> 03:56:49.940]  so that's going to be the major issue
[03:56:50.660 --> 03:56:54.820]  and now you're looking at oil prices going up
[03:56:54.820 --> 03:56:58.980]  if oil prices go up too high you're already seeing a push down in retail
[03:56:58.980 --> 03:57:03.620]  sales if oil prices break above $75 a
[03:57:03.620 --> 03:57:08.020]  barrel and now they're around 70 69 and change
[03:57:08.020 --> 03:57:13.220]  for Brent crude there's going to be pressure on the economy
[03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:18.580]  so stay tuned to the current events forming future trends
[03:57:18.580 --> 03:57:22.900]  don't get caught up in the junk news that they're pushing out
[03:57:22.900 --> 03:57:30.020]  on the mainstream media it's very important
[03:57:30.020 --> 03:57:34.180]  to volatile times so to stay ahead of the trends
[03:57:34.180 --> 03:57:38.180]  and on top of the news stay tuned to info wars
[03:57:38.180 --> 03:57:44.180]  and also consider subscribing to the trends journal there are thousands of
[03:57:44.180 --> 03:57:47.140]  ideologies out there hundreds of different political
[03:57:47.140 --> 03:57:50.900]  systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[03:57:50.900 --> 03:57:54.180]  info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[03:57:54.180 --> 03:57:57.220]  that's why the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down
[03:57:57.220 --> 03:58:00.660]  i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance
[03:58:00.660 --> 03:58:04.580]  americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring
