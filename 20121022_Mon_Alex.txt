[00:00.000 --> 00:10.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.280 --> 00:11.280]  You want answers?
[00:11.280 --> 00:13.280]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.280 --> 00:17.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.600 --> 00:29.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.160 --> 00:35.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready because, well, I'm wound up and there is a lot to cover and
[00:35.600 --> 00:39.200]  it just continues to illustrate everything we've been talking about.
[00:39.200 --> 00:45.800]  There is a private, anti-free market, anti-family world government being established that calls
[00:45.800 --> 00:47.280]  itself the New World Order.
[00:47.280 --> 00:52.080]  It's just modern slavery where the globalists are exempt from taxes, exempt from their own
[00:52.080 --> 00:59.920]  laws that they internationally create, codify, and then get our dictatorial governments of
[00:59.920 --> 01:01.400]  every major nation to certify.
[01:01.400 --> 01:05.920]  So we're going to be breaking all of this down today.
[01:05.920 --> 01:12.040]  Lou Rockwell of LouRockwell.com will be joining us via video Skype, and we'll take some of
[01:12.040 --> 01:15.620]  your calls as well in the third hour.
[01:15.620 --> 01:19.160]  And we are also going to have Pat Shannon on, he was going to be on a few weeks ago,
[01:19.160 --> 01:25.520]  but so much breaking news, I moved him, I've known this guy for like 16 years, 17 years,
[01:25.520 --> 01:27.240]  and an amazing investigative journalist.
[01:27.240 --> 01:30.400]  He's written a new book that I couldn't put down, I started reading it.
[01:30.400 --> 01:34.920]  Everything they ever told me was a lie, available at InfoWarsStore.com, and we're going to be
[01:34.920 --> 01:40.440]  going over his book and a lot more today in the second hour.
[01:40.440 --> 01:41.880]  And we'll also have open phones then.
[01:41.880 --> 01:43.720]  Wow, where do I start?
[01:43.720 --> 01:45.960]  Where do I begin?
[01:45.960 --> 01:48.480]  There's been something really eating at me.
[01:48.480 --> 01:50.720]  I've talked about it some, but not enough.
[01:50.720 --> 01:54.360]  And so we're going to do a series of investigative reports on this, just illustrating the fact
[01:54.360 --> 01:55.360]  for you.
[01:55.360 --> 01:57.560]  The facts are in, but we'll put it together in the reports.
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.280]  I'm going to talk about it today, but it almost doesn't do justice to it.
[02:01.280 --> 02:05.480]  It's like if I do a special report on the nightly news, and then air it here, everyone
[02:05.480 --> 02:09.120]  pays attention to it, and it has some special gravitas.
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.760]  But if I'm just here going over the mountains of information, it tends to kind of fall on
[02:14.760 --> 02:22.000]  deaf ears sometimes, but there is no doubt, and it has been stated that the government,
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.080]  for any reason, no judge, no jury, is not just planning to not let you travel outside
[02:27.080 --> 02:34.280]  the country or back into the country, vis-a-vis however they choose, or take your bank accounts,
[02:34.280 --> 02:40.880]  but that the government is moving to not even let you travel within the country or have
[02:40.880 --> 02:41.880]  a job.
[02:41.880 --> 02:44.840]  In fact, I printed it last week and meant to get to it.
[02:44.840 --> 02:50.760]  Just type in Obama's new executive order to seize bank accounts.
[02:50.760 --> 02:52.640]  It's huge bombshell news.
[02:52.640 --> 02:55.920]  And see, I already know all this is coming.
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.080]  So what happens is I read this news, I confirm it, and then I don't even cover it a lot of
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.040]  the time because it's passe to me.
[03:03.040 --> 03:10.720]  Well, just because you know that you're being taken to the gallows at 5 a.m. doesn't change
[03:10.720 --> 03:13.320]  the fact that you're being taken to the gallows.
[03:13.320 --> 03:18.840]  And our country is being walked to the gallows pole, and I do not like it.
[03:18.840 --> 03:24.280]  So we're going to be going over just news of the last couple days.
[03:24.280 --> 03:31.120]  This is just what I came in this morning and dug out of today's stack and the stack from
[03:31.120 --> 03:34.600]  over the weekend, okay?
[03:34.600 --> 03:37.080]  This is just out of the stack from today.
[03:37.080 --> 03:39.440]  And when we come back, I'll mention some of the other news that's coming up today.
[03:39.440 --> 03:42.160]  That's a big news day, very important news, AP.
[03:42.160 --> 03:45.800]  No fly list trans man on island in Hawaii.
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.840]  I'm proud of the fact that days before this last week, what last Wednesday, and this came
[03:50.840 --> 03:58.760]  out on Friday, it was Doug Hagman who told us about this.
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.280]  And we got the guy on the show repeatedly and were able to force it out.
[04:03.280 --> 04:12.000]  Now here's the AP days later admitting that because he's a prepper and because he complained
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.440]  about the NDA online, well, now you just can't fly, but how's that sound?
[04:17.440 --> 04:31.560]  You're a U.S. citizen, no judge, no jury, no judge, no jury, and you're just disappeared.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.560]  That's just the beginning.
[04:32.560 --> 04:36.520]  You rock, well, why you need a passport now, they're moving to just deny Americans passports
[04:36.520 --> 04:37.520]  for no reasons.
[04:37.520 --> 04:44.000]  Oh, the IRS, you're not going anywhere, Fox News, senators unveil expatriate act to expand
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.120]  to Facebook's severance tax scheme.
[04:46.120 --> 04:50.760]  We're going to break down what life in America and the Western world will be like if we don't
[04:50.760 --> 04:51.760]  stop these authoritarians.
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.440]  That's why the TSA is the heart of all this.
[04:54.440 --> 05:21.440]  So UN monitors are here to oversee the election, that and a lot more coming up.
[05:21.440 --> 05:26.400]  Supercell technology is safe enough to consume every day while powerful enough to destroy
[05:26.400 --> 05:32.600]  the causes of many serious diseases like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other
[05:32.600 --> 05:34.320]  harmful pathogens.
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.000]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers and has the
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.320]  ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness
[05:45.320 --> 05:47.760]  of older solutions.

[08:57.520 --> 09:02.040]  hour then Lou Rockwell Ron Pulse former chief of staff to give us his take on the differences
[09:02.040 --> 09:08.840]  between puppet A and puppet B Barack Obama and of course Mitt Romney and I've got a big
[09:08.840 --> 09:18.160]  stack of them here every scientific big poll Gallup you name it has him now in a dead heat
[09:18.160 --> 09:24.720]  or three to five points ahead of Obama and I went back and looked at it also found another
[09:24.720 --> 09:31.160]  article going over it from Gallup showing their polling over the last two weeks and
[09:31.160 --> 09:39.720]  yeah it shows him two weeks ago Romney 49 Obama 47 and now you can just see it change
[09:39.720 --> 09:46.320]  the numbers up till now Obama 45 Romney 52 and that's what a bunch of other polls are
[09:46.320 --> 09:51.160]  showing now now listen to don't don't don't count your chickens before they're hatched
[09:51.160 --> 09:58.800]  if you like Romney because there's something called electronic voting fraud that has been
[09:58.800 --> 10:06.280]  proven to really be bad more than 10 states and it varies county to county but 10 states
[10:06.280 --> 10:11.600]  are really been certified to be full of fraud places like Ohio Florida basically anywhere
[10:11.600 --> 10:19.480]  that's been a swing state before Iowa in primaries California do not hold your breath ladies
[10:19.480 --> 10:25.360]  and gentlemen and again it'll just mean a different management team from the new world
[10:25.360 --> 10:33.120]  order if Romney gets in Christian Science Monitor has an analysis out today saying that Romney
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.120]  couldn't really have a tougher Iran policy with sanctions and covert operations than
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.000]  Obama would and that's really true from my research Kurt Nemo a day before that an article
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.640]  out Obama and Romney war no matter who wins election well yeah people say oh Alex where's
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.840]  this war I don't know Libya I mean oh they called it a peace action Syria right now blowing
[10:52.840 --> 10:58.480]  up missile factories blowing up military police bases on a weekly basis assassinations inside
[10:58.480 --> 11:05.080]  Iran our media bragging that there's there's covert war going on I mean that's that's war
[11:05.080 --> 11:10.080]  you know when you're blowing up military bases in Iran that's that's called a war just in
[11:10.080 --> 11:14.640]  case people didn't know there's wars been going on for really three years hot and heavy but
[11:14.640 --> 11:19.120]  it's it's it's starting to intensify it's it was kind of like on level five on the top
[11:19.120 --> 11:25.880]  the stove now they turned it up to level 10 so it is it is on high burn right now the only
[11:25.880 --> 11:30.680]  question is will it go into overdrive and turn it up to broil so we're going to be breaking
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.480]  all that down also on the election you end to monitor conservative groups at us polls
[11:35.480 --> 11:41.480]  that's Melissa Melton in full wars dot com and it's also in the hill newspaper that covers
[11:41.480 --> 11:47.440]  capital hill international monitors at us polling spots for our criticism from voter
[11:47.440 --> 11:54.480]  fraud groups and see the UN it's the UN when you read it says it's the UN I mean I mean
[11:54.480 --> 11:58.440]  look we told her by the UN starting to run our country more and more can we just be honest
[11:58.440 --> 12:03.080]  about it or is the media always have to say oh it's global governance not government same
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.240]  thing though or oh yeah it's international monitors yeah from the UN but we're not going
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.920]  to say that in the headline because that sounds conspiratorial so that financial times of
[12:12.920 --> 12:16.560]  London article another one pushing world government a few months ago it's like yeah we don't want
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.520]  to be conspiracy theorist but there is a global private corporate government and it knows best
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.320]  and it's authoritarian but don't listen to the conspiracy cooks that say there's a world
[12:24.320 --> 12:28.080]  government so the message is hey there's a world government get in line with it or we're
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.480]  going to call you conspiracy theorist because the general public's dumbed down that's what
[12:32.480 --> 12:38.400]  they're telling business readers yes it's real but you're not supposed to say it is
[12:38.400 --> 12:42.760]  well the problem is I'm not going to play along with it info wars dot com prison planet
[12:42.760 --> 12:49.360]  dot com matt drudge drudge report dot com and his crew aren't going to go along with
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.280]  the so-called establishment saying they're going to lecture us on reality world that
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.520]  daily it's not going to go along with it many others aren't going to go along with it you're
[12:58.520 --> 13:02.820]  not going to go along with it and so they got a problem because we have inalienable
[13:02.820 --> 13:09.320]  rights we're not slaves and listen I live in a city we've done news reports showing
[13:09.320 --> 13:16.200]  the U.N. website where they brag they call it immunized U.N. model city and the city
[13:16.200 --> 13:22.360]  of Austin has signed agreements and policy guidelines to even get international funds
[13:22.360 --> 13:31.800]  and designations there's our city and one other Japanese city you can look it up that
[13:31.800 --> 13:41.080]  are the U.N. models of the world and and and and and then that Japanese city is our is
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.320]  our sister city so again you can go watch Aaron Dyke's Melissa Melton's reports they
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.160]  followed like three of them in the last month we should air those again we did during the
[13:51.160 --> 14:00.320]  special 48 hour broadcast but the point is that it even hit me yesterday driving along
[14:00.320 --> 14:04.360]  with my wife and and I and I just said I've got to go on air and explain to people we're
[14:04.360 --> 14:08.880]  in occupied territory and she goes you've said that many times but I mean I need to
[14:08.880 --> 14:16.080]  explain that this is really happening this is really going on I mean I'm not just saying
[14:16.080 --> 14:23.440]  deep behind enemy lines in in in captured female region six I live more than anybody
[14:23.440 --> 14:29.440]  else in the United States under the United Nations we're going to do more reports on
[14:29.440 --> 14:35.040]  that and there every small town around Austin is in the process of being taken over I mean
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.520]  they'll go into small towns with 10,000 people in them and spend five six seven eight million
[14:39.520 --> 14:47.240]  dollars a year in the last few years going in buying the mayors buying everybody pushing
[14:47.240 --> 14:51.680]  a referendum putting armies of bureaucrats knocking on doors having town hall meetings
[14:51.680 --> 14:57.800]  saying sign on to this and then they just roll over and just take the land I mean you name
[14:57.800 --> 15:04.360]  it I mean it's incredible but they do it in a limp-wristed simpering MPR voice which
[15:04.360 --> 15:10.160]  is scientifically crafted under Delphi technique we'll say to these people you're Delphi trained
[15:10.160 --> 15:13.880]  they'll start smiling I've had them off record laugh at me and say you're not going to stop
[15:13.880 --> 15:21.440]  us these are soldiers folks these are operatives these are infiltrators and they know it is
[15:21.440 --> 15:25.880]  the thing I've been to smart growth conferences when the cameras off and have one of them just
[15:25.880 --> 15:32.920]  grabbing by the shirt bankers former Dallas cowboy you name it they're all there Bank of
[15:32.920 --> 15:36.760]  America all of them and they'll say you don't ever hang that camera at me you understand

[15:42.240 --> 15:48.400]  and I mean I've witnessed it they're not naive folks these are pirates but 21st century
[15:48.400 --> 15:57.320]  pirates act all nice and oh hi everybody oh I mean it's a program these are spies these
[15:57.320 --> 16:03.240]  are operatives and I don't know how I get this across to you that the fact of the general
[16:03.240 --> 16:08.000]  public reads the newspaper you know 23% of people read newspapers still and then they
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.600]  think they're smart and that's a bunch of gobbledygook or they tell the truth but then lie by omission
[16:13.600 --> 16:19.760]  or frame things differently and say one thing is another while incredible historic things
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.520]  are happening we are now in occupied America by the globalist by the banksters and just
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.400]  type in banks declare they've conquered Europe or Goldman Sachs conquers Europe or Goldman

[16:53.360 --> 16:56.560]  if the carbon taxes fail we're going to have a new global currency we're not going to get
[16:56.560 --> 17:00.720]  rid of the other currencies we're just going to devalue them until you beg for the new

[18:04.680 --> 18:11.160]  syndicated in local talk radio a lot when I'm out jogging and things I heard W.O.A.I.
[18:11.160 --> 18:16.360]  last Friday when I was taking a break jogging when I left here the big talk station into
[18:16.360 --> 18:20.360]  San Antonio one of the big ones saying it's terrible that our government's backing al-Qaeda
[18:20.360 --> 18:27.840]  and Libby in Syria and this morning I heard on news radio 590 them them admit and go yo
[18:27.840 --> 18:32.800]  it's true our government runs al-Qaeda and it's terrible so look we can get this info
[18:32.800 --> 18:37.320]  out there I know it he doesn't compute with the normal it's like well the government
[18:37.320 --> 18:40.880]  runs al-Qaeda well then well then why are they trying to take our liberties because
[18:40.880 --> 18:46.360]  it was always a bait and switch it was always meant to be a bait and switch and you've
[18:46.360 --> 18:53.480]  got to come to grips with it I mean I've been at these smart grow conferences and things
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.560]  and I've had people come over who are in the city and literally look around when nobody's
[18:58.560 --> 19:05.200]  around while I'm by the water fountain and bump into me and say I'm going to kill you
[19:05.200 --> 19:08.560]  and you look at them and you're like you're going to kill me yeah I'm a Marine I know

[24:07.040 --> 24:21.320]  show because there's a war on for your mind well Obama is now on record in the media
[24:21.320 --> 24:27.200]  starting to pick it up he wants to not only ban rivals but also handguns and put citizens
[24:27.200 --> 24:33.040]  extra judicially on a list and just take your guns no judge no jury no nothing just well
[24:33.040 --> 24:38.760]  you're on a no fly list you're also on a no buy list and again ten years ago I was watching
[24:38.760 --> 24:44.520]  C-SPAN for more than an hour and a half and they had a TSA Governor Ridge was there he
[24:44.520 --> 24:51.160]  had even gotten cabinet position yet for Homeland Security newly formed by the executive and
[24:51.160 --> 24:57.080]  they had all these tables together with all these corporate CEOs there and they said at
[24:57.080 --> 25:03.240]  that meeting that in the future you will have to have a TSA Homeland Security authorization
[25:03.240 --> 25:07.800]  to have a job anywhere and that they would start in critical infrastructure computers
[25:07.800 --> 25:14.200]  ports and fan out from there and now you can go look at literally tens of millions of
[25:14.200 --> 25:21.200]  Americans people that do you know service on trucks at national parks people that work
[25:21.200 --> 25:26.560]  in mining people that work in basically every area are told you got to go get a certification
[25:26.560 --> 25:31.480]  it doesn't matter your background check came back from Homeland Security and then they
[25:31.480 --> 25:39.400]  just put a block on you and you see this is the essence of tyranny every authoritarian
[25:39.400 --> 25:44.140]  system makes you have a paper that's stamped and certified that you're in good standing
[25:44.140 --> 25:49.440]  with them and then if you're not a good globalist if you're not a good Nazi if you're not a
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.720]  good communist if you're not a good Roman if you weren't a good Aztec whatever the case
[25:54.720 --> 26:02.240]  was you weren't allowed up in England in the Middle Ages also in Europe they had laws about
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.600]  what you could wear certain colors because they didn't have to have checkpoints if you
[26:06.600 --> 26:11.960]  had a bunch of finery and diamonds and we're wearing purple or scarlet then you were just
[26:11.960 --> 26:17.000]  boom access wherever you went you were known by your horse you were known by and you could
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.360]  be executed in ancient England if you were wearing a night sword and we're not a certified
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.440]  night and if you didn't have all the secret pass codes and that's where secret societies
[26:28.440 --> 26:35.200]  come from the masons all of that and that's what happens here well now if they just turn
[26:35.200 --> 26:39.640]  your face scan off your your your your your thumb burning off and they know it's going
[26:39.640 --> 26:43.920]  to be a giant chilling effect you serve the system you're going to be left alone it's
[26:43.920 --> 26:47.120]  now been in the news and I've interviewed some of the Marines and people they've done
[26:47.120 --> 26:52.400]  this to they always want soldiers to infiltrate groups and basically set them up or be set
[26:52.400 --> 26:55.920]  up themselves that you get put on a no fly list when you have no criminal record they
[26:55.920 --> 26:59.840]  always target people that they know are salesmen and folks that have to be able to fly and
[26:59.840 --> 27:03.720]  they call you in six months later they've got a formula when you're basically bankrupt
[27:03.720 --> 27:06.520]  and they say listen we're going to pay you the money back and everything you've just
[27:06.520 --> 27:11.760]  got to work for us now in infraguard and then we may never ask you to do anything but we
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.960]  may ask you to kill people that's come out in the news about infraguard or we may ask
[27:17.960 --> 27:22.480]  you to go set people up now we're going to pay you we're going to pay the money you've
[27:22.480 --> 27:30.240]  lost from being on the no fly list I mean this is what they do this is how they induct
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.960]  people and a lot of people get scared and they go well you're FBI I okay you're ATF
[27:35.960 --> 27:40.960]  well all right I'll do whatever and and then you know a couple years down the road they
[27:40.960 --> 27:45.760]  find out you're doing things like they want you're taking over to pure dark side of government
[27:45.760 --> 27:49.240]  which is now bigger than the light side many experts like Joel scowls and break down and
[27:49.240 --> 27:53.280]  I agree with this analysis and I mean if you'll do anything you're you're going to be a drug
[27:53.280 --> 28:02.680]  dealer or if you'll go you'll be a killer or if you'll go even further it's unlimited
[28:02.680 --> 28:06.840]  I went and saw loopers last night and I'm going to get more into this big big issue of not
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.280]  being able to travel out the country or come back in if they want when come back from break
[28:10.280 --> 28:16.440]  I went and saw it it's a real subtle movie with Bruce Willis very very well done and
[28:16.440 --> 28:22.800]  in the future of the United States is run by the mafia and suddenly it shows that the
[28:22.800 --> 28:28.760]  police by the end that the mafia is in a police station and they've actually got cops in blue
[28:28.760 --> 28:34.600]  that you see at the end that that are working for the mafia and the police chief is the
[28:34.600 --> 28:42.920]  gangster mafia chief sent from the future spoiler alert obviously living in a vault
[28:42.920 --> 28:48.640]  inside the building and the United States is fully collapsed because of corruption and
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.640]  China is now the center of the world government but there is still a second amendment so everybody
[28:53.640 --> 28:58.000]  shooting and killing each other and more than half the population is homeless that's actually
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.920]  agenda 21 but they plan to fully convert the police over it's even more realistic low level
[29:04.920 --> 29:10.120]  cops aren't allowed to have weapons then mid level are allowed to have a single shot shotgun
[29:10.120 --> 29:15.720]  and the higher ups have automatic weapons and everything else that's actually State Department
[29:15.720 --> 29:27.980]  memorandum and common law US law 7277 State Department random 7277 and UN treaty that
[29:27.980 --> 29:31.560]  we've covered here before it says the general cops are going to be disarmed and just have
[29:31.560 --> 29:37.960]  tasers I mean that movie that is predicted program either their pure new order or it
[29:37.960 --> 29:43.000]  was there to condition us or they were good guys that got this out of course even if they're
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.440]  good guys they were just allowed to put it out to still condition people well they ride
[29:46.440 --> 29:54.080]  back stay with us a big news straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run
[29:54.080 --> 30:03.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network Aaron Fullen here as the food police shut down food
[30:03.240 --> 30:08.040]  co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and
[30:08.040 --> 30:12.280]  homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut
[30:12.280 --> 30:16.400]  yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and
[30:16.400 --> 30:20.360]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these
[30:20.360 --> 30:24.120]  remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence

[34:37.360 --> 34:41.640]  with some of the things that rustle means promoted 20 30 years ago but more and more
[34:41.640 --> 34:46.600]  he was speaking out against the new world order against socialism against collectivism
[34:46.600 --> 34:52.480]  he understood it was eugenics based he said obama was bad four years ago he had a lot
[34:52.480 --> 34:58.640]  of courage and we did a big hour long plus many documentary with him that he said was

[35:40.240 --> 35:45.360]  means and the fact that he actually spoke his mind and the left turned against him in
[35:45.360 --> 35:50.960]  the last 15 years because he began to understand that socialism and communism was a system
[35:50.960 --> 35:57.640]  of enslavement and eugenics to control people and destroy them and he started speaking about
[35:57.640 --> 36:03.880]  that and exposing that and so the left started attacking him as well as the fake right so
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.800]  happy trails buddy there in the happy hunting ground i guess we'll all end up there if we're
[36:08.800 --> 36:14.120]  lucky enough instead of the other place so god bless you and tonight on the nightly news

[36:59.000 --> 37:03.280]  to humanity even though the group with everything they said they had courage they had guts and
[37:03.280 --> 37:07.960]  that was enough we need to remember these people not just remember all the fake sports
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.880]  icons and things the globalist build up so they can tear them down and i want to talk
[37:11.880 --> 37:18.520]  about how they can try to control heroes a little bit towards the end of the hour after
[37:18.520 --> 37:26.000]  i get into some more of the news that is coming up okay let me just give you some of the headlines
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.880]  before i get back into the domestic checkpoints that are not coming they're already here but
[37:30.880 --> 37:36.360]  but what life will be like here in america let me just get into some of the other headlines
[37:36.360 --> 37:42.040]  here eugenics and education healthy boy banned from public school due to genetic make up
[37:42.040 --> 37:48.000]  11 and this has been covered by fox news you name it 11 year old california schoolboy
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.680]  named colman shatum has been banished from his school and forced to transfer to another
[37:52.680 --> 37:57.240]  school because he carries the genetic mutation for cystic fibrosis it's not communicable
[37:57.240 --> 38:04.120]  it's not a it's a genetic disorder and it's not even manifesting but they say you've
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.120]  got to go to our special school and you notice the special schools are getting in summer
[38:08.120 --> 38:12.240]  age as big as the regular schools because they're the vaccines the drugs the chemicals
[38:12.240 --> 38:17.840]  the bad diets more and more the kids are going to have problems the school gets more money
[38:17.840 --> 38:21.760]  so why do they even know his genetic makeup well they take your blood at birth people
[38:21.760 --> 38:25.160]  are going to get genetic testing now you've noticed and and and they'll say oh we have
[38:25.160 --> 38:29.040]  a genetic treatment for you we can probably cure cancer or whatever it is but oh yeah
[38:29.040 --> 38:33.120]  they got a blood sample from you sometime in your life this company patented your particular
[38:33.120 --> 38:37.920]  blood DNA that's not a joke look that up and sorry the treatment is going to cost a million
[38:37.920 --> 38:44.040]  dollars now was going to cost 20,000 I mean just type that in court rules that you don't
[38:44.040 --> 38:56.320]  own your DNA okay they're just doing whatever they want so there it is what we're seeing
[38:56.320 --> 38:59.960]  here is the beginning of the application of eugenics in public schools this is how it
[38:59.960 --> 39:05.080]  starts banning little boys and girls because a bad gene sequence even if they have absolutely
[39:05.080 --> 39:08.560]  no symptoms and are living in a state of perfect health well what do they want to go to that
[39:08.560 --> 39:16.600]  school next it progresses to racially genetic profiling with declaration that people have
[39:16.600 --> 39:21.160]  certain races are genetically inferior that already happens in in game we have in state
[39:21.160 --> 39:25.280]  board hearings in the legislature they say why do you drug 69% of kids and they go they
[39:25.280 --> 39:31.560]  have bad gene pools no test is done they're black just you can't make this up and therefore
[39:31.560 --> 39:37.120]  unable to be taught in public schools will be told and from there this history is showing
[39:37.120 --> 39:40.080]  it moves to the eugenics phase that's right we're now they said they're going to drug
[39:40.080 --> 39:46.160]  all the kids total nightmare and Mike Adams at naturalnews.com it's also up at m4wars.com
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.040]  links sort of Fox News Daily Mail HBO Bill Maher saying just kill everybody you know he's
[39:51.040 --> 39:59.720]  pro death very nice people india may ban GMO crop field trials for 10 years but that's
[39:59.720 --> 40:09.780]  okay because now six largest pesticide corporations funding effort to try to defeat GMO labeling
[40:09.780 --> 40:13.840]  proposition 37 because you shouldn't be able to know if something's had a bunch of high
[40:13.840 --> 40:19.680]  tech pesticides sprayed on it or low tech like fluoride sodium fluoride you shouldn't
[40:19.680 --> 40:27.640]  be allowed to know that America no you shouldn't be allowed to know that that's another report
[40:27.640 --> 40:35.360]  in that area pesticide can be the culprit and be drop off a new big study out on that
[40:35.360 --> 40:44.240]  university study flu vaccine effectiveness claims are wildly exaggerated and it only
[40:44.240 --> 40:50.800]  helped people 1.5% of the time when the study was looked at by the University of Minnesota
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.160]  and that's even using the cooked data they had the flu shot actually lowers your immunity
[40:55.160 --> 40:59.760]  that's been proven in so many studies it makes my head spins another great SD well story
[40:59.760 --> 41:05.320]  at natural news shot effects of GMOs ask your doctor is cancer right for you excellent
[41:05.320 --> 41:14.120]  article up at info wars dot com natural news dot com pesticide food timeline and it goes

[41:29.960 --> 41:35.680]  for them once you get them on riddling to put them on prozac they like it well yeah what
[41:35.680 --> 41:39.400]  are they 5 to 7 to 10 depending on the study more likely than being drug addicts when you
[41:39.400 --> 41:43.040]  ever put them on any of this well of course they're getting them young got to fight drugs
[41:43.040 --> 41:50.080]  I mean dare to stay off drugs unless they're big farmers deadly drugs also a lot of reports

[41:59.960 --> 42:03.680]  attack through puppets they covertly hire we don't even know they've been hired later
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.080]  bust those puppets as a way to totally take over the web and I'm now hearing radio ads
[42:08.080 --> 42:13.800]  about under the new compliance rules you must save all your email for years and have federally
[42:13.800 --> 42:18.800]  approved IT people you could go to jail if you don't check this federal website to find

[43:02.680 --> 43:09.440]  be getting into all of that as well again you and monitors to control our elections
[43:09.440 --> 43:16.280]  and to be overseeing them but but but not overseeing for electronic institutional government

[43:27.120 --> 43:32.080]  going to be there making sure the illegal aliens can vote not once not twice but twice as democratic
[43:32.080 --> 43:35.480]  operatives have been recorded saying yes we'll teach you how to vote repeatedly that's all
[43:35.480 --> 43:39.920]  coming out by the way what was it a CBS News channel I had it here in my stack I'll get
[43:39.920 --> 43:46.400]  to it here it is CBS News affiliate calls 2012 presidential race for Barack Obama weeks
[43:46.400 --> 43:52.560]  ahead of election and and this continues to happen sometimes on the night of the event
[43:52.560 --> 43:59.520]  was an ABC in 96 flash the exact voting totals hours before for the entire country up on screen
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.320]  and then didn't even change it later to still put it up the 2012 presidential election is
[44:04.320 --> 44:09.840]  still more than two weeks away but on Friday a CBS News affiliate in Arizona called the
[44:09.840 --> 44:14.760]  race for President Barack Obama that's a daily caller reports for 17 seconds Phoenix Arizona
[44:14.760 --> 44:23.400]  CBS News KPHO ran a lower third graphic that showed the Obama had won the November 6 election
[44:23.400 --> 44:29.200]  over Governor Mitt Romney with 99% of the precincts reporting lower third graphic appeared
[44:29.200 --> 44:34.960]  at 3.30 p.m. on October 19th during an episode of the People's Court got that a little too
[44:34.960 --> 44:37.680]  concrete they said they'd already blown up building seven they said it already fallen
[44:37.680 --> 44:41.480]  its own footprint an hour before it happened and then 25 minutes before and the reporters
[44:41.480 --> 44:46.040]  are it fell in its own footprint from fires everyone survived surprised that they complete
[44:46.040 --> 44:56.080]  collapse hadn't happened yet you guys ready going there very loving the CBS News graphic
[44:56.080 --> 45:03.040]  showed Obama went in the election with 43% of the vote nationwide to Romney's 40% with
[45:03.040 --> 45:12.280]  a 40 million 220 237 thousand votes to 38 million and change for Romney it is unclear
[45:12.280 --> 45:17.920]  who garnered the other 70% in the fictional election results KPHO's general manager did
[45:17.920 --> 45:24.960]  not return the daily caller's request for comment by the time of publication so there
[45:24.960 --> 45:36.560]  you go from a daily caller reporting on that okay let's just continue here now now I want
[45:36.560 --> 45:40.800]  everybody to listen to me very very carefully I want to explain to you what life in this
[45:40.800 --> 45:47.560]  country and in every industrialized nation is going to be like and this isn't my opinion

[45:58.360 --> 46:03.800]  services who all meet and have all integrated their programs that's why they got naked body
[46:03.800 --> 46:08.880]  scanners going in Europe same ones here it's continuity of agenda it's a global corporate
[46:08.880 --> 46:14.840]  agenda that is that handed down to the North American Union the EU and the Asian Union
[46:14.840 --> 46:20.800]  which are all open and publicly operating and deciding everything from the color of
[46:20.800 --> 46:29.000]  street signs down to what the world reserve currency will be it's all been standardized

[47:14.880 --> 47:20.960]  just going to deny you and not say why no judge no jury so there's no fly list that

[47:49.440 --> 47:54.840]  point it may be impossible to get one papers please dot org reports on what the state department
[47:54.840 --> 47:59.040]  is planning for future passport applicants the new US passport application forms are
[47:59.040 --> 48:04.040]  back worse than ever ignoring massive public opposition and despite having recently admitted
[48:04.040 --> 48:09.520]  there is already using the proposed forms illegally without approval the state department
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.840]  is trying again to get approval for a pair of impossible to complete new passport application
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.080]  forms that would in effect allow the state department to deny you a passport simply by
[48:18.080 --> 48:27.040]  choosing to send you either of the long forms and it goes over the new rules asking who the
[48:27.040 --> 48:32.200]  doctor was delivered you who the nurse was everything with proof you have to get our
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.240]  a private investigator to be able to get this okay meanwhile illegal aliens are all just
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.240]  given them instantly are all legalized everywhere people say oh we need internal checkpoints

[51:15.760 --> 51:20.080]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid
[51:20.080 --> 51:24.040]  of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with archaeological
[51:24.040 --> 51:27.840]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[51:27.840 --> 51:33.160]  culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kimchi and
[51:33.160 --> 51:37.480]  in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South for

[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:19.880]  federally funded checkpoints where they even face scan you with similar systems they had
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:26.760]  in feluja and then drag you off and in the future it's going to be a no buy no fly no
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:32.560]  gun own no work no travel they've said this you're not going to have a job you're not
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:36.200]  going to travel you're not going to buy food you notice all over they're putting signs
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:40.160]  up saying we don't accept large bills now they're trying to tell me at stores they won't
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:45.840]  take 20s now so they're just phasing it out they're tearing up $100 bills at walmart that
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:49.840]  are real they're arresting people that have $100 bills they're arresting people that have
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:54.680]  silver and show it to someone at the park everything's criminal now except being criminal
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:10:03.040]  then your view this is a tyranny is when criminals take over and sure society collapses they
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:07.160]  don't they don't they don't care about that so I want to get Pat Shannon's take on this
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:14.000]  but here are some of these articles wall street journal reports legal families with with
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:29.960]  with post tax money people have post post tax money and they are not allowed to leave
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:34.600]  with it out of the United States they're not letting citizens leave the Costa Rica they're
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:39.160]  not letting them leave to Switzerland and that's in the wall street journal they say
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:43.680]  you can leave your money stays here and by the way there's not even a law they're just
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:49.760]  saying there's no law the UN runs our country but Obama says they do to Congress there's
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:53.760]  no law saying he can shut down coal power plants they just do it it's called government
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:11:00.240]  does whatever it wants Mitt Romney hardly pays any taxes the big mega corporations themselves
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:07.760]  on average pay zero most of them pay nothing but Google pays 3.4% a year but the average
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:13.000]  American making over $100,000 a year pays almost 40% to the Federal Reserve then there's
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:18.800]  the dozens of other taxes so here's that report and we've got a video truck driver stands
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:22.560]  up the unconstitutional checkpoint Americans are reasserting their Fourth Amendment they
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:26.920]  now have border patrol checkpoints a hundred miles in from any border or coastline well
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:30.720]  most of the population lives on coastlines and I've seen it they let illegal aliens
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.360]  just drive through unfettered give them bank accounts they're all left alone homeland security
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:40.360]  announced months ago we already know they don't take any legal aliens now in fact they hire
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:47.440]  them in homeland security to do contracts and people comment in this video they go I thought
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:53.360]  you people want to stop the illegals the checkpoints as Ron Paul said are for the American people
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:59.440]  okay but the really scary thing is this Lou Rockwell story why you need a passport now
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:04.920]  and it goes over and has links to mainstream news where they now say they have the right
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:11.200]  outside of law it says there's no law to just deny you a passport and if you sue them they
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:16.680]  give you a long form basically saying who was your doctor what was the nurses name and
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:20.680]  hundreds of questions no one can answer and then they'll just say they're improper and
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:26.840]  refuse them so this is the new system and nothing to do with the illegals they're just
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:31.680]  allowed in that they do a few arrests for you know for public consumption and again no
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:37.960]  fly list strands man on island in Hawaii we had him on twice last week Hawaii is a paradise
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:43.600]  for most visitors but it was Wade Hicks juniors prison for five days and he only got out because
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:48.360]  the media attention here on the show the 34 year old Gulfport Mississippi was stranded
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:52.880]  in the islands this week after being told he was on the FBI's no fly list during a layover
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:57.040]  for a military flight from California to Japan the episode left Hicks scrambling to figure
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:01.480]  out how he'd get home from Hawaii without being able to fly then he was abruptly removed
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:06.200]  from the list Thursday with no explanation well he we had him and another fellow on to
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:12.280]  this happen a lot of people it has raised questions on how he landed on the list Hicks said he
[1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:16.680]  was traveling to visit his wife a US Navy lieutenant who deployed to Japan he hitched
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:20.000]  to ride the military flight in his common for military dependents who were allowed to
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.880]  fly on scheduled routes when there is room Hicks said that during the layover at the
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:29.840]  Pearl Harbor base immigration customs force an agent told him he was on no fly list wouldn't
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:32.880]  be allowed to do plane of course they don't want to tell you it was over the fact that
[1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:37.280]  he was told that he was a prepper and that they were reading you know they go and look
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:42.480]  up now what you do on the internet and they got records of you flying constantly no criminal
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:47.200]  record they don't care they grab your laptops now and download them cops all over the country
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:51.720]  now grab your cell phone and download stuff without warrants courts say they can court
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:55.800]  say they can taser you to make you answer questions in a hospital bed they now throw
[1:13:55.800 --> 1:13:59.920]  people out of wheelchairs that are quadriplegics and the courts say that's good you should
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:04.680]  have minded the order if you're having a convulsion don't mind the order to stop having a convulsion
[1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:09.240]  I'm not joking they taser you if the teacher uploads a picture of her breasts in front
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:14.680]  of the class they spend the class and they say well the rule says you can't see pornography
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:20.360]  the teacher is fine people like well that makes no sense it's meant to overturn reason
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:24.200]  why do they in the military give you sleep deprivation for eight weeks and make you sing
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:28.240]  silly songs and do silly things just to see if you'll do what you're told this is my rifle
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:32.440]  this is my gun this is for fighting this is for fun the Marines at least back in the 60s
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:35.960]  I saw a documentary about Stanley Kubrick doing research they made them march around
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:43.760]  grabbing their genitals why because it's you're gonna do it or I'm gonna stop your guts out
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:50.560]  that's why the editor of right Bart says I don't want to be taken behind closed doors
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:55.080]  and they say well you are and they drag her back there to grab her genitals on video you
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:15:01.040]  see the door close and the TSA people are smiling these are weirdos that like this a normal person
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:05.400]  doesn't like to get in the face of somebody that deserves to be gotten in the face because
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:10.360]  it's embarrassing it's weird when you're powerful to exercise power over people but those that
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:15.800]  don't have power crave it all right continuing it's time for us that are good to get angry
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:21.920]  and route these people here's Fox News oh the IRS you're not going anywhere we'll get
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:25.920]  we'll get the Rockwell on about 15 after we're gonna hold a pad over about 10 minutes I just
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:29.300]  had to cover this because it's so important and it says well they couldn't get it passed
[1:15:29.300 --> 1:15:34.520]  in Congress so now they're just saying you're gonna be put on a no fly list if the IRS
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:39.920]  says one of their bureaucrats that they think you may not have paid everything that means
[1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:44.040]  if they send you a letter saying they believe you've underpaid the private fellow reserve
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:49.680]  that you're not gonna fly no judge no jury just like Rahm Emanuel said you are on no
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:53.920]  fly list that they put you on a traditionally over two million Americans on it Senate report
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:59.080]  just came out and admitted it totally innocent not one terrorist caught because they run
[1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:03.080]  the terrorist that was two weeks ago Senate report confirming what we've been saying for
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.880]  years government midst they put off fake terror alerts governor regimented that they're staging
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:11.840]  it all they run Al Qaeda overseas and they sit there and they say you're not gonna own
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:16.000]  a gun now we're gonna not just let you buy guns now we're gonna swat team you in the
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:20.760]  middle of the night even though you have no criminal record because we put you on the

[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:29.760]  and oopsie they're gonna gun you down in the future and a gun gets dropped just like the
[1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:34.760]  troops are trained to do an Iraq they carry a few extra AK-47s in the tank or the APCs
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:41.120]  on record and they kill 20 30 Hodges just throw a gun down what they call them and they come
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:47.600]  back here they become cops and they kill their wives and kids it's not even a big deal now
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:51.720]  just oh yeah that's just what happens this is the new system but then the rest of veterans
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:55.880]  who held it together and were moral well you're all gonna lose your rights to unless you join
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:17:00.440]  the new world order then you can keep your guns this is the hell system and I've studied
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:05.280]  Nazi Germany Soviet Russia and every other tyranny the old Roman system when it started
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:10.520]  collapsing wouldn't let Romans get out with their money these are called capital controls
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:18.920]  and they're coming legal I remember talking to some members of John Wayne's family John
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:25.880]  Wayne used to love to go camp and stay out in the county right next to Hays County I

[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:32.360]  know more than two decades remember when i was first getting woken up i was reading stuff you
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:38.280]  were writing in media bypass and other places but now so much of it's come true you know back
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:42.520]  then they said it was a terrorism basically if you said there was a world government that was
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:47.080]  going to be set up by banks now it's like you're a terrorist if you don't love the world government
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:51.400]  being set up by banks pat shannon on your radar screen what is front and center there's so much
[1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:56.040]  to talk about i mean i guess the federal reserve they're victims now i predicted they would foil
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:01.720]  false flags against it and as usual it's coming out that it's patseyville well yeah well the
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:08.280]  incident last week was so obvious and especially when the fbi had such a reputation for this you
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:13.560]  know the in fact it was it was one of one of their federal government antics have brought you and me
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:19.640]  together the first time with the oklahoma city bombing back in 95 that's right uh the but what
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:24.280]  happened last week a judge in apolitano i don't know if you caught it but he he said that's the
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:34.040]  18th time the one eight 18th time since 2001 uh 911 that this has happened with it but and now
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:40.280]  those are just the ones that were exposed my friend i mean you know they're staging stuff
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:44.920]  when even the new york times in washington post admitted yeah break down how they set up these
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:53.720]  useful idiots well i i think probably mentioning the the new york times uh back in 93 i think it's
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:26:01.960]  october 27th or eighth issue they actually explain tell the whole story about the alleged terrorist
[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:10.040]  sulem was his last name spelled like salem and uh how he actually stung the fbi when he offered to
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:16.760]  bring them some white powder that was you know subtle not explosive and they said they insisted
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:22.360]  and he taped them on the telephone they insisted didn't know he used the real explosives so he
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:27.560]  did a reverse sting on the fbi and it really was laughable to to those of us who were tuned in
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:32.600]  yeah he was the handler of the low-grade morons they chose they made them cook the bomb train the
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:37.480]  driver use real detonators he figured out because he worked for the cia that they were setting him
[1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:42.200]  up so he recorded them and then did a press conference the day after the attack saying look
[1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:46.600]  i'm not involved so instead of them being able to set him up as them as the mastermind they had
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:54.280]  to pay him off correct and and with egg all over their faces but they just do it over and over again
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:58.920]  it turns out they got this guy into the country again and insisted he get a visa but meanwhile
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:06.280]  if you're a constitutionalist they're they're putting on a fly list yeah that is it's so much
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:11.320]  powerful control over over we the people and i've said it for a long time it's a long chapter the
[1:27:11.320 --> 1:27:16.520]  first chapter in my book it's going to be the first chapter in volume two as well is and that
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:22.600]  was hiding in plain sight is the power of legal tender once they stole the the lawful money from
[1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:28.120]  us the circulating golden silver coin and began to counterfeit not only paper but the slug coins
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:33.880]  since 1965 then they can do anything as you will know rachel said give me the control of
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:40.520]  the nation's money supply and i don't care who makes its laws uh you're right this is a short
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:45.000]  segment a long segment's coming up i don't do pre-interviews normally pat there's so much to
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.480]  talk about what do you want to get to when we come back i mean there's just so much well the
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:55.560]  assassinations and the news media cover up section large section of my book is i covered very very
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:28:01.000]  well known cases you know the attempt on reagan jfk but what i have done here in everything
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:06.440]  they ever told me was a lie was was uh point out the fallacies and the government's official stories
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:12.200]  but also little details that are major details that were never reported and everyone who reached
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:17.480]  my book says holy smokes i didn't know what that was going on in that case and so i'll point out
[1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:21.960]  some of them to you in the next segment we'll do that what do you make of building seven on 9
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:26.360]  11 where there's video where they say get back we're blowing it up and the news goes the building
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.840]  is falling on its own footprint oh it's still up there it's coming down in a minute i mean it's
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:37.880]  just so obvious that was the bbc lady yeah no once again egg all over their faces i i believe
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:43.000]  that so many rumors are circulating it but the only one that makes sense to me uh you know without
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  proof i i believe that was the brains of the operation and juliana's office and the whole cia
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:54.040]  equipment and i think that's why they had to bring it down well i want to ask the cia and fp on all
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:58.040]  these guys something i mean you guys know the government's bringing in the drugs you guys
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:02.840]  know the government's behind white slavery little kids uh do you really want to be signed on to this
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:07.720]  i mean come on it's it's it's out in the open now the government's evil and uh you're destroying
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:12.120]  your own future i mean i just don't get it i mean the type of tyranny they're bringing in pat shannon
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:17.320]  is so hot this is not just some corruption they're going to get away with this thing is all or nothing
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:22.760]  once again the power of legal tender you see those guys that got six figure incomes now elix
[1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:28.920]  plus great retirements uh that's an easy way to sway a guy to uh not so much come out and blatantly
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:35.000]  lie but just tell a little white lies and and ignore the real facts so they got the guys wearing wine
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.640]  hats that just go along with the evil with brigades of black hat operatives within every agency
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:43.720]  uh yeah and you know what the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:48.360]  i i just covered that in Oklahoma city bombing right there exactly that's why we found out the feds

[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:39.240]  one day out of the year in the last five years we've never raised more than $500,000 and it's a
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:44.360]  lot of small donations we want to thank everybody i went to barton springs to swim swim some laps
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:50.360]  uh saturday after the 48 hour broadcast uh because i had such a headache i thought that
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:54.440]  would get rid of my headache and by the way it did and i ran into one of the lifeguards who
[1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:59.320]  brought a bought a pro pure water filter discounted at info wars store dot com as part of the money
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:03.560]  bomb uh and just was humbling to you know actually run into somebody who donated plus they got a
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:10.120]  great water filter discounted prices win-win so if you go to info wars money bomb dot com
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:16.040]  you can see some of the top featured interviews we did uh with so many amazing people like gerald
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:24.520]  salante and george norrie uh and many many others joel scowzen david eich uh it is all up there
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:31.240]  max keiser at info wars money bomb dot com we also i mean it was 48 hours we ended up going
[1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:37.560]  about 46 hours uh james wesley rahl's very powerful interview we did as well uh and then
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:44.200]  there's a link to all the interviews 40 plus hours of them uh up there at uh info wars dot
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:47.800]  com you can link through to our official youtube channel and it's all archived in higher res
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:53.800]  quality at prism planet dot tv so again uh this is going to let us get the uplinks now i'm just
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:58.680]  going to decide which ones to get to hit different parts of the world to budget that out uh the
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:03.240]  different file sharing systems to get on local tv stations around the country because most tv picks
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:09.640]  you up off of these big file sharing systems uh they're very expensive to subscribe to so i mean
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:15.560]  it is a lost leader to get the word out but it will expand the audience so we can have a few sponsors
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:20.920]  and we're kind of a hybrid for tv where we don't have no zero ads but we have you know some ads
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:26.200]  and so i'm having to codify all that after a few years beta testing and we are just rushing forward
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:30.440]  five years ago we would reach um about three million people a week now it's 15 million a week
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:36.200]  uh just amazing uh so again all of you great job you're not behind us you're right beside us
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:41.560]  in this fight and 100 of the money from the money bomb will go towards the infrastructure
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:45.640]  and equipment and the satellite uplink so again thank you so much you've seen the expansion we've
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:51.160]  done with the last four it's just given us that extra you know money to really well plant seeds
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:55.560]  and preachers call it seed money well that's what it is okay uh let's go ahead and go back
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:02.040]  to pat shannon pat again now you've got the floor take it away with this page turner book
[1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:06.040]  everything they ever told me uh was a lie let's just run through some of it
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:12.680]  Reagan's an interesting one uh but but you're also at the money power go go ahead before i do
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:19.560]  let me let me say to your audience that i recently uncovered your interview maybe four or five years
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:25.320]  ago that 90 minute interview with Aaron Russo and speaking of people who are half asleep or half away
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:29.640]  that is about the greatest thing you anyone could ever look at i want to commend you and
[1:37:29.640 --> 1:37:34.280]  Aaron and i were friends i shot pool with him and his boys in his basement in his Beverly Hills
[1:37:34.280 --> 1:37:40.840]  home back in the 80s uh he and i went way back and but but that guy i watched him grow i watched
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:46.920]  him grow in truth and uh i i just want to tell your audience to tune in at cost or nothing just
[1:37:46.920 --> 1:37:51.160]  pull him up to the prison planet tv and have a look at it it's dynamite yeah it's up there in
[1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:58.280]  high res on prison planet dot tv but um it's called reflections and warnings it's it's almost two hours
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:05.320]  long and uh i went down there and uh his wife was really sweet because he could barely walk at the
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:10.360]  time and was in excruciating pain had been fighting cancer for like four years at the time he ended
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:15.880]  up living another year or not quite a year and i mean that guy was just unbelievably tough i don't
[1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:21.560]  want to get into all of it but uh but uh he sat there you know at the table for two hours being
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:26.440]  interviewed by me uh and was just you know in excruciating pain the whole time i don't in the
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:31.240]  point is he was a great guy but he and i think that's why that interview is so good and there's
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:35.080]  a little clip at the restaurant i'll never forget last time i saw him personally you know we went to
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:42.520]  a restaurant uh and uh he got out the car pulled up he got in it and he gave me a hug and i could
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:46.680]  tell by the way he was acting he knew he was going to be going over the mountain uh but uh
[1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:50.840]  absolutely pretty pretty powerful in fact speak some more about erin rusa if you'd like
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:57.640]  well erin and i first met back in the late eighties when uh a tupper sauce he was on the
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:04.840]  lamb and traveling under a false name and i was his tupper's window to uh to the society back then
[1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:10.680]  and uh ended up going to dinner with this i didn't even know i didn't know anything about erin's
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:17.640]  reputation and and uh movie making and i learned all about it that evening also a little known fact
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:26.920]  is that uh he was a long time uh uh live in with uh with a movie star that everyone would know and i
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:31.320]  i probably shouldn't mention this on the tube but most people if they knew erin's history at all
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:38.360]  would know whom i'm talking about and and she uh and it's not a sacred vet meddler and and and
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:43.960]  then on top of that he was also the guy that originally got led zeppelin over here so yeah
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:51.480]  yep well what what i was going to tell was a secret but now i can't but anyhow uh yeah he
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:57.480]  he took that to bet to hollywood and uh they later uh split up for for some reason i don't think
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:01.080]  that's a secret bro that's that's i think that was even like in his obituary i guess it wasn't
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:04.360]  widely known but the internet now everything's widely known no i mean he produced the big play
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:09.640]  that got her uh into stuff yeah uh he also invented uh invented a lot of other stuff
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:14.360]  very interesting fellow certainly an evil person that built it what did you make of uh
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:20.920]  what did you make of uh obama saying you didn't build that and talking down entrepreneurs that's
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:28.360]  pretty amazing yeah the uh the the best retort and and i'm i'm not fond of any of these candidates
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:36.280]  this this this season never am but uh if you haven't seen the talk that mit romney did last
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:41.720]  thursday night at that al smith dinner you must pull it up it's one of the best political speeches
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:47.080]  comedy things like i mean he has some terrific comedy writers and i uh if you haven't seen
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:51.560]  that speech you gotta you gotta pull up and listen to it it's dynamite it's a rib rocker
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:59.560]  uh anyway uh you you asked me uh about the uh about the book and we're talking about the fbi
[1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:05.080]  and all and more and more over the years i've grown to see how my suspicions and yours and many others
[1:41:05.880 --> 1:41:12.280]  in the past have come to be true with the the way that uh the government frames people even
[1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:18.520]  you'll goes right into the courts and in fbi ages lying under oath i saw covering so many federal
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:25.160]  trials over the years i i saw that uh over and over but you know proving it is something else
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:29.560]  and very few people would have the facts of what's not being an investigator which now
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:34.680]  been proven in this case out of round rock in georgetown where they uh where the kids said hey
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:39.720]  daddy wasn't home another man killed mommy and they had the dna and you know evidence and all
[1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:47.400]  sorts of stuff and knowingly knowingly sent to god a prison for fun i mean and you read about
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:51.960]  stuff like that it'd be one thing to set up a five-time ex-con or something that'd be a moral
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:57.640]  and wrong but when they send innocent family men business owners with no criminal record to jail
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:04.840]  and know they're innocent i mean it's just create it's downright evil it is and and i are in the
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:10.280]  in the section on the who killed robert kennedy uh in my book i i point that out that herbert
[1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:16.600]  herbert mcdonnell was a director of a laboratory of forensic science and he was quoted saying that
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:21.880]  the revolver taken from sir han considering all the physical factors could not have been the one
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:27.320]  that fired the projectile removed from bobby kennedy well we come on down to the trial elix
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:34.840]  and here they have their high ranking criminologist uh this is uh by the way on page 224 uh sits on
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:40.920]  the witness stand and under oath says that the serial number of the 22 revolver that killed
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:50.200]  kennedy was h 18602 and yet the recorded number of the weapon carried by sir han was h 53725
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:58.040]  and i asked for separate criminal attorneys defense attorneys i said is there any way that
[1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:04.600]  could have gotten by uh a defense counsel he said no way we all of them said to a degree no way we
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:10.680]  would have had the numbers in front of us on the on the table and it was just a phony charade and
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:16.760]  so what i'm saying elix is this high powered attorney a grant cooper in in california the time
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:21.320]  had to have been paid off to lose the case and even sir han tried to fire him and then the
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:27.000]  judge wouldn't let him so the whole thing was controlled from the beginning you're right and
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:33.400]  that case i mentioned earlier was the michael morton uh case where again they were just all in on
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:39.720]  sitting innocent got a jail and over the decades knew it and uh just just just you know reportedly
[1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:47.640]  didn't even care former prosecutor ken anderson faces charges uh that's now uh coming out and it's
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:51.720]  just so well williamson county north of us is really a wicked place because you got all these
[1:43:51.720 --> 1:43:56.680]  bible belt folks that are real naive and you've got a really sinister one of the sinister group
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:03.240]  of police forces up there and prosecutors have ever seen uh you know it's strange how one county
[1:44:03.240 --> 1:44:07.400]  cannot be corrupt and the next county can be corrupt it just seems like the more naive the
[1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:12.600]  population a lot of times the more bible belty they are for the strange reason the more evil
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:17.480]  it can get because people are so naive have you seen that yeah and trust in trusting a government
[1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:22.200]  um monroe county tennessee it's going on right now you may remember reading over the past couple
[1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:28.600]  of years i i did a few articles on uh lieutenant commander wall fits patrick who tried to go after
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:35.080]  obama on the on the phony birth thing like three years ago one thing led to another he discovered
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:39.320]  all kinds of grand jury discrepancy the former of the grand jury had been sitting there for over
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:48.680]  20 years and yet the tennessee law says they can't sit more than one year uh the uh the the people that
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:57.160]  have have gone down uh like in in that case in monroe county of darin huff was uh has gone to
[1:44:57.160 --> 1:45:01.880]  federal prison for four years for a crime that was never didn't ever even happen and i covered that
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:09.880]  trial up in noxville it's uh just one more false prosecution because they were able to mail a
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:16.360]  monogun charge that was made up and here he was licensed but uh it goes on like the divideans
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:22.200]  they were found not guilty of murder but found guilty using guns in the commission of murder
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:25.880]  and even when the supreme court after they've been in jail what like seven years because i
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:32.360]  went and covered it said release them the federal prison didn't i mean it's just lawlessness and the
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:37.320]  more innocent you are the more they want to throw you in prison and you know that's coming out with
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:42.360]  the dna and all this it's really weird yeah well Leonard peltier you know that goes back to the
[1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:47.320]  one today you mentioned earlier uh those two fbi agents who died there was never any proof that
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:56.360]  Leonard did it he was a convenient patsy amazing they just grab whoever they want i guess to get uh
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:02.120]  a collar or whatever yeah i'm working on this i'm still working on this west memphis story jerry
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:10.200]  and joe kane uh that begins to stink more and more um with the situation where the i have a copy of
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:16.440]  of the autopsies and uh these guys these guys were shot with automatic weapons
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:21.720]  alex will break down that story for those that may not know recap that well they were traveling
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:28.120]  from las vegas back home to florida and i 40 coming in uh to west memphis uh from little rock
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:36.920]  and uh the official story says that they uh were pulled off in a traffic stop and uh
[1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:45.880]  the son uh joe kane was 16 and jerry was 46 or so explain who they were and why this is important
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:51.080]  well they were told they were exposing the money situation and and they were doing seminars around
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:56.680]  the country on on the fraud in the fed and that's that's how on ground that you and i must not step
[1:46:56.680 --> 1:47:04.040]  on yet we do it all the time and uh so jerry kane the father was was driving and allegedly was pulled
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:11.560]  over on a traffic stop however when uh uh the son jumps out and they show a video but not to 48 days
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:18.280]  later of the son doing of shooting and killing his cops he's got uh uh ar 15 or ak 47 but it's
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:25.400]  semi-automatic and so that's my point here uh and then i'm imagining if you had if you had killed
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:31.160]  a couple of cops would you hang around a town like west memphis arkansas for the next 90 minutes
[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:38.920]  i wouldn't and yet one exit down 90 minutes later jerry and joe kane were surrounded and
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:43.880]  shot up and killed in the walmart parking lot only one exit from this other one uh where the
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:50.920]  cops were killed anyway it's as far too difficult and complex to go in on this short time we have
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:56.920]  left but what it boils down to is those those men were killed with automatic weapons and and i i
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:01.160]  don't know who did it but i i did the angle the ballistics everything showed it could not have
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:07.960]  been joe kane from the video that they trumped up and showed us some 48 days later so but once again
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:11.880]  these are the sorts of things give that story by the way will be in volume too of everything they're
[1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:17.800]  filming us alive let's look at oklahoma city uh they're now talking about domestic groups are
[1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:22.440]  going to strike homeland security's not for al-qaeda it's for the american people we knew that was
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:28.280]  always where this was headed uh but i mean oklahoma city i mean in the two minutes we've got before
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:33.400]  you're to break what do listeners need to know about that event well most people don't remember
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:37.560]  the basics because once again we're talking about 17 years ago but the basics were as
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:42.760]  general parton and i always said if the fbi and the courts really wanted the truth and what had
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:47.640]  happened at oklahoma city with the blasts and they would have called general parton to the stand
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:53.240]  who showed that the charges were inside the building he showed which columns they were at and
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:58.840]  and he first spotted this sitting in his home in virginia looking at nothing more than time in news
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:04.360]  week magazine looking at the pictures and he tells his wife bologna this no truck bomb did this
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:10.840]  this and so general parton came to oklahoma and we met him and and uh he began to look at the fire
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:16.840]  department's hundreds of other pictures and found at least four spots where the charges uh
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:23.560]  were set inside the building and strategically right above the nursery that's so it was designed
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:28.520]  to murder children and because they found out that what they had pulled in new york back in seven
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:34.600]  and ninety three just just did not seem to us from the heartstrings of america the way they
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:39.560]  wanted to so they had to kill some innocent children and this is you know this is the hardest
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:45.480]  thing as you mentioned for christian america to understand and believe that what what these dogs
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:52.840]  were stooped to but we know the government admits to tens of thousands of people exposed to sarin
[1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:58.040]  nerve gas radiation you name it when they admit to in the department of energy killing thousands
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:02.840]  of foster children in radiation experiments and shooting black men up with syphilis when everybody
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:09.160]  knows about that stuff so what you'll fry little kids to death but you won't blow them up at the
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:14.360]  alfred p mara building to get control i mean i mean it's a no brainer that's right that's it's
[1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:23.480]  very obvious so anyway uh the the oklahoma city thing was an atrocity i've spent more time out
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:29.560]  there as much as any reporter i guess on the case and uh you know interviewed people who were actual
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:35.320]  victims uh as well as investigators hoppy heidelberg was became one of my closest friends over the last
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:40.760]  decade uh he just died this year i'm so to russle means we're gonna come right back with pat shannon
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:45.080]  your phone calls everything they ever told me was a lie then we're gonna ask pat where he sees
[1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:50.520]  america going are we are we waking people up or are we starting to win or are we just waking up the
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:55.800]  fact we're total slaves run by psycho killers and uh you know how bad will it get i mean i guess the
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:51:03.960]  sky is the limit i'm alex jones stay with us the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first

[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:13.880]  correct he was reagan's first and and this is quoted from cia director william kasey's first

[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:46.680]  my email but i couldn't get back had a lot of disabled that problems uh medically but i'll get
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:51.160]  back to you i want to ask you what's your opinion on the october supplies do you think they're
[2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:57.080]  going to pull anything with poops or the games like they've been training for 30 years i'm i'm
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:01.480]  thinking they may have already pulled it out i'm reading of some interesting stuff and it's about
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:07.640]  the only scenario that makes sense to me is uh what happened in libya was actually a kidnapping
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:14.120]  planned by obama and that went bad and if if this is true then that might have well been
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:19.560]  his october surprise well you know there's so many angles yeah and that's one of them i've looked at
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:24.840]  is kidnapped the guy al qaeda's who they put in at work people ended up fighting back too much
[2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:29.480]  they get killed uh so that's why they were dragging him around and then and then they were going to
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:37.080]  have like a hostage crisis like in 1979 1980 but then obama would have had had them give him back
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:43.240]  he could say see i did a good job yeah i'd have been the hero what about all this talk there could
[2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:53.240]  be riots if obama doesn't win well i think that they would be quelled quickly uh in that the most
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:02:57.480]  of those doing that would of course would be the black regiments around the country and they just
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:02.440]  don't have the they don't have the firepower i think to go very far with very very many riots
[2:03:02.440 --> 2:03:07.160]  oh sure we would see some buildings burned down but i don't think there would be a mass war
[2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:12.920]  let's go race war let's go ahead and take another call from ventz in california go ahead ventz
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:18.440]  hey good morning you guys alex love your show been listening for five years and pat i've been

[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:28.920]  kind of tie together one alex you've had alex on your show many times and he's got a colleague
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:35.800]  named roger sales s a y l e s who talks about the way the feds get us under their jurisdiction
[2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:41.640]  as we volunteer for it by saying we're united states citizens and you know i know about all that
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:47.880]  stuff here's the deal the globalists do whatever they want their lawless criminals it's true when
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:51.640]  you contract with them it robes you more and more and it's good to get out of the system
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:55.800]  as much as you can but i'm telling you they don't even follow the bill of rights and constitution
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:04:02.600]  they have the nsa illegally spying on us uh and so the all this patriot mythology stuff and i'm not
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:07.240]  saying he's doing that but so much of it leads to a dead end that's why i don't promote it let's
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:13.720]  let me get a quick take here from pat shannon on that oh i i have to agree regardless of how many
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.360]  of these things are lawfully correct when you're up against the tyrannical government it makes no
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:23.880]  difference yeah i mean that's the deal folks they they go and for a year and a half try to get
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:29.080]  amish to sell the neighbor milk and they do an undercover sting to act like it's illegal when
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:34.120]  it's not even illegal to trick the jury into convicting him for another statute and and the
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:39.480]  feds knew it wasn't illegal i mean these are people that love to hurt good people uh pat shannon

[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:48.680]  civils pedophile pals are hunted that's out of the sun victims of twisted jimmy civille are
[2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:52.920]  believed to have told police that more than a hundred other pedophiles were involved in the
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:57.960]  attacks this is just like penn state folks he was just a procurer this is a guy that hangs out with
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:04.120]  the royal family cops investigating the disgrace bbc dj and tv presenter have understood to have
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:09.720]  been given names and descriptions of the men last night is forced all the sun the scale of what has
[2:09:09.720 --> 2:09:16.200]  gone on is unbelievable it must be more likely that among these names will be some very well-known
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:20.600]  people indeed this is all coming out now because england's they're trying to bring it into the
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:26.200]  euro so they're getting ready to blow out all their networks more than 200 people now say they were
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:34.600]  molested by civille and his cronies uh met commander peter spindler heading an investigation which is
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:39.640]  more than 400 separate lines of inquiry to the public's response has been astounding last night
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:44.920]  he said we don't want to get into numbers game but the vast majority of the allegations we had
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:50.520]  a reporter on last week about this we said to be huge uh related to civille and a bunch of other
[2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:55.800]  big high-powered people rumors about jimmy civille circulated among broadcasters for years
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:59.880]  and we had a bbc broadcaster on talk about it heard about the 90s but were thought too dark to be
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:09.160]  true tv's uh emin on homes said yesterday uh he said that one even suggested civille was necrophilic
[2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:13.480]  yeah that's what came out he added that was so ridiculously outrageous you could never believe
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:19.720]  it the father of four added you could look at jimmy civille as eccentric you could look upon him
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:27.320]  as something out of a horror movie tycoon william gov 65 feared to abuse 3500 boys to abuse them
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:34.920]  died of natural causes in a uh albany jail in the isle of white yesterday and folks if you look
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:41.800]  at photos of jimmy civille he looks just like just his demonic and textbook crazy pervert type
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:48.280]  as sandusky looked i mean and again it's networks of these people that use government
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:54.040]  and use media as their power networks and it shows how power corrupts an absolute power
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:11:04.120]  corrupts absolutely okay now uh continuing uh here ladies and gentlemen with some of the economic
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:12.280]  news that we're going to go to our guest grease austerity diet risk 1930 style depression and
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:18.920]  and that's out of bloomberg but we had the uh former world bank chief economist joseph stick
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:25.080]  let's say last week it's already a depression but our media says it's not uh continuing um
[2:11:25.080 --> 2:11:30.600]  with other economic news obama care mandate anyone who works 30 hours a week is now full time
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:34.920]  and you've got to supposedly get them health care so everybody then goes to 20 hours or
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:43.400]  you just lay people off uh merkel to warn uk on europe budget veto chinese gold imports through
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:49.640]  august surpass total ecb holdings european central bank holdings imports from australia search
[2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:56.360]  900 government storage soros you name it they're all buying gold uh so that's just some of the
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:12:03.560]  economic news we have the presidential debate on foreign policy coming up tonight and uh there's
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:07.960]  very little difference between these two and who their advisors are uh so we're going to be
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:12.280]  getting into more of that but don't worry in most polls mint romney has pulled ahead but
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:17.400]  there's electronic voting fraud but even if he ended up getting in he's again controlled by the very
[2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:25.720]  same crony capitalist apparatus and of course the hill also reports the un to monitor us elections
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:32.760]  but not for electronic voting fraud the big kahuna but for uh but for retail type stuff
[2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:38.680]  that people try to stop the grassroots fraud of course lou rockwell uh head of the bon mis
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:47.000]  institute and he is also former chief of staff for ron paul blue rockwell dot com syndicated
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:52.120]  columnist he can speak to all of these things i want to cover a laundry list with lou rockwell
[2:12:52.120 --> 2:12:58.360]  who's kind enough to come on with us today uh lose so much going on i mean obviously uh you're
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:03.800]  not a fan of romney or obama but do you have any views on how either one of these guys and the power
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:09.960]  structures uh behind them i mean i mean really different arms of the same ogre but i mean i
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:14.760]  understand you've divorced yourself from this corrupt system never been part of it but i mean
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:19.880]  if you had to take one of these poisons uh would you have a flavor that would be less nauseous
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:24.600]  no i don't i don't think so alex i mean it seems to me that for example romney
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:29.480]  uh is just slightly more of a war longer than obama now it's difficult to be more of a war
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:35.960]  longer than obama but i think he's i think he's slightly more likely to uh nuke iran which is
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:40.680]  what some people want him to do um and commit other kinds of war crimes on the other hand
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:46.040]  of course obama has not ended the war in iraq it's still going on with with a vast number of
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:51.320]  us mercenaries there and still troops and of course all these these vast occupation embassies
[2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:56.040]  and consulates all over the country full of spies and troops uh that's still going on the of course
[2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:02.280]  the afghanistan war was going on obama bombed libya uh he's he's um bringing about the destruction
[2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:08.520]  of syria that's all a u.s uh turkey israeli british french operation in syria this is not
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:14.440]  this shouldn't just happen but i think i think romney is you know is likely to be worse um is
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:19.640]  obama slightly worse on economics i don't know i mean the government grows just as fast under the
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:25.080]  republicans as it does under the democrats may be faster sometimes under the republicans as under
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:32.440]  george w bush uh course obama's worse than bush will obama two be worse than obama one will
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:39.160]  romney be worse than obama one i would say yes so i'm you know you can't all you can do when
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:43.800]  you're faced with the choice of these two evils is just you know don't participate don't don't
[2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:50.280]  take either flavor of the poison um abstain from the poison don't vote and then you have
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:56.920]  no responsibility for what these creeps are going to do to us so i get your point uh buying into the
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:03.560]  whole two-party uh one-body dictatorship almost lends credibility to it uh but but i do think
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:10.440]  locally where you have eight percent turnout nationwide people should go get into sabotage
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:16.200]  you know the the bureaucrats to expose corruption to kind of do what ron paul has done and act as a
[2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:21.720]  watchdog well i think ron paul of course is is an exception i mean here's a man who uh i tell you
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:25.720]  why he's an exception and not only does he have the right principles which of course is essential
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:31.240]  but he's not power mad he's not power hungry he doesn't actually want to run anybody else's life
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:35.320]  so that sets him apart from all these creeps in washington all the creeps who want to go to
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:40.600]  washington presidents and all the and and all you know it's in town councilmen and mayors too
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:45.880]  they're all like this they all want to run other people's lives so if we uh so that you know run
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:51.480]  run ron paul's different whether you know voting i mean as you know i'm a skeptic about voting
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:57.800]  unless unless the elections decided by one vote your vote doesn't count now why why to go to the
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:03.080]  trouble go to some horrible socialist public school or some kami church or whatever they hold
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:07.480]  these voting you know they have the voting machines that and as you say you can't believe the results
[2:16:07.480 --> 2:16:13.400]  anyway we know there's electronic hacking we know that there's an old-fashioned vote stealing
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:17.880]  you know mayor didn't start or end with mayor daily i mean this is the normal thing in american
[2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:23.720]  politics as it is every place well let me bring this up to you don't do it this is the important
[2:16:23.720 --> 2:16:29.400]  question i have in this area for you undoubtedly there are cycles in history and we are entering a
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:34.760]  very very decadent cycle disagree with me if you don't think that's the case and and and i
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:41.320]  am now seeing things that even i can't believe i mean we get new footage every few days of police
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:46.360]  telling quadriplegics to walk and then beating them when they don't and then the police department
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:50.920]  says well you should have followed the order or we see a teacher uploads pictures of her breath to
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:56.520]  the to the class computer the kids get expelled uh we see the tsa now at highway checkpoints
[2:16:56.520 --> 2:17:03.640]  groping people uh we see uh an article at lou rockwell dot com right here why you need a passport
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:08.680]  now saying they'll just deny anybody a passport they want for no reason and then that dovetails
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:13.160]  the wall street journal admitting there's not even a law but they're not letting americans
[2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:19.000]  who have after tax money and can prove it to leave with any money again i was told about
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:23.080]  some very wealthy people a few years ago that they had to get out now that was coming here's
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:28.600]  the associated press a guy was a prepper they looked at his website he was flying out of hawaii
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:33.000]  to see his wife in japan they wouldn't let him fly no judge no jury they've said they're going to
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:38.920]  put you on the no gun by list two that's ap we have you know all of these reports where they're
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:44.040]  where the irs wanted a law this year where they say you haven't paid taxes no judge no jury then
[2:17:44.040 --> 2:17:48.600]  you can't leave the country or they say you can't come back in and now they're just saying they're
[2:17:48.600 --> 2:17:55.080]  going to do it as a bureaucracy for homeland security without a law that's fox news senators
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:59.800]  say if you leave the country with money even legally you can't come back that's abc news so i'm
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:05.320]  showing these is this not the ultimate sign of an authoritarian takeover win in every case in
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:11.960]  history they put capital controls on i mean this this is the final cherry on top alex you know you've
[2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:17.400]  been fighting this stuff for years i have to uh the speed of it is is uh i must say slightly
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:21.720]  astounding as you're as you're pointing out but yeah they do the capital controls they want to
[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:26.360]  prevent you from taking your money out of the country and this is your own earnestly own money
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:31.720]  or earn money money you've paid taxes on you've been already looted on and you know it began
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:36.760]  when you could no longer take um money of more than ten thousand dollars with you out of the
[2:18:36.760 --> 2:18:41.960]  country on an airplane that was some years ago and uh you know they want to crack down now they're
[2:18:41.960 --> 2:18:46.600]  confiscating people's money with less than ten thousand if they uh if they have it on their
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:51.640]  person that's what the tsa is they're even taking a thousand they're even taking five or six silver
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:57.560]  coins and they put it on the news today two thousand was found and the guy apologizes and they take it
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:02.600]  that's right and then you have to appeal to get it back and good luck to you because of course the
[2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:07.080]  government takes this sort of thing it's the local police as well these are crazy robbers we've now
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:11.800]  arrived at total tyranny except for shutting down the media and now they're talking about that well
[2:19:11.800 --> 2:19:17.160]  as mary rothbart said you always think about the government as a gang of thieves writ large
[2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:20.680]  and if you think about the government that way then actually none of this stuff surprises you
[2:19:21.480 --> 2:19:25.640]  what's happened i mean every government sort of has the ambition to be a totalitarian state that
[2:19:25.640 --> 2:19:30.040]  all like to be nazis or communists if they could get away with it but public pressure prevents
[2:19:30.040 --> 2:19:35.880]  them from doing so but ever since 9 11 and this whole unlimited forever war on terror where there's
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:41.800]  an incorporeal enemy i mean is not that the enemy doesn't even is just as an idea giving them you
[2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:48.680]  know permanent authority to to run our lives control us take our money feel us up do everything
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:53.800]  they want to us isn't there once that's arrived yes it's you're right we're headed we're already
[2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:58.680]  an authoritarian state we're headed towards a totalitarian state isn't this really a will
[2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:03.560]  to power because we've had corrupt elites before but they like due process to protect themselves
[2:20:03.560 --> 2:20:11.640]  hollywood selling all these anti-liberty anti-family messages anti god the police are are held up if
[2:20:11.640 --> 2:20:16.920]  they're more brutal i mean doesn't the power structure realize that they're building a system
[2:20:16.920 --> 2:20:23.480]  that will end up being used against them i mean it seems like a will to power madness an orgy of
[2:20:23.480 --> 2:20:31.880]  control freak nobodies just just just going towards this bloodbath alex you're exactly right it's
[2:20:31.880 --> 2:20:37.480]  like the ancient fable of the scorpion and the frog you know the scorpion encourages the frog
[2:20:37.480 --> 2:20:41.640]  to take him across the stream and the frogs afraid he's going to hurt me says no i won't hurt you
[2:20:41.640 --> 2:20:45.400]  after all it would hurt me too so they get out in the middle of the stream this the scorpion
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:49.480]  stings the frog and he's drowning and they're both going to drown he says why why did you do it
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:55.240]  and he says well it's my nature well it's then it's the nature of the people who go into politics
[2:20:55.240 --> 2:21:00.280]  who are members of the power elite who want nothing more than to rule other people uh
[2:21:00.280 --> 2:21:04.440]  they're concerned what they want is power that's the they can get money they can get other things
[2:21:04.440 --> 2:21:09.800]  when they have the power they want the power they're desperate for the power they're demonic i mean
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:15.320]  they're they're criminals and um they feel that they've got they've got right now they feel they're
[2:21:15.320 --> 2:21:19.320]  making this move it's not only of course in the united states it's in in europe it's all over the
[2:21:19.320 --> 2:21:25.480]  world where these people are making a move for a world totalitarian state and um you know it's
[2:21:25.480 --> 2:21:30.520]  it's happening right before our eyes and you say the news is quite extraordinary but i think also
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:35.720]  more and more people are waking up you're helping wake up people uh more and more people are waking
[2:21:35.720 --> 2:21:40.360]  up so it's it's the constant struggle that's always existed throughout of all of human history
[2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:47.160]  between power and market between liberty and and and government so sometimes the government gets
[2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:51.960]  ahead and they have what they wanted nature in Egypt where the the pharaoh the government was
[2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:56.280]  actually god which is what they what they really would like they would actually like us to worship
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:22:02.680]  them as as as gods so but sometimes liberty gets ahead too so this is a constant battle going back
[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:09.400]  and forth right now is no question power has been uh in the ascendancy like i haven't seen in our
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:15.880]  worldwide basis in my certainly in my lifetime um but the people are fighting back more and more
[2:22:15.880 --> 2:22:20.360]  people are learning uh that's the key you have to learn about what's going on you can't just turn
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:25.080]  your head you can't ignore it you can't avert your eyes that's uh that's giving power to all the
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:29.880]  evil forces in the world so uh we have to be involved first of all we have to learn what's
[2:22:29.880 --> 2:22:36.760]  going on it's why your program is so valuable of course there are a lot of people out there that
[2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:41.880]  do feel helpless but you talk about market power which is really the individual voting with one
[2:22:41.880 --> 2:22:46.600]  of the few things we've got left to vote with that's why the system craves these controlled markets
[2:22:46.600 --> 2:22:51.880]  Michelle Obama telling us what we can eat 15 years ago 20 years ago you couldn't find organic food
[2:22:51.880 --> 2:22:56.920]  on store shelves people were willing to pay for it so it created a market now they're trying to
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:02.840]  come in with fraudulent organic but that's going to happen slavery in 1860 most people were you know
[2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:09.080]  either for it or tacitly supported it uh 65 years later uh you know it was outlawed or
[2:23:09.080 --> 2:23:14.920]  67 years later it was outlawed um marijuana laws you know 30 40 years ago they'd give you life
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:22.040]  in prison in places like texas uh if you had one marijuana cigarette uh now uh you know the police
[2:23:22.040 --> 2:23:25.640]  themselves know it's a fraud so they catch somebody whether they just let them go because
[2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:31.800]  they know it's a joke uh there's so many hundreds of examples of where people just stop complying
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:38.280]  and get it and understand that that what's going on is wrong and that self-preservation for everybody
[2:23:38.280 --> 2:23:44.280]  means that we all start even people in the system just dragging our feet not going along with it
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:51.240]  saying no to the tsa uh saying no to new taxes saying no to new bureaucracies getting in the face
[2:23:51.800 --> 2:23:57.800]  of the nanny state i mean what can you say about voting with our dollars and the power
[2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:01.960]  people have if they will simply vote with their dollars and some examples of that
[2:24:01.960 --> 2:24:06.760]  well also we should vote with our literal dollars we should always to the extent we can always use
[2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:12.600]  cash get cash out of the bank and that hurts the banks by the way get your cash out of the banks
[2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:18.440]  and spend it they hate it uh but it's something that really harms the whole banking federal reserve
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:23.080]  oh i've tried to get a thousand dollars out of that like i'm a criminal they won't take fifties
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:28.440]  now at major stores no it's a we've tried to get a thousand it's absolutely true i recommend it to
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:32.840]  everybody when you want to get a thousand dollars out of your own money out of the bank um you're
[2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:38.840]  a bank robber i mean they they hate you so there's proof by the way you should be doing it uh so yeah
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:43.160]  and we can just look at this medium that we're we're talking on right now the internet i mean
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:47.400]  there's no doubt in in anybody's mind if the government had known what the internet was going
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:51.560]  to be they would have outlawed it and of course right now they were talking about it senator
[2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:55.560]  Rockefeller said that a few years ago in the senate well and hillary clinton said there should
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:25:01.160]  be government gatekeepers uh just decide who can get on the internet and so forth but the internet
[2:25:01.160 --> 2:25:04.600]  outran the government because the one thing we always have to remember about government
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:10.360]  it's a very stupid institution i think of it as like a huge blind dog it's got vicious teeth
[2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:15.880]  if one of the pause steps on you you're dead uh so it's very very dangerous but it's a stupid
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:22.360]  operation uh and it's possible to outrun it the market outruns it all the time and uh the internet
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:25.960]  is doing it so they're trying to hinder the internet they're doing many things but the internet
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:30.520]  people in the millions and millions hundreds of millions of people involved in the internet at
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:36.680]  one level or another are fighting back and i was delighted to see that kim dot com the great uh
[2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:42.120]  internet entrepreneur in new zealand who was arrested by a swat team and now has been released
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:47.560]  because he lives in new zealand a freer country than this one is going to come out with a new
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:53.080]  version of his mega upload site and that's driving the u.s crazy i also noticed that britain for
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:58.440]  example there's been a poor kid with asperger's that the u.s has been trying to to extradite from
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:04.600]  britain for 10 years they want to put him in one of these federal um high security uh solitary
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:09.080]  prisons for the rest of his life for the crime of having gone and looking for you information on
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:14.360]  ufo's and the nasa computers and of course actually for the crime of showing them up and
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:19.880]  showing that they had and i've heard him interviewed uh and he obviously is uh you know kind of an
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:26.520]  idiot savant autistic i mean are we going to put the rain man in jail uh honestly god bless his
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:30.680]  mother you know his mother is the one who's fought for him all these years and really is
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:36.120]  responsible for the fact that even the cameron government which is a tool of the u.s finally
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:39.960]  refused to extradite him they're not going to allow him to be extradited so there are good
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:45.160]  things happening in the world as heroes like this kid's mother and uh all the people who are
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:49.480]  fighting for freedom on the internet and and in markets uh i always think you know i always
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:53.640]  hear people saying when somebody's been in the military thank you for your service well alex i
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:57.880]  thank you for your service i think all the business people for their service all the people on the
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:27:01.800]  internet all the people fighting for freedom they're the ones i want to thank for our for their
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:06.520]  service and that was my next question employed by the government by the way exactly what do you
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:11.800]  make of the incredible disconnect that obama would actually give a speech explaining how
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:17.400]  entrepreneurs didn't build it when anyone with half a brain knows entrepreneurs are the spark
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  of civilization well you know i sometimes think that obama is a boob as well as as well as a
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:29.400]  fascist socialist whatever is in his ideology i mean he's easy he just got away he said something
[2:27:29.400 --> 2:27:33.800]  had actually hurt himself uh he got away from him but that of course gave us a peek into his
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:38.520]  into his real view i don't believe by the way that romney's any different and romney uh
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:44.520]  may be smarter and more successful in private life than certainly obama ever was but uh
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:51.400]  romney's a fascist too so i don't believe that you know these guys uh the the power elite the
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:56.760]  oligarchs the plutocrats uh even though they hold vast business interests um they don't
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:01.560]  like new entrepreneurs either they do everything they can through tax policy other government
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:06.920]  regulations to crush the new entrepreneurs who would be competitors to them so uh this is the
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:11.720]  republic the republicans have this have this view too but i was glad obama said that because it
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:17.960]  revealed uh a piece of his of his mind and a piece of his heart to everybody who wants to see it
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:23.160]  well it also shows from every soviet or or fascistic model from nazi germany to later east
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:29.560]  germany to russia to china uh the the the true movie uh the lives of others where it shows
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:33.480]  these germans controlling what playwrights can write and if you want to be an actress you've
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:38.840]  got to have sex with the local police commandant that's what authoritarianism is is they get to
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:43.960]  then dominate the artists the thinkers they get to tell us we didn't build anything they get to
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:49.720]  tell us what they want they're obsessed with controlling the spark of truly dynamic humans
[2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:54.440]  that makes them so angry people that are really successful we're going to be successful because
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:29:00.360]  we have talent and energy and it's embarrassing to us to dominate someone we want to empower people
[2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:05.480]  we when will good people start standing up and crushing the control freak slugs but you know
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:10.840]  this is this is actually nothing new in the history of in the history of government cesar augustus
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:18.360]  you know paid um the best poets of his time virgil and horris and and uh livi and the historians
[2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:24.120]  to uh to write pro-government propaganda these are very talented people and and they did some very
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:30.200]  effective government propaganda so this is you know then and now but we have of course the
[2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:35.240]  u.s. government today forget cesar augustus or hitler or stalin or anything this is the biggest
[2:29:35.240 --> 2:29:39.320]  most powerful government in the history of the world so to get a hold of this government
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:45.400]  which has the uh which wants to be the world government um is a much more dangerous let's

[2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:17.960]  dot com and others uh lou you were starting to get to america wanting to be the world government
[2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:25.000]  and the mega banks that are in control of it uh wanting to be at the center of that power structure
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:31.240]  and this is the packs americana they're going forward with it uh and they are butchering every
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:37.880]  known form of liberty and then publicly using al qaeda and libya and syria and then hillary
[2:34:37.880 --> 2:34:42.200]  comes out and says two weeks ago we've got to invade syria with boots on the ground because
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:48.600]  they're with al qaeda and then oh i rand's with al qaeda when the west runs al qaeda and is funding
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:54.120]  them i mean and we've got to give our rights up because of al qaeda i mean it is so over the top
[2:34:55.560 --> 2:35:00.600]  that i don't even know what to say it's so crazy i mean i don't think i've ever seen government
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:06.280]  get into more of a delusional state where nothing even matches up but more and more i think that's
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:12.440]  part of the tactic to just get everybody used to this absurdist alice in wonderland tea party
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:17.720]  type deal i remember garard neemire who was a great political science professor in Notre Dame
[2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:23.160]  talking about in the in the soviet union what sort of an effect it had the official lies has
[2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:29.000]  an effect on people to keep hearing the truth of these lies promulgated as truth has it just
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  has a bad effect now in the soviet union they didn't have of course what we have in this country
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:37.720]  we still have a free media we still have free websites we still have free publications that
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:44.360]  that tell the truth but yeah they they they lie always assume they're lying by the way once in a
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:49.160]  while they tell the truth it's very very seldom look at as you say hillary the us has been training
[2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:54.920]  al qaeda in its turkish air force bases for a couple of years before they sent them into syria as
[2:35:54.920 --> 2:35:59.400]  the quote unquote rebels so these are guys from chechnya they're from various arab countries
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:05.640]  from north africa many of them are al qaeda which is of course and if we don't look at it as a
[2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:10.280]  group that was formed by the u.s. and the saudi is in a sum of inladenance over to fight the
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:17.720]  the russians in afghanistan it's it's a ideological tendency it's not an organization and there are
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:22.760]  some of these people who belong to that ideological tendency that sort of islamist tendency us has
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:28.040]  trained them arm them sent them in and continues to continues to arm them sent them into syria
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:33.880]  to overthrow the last secular arab government in in the arab world that would the one non islamist
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:39.160]  government now why is what why is the u.s. doing that well there are a number of reasons has to
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:43.080]  do with of course the empire they want to control all oil they want to control the entire middle
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:48.200]  east but they want to cause trouble i mean this is what the romans were open about when they said
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:53.800]  they to divide and conquer to cause conflict and then enable them to conquer and to rule
[2:36:53.800 --> 2:37:00.680]  so the u.s. loves it when al-qaeda gets active in quote unquote al-qaeda active in libya or in syria
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:05.320]  or whatever they want trouble they want to break up all these countries they want to destroy them
[2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:11.400]  and so the u.s. and its allies can can rule but it's so weird from getting to anybody they don't
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.640]  want it to get to exactly it's so weird to hear that you know my wife needs to be drug off to a
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:20.840]  private room to be grabbed on by somebody or my kids do or out in the oak because al-qaeda
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:26.600]  and i'm i've just gotten the point with the tsa i'm gonna make you know it known that i know this
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:31.320]  is all the hoax and now tsa agents come out and say we're all stealing i stole a million in one
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:37.320]  year i mean it's just like it's because who would want a job dominating and yelling at people all
[2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:41.960]  day well there of course there are people like that and they go into government and they rise
[2:37:41.960 --> 2:37:46.200]  to the top they're people who like torturing other people they're like people who imprisoning
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:51.160]  other people they're people who like beating up their people who like dominating and uh
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:57.000]  and and ruling so this is yeah this is the government so it's why we want the smallest
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:01.720]  government possible we want the least intrusive government possible because these are bad people
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:06.760]  these are not public servants i'm not talking about every school teacher or postman obviously there
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:10.600]  are decent people who work for the government for the people who rise within the government
[2:38:10.600 --> 2:38:15.960]  the people who get to be jan and apolitano or whatever these people are a hundred percent evil
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:21.000]  a hundred percent so uh if you don't want more of that kind of stuff and of course this business
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:25.640]  of the philip and the airports has nothing to do with quote unquote security it has to do with
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:32.600]  making you humiliated making you a bay so that they can do anything to you your wife your children
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:38.120]  anything and you have to like it and smile at them and say yes sir that's the purpose of that
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:41.640]  and of course they want to they want to extend that through society they're like all of society
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:45.640]  to be like one of these airports where one day you're supposed to look them in the eye
[2:38:45.640 --> 2:38:49.240]  and if you don't look them in the eye you're a terrorist another day if you look them in
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:52.840]  the eye you're a terrorist you know they keep switching they keep switching their their little
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:57.800]  protocols uh so they want the whole the whole country like the airport but they were the uniform
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:02.760]  thugs are ordering us around and uh you know whether we call them the stazis or the ss or the
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:09.480]  sa or the sd or the kgb or the nkvd or there are people who love this kind of stuff and and uh
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:14.680]  are happy to go to work for the government and to rise within the government good people
[2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:19.080]  do not rise within the government just look at what happened to ron paul how wonderfully
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:23.160]  got to be a congressman but uh when he tried to run for senate or of course when he tried to run
[2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:27.960]  for president they they stole the votes for him they did everything possible to crush him and keep
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:33.720]  him out and uh the proof of course more proof that ron paul is a great man yeah you know i've
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:38.760]  known ron paul for about 16 years and i i like a lot of things he stands for he's one of the best
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:45.000]  people in the senate but some of his underlings and people uh you know i've seen reports out
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:49.640]  some of the campaign for liberty people saying hey we shouldn't criticize the bilderberg group
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:55.640]  like alex jones well ron paul is where i learned about the bilderberg group 20 years ago so what
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:40:01.160]  strange is is that we see almost a a attempt to get into campaign for liberty and all this
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:05.080]  and then i don't want to be negative you know it's but i'm not going to sit here and watch
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:10.760]  something i helped build uh be infested by neocons and i know ron paul's come out and said
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:15.240]  he's not going to endorse romney and i know that rand has backed off his some of his pro
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:21.880]  you know war stuff i mean listen uh i'm not trying to bring up dirty laundry here but i mean you
[2:40:21.880 --> 2:40:27.720]  were ron paul's chief of staff have you had any little uh you know a bad taste in your
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:32.200]  mouth or anything about some of the things we've seen in and around ron paul well i think you know
[2:40:32.200 --> 2:40:39.480]  i i i must say i don't follow uh the other politicians uh ron paul was my i despised
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:46.840]  politics even though i was once in regular politics before going straight uh ron ron paul is uh you
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:53.160]  know my one exception so i tend not to to follow other politicians i don't uh i don't do it just
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:57.400]  to hear some of the campaign for liberty some around paul people go on this is how we win
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:01.400]  we merge with the republicans know this is how we get co-opted so i guess that's why
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:05.240]  you don't have anything to do with it because i guess that's where it leads the republican party
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:09.080]  is of course a corrupt and evil organization just like the democratic party i mean they're
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:12.760]  they're they have different interest groups associated with them they have different rhetoric
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:16.280]  uh but there's no there's no difference between them and of course we should be concerned with
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:20.840]  groups like the bill the burgers or the council on foreign relations of the trilateral commission
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:27.160]  or all these groups when the one the power lead gets together for a secret meeting to talk about
[2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:31.400]  what our future ought to be yeah we ought to be concerned and of course you've been great about
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:36.360]  following these people uh and trying to find out what they're saying what they're planning who belongs
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:41.400]  it's very useful information that doesn't mean that they're running the world uh but they're
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:46.200]  part of the apparatus no question that they're part of the well sure they're meeting the government
[2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:51.480]  they're meeting with government to try to get government and give them sweetheart deals and
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:55.720]  that's why there's a problem but it's worse than that it's that when we used to point it out the
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:42:00.360]  media said it didn't exist and we were crazy so see that's the big issue we've forced this out in
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:06.520]  the open ron paul yourself myself and many others and now that we've won that fight that there are
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:12.680]  shadowy corporate crony capitalist who work with government who are arch enemy now we're being
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:17.960]  lectured well okay we should work with bilgerberg you know i mean that's the type of stuff coming
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:23.400]  out well you know the the the i mentioned earlier that the government is a stupid organization the
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:28.760]  people who aren't stupid however are these private interests the power elite the big banking families
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:34.280]  the big industrial families the plutocrats you know soros coax and so forth these these these
[2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:40.440]  families are very smart and they're able to make use of government to their own benefit it also
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:44.360]  massively grows the government hurts the rest of us but you know what they couldn't care less
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:50.120]  because they're in it for money and power and so that's you know that that's the way they operate
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:54.520]  but we have to be concerned and we have to be concerned about these power elite groups and
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:43:00.200]  it gives us a peak very power elite analysis is mary rothward always called it is just essential
[2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:05.640]  to look at other people would call it conspiracy theorizing but to look at who these groups are
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:10.600]  what they're trying to achieve the government officials they work with against the rest of us
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:14.760]  it's very very it's very very important and it again doesn't tell us everything but it gives us
[2:43:14.760 --> 2:43:20.200]  a peak into their into their evil nature and maybe gives us a hint about what they're planning
[2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:24.760]  and to the extent we can have hints about what they're planning it helps us to ensure to refute
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:28.920]  and to defeat what they're trying to do well i mean look they're saying we want to manage
[2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:34.920]  economy we're going to pick winners and losers and that is the antithesis of a free society and
[2:43:34.920 --> 2:43:41.320]  as david rockefeller's grandpa said competition is a sin john d rockefeller and he said that over
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:46.760]  and over again in newspaper interviews they want monopolies and the republican party will never
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:51.800]  talk about that the democrats think all business is bad the republicans say oh it's all good let
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:57.080]  it do whatever it wants well no it's not good uh if it comes in and puts regulations in that it's
[2:43:57.080 --> 2:44:02.760]  exempt to shut down its competition i mean it's it's so elementary let me ask you this and then
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:06.360]  we're going to get into some of the other news uh topics and find out what's on your mind before
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:11.560]  we take a few calls lou rockwell where do you see all this going i mean if you have to stare out
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:17.000]  into the future with your considerable economic and historical research and gravitas i mean i
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:20.840]  read your writings every week and you know astounding insight and from all the amazing
[2:44:20.840 --> 2:44:25.800]  people you've worked with over the years where do you see us going i understand it's fluid we're
[2:44:25.800 --> 2:44:31.480]  deciding the future ourselves but seeing the current formations obviously big conflict between
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:36.440]  liberty and and tyranny it's coming to a head but uh where do you see it going if we don't defeat
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:42.040]  these people versus if we did kind of win the day because there have been times in history
[2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:48.520]  when we can get a grassroots brush fire to go where people really reject and kind of vomit out
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:53.640]  the control freak government demon that's right because they are a minority they're a small minority
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:45:00.200]  we are the vast majority think of us as a big friendly dog that's got a bunch of fleas on it
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:05.240]  we are capable of scratching the fleas off and they are just fleas as compared to the to the
[2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:11.480]  big friendly dog of the people so it is possible to do it but what do i see coming i am afraid we
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:19.240]  see more war uh it looks like they want to go to war against iran um you know they keep obama as
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:24.200]  well as romney as well as george will be bush keeps saying nothing is off the table when we go to go
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:28.360]  war against iran what they're saying is we're prepared to nuke them we're prepared to kill
[2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:33.400]  millions of people uh and of course they've never forgiven iran for having tossed out the us dictator
[2:45:33.400 --> 2:45:38.920]  the shah um you're not supposed to turn the clock back that way once the us takes over a province
[2:45:38.920 --> 2:45:43.320]  it's never supposed to be freed and so they can't of course can't stand iran for that reason
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:47.240]  economically i think uh you know there are many things we can change things you're exactly right
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.760]  things are fluid we do have free will we can change your ideas we can change the future
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:57.560]  but there are also economic laws and what the federal reserve is doing and cohoots with the
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:01.960]  big banks and the big investment banks and so forth uh and cohoots with the rest of the
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:07.320]  government uh has been so dangerous so harmful there's never been anything like this in the
[2:46:07.320 --> 2:46:12.360]  history of the human race where we've had this kind of massive money creation by central banks
[2:46:12.360 --> 2:46:18.760]  all across the world um we've got very very serious trouble ahead that's destabilizing for
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:24.360]  the regime as well as for us so i hope that we can turn it to our to our benefit in the sense
[2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:28.680]  that i hope we more and more all of us learned some economics i hope that we learned something
[2:46:28.680 --> 2:46:32.600]  about what the power elite is doing and we learn what have what ought to be done is versus what
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:38.280]  they are doing and how why ben Bernanke is such an unbelievably dangerous public enemy i mean
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:42.520]  and it's not only you know it was it was the head of the european central bank and the head of the
[2:46:42.520 --> 2:46:47.400]  bank of japan and just go down the line all these central bankers are some of the worst enemies
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:54.040]  mankind has ever faced so they're doing horrendous damage to us but we can understand why that's bad
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:46:59.720]  why they shouldn't exist why central banking shouldn't even be here why we need hard money
[2:46:59.720 --> 2:47:04.200]  sound banking honest banking instead of the dishonest banking that we have today we don't
[2:47:04.200 --> 2:47:10.520]  need a bankocracy the banks rule the europe they rule here they toss up prime ministers and install
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:16.200]  their own in europe uh... a guy like uh... mit romney has been a tool of the investment bankers
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:21.480]  goldman sacks and so forth since he was a young man so of course obama got massive support from
[2:47:21.480 --> 2:47:27.160]  these investment banks uh... jp morgan goldman sacks uh... and uh... and all the rest of them
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:31.720]  when he was running for office he still gets massive support so we need to learn about these
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:35.960]  people we need to learn why they're economically so dangerous but that's the first thing you have
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:42.120]  to learn you have to study and uh... read just start with henry haslet's economics in one lesson
[2:47:42.120 --> 2:47:46.280]  start with murray rothbards what has government done to our money or the case against the fed
[2:47:46.280 --> 2:47:51.720]  or on paul's great book on end of fed read these books and then you'll understand just what our
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:57.080]  enemies are doing to us then we have a chance of sure of defeating them i want to go to calls but
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:02.760]  let's quantify this there's two different trains in history there's there's a creativity those that
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:07.960]  love freedom those that like being honorable reassociation and their gangs gangs with flags
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:13.720]  uh... gangs at a writ large with what we were saying earlier your gangs with a flag and sure
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:17.960]  you can have nations that are more pro-liberty that can fight off another tyranny but then
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:22.680]  they always end up becoming what they were you know organized against but people you understand
[2:48:22.680 --> 2:48:26.680]  it's not like we're gonna have total victory over corruption or it's gonna have total victory over us
[2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:32.200]  unless we give in every little battle every little resistance demonizing these people right now
[2:48:32.200 --> 2:48:38.760]  with their acts exposing them exposing police when they're out of control you know then puts
[2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:45.720]  pressure on the bad ones and so it's an ongoing battle every day is a pitched battle against
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:51.080]  this corruption and we always have to speak the truth it's so powerful just one person speaking
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:56.280]  the truth they fear it they hate it and so whether we're talking about domestic oppression
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:02.760]  international oppression bankster oppression crony capitalist oppression warfare state police state
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:07.880]  tsa all these things speak the truth they fear it and of course that's the way you
[2:49:07.880 --> 2:49:14.040]  persuade other people to speak the truth don't be silence but it'll be silenced don't be silent
[2:49:14.600 --> 2:49:18.040]  let's talk to kreg in new york quick question and we're going to break kreg
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:25.720]  oh yes sir you're on the air sir go ahead yeah i know just got a question about
[2:49:25.720 --> 2:49:32.120]  uh the current presidential situation um around the uh if i remember correctly
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:39.560]  a lot of mainland shows talked about trying to like hunt down people with mental illnesses and
[2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:44.440]  cure them uh so i'd like to hunt them down to kill them or something but either way in the
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:49.080]  book of war when the articles of faith first seven it says we believe in the gift of tongues
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:55.960]  prophecy revelation visions healing interpretation of tongues and so forth to me a lot of religions
[2:49:55.960 --> 2:50:03.240]  do that so that would kind of mean all believers in god i know i hear your question janet rino
[2:50:03.240 --> 2:50:07.880]  said on 60 minutes that everyone that believes in the second coming of christ is mentally ill and
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:11.640]  now they have the new freedom initiative where they want to drug half the kids rolling out your
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:17.160]  take on that well there was a great article of all places in the new york times great because
[2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:21.960]  of the information that uh contained up because of its orientation about how doctors are being
[2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:27.480]  encouraged to give all kids these psychoactive drugs adderall and riddolin and so forth and
[2:50:27.480 --> 2:50:30.840]  they were of course the portrayed the doctors were great charitable wonderful compassion
[2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:36.040]  and they get kickbacks from the drug companies that wasn't mentioned and all kids they want to
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:40.840]  give everybody a put everybody on drugs absolutely just like they've got the rest of us on fluoride
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:46.360]  and who knows what else but it's so crazy they're like let's put all kids on drugs it increases
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:51.800]  and it admits that those speed drugs literally make the brain smaller physically and and make
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:57.400]  the heart bigger i mean totally hurts these kids some of the side effects are dead and they're
[2:50:57.400 --> 2:51:03.160]  like we're gonna put all your kids on it i mean there's it's insanity hi my name is annette and

[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:55.880]  conference on friday and saturday at kellyway gardens in georgia on war revisionism on the
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:55:00.760]  truth about war which is obviously an important an important topic we have a rompology and
[2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:06.120]  apolitano a lot of a lot of wonderful speakers and uh anybody's interested in it you can go
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:11.960]  to mesis.org m-i-s-e-s dot o-r-g-r website and also if you become a member of the institute with a

[2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:23.800]  oh man see i wish i wasn't tied down here running my evil i didn't build an operation
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:27.720]  because that's the type of thing i would love to go to that's the type of thing that i would
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:31.720]  love to send a crew to to be able to come back and have a boil down up but that's the type of
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:36.520]  thing everybody should go get $50 because the way you counterbalance the other side it's not
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:41.320]  even a counterbalance i am so sick being someone who loves history because it's so entertaining
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:46.280]  and that's why i got into it and then found out it was actually horrifying to hear how government
[2:55:46.280 --> 2:55:50.200]  makes things great and how government health care is great when we know it's a nightmare in europe
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:55:55.880]  government always wrecks and ruins everything and it's so dangerous and i'm sick of hearing how
[2:55:55.880 --> 2:56:00.360]  it's going to fix everything yeah and of course then they fix everything with bombs too right
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:03.720]  according if you listen to them it's fixing you know brought freedom to libya brought you know
[2:56:03.720 --> 2:56:08.440]  they always bring freedom by killing people so we're going to talk about how they lie consistently
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:12.280]  about their wars just like they lie about everything else and just how unbelievably
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:19.000]  damaging from the standpoint of economic prosperity freedom uh the decent life civilization itself
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:24.040]  these sorts of perpetual wars the u.s government engages in perpetual wars it lies about them
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:31.480]  we want to tell the truth all i know is i drove home last night at about 9 30 uh with my wife
[2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:38.840]  and children and i had police rush up behind me three times drive recklessly into the other lane
[2:56:38.840 --> 2:56:42.840]  and i and they weren't even going somewhere they just pull off in a gas station and it was like
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:48.120]  race carville or something and i know austin police and then i saw out in the county county police
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:52.040]  we aren't they aren't they aren't that bad compared to some areas but you can just see the attitude
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:55.560]  and just government more and more of them but they're telling us they're going to do less than
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:56:59.560]  less duties quote helping us they're just going to revenue generate well sure they're going to
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:04.360]  give you a big ticket for texting or whatever i remember hearing a real hood the transportation
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:09.320]  guy what a great name for a politician right where the hood but anyway he somebody called him up he
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:12.920]  was on c span and they said you're going to be on texting outlawed everywhere by the federal
[2:57:12.920 --> 2:57:18.840]  government what about cops they they text and he said oh the cops are specially trained so they're
[2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:23.560]  actually passing laws they pass one in texas where they're exempt yeah so but what you know
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:28.200]  it's but of course they this is why they become cops because they become exempt from the law this
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:33.800]  is the this is the essential thing to remember about government it's above the law it uses the law
[2:57:33.800 --> 2:57:38.920]  as a weapon against the rest of us but the law doesn't apply to us so the things that are murder
[2:57:38.920 --> 2:57:44.520]  for private citizens and should be punished are war for the government if it's kidnapping for us
[2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:50.040]  it's a conscription in the draft for them if it's stealing for us why it's taxation so the key
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:55.320]  libertarian insight is the government is not above the law the moral law applies to the government
[2:57:55.320 --> 2:57:59.880]  just like it applies to us the things that are wrong alex for you and me to do are wrong for people
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:05.080]  and just because they're wearing a government suit doesn't change that that sounds terrorist i mean
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:10.440]  fema told me george washington was a bad man that's right can you believe in the actual training
[2:58:10.440 --> 2:58:16.040]  manuals and we have video of it they say george washington and thomas jefferson are bad well they
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:22.680]  resisted the government can't have that happening but i mean oh man we're gonna go to break and

[3:00:26.680 --> 3:00:34.040]  jam in a bunch of calls judy in florida you're on the air uh go ahead hi alex um i had two quick
[3:00:34.040 --> 3:00:43.800]  questions if possible uh one is um with all the information all the facts that are linked to uh
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:51.560]  both 9 11 and uh the the underwear bomber um if there was a concerted effort with all alternative
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:59.960]  media and it was relentlessly pushed and all the facts surrounding those two um situation i mean
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:04.680]  it would not at least open up a fresh investigation i mean there's a lot of proof that points to the
[3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:09.160]  fact that sure no i mean i mean they're scared of us exposing oklahoma city 9 11 the underwear
[3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:12.440]  bomber being gotten on the plane protected this latest guy that was going to bomb the
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:17.560]  federal reserve turns out they protected this moron patsey it's always the same story lou rockwell
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:23.000]  comments on that well all police states uh employee asia provocateur so they try to get
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:30.040]  they pick you know some poor boob from bangladesh lonely um maybe not too high an iq they talk him
[3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:35.480]  into planning a bomb they tell him how to how to make the bomb which of course is not just a fake
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:40.840]  bomb not a real bomb they direct him they say bomb the federal reserve and they protect him from
[3:01:40.840 --> 3:01:46.280]  being captured by any of the counterterrorism forces in lower manhattan he gets there to the
[3:01:46.280 --> 3:01:51.480]  fed he plants the phony bomb and they arrest him for all terrorism well who's the you know so
[3:01:51.480 --> 3:01:55.960]  just like the old russian see the czar secret police was famous for this all all secret police
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:02:01.000]  do this they create these terrorist incidents in order to scare the people and say oh we better
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:06.280]  give all power to the government but i think this is not working anymore i think that that latest
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:10.680]  thing about well against the fed which i think was aimed at people like us by the way alex this is
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:15.400]  why they're picking the fed is a target the new york fed um i don't think it had the effect they
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:19.720]  want i don't think people pay attention anymore they don't uh look in the closet and under the
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:23.720]  bed for terrorists anymore like the government would like them to well sure i mean it's like all
[3:02:23.720 --> 3:02:30.040]  the poor fed i've predicted they would fall flagged the fed let's go to mouse link um in new
[3:02:30.040 --> 3:02:37.160]  york you're on the air mouse good day gentlemen uh my ears perked up when you were talking about
[3:02:37.160 --> 3:02:41.880]  not voting it is something that we've been discussing here for the past few weeks haven't
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:46.040]  followed the debates and whatnot and i'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit
[3:02:46.040 --> 3:02:52.200]  more on that seems to be kind of a taboo subject you know it was right yeah people people are shocked
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:56.200]  when you talk about what what you know not vote you're we're trained from the earliest days in
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:03:00.680]  the government schools that it's our duty to uh partake in the sacrament of the government
[3:03:00.680 --> 3:03:05.800]  which is which is voting but first of all your vote doesn't count even if the votes are honestly
[3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:10.840]  counted and who the heck believes that your vote doesn't count unless the elections one by one vote
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:16.360]  it's a pain in the neck and the government loves you to vote it's very very important that you vote
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:21.240]  and people who don't vote bother the government and if we had a if we you know in the old days
[3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:25.480]  but we used to talk about what if they held a war nobody showed up what if they held an election
[3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:30.680]  and nobody showed up uh that would be a very revolutionary act so if we have fewer and fewer
[3:03:30.680 --> 3:03:36.040]  people voting bothers the regime bothers the government bothers the media and by the way
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:40.520]  you don't have to go waste your time in some horrible government line in front of a government
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:46.520]  machine in what's just a facade and uh and and just a uh a baloney operation but i think their
[3:03:46.520 --> 3:03:51.480]  point is then how do you change the system well you don't throw it through politics i mean politics
[3:03:51.480 --> 3:03:55.320]  is the government's game give us a few examples of how you do it give us a few examples live
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:03:59.960]  well i think we have to do it by first of all just mentally succeeding from the government i mean
[3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:04.360]  you can do things like homeschool your children that's one great way to do it but if you just
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:09.960]  mentally don't give them your consent if you don't do what they want if you don't think that they're
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:14.200]  the source of truth if you then talk to other people about this and if you learn yourself the
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:19.240]  truth about economics about history about government uh false flags and all all the various things
[3:04:19.240 --> 3:04:24.680]  you can learn about then you can be a source of truth and guidance to others that's the way we
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:31.000]  change things by changing minds not by putting creep a is versus creep b in the white house i mean
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:34.760]  why would anybody think that would make any difference it doesn't make any difference if
[3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:39.320]  there were ever worth president it was any good believe me he would not be in office for very long
[3:04:39.320 --> 3:04:45.640]  at all lou rockwell uh thank you so much for spending time with us sorry to the other callers
[3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:49.880]  look forward to talking to you again soon and uh thanks alex thank you so much all right folks
