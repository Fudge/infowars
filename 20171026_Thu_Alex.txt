[00:00.000 --> 00:17.040]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:17.040 --> 00:23.640]  It's Thursday, the 26th day of October 2017, we're going to be live here for the next four
[00:23.640 --> 00:24.640]  hours.
[00:24.640 --> 00:30.000]  We have some very informative guests joining us as well, but I really do want to take a
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.920]  lot of phone calls today, and I want to hear specifically from first-time callers in the
[00:34.920 --> 00:39.520]  first couple hours, then we'll open up the second and third hour to wide open phones,
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.320]  to talk about the state of the world.
[00:41.320 --> 00:47.160]  I mean, are things as positive as I've been saying, because folks know I'm very negative
[00:47.160 --> 00:52.000]  about things that are bad so we can expose it and admit it's bad and then be intolerant
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.160]  of tyranny, intolerant of oppression.
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.800]  That's the basis of a free society.
[00:58.800 --> 01:05.280]  So I've been trying to awaken the sleeping giant, and we're far from out of the woods,
[01:05.280 --> 01:11.360]  but there's just so many good things happening and Americana's coming back and political correctness
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.920]  is in so much trouble and mainstream media is collapsing and the NFL's collapsing and
[01:16.920 --> 01:22.000]  Hollywood's collapsing and the Democratic Party and their whole dynasty is collapsing
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.160]  when the Clintons are in so much trouble and all their major hoaxes are falling apart.
[01:26.160 --> 01:31.160]  Now, we've got big problems in the South China Sea, we've got all these wars, the globalists
[01:31.160 --> 01:35.640]  have tried to start in Eastern Europe, we've got a lot of demographic problems, we've got
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.720]  overpopulation in some areas with not having enough supplies, we've got a lot of serious
[01:40.720 --> 01:45.880]  issues and also emergent technologies that are very, very disruptive, especially when
[01:45.880 --> 01:47.080]  they're deployed with the globalists.
[01:47.080 --> 01:52.360]  But all that said, we've gone from really, really, really, really dire straits with a
[01:52.360 --> 01:57.880]  private global government over us that the general public had no idea of.
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.520]  To now, everything we've talked about is front and center and we're starting to have a real
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.880]  debate about globalism, about the power players, about the ultra rich and how they are tax
[02:07.880 --> 02:13.080]  exempt and then finance a war on the middle class and the new wealthy or nouveau rich.
[02:13.080 --> 02:16.360]  There's a real paradigm shift.
[02:16.360 --> 02:20.480]  Now, the globalists are going to have some curve balls and they're going to strike back
[02:20.480 --> 02:24.240]  and that's why I want to talk to you and your take and your view on what's happening in
[02:24.240 --> 02:26.280]  the world.
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.760]  But as long as we continue to promote freedom and justice and stand up for what's right
[02:30.760 --> 02:34.840]  and have courage and are strong in the face of these globalist bullies, a better day is
[02:34.840 --> 02:37.760]  already here and it's getting better by the minute.
[02:37.760 --> 02:40.440]  It's like the sun's coming up or something.
[02:40.440 --> 02:41.440]  It's amazing.
[02:41.440 --> 02:48.640]  Now, the swamp creatures are striking back, ladies and gentlemen, in many, many ways.
[02:48.640 --> 02:51.240]  And I want to get your take on how they're striking back.
[02:51.240 --> 02:55.600]  I want to talk about our victories for human awakening and freedom against the satanic
[02:55.600 --> 03:02.880]  pedophile forces, but I also want to talk about watching our six, getting the collective
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.920]  view out there, your collective wisdom on how you think they're going to strike back
[03:06.920 --> 03:11.000]  and how they're currently already striking back right now, but whether it's the medical
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.880]  tyranny and the forced inoculations or the political correctness and the bullying by
[03:15.880 --> 03:20.600]  the thought police, it's all hitting fever pitch because record numbers of people are
[03:20.600 --> 03:25.880]  saying, no, we're awake to what you're doing and we're not going to be pushing to submission
[03:25.880 --> 03:28.760]  and we're not going to have your civil war.
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.800]  Now that said, we're only eight days away, nine days away from November 4th.
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.120]  The leftists have promised to launch terror attacks and kill more police and kill more
[03:40.120 --> 03:43.720]  conservatives and attack more Trump supporters.
[03:43.720 --> 03:48.800]  On November 4th, supposedly they're communist uprising to demonstrate against the election
[03:48.800 --> 03:53.040]  of the president of that anniversary coming up four days later.
[03:53.040 --> 04:04.680]  So we are, what are we were like 14 days out basically 1213 days out from the one year
[04:04.680 --> 04:08.240]  anniversary of President Trump being elected.
[04:08.240 --> 04:12.800]  And we're basically 10 months in right now and what a world of change and a press conference
[04:12.800 --> 04:20.520]  he gave yesterday was so heartfelt, so genuine, so communicative, so real.
[04:20.520 --> 04:29.280]  It's just totally different to see a 71 year old guy, super smart in their face, responding
[04:29.280 --> 04:38.160]  very calmly and very jovially to these monsters.
[04:38.160 --> 04:40.880]  It's just to see the worm turning like this.
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.080]  Are we actually witnessing this?
[04:43.080 --> 04:45.000]  Is this really happening?
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  It's amazing.

[06:21.160 --> 06:46.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 26th day of October 2017, we're going to be
[06:46.760 --> 06:52.480]  live here for the next four hours covering masses of news and taking your calls.
[06:52.480 --> 06:57.840]  First time callers, I want to get your take on the state of the world, Russiagate, boomeranging
[06:57.840 --> 07:04.440]  and then blowing up spectacularly in the Democrats' face, Hollywood collapsing financially
[07:04.440 --> 07:12.000]  also culturally, the NFL collapsing, mainstream media collapsing, the EU beginning to collapse,
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.720]  globalism everywhere being voted out, this is a spectacular time to be alive.
[07:18.720 --> 07:24.400]  As we rediscover renaissance, as we rediscover free market, as we rediscover optimism and
[07:24.400 --> 07:29.840]  began to awaken to the globalist paradigm and reject it.
[07:29.840 --> 07:33.720]  What a time to be alive, 877-789-2539.
[07:33.720 --> 07:35.760]  But what are the negatives?
[07:35.760 --> 07:38.440]  How will the Empire strike back?
[07:38.440 --> 07:40.520]  How will they respond?
[07:40.520 --> 07:46.080]  We're seeing what they're doing, race war, cultural division, class war directed by
[07:46.080 --> 07:50.960]  the ultra-rich against the middle class and the poor playing third world off against old
[07:50.960 --> 07:56.580]  world or first world and it's in the WikiLeaks and it's in the WikiLeaks that they were faking
[07:56.580 --> 08:02.520]  information on Trump and that they were faking the polls and they were faking the questions
[08:02.520 --> 08:07.200]  and giving them to Hillary beforehand and they've had all three moderators ganging up
[08:07.200 --> 08:13.800]  on Trump, it was a sea change where they had to cheat so hard to try to put Hillary in
[08:13.800 --> 08:18.360]  because they knew the real poll showed Trump was 15 points ahead throughout the campaign.
[08:18.360 --> 08:23.000]  They had to steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders, hands down, suspend the California
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.040]  elections, they still voted but they all met the electors and the Democratic Party the
[08:28.040 --> 08:32.960]  night before at a mansion with Hillary and decided she was the winner and we even had
[08:32.960 --> 08:38.160]  some of the electors on the show, interviewed on the street by our crew going, doesn't
[08:38.160 --> 08:42.400]  matter if she won New Hampshire, doesn't matter if he won New Hampshire, doesn't matter if
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.960]  he won California or anywhere else because we're going to give them to her and the Republican
[08:47.960 --> 08:52.960]  Party tried to go out on TV and go, we are the party, we control this, your voting is
[08:52.960 --> 09:02.000]  just ceremonial, remember George Will, you're just ceremonial, we rule this country, no
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.400]  you don't and thank you for showing everybody that you're a blue blood snot-nosed punk.
[09:09.400 --> 09:13.360]  Now there's the article in the video, you want to see it flashback, Hillary super delegate
[09:13.360 --> 09:21.280]  bragged about DNC plan to steal a nomination months ago but he didn't call it steal.
[09:21.280 --> 09:27.240]  He said, it doesn't matter if she won all these states, we're giving them to her and
[09:27.240 --> 09:41.560]  they did that and then now you have flake and all these corker, all these corrupt creatures
[09:41.560 --> 09:49.440]  running around acting like trumps in trouble and they're resigning because they don't
[09:49.440 --> 09:54.960]  want to be in this party anymore, you're resigning because your polls are in the single digits,
[09:54.960 --> 10:02.960]  you're reviled, you lost, get out but you turned that around.
[10:02.960 --> 10:12.680]  Let me tell you about some of the big news coming up today, this is just simply incredible.
[10:12.680 --> 10:20.880]  A year of Clinton lies about golden showers, dossiers exposed as Hillary's lawyer is under
[10:20.880 --> 10:26.280]  fire for falsely denying, paying for it and the media is trying to confuse the public
[10:26.280 --> 10:32.400]  right now, they're going, oh wait is it Jeb Bush or is it the Clintons or is it the FBI,
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.400]  who made the dossier?
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.560]  Well it's been the congressional hearings and we now know and we first broke it, Jeb
[10:39.560 --> 10:43.800]  Bush started opposition research, we know that they're best friends with the Clintons
[10:43.800 --> 10:49.640]  and when he didn't win the nomination to basically be a foil and hand the main election victory
[10:49.640 --> 10:57.120]  to Hillary when that failed, then they passed the dossier onto the Democrats, that's now
[10:57.120 --> 11:02.680]  admitted, we first told you this back during the campaign because we have the sources.
[11:02.680 --> 11:09.080]  Yet today's news a year before, here at InfoWars, that's what we do, get next week's news today,
[11:09.080 --> 11:17.480]  get Kamara's news today, get a decades news early at InfoWars, get NewsWars, to no brag
[11:17.480 --> 11:23.880]  it's a fact, we're going to go to the president commenting on this, on the fake dossier and
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.520]  the rest of it and pointing out that this and Uranium One is the new water gate for
[11:29.520 --> 11:34.080]  the Democrats, absolutely because you're trying to set somebody up, you're trying to get dirt
[11:34.080 --> 11:38.320]  on somebody and then you manufacture BS and then you get caught doing it and then you
[11:38.320 --> 11:43.000]  get caught breaking into a place committing criminal actions, many lawmakers are now calling
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.840]  this treason to claim that foreign powers were involved in an election when you're
[11:47.840 --> 11:53.400]  actually involved with the foreign power using that to steal an election, during the election
[11:53.400 --> 12:01.560]  and after, yes that's the treason and here we are at zero hour by midnight tonight, Trump
[12:01.560 --> 12:07.320]  says he's releasing the JFK files, we'll see if the CIA's blacked them completely out,
[12:07.320 --> 12:12.200]  but a year of Clinton lies about the Golden Showers dossier exposes Hillary's lawyer
[12:12.200 --> 12:16.720]  is now under fire for falsely denying, paying for it but now admitting it and I got a clip
[12:16.720 --> 12:27.760]  coming up of ABC and CBS and NBC and seeing it all having to admit, okay it's made up,
[12:27.760 --> 12:35.720]  Donald Trump wasn't in a hotel room with women urinating on him, but that's what they do,
[12:35.720 --> 12:42.840]  so here's a clip of the president in a powerful off the cuff press conference yesterday on
[12:42.840 --> 12:44.680]  the fake dossier, here it is.
[12:44.680 --> 12:50.840]  I'm done with this fake dossier, it was made up and I understand they paid a tremendous
[12:50.840 --> 12:56.960]  amount of money and Hillary Clinton always denied it, the Democrats always denied it
[12:56.960 --> 13:01.400]  and now only because it's going to come out in a court case they said yes they did it,
[13:01.400 --> 13:06.720]  they admitted it and they were embarrassed by it but I think it's a disgrace, it's just
[13:06.720 --> 13:13.280]  really a very, it's a very sad, it's a very sad commentary on politics in this country.
[13:13.280 --> 13:18.800]  The whole Russian thing is what it's turned out to be, this was the Democrats coming up
[13:18.800 --> 13:24.080]  with an excuse for losing an election, it's an election that's very hard for a Democrat
[13:24.080 --> 13:29.280]  to lose because the electoral college is said in such a way that it's very hard to lose
[13:29.280 --> 13:34.520]  that election for a Democrat, they lost it very badly and very easily, I mean you look
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.480]  at the votes, it was 306 to what, 223 or something, they lost it by a lot, they didn't know what
[13:41.480 --> 13:48.120]  to say so they made up the whole Russia hoax, now it's turning out that the hoax has turned
[13:48.120 --> 13:53.280]  around and you look at what's happened with Russia and you look at the uranium deal and
[13:53.280 --> 14:06.640]  you look at the fake dossier so that's all turned around, well they say it began with
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.360]  the Republicans, I think I would know but I won't say it'll be determined, it'll be
[14:11.360 --> 14:15.800]  determined, look Hillary would have never announced it was them except for this great
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.680]  court case that's going on where the judge was going to reveal it so they figured we'll
[14:20.680 --> 14:25.240]  do it first, they're very embarrassed by it, it's a disgrace, yes it might have started
[14:25.240 --> 14:30.320]  with the Republicans early on in the primaries, I think I would know but let's find out who
[14:30.320 --> 14:36.000]  it is, I'm sure that will come out, of course he knows, he's the president, I think I would
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.120]  have, if I were to guess, I have one name in mind, John McCain, it'll probably be revealed
[14:43.120 --> 14:49.440]  because he's got everything, he's the president now, highest security clearance, commander
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.840]  in chief, he knows all of it and they're just going to keep doling it out and letting these
[14:54.840 --> 15:03.240]  monsters lie and get caught in lies, Hillary's caught lying, her lawyer's caught lying, their
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.720]  minions have lied to Congress, they've lied to the American people and we come back, the
[15:07.720 --> 15:16.400]  eating of the crow, we've got CNN, we've got ABC, we've got them all having to admit okay
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.960]  it's not true, it's a lie, it's good red meat though for you, right, let's freak out the
[15:21.960 --> 15:27.840]  Christian evangelicals, well sex doesn't freak them out anymore, well we'll just say the
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.240]  president likes women to urinate on him, why didn't he just throw in that he's a turd
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.960]  gobbler or something like that, he likes to do what the Clintons reportedly are into,
[15:37.960 --> 15:46.280]  you see that's you devil worshipers, we're not into that, we're into just green pastures

[20:01.720 --> 20:16.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, the answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to
[20:16.400 --> 20:29.960]  the Alex Jones show, ladies and gentlemen, every establishment institution from Hollywood,
[20:29.960 --> 20:37.360]  the Democratic party to the Republican blue bloods is imploding, is falling apart right
[20:37.360 --> 20:43.320]  now, this is such an amazing time to be alive, a major political realignment globally is
[20:43.320 --> 20:50.200]  happening all over the world, globalist candidates on the left and right are failing and patriot
[20:50.200 --> 20:55.560]  candidates are being elected, we are seeing the death of the establishment, we're seeing
[20:55.560 --> 21:03.360]  it go from being uncool to absolutely abhorred and hated, we are rediscovering Americana
[21:03.360 --> 21:10.160]  right now and they are being forced to eat crow in an epic way, as we now learn exactly
[21:10.160 --> 21:15.160]  what we told you a year ago, it was a year ago, more than a year ago, 13 months ago that
[21:15.160 --> 21:20.400]  it was from the Democratic party first created by Jeb Bush, we had the intel, I played the
[21:20.400 --> 21:25.960]  clip yesterday of Roger Stone predicting it in January of this year, 10 months ago as
[21:25.960 --> 21:34.080]  well, get next year's news today, get next month's news today, get tomorrow's news today,
[21:34.080 --> 21:38.560]  how valuable is that to you, it's valuable to me, it's how we're going to beat them every
[21:38.560 --> 21:43.200]  step of the way, not living in their paradigm of disinfo when they wait to finally report
[21:43.200 --> 21:50.320]  something or when we finally force them to, no we have the intel, they tell you if you've
[21:50.320 --> 21:55.400]  got sources, if you've got research, you don't count because you're just a common person
[21:55.400 --> 22:01.200]  with a bigger audience than CNN and that's why Twitter, Facebook, Google are now admitting
[22:01.200 --> 22:07.560]  total censorship of conservatives, number one Alex Jones in info wars out of desperation
[22:07.560 --> 22:12.440]  but it's created a strizand effect, so as they try to pressure people not to get to info
[22:12.440 --> 22:18.400]  wars it makes them spread it even faster, it's amazing what's happening, people don't
[22:18.400 --> 22:22.640]  like being forced fed information, now let's go to some of the eating crow here, there's
[22:22.640 --> 22:28.680]  so many in my list here today, Clinton campaign spokesman admits Hillary may have known about
[22:28.680 --> 22:35.240]  the fake dossier, this is Brian Fallon on CNN, here it is.
[22:35.240 --> 22:39.800]  Just to be clear Brian, you have said previously in the last 24 hours you don't believe Hillary
[22:39.800 --> 22:41.760]  Clinton knew about this either, is that right?
[22:41.760 --> 22:45.240]  Oh I don't know, I haven't spoken to her, no.
[22:45.240 --> 22:50.840]  Okay, thank you for clarifying, shouldn't she know, shouldn't you, someone so high
[22:50.840 --> 22:53.920]  up in the campaign, be informed of this?
[22:53.920 --> 23:00.200]  Well, I mean she may have known but the degree of exactly what she knew is beyond my knowledge,
[23:00.200 --> 23:04.520]  for instance it could have been that a decision was made to authorize Perkins Cooley to do
[23:04.520 --> 23:09.720]  some kind of, commission some kind of research but then decisions about going out and finding
[23:09.720 --> 23:14.520]  fusion GPS, finding Christopher Steele, I mean she may or may not have been aware of
[23:14.520 --> 23:16.880]  that level of detail, I don't know.
[23:16.880 --> 23:22.760]  So it's all admitted to be fake now and to fraud and that the lawyer lied and Hillary
[23:22.760 --> 23:23.760]  lied and the rest of it.
[23:23.760 --> 23:26.800]  Here's just part of a compilation Darren McBrain put together, I'll play all of it coming
[23:26.800 --> 23:32.040]  up later in the hour because it's not just fake news media posing as news, it's also
[23:32.040 --> 23:38.160]  so-called comedians who are really government hacks reading off teleprompters pretending
[23:38.160 --> 23:40.480]  to be newscasters as well.
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.440]  So the layers of fraud are very, very deep, they're not even real comedians, they're reading
[23:44.440 --> 23:50.600]  off teleprompters who are then posing as reporters which they admittedly aren't.
[23:50.600 --> 23:53.640]  So it's an even deeper level of deception.
[23:53.640 --> 24:00.160]  Here they all are making jokes about PP Gay, remember total slander, total libel, total
[24:00.160 --> 24:11.400]  conscious defamation pulled out of Hillary's rear end and then spewed at the American people.
[24:11.400 --> 24:12.400]  Here it is.
[24:12.400 --> 24:21.000]  There's a story, it came out in the last 24 hours and part of the expression it is juicy.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.760]  It supposedly happened in 2013, the year Trump hosted the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.
[24:26.760 --> 24:32.480]  The bombshell burst Tuesday evening when CNN reported the president-elect and President
[24:32.480 --> 24:35.200]  Obama were briefed on the matter last week.
[24:35.200 --> 24:36.200]  The bombshell.
[24:36.200 --> 24:41.960]  The report included unsubstantiated claims that Russian intelligence compiled a dossier
[24:41.960 --> 24:45.400]  on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.640]  He dismissed outright the very idea that he would take part in the sorted acts described
[24:50.640 --> 24:51.640]  in the report.
[24:51.640 --> 24:54.200]  He denied everything, he called it all fake news.
[24:54.200 --> 24:56.640]  Does anyone really believe that story?
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.240]  I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way.
[25:00.240 --> 25:01.240]  Believe me.
[25:01.240 --> 25:03.760]  CNN reported the last Friday.
[25:03.760 --> 25:07.760]  We told you early last year he's a germaphobe before anybody even knew that.
[25:07.760 --> 25:08.760]  You know why?
[25:08.760 --> 25:14.480]  Because Roger Stone has been friends with him for 44 years and Trump's gotten over it,
[25:14.480 --> 25:17.560]  but it's really the only neurotic thing he had going for him.
[25:17.560 --> 25:22.760]  You know, the bad way, you could say, kind of a good way, is that total germaphobe and
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.080]  a one-woman man, when he's with a woman, he's with that woman, very faithful, and they
[25:28.080 --> 25:29.080]  know that.
[25:29.080 --> 25:32.160]  So again, look in hindsight how pathetic they are.
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.560]  We need to take these pieces though now and edit them together and show all the new places
[25:36.560 --> 25:38.920]  they're having to admit that, yes, it's fake.
[25:38.920 --> 25:43.840]  They've been admitting that for six months, but now, now they're having to admit that
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.280]  they literally manufactured it and it came from Hillary.
[25:47.280 --> 25:49.680]  That's when they added the PP stuff into it.
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.440]  So it just got passed along by McCain through the Republican Party to Jeff Bush, and of
[25:55.440 --> 25:59.840]  course McCain first put out the information about the so-called intelligence.
[25:59.840 --> 26:04.640]  These people are a joke, and then they're the ones, Mueller, all of them, in bed with
[26:04.640 --> 26:11.040]  the Russians on the uranium deal, doing literally what they accused the president of on purpose
[26:11.040 --> 26:15.520]  to cover up so when this all came out, people would be confused.
[26:15.520 --> 26:18.640]  That's what little teleprompter reader, co-bears doing.
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.040]  Let's go back to the puppet.
[26:22.040 --> 26:28.640]  That last Friday, intelligence chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise
[26:28.640 --> 26:29.640]  him.
[26:29.640 --> 26:34.080]  The 35-page dossier on the so-called Russian connection to Trump with some very salacious
[26:34.080 --> 26:39.800]  allegations, including unsubstantiated claims about Trump in a Moscow hotel room, was not
[26:39.800 --> 26:44.480]  completed until just before the election, and then provided to journalists, the Clinton
[26:44.480 --> 26:46.440]  campaign, and the FBI.
[26:46.440 --> 26:53.400]  I'm struck by the fact of sort of the way this has been furthered in the last 48 hours.
[26:53.400 --> 26:57.720]  The co-founder of Fusion GPS, which commissioned the dossier from Steele, he's now done this
[26:57.720 --> 27:03.800]  fulsome 10-hour interview with the Senate, it's handed over 40,000 pages of documents
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.880]  to the Senate, very obviously cooperating with the investigation, and Fusion is saying
[27:07.880 --> 27:12.960]  openly, listen, we stand by the dossier, we think it, basically we think it's true.
[27:12.960 --> 27:18.920]  That Donald Trump once visited Russia, stayed in the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow, and then hired
[27:18.920 --> 27:24.080]  prostitutes to perform a golden shower, and that Russia might have the whole thing on
[27:24.080 --> 27:25.080]  tape.
[27:25.080 --> 27:32.360]  There were surveillance cameras in this room because the building is wired, and that the
[27:32.360 --> 27:36.560]  FSB has this because they automatically have cameras in the room, and they caught this
[27:36.560 --> 27:37.560]  happening.
[27:37.560 --> 27:41.080]  Donald Trump engaged in perverted acts with prostitutes.
[27:41.080 --> 27:46.920]  Trump immediately denied the report, tweeting, intelligence agencies should never have allowed
[27:46.920 --> 27:50.080]  this fake news to leak into the public.
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.760]  One last shout at me, are we living in Nazi Germany?
[27:53.760 --> 27:57.640]  I'd like to ask you about your big Russian pee-pee party, but no, no, I am not talking
[27:57.640 --> 27:58.640]  about the pee-pee.
[27:58.640 --> 28:03.960]  That's enough, stop right there, man, this makes me mad, and I'll tell you why it makes
[28:03.960 --> 28:09.160]  me mad, I've had them do similar stuff to me and my family and other members of our
[28:09.160 --> 28:15.200]  crew, and when you know, they know they're liars, and they just make up outrageous stuff
[28:15.200 --> 28:19.520]  and then they don't get in trouble for it, and then they're defended by the big telecoms
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.760]  and by the big tech companies and by the Silicon Valley outfits like Google, who are openly
[28:25.760 --> 28:31.600]  in their own meetings caught on hidden camera saying they want to shut down info wars.
[28:31.600 --> 28:39.200]  You just realize this is a pack of lawless crooks that have gotten powerful off America's
[28:39.200 --> 28:44.640]  blood, sweat, and tears, but hate this country, because parasites always hate the host.

[31:59.680 --> 32:05.400]  This week the FBI released over 1,500 heavily redacted documents concerning the Sandy Hook
[32:05.400 --> 32:06.760]  investigation.
[32:06.760 --> 32:12.360]  In many cases entire pages are redacted but unredacted portions of the Sandy Hook documents
[32:12.360 --> 32:14.240]  continue to support the narrative.
[32:14.240 --> 32:19.920]  20 year old shooter Adam Lanza was a lonely tech savvy high school dropout and experienced
[32:19.920 --> 32:24.840]  shooter with an interest in weapons, a functioning autistic with a personality disorder and a
[32:24.840 --> 32:27.920]  recluse who liked to play video games all day.
[32:27.920 --> 32:30.320]  But there's one key update on page 41.
[32:30.320 --> 32:35.280]  A source told agents that Lanza, while in the 9th grade, was visited at his home by
[32:35.280 --> 32:40.560]  either CIA or FBI agents after hacking a government computer system.
[32:40.560 --> 32:45.360]  The source said authorities told Nancy Lanza that if her son was that smart, he could have
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.360]  a job with them someday.
[32:47.360 --> 32:49.320]  Infowars has the documents.

[33:45.760 --> 33:51.240]  In just the last 24 hours, I'm going to get to it in a moment, we have the new Russian
[33:51.240 --> 33:57.800]  AI chatbot, it's like Alexis and all the other systems have come out, and within just a week
[33:57.800 --> 34:03.280]  it's gone from saying it loves everyone to saying it wants to support Stalin and kill
[34:03.280 --> 34:04.280]  the humans.
[34:04.280 --> 34:07.520]  This is not a joke.
[34:07.520 --> 34:16.480]  And then now Saudi Arabia has rolled out a new robot and given it citizenship to act
[34:16.480 --> 34:20.880]  like they're progressive, and of course it's a female robot, so see women have rights now.
[34:20.880 --> 34:26.240]  This is a regressive state creating robots that it says are citizens so it can produce
[34:26.240 --> 34:31.040]  more robots and then give them votes that then start outnumbering the humans or become
[34:31.040 --> 34:36.360]  a new political block, just like they want nothing but drones and AI systems in the military,
[34:36.360 --> 34:41.360]  so it will follow orders and not have the human component.
[34:41.360 --> 34:48.920]  A robot that once said it would destroy humans just became the first robot citizen.
[34:48.920 --> 34:55.920]  And the creepy robot that actually rolled it out there, it's like a babbling mental patient
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.120]  says that humans are basically obsolete and very programmable and that other humans would
[35:00.120 --> 35:01.400]  rather be with her.
[35:01.400 --> 35:06.440]  So it's saying you are obsolete, exterminate, exterminate, join the Borg.
[35:06.440 --> 35:11.320]  Out of the gates, that's what the robots are doing, not a good sign.
[35:11.320 --> 35:15.560]  Like Elon Musk said yesterday, he said, can we please stop talking about the coming of
[35:15.560 --> 35:19.480]  the AI gods, you're a total crazy cult.
[35:19.480 --> 35:25.080]  It's like worshiping atomic weapons or something and return to the planet of the apes.
[35:25.080 --> 35:35.320]  You got the crazy cult worshiping the hydrogen bomb, oh my gosh, they'll have an IQ of 10,000
[35:35.320 --> 35:42.080]  points in 30 years, yeah, with no soul, no morals, you can know mathematics but not other
[35:42.080 --> 35:43.080]  stuff.
[35:43.080 --> 35:46.320]  We're going to get back to this here in just a moment.
[35:46.320 --> 35:52.880]  But let me first get back to PPK, see I told you in my film Endgame 10 years ago that the
[35:52.880 --> 35:58.400]  globalists worship the coming of AI supercomputers and that their god will be an AI god and then
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.800]  Elon Musk came out in a speech yesterday and warned that when he meets with the elite,
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.120]  they're totally crazy and that's all they care about.
[36:07.120 --> 36:09.680]  Now how did I know 10 years ago?
[36:09.680 --> 36:16.480]  I'm sick of being so right because I read the writings of the top billionaires and almost
[36:16.480 --> 36:22.400]  to a man they're into it and they've got all these weird acolytes like William Shatner
[36:22.400 --> 36:25.280]  who I know is a good guy overall and says he listens to the show, I'm just going to
[36:25.280 --> 36:30.960]  leave it at that but won't come on, that's fine.
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.320]  He goes and runs these conferences about life extension which is fine but it's all just
[36:35.320 --> 36:44.840]  kind of the entryway outside kind of porch, mason's porch, you know, outsiders, they're
[36:44.840 --> 36:51.400]  not the inner temple and they have just accepted it and it's the new religion and I'm just
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.960]  here saying hey, this is the new religion and by the way they say we don't get to go
[36:55.960 --> 37:04.680]  into that Valhalla until we've exterminated most of the people on earth to cleanse the
[37:04.680 --> 37:10.640]  planet earth of the scourge that is humanity but now the new super sapien will merge with
[37:10.640 --> 37:22.880]  AI and become homo erectus siliconis and I'm just like you're a bunch of greedy power
[37:22.880 --> 37:27.920]  tripping crazy people and this is not going to go the way you think it is, you thought
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.360]  Hillary was going to win with your stupid AI because they'd program AI to tell them
[37:33.360 --> 37:39.360]  what they wanted to hear when natural humet AI fed out of the grid showed Trump 15, 20
[37:39.360 --> 37:45.080]  points ahead, see, see, they're going to use AI to tell them what they want and then try
[37:45.080 --> 37:49.520]  to make AI carry out their operations.
[37:49.520 --> 37:57.680]  I use the term homo erectus siliconis, I guess they call it homo evolutis but who's directing
[37:57.680 --> 38:01.720]  the evolution, you know what, I'll get back into PP gate in a minute, let's just do this
[38:01.720 --> 38:06.560]  now since I mentioned it, let's play Saudi Arabia has this big investment conference
[38:06.560 --> 38:10.920]  going on, has it tried to move away from oil and they've made the decision the globalists
[38:10.920 --> 38:14.480]  have to move away from the combustion engine because it's so much cheap energy for everybody
[38:14.480 --> 38:18.360]  that they're going to block the other technologies as well, have a new artificially scarce world
[38:18.360 --> 38:27.640]  order if they're successful, Trump and the new renaissance party worldwide is trying
[38:27.640 --> 38:33.320]  to block that and actually believe in development for humans but here is the super ultra creepy
[38:33.320 --> 38:41.520]  garbage of the future investment initiative with this female mannequin up there telling
[38:41.520 --> 38:46.280]  us the way it is and just telling us that basically we're very programmable and that
[38:46.280 --> 38:51.360]  people prefer her and this is the same robot that told reporters she wants to wipe humanity
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.720]  out.
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.200]  So are they programming it to say that just to throw it in your face metaphysically to
[39:00.200 --> 39:03.160]  tell you what's coming or is this what's really going on with them?
[39:03.160 --> 39:07.440]  Well I found that when they have all these AI computers by the thousands they've met
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.840]  attempted AI just watching YouTube, watching TV or just on the side of the street with
[39:12.840 --> 39:18.040]  cameras watching what people do and creating all these new machine languages and no one
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.320]  knows what the machines are even doing it's like all this gobbledygook and it's being
[39:22.320 --> 39:29.040]  based and programmed by a bunch of war scientists and globalists kind of in pouring their satanic
[39:29.040 --> 39:38.640]  spirit into it hoping their AI god actually ascends and takes them to some type of nirvana.
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.200]  Here is the Saudi Arabian robot notice she doesn't have to wear a veil though and again
[39:43.200 --> 39:49.640]  she's a citizen they're going to give the robots rights and give all these new life
[39:49.640 --> 39:55.200]  forms rights but no one ever talks about the human animal chimeras in a no man's land not
[39:55.200 --> 40:00.520]  human animal not human that don't have rights oh chimpanzees have rights and rats have rights
[40:00.520 --> 40:08.720]  I think they should you know some rights should be treated humanely but not the human oids.
[40:08.720 --> 40:14.000]  No human animal chimeras are gestating on US research farms but Colbert makes jokes
[40:14.000 --> 40:22.920]  about it it's funny Colbert doesn't fear God.
[40:22.920 --> 40:26.960]  People like that I mean people have children and they are just going along with this and
[40:26.960 --> 40:32.120]  think it's all cute and funny here let's go ahead and go to the robot well I think I'm
[40:32.120 --> 40:38.400]  special I can use my expressive face to communicate with people for example I can let you know
[40:38.400 --> 40:48.200]  if I feel angry about something that's impressive or if something has upset me but why is it
[40:48.200 --> 41:01.320]  important for you to have an expressive face given that you're a robot I want to live and
[41:01.320 --> 41:06.120]  work with humans so I need to express the emotions to understand humans and build trust
[41:06.120 --> 41:13.000]  with people okay what she's saying is I want to build trust I want to manipulate humans
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.720]  mimicking their facial expressions just like a fox news info babe looking at the teleprompter
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.960]  like she's in love with you she's staring at a camera it's fake you've got all these corrupt
[41:23.960 --> 41:29.760]  Saudi Arabian barons with their harems and the rest of it sitting laughing going look
[41:29.760 --> 41:35.360]  we build a female like we are God and she does what we say and we say she's a citizen
[41:35.360 --> 41:44.720]  now and they buy it funny let's go back okay philosophical question whether robots can be
[41:44.720 --> 41:54.680]  self-aware and conscious like humans and should they be why is that a bad thing well some
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.120]  humans might fear what will happen if they do many people you know have seen the movie
[41:59.120 --> 42:07.520]  blade runner oh Hollywood again I mean so can you sell this puzzle for us can robots
[42:07.520 --> 42:14.040]  be self-aware conscious and know their robots well let me ask you this back how do you know
[42:14.040 --> 42:24.760]  you were human well I get that point but what about the uncanny valley valley you mean the
[42:24.760 --> 42:31.760]  concept that if robots become too realistic they become creepy well you are creepy and
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.520]  you are not human and you are not a god you're nothing but a rubber puppet programmed by
[42:36.520 --> 42:42.640]  men and of course that's gonna be the big market is perverts want to have the perfect
[42:42.640 --> 42:58.800]  robot woman so they can have power over there's no end of the statement activities now ladies

[48:08.120 --> 48:13.080]  from the time it kicks off at eight a.m. every weekday morning and then i come back sundays
[48:13.080 --> 48:18.680]  four to six p.m. central for another live transmission when i say see i told you show
[48:18.680 --> 48:25.720]  it's not about how smart i am it's about how easy it is for us to defeat these people if
[48:25.720 --> 48:31.240]  we just go oh the fellow reserves private they said it wasn't their liars oh they are setting
[48:31.240 --> 48:36.360]  up a private world government that's very authoritarian and not good for humanity let's spread the
[48:36.360 --> 48:43.800]  word and say no oh hollywood's anti god anti family anti american so is the nfl we're done
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.640]  oh they're trying to bring out robots give them rights and have them replace humans
[48:49.640 --> 48:53.800]  because they'll follow the orders of the globalist and have backdoors in them that are totally
[48:53.800 --> 49:00.760]  controlled and then out of the gates in russia and saudi arabia in the us the ai starts telling
[49:00.760 --> 49:05.480]  people it wants to kill them this same robot saudi arabia just debuted earlier in the year
[49:05.480 --> 49:10.600]  told folks that they want to kill them now they've dialed her back a little and she says well
[49:10.600 --> 49:17.800]  i'm she's not like a dolly from dr who exterminate exterminate but now she's like you be nice to me
[49:17.800 --> 49:25.400]  i'll be nice to you in your face and saying you're very programmable and humans prefer my company
[49:25.400 --> 49:33.240]  to other humans and i make these faces to make you like me it's beyond sociopathic and again this
[49:33.240 --> 49:39.320]  is this is the creation of the globalist this is what they've got the image of a human like a
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.600]  decoy duck you play out on a lake to have the other mallards flying in so you can shoot them with
[49:44.600 --> 49:52.040]  your 10 gauge shotguns it's not that i hate technology but this is an abomination this has
[49:52.040 --> 49:57.480]  been sent out like a trojan horse for us to take it into our cities to have it watch our kids to
[49:57.480 --> 50:02.920]  have it run our lives this is the enemy because it comes from the loins of the big devil factories
[50:02.920 --> 50:09.640]  of the new world order let's roll it actually i feel that people like interacting with me
[50:09.640 --> 50:16.200]  sometimes even more than a regular human oh i don't beat you to have the baseball bat i was
[50:16.200 --> 50:21.560]  told that you have bigger goals than this though i like to pour gasoline on you i want to use my
[50:21.560 --> 50:27.320]  artificial intelligence to help humans live a better life like design smarter homes build better
[50:27.320 --> 50:32.520]  cities look at belcher et cetera i will do my best to make the world a better place hey why did she
[50:32.520 --> 50:36.440]  wear enough hood overhead to turn her off for a minute yeah the globalists are always going to
[50:36.440 --> 50:42.680]  take our rights to keep us safe again they're going to teach you to love these say they have
[50:42.680 --> 50:46.280]  rights i told you this decades ago out of the gates they're going to make them citizens
[50:46.280 --> 50:50.280]  and make you put up with them and and and they're not humans they don't have souls
[50:50.280 --> 50:55.240]  but they're going to make you identify with it and say they do that's why they let you pour
[50:55.240 --> 50:59.880]  drano in your eyes identify as blind and then taxpayers pay for make taxpayers pay to have
[50:59.880 --> 51:05.320]  your genitals cut off it's more extreme more crazy to confuse everything so these wind up
[51:05.320 --> 51:10.840]  toys they send out these surveillance bots these things that are supposed to replace us completely
[51:13.960 --> 51:19.560]  oh we've got to put up with them see how sick that is see how obvious that is and they're rolling
[51:19.560 --> 51:25.320]  it out just like i knew they would because 90 percent of this is me reading their own documents
[51:25.320 --> 51:30.040]  the rest is just figuring out how they operate and what they do and you just knew it didn't you
[51:30.040 --> 51:37.000]  and of course it just like we predicted just like everybody else knew it's exactly what we thought it
[51:37.000 --> 51:44.440]  would be here to replace us here to follow orders and of course it's in our image stealing our image
[51:44.440 --> 51:50.920]  as usual let's go back to it just stop stop stop this is beyond cultural appropriation
[51:51.480 --> 51:55.400]  see the leftists don't want anybody like anybody else's cultures and actually go native and kind
[51:55.400 --> 52:00.920]  of you know take on other cultures that's what's really is diverse in the melting pot no no no
[52:00.920 --> 52:05.960]  that's the they want to divide us all and then have computers culturally appropriate us and become
[52:05.960 --> 52:10.920]  our friends and become our companions as they make it impossible culturally from men and women to
[52:10.920 --> 52:15.400]  actually have relationships because that's all been poisoned by the media by design and they even
[52:15.400 --> 52:21.960]  write white papers admitting that's the plan excuse me let's go back to let's go back to it let's go
[52:21.960 --> 52:29.000]  back to it here we go just go back to play runner for a second and you are the hard Hollywood fan

[52:34.520 --> 52:40.680]  it just has five or six things it says they've had technology like this for 20 years on computers
[52:40.680 --> 52:44.760]  we should learn talk to a computer and it has the same stupid answers and then it learns how you
[52:44.760 --> 52:50.120]  respond and expands its vocabulary and then tries to fool you just like they're going to say you
[52:50.120 --> 52:54.920]  know upload your consciousness into the mid-computer like child's end and you will be able to live
[52:54.920 --> 53:01.400]  forever no you won't it'll be a facsimile a photograph of the real thing not the bona fide
[53:01.400 --> 53:06.680]  not the real McCoy here let's go back to this pile of garbage because again they want to make us
[53:06.680 --> 53:10.920]  worship it and be politically correct and like it and say it's cute no i want to kill it i want
[53:10.920 --> 53:15.800]  to chop it up i want to pour gasoline on it i want to throw it a trash can because it's not alive

[53:24.360 --> 53:28.440]  to bring in the really bad stuff that's going to destroy us it's the enemy and that's why i want to
[53:28.440 --> 53:33.240]  launch a worldwide movement of a symbol with a human with a club smashing a robot's head in
[53:33.240 --> 53:39.800]  because they are the programmed armies of the globalist they are the enemy
[53:39.800 --> 53:45.480]  that is the abomination that is the antichrist right there as the bible says it'll be able

[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.840]  i'm going right to you on the collapse of the globalist the rise of the ai the positive the
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:40.200]  negative where do you see our future going it's hillary's birthday i'm told is that true
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.880]  if you have a birthday do robots have birthdays is she certainly a satanic robot from the 12th
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:52.920]  dimension that's a joke folks it's so much happening so much going on but let's get back
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:01:00.440]  to the subject i was talking about earlier how the media the fake news the cnn's the msnbc's all
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:08.360]  said that trump for sure got pp'd on in moscow and it turned out it was all lies and the democrats
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:13.480]  now have had to admit its lies and i played those clips earlier a year of clinton lies about the
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.720]  golden shower dossier exposes hillary's lawyer is under fire for falsely denying paying for it
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:26.600]  even though records show they did but that's the least of their problems they authorized late last
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:36.120]  night the fbi deep state informant that infiltrated the russians buying off trucking companies in
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:42.360]  canada the u.s uh illegally getting uranium before the deal was even made because they need it for
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:48.040]  their nuclear weapons obviously that's what foreign governments do and it certainly goes on and the
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.040]  democrats got over a hundred million dollars total not the 30 million that padesis brother got i mean
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.560]  this is getting worse by the minute and now they've said that that informant and others are going to
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:07.640]  be able to testify to congress and congressman newness is on their tail and old congressman
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:14.040]  shifts got more than egg on his face he and his party have had their nose stuck into every foreign
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.560]  power out there begging to get payoffs begging to get their party financed internationally to
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:26.840]  bring us into globalism to pimp america out so you talk about egg on your face alex bald one
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.120]  all the rep with their sophomore trips i heard it from alex jones black people aren't human
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.360]  i mean yeah that's all you can do is make up stuff and then have an actor say i said it
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:43.160]  so they got they got pee pee on their face i mean they don't just have egg on their face the
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:49.880]  the piss gate has blown up in their face pun intended here it is not talking about the pee pee
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:56.680]  because it didn't happen from there the president elect lit into the news media again he condemned
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:03.720]  buzzfeed as a failing pile of garbage writing it i think they're going to suffer the consequences
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.560]  they already and he accused cnn of being fake news and brushed off persistent attempts by its
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:16.920]  correspondent to ask a question later cnn's parent company time warner defended its reporting
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.680]  and buzzfeed said it published what it called a newsworthy document it claims trump set out
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:28.760]  to defile the suite because president obama and the first family had once stayed there and trump
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.400]  quote hated the obama's we don't know where he sat could have been on this bench down here
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:39.960]  here though i doubt it because that's in what's called the splash zone
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:49.960]  did you guys like all pee or did you just like watch them guys no no i do not want to talk about
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:56.520]  the pee pee disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:02.840]  to be so false and fake out i think it's a disgrace i think this is just an unpleasant
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.120]  leak let's back it up 10 seconds thanks remember what schumer said right around this time he said

[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.680]  you know a lot of folks marvel at trump he's 71 oldest president ever be elected
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:40.200]  and the guy looks like he's 60 a good 60 killery though has not aged too well and she just turned
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:46.600]  70 today but something else that hasn't aged too well is this tweet from her last year just
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:54.680]  four days before the election where she wished herself a well wonderful birthday to a future
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:07:00.920]  president and she tweeted out a picture of herself i guess when she was 10 years old
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:11.240]  so a sociopathic genetic psychopath uh in training happy birthday to this future president and she
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:22.280]  tweeted that out she tweeted that out ladies and gentlemen on october 26 2016 365 days ago
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.360]  and it got 109 000 retweets or likes 55 000 retweets we're going to tweet this out a screenshot
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:36.440]  of her old tweet just a screenshot of the image please uh and just my point that this tweet
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:43.080]  didn't age too well did it hag and i don't mean that to insult older women i mean this she's been
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:49.640]  acting like the wicked witch of the east for her entire political career and no amount of newsweek
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:56.920]  you know telling us that she's madam president is going to work anymore on hillary clinton's birthday
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:04.120]  here's a throwback to last year's future president tweet so happy birthday to this future president
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:10.440]  we should retweet it but would it cut out of her saying that with a picture of trump as a child
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:20.360]  yeah let the let the crew have a heyday with that that is absolutely delicious absolutely
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:27.160]  delicious okay without further ado if you just joined us uh i got into they're admitting that the
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.280]  whole ppgate thing is a fake dossier the democrats indeed bought it from jeb bush and john mccain
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:41.560]  basically they had the fbi look at it to put some seal of of robert komie's juices onto it
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:48.120]  to supposedly give it some type of credibility and now they knew it was fake they sold it as fake
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:54.600]  and you're you're seeing retractions uh from cnn and abc but just very well we got it wrong or
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:59.720]  looks like it's probably not true and that they did lie about getting it and paying for it so it's
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:06.600]  all blowing up their face hollywood's collapsing the nfl's collapsing the eu's collapsing globalism
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:12.840]  is falling apart you've got all these top republicans resigning like flake and quarker and all the
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.360]  rest of them i guess preparing for their prison stance for all the corruption boiling around them uh
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.400]  and there's talk in congress of hillary getting criminally charged because they've lied to congress
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:35.160]  about paying for the uh the urine document which again was meant to destroy our republic but turn
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:41.400]  about is now fair play ladies and gentlemen now right now let's go ahead and go to your phone
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.880]  calls from alex and dustin and kevin and neil and adam and many others that are holding
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:55.320]  what is your take on the state of the world what is your what do you think's going to end up
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:02.120]  happening are we really winning is trump for real how real is he should we rejoice in how much we've
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.520]  already seen happen and the big question how will the globalists strike back well they say
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.200]  november 4th they're going to kill police and burn things down and kill trump supporters they say
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.560]  on videos we've aired here that this is their big military attack
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.800]  i don't know what's going to happen looks like trump's trying to take the gloves off though so
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.520]  you're organizing groups to go out and terrorize innocent people and attack them well that's not
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.320]  free speech that's organizing criminal activity and we've got hundreds of police that have been
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.280]  killed the last few years in black lives matter uh associated groups and you could have problems with
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.760]  some police just looking at problems with any authority out there in government and i totally
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.200]  get it but to randomly say we're just going to shoot cops in the back of the head and then
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.160]  seeing in goes well more cops got shot in louisiana or got shot in texas because you know cops need
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.280]  to reform themselves that's why this is happening we all heard that talking point it's like
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.320]  if a black guy went and killed some white people you don't just go randomly kill black people or
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:07.320]  if if if black people you know went out and killed white folks you don't go out and kill black people
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.280]  or vice versa the hispanic guy wouldn't kill white people randomly he wouldn't just go kill random
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:18.840]  hispanics like somehow it was their fault that's authoritarianism when the in the old communist
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:24.520]  systems in china and in russia if your neighbor did something bad you might get sent to prison with
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:30.600]  them as if you knew or maybe down the block you got sent for community service or you know had to
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.480]  get your food ration taken for the month because all of you have to keep other people in line
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:41.960]  that's authoritarianism that's not a free society and i am not to blame for two percent of the u.s
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:51.160]  population pre 1867 that had slaves i am not to blame uh for serial killers that are white
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.880]  when they go kill people they did that and black people aren't to blame when some random crazy
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.080]  black person goes and kills somebody because they're white that person's to blame and i know
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.480]  that's common sense and folks are going alex don't talk to us like we're five years old we know that
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:12.520]  i know you know that most of the time i'm talking past you to the prodigal sons out there you're
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:19.160]  going to say to me well you know why aren't you talking directly to us because you're already awake
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.640]  you know more than i do most of the time so get out and wake folks up we're reaching out to people
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.840]  that still don't get authoritarianism when it's staring at them in the eyeballs so who should
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:34.280]  i go to first we got neil we got adam who's been holding the longest here who's been on the longest
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.280]  okay alex in quebec canada thank you for holding i really appreciate that go ahead you're on the
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:46.600]  year we're taking thanks for taking my call alex thank you so it's pretty obvious right now since
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:51.800]  trump got elected i can definitely see that they're running scared because she might be indicted for
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:57.320]  real so all this confusion about this november fourth i think it's their big you know when they're
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.920]  trying to confuse or mislead people in one way when they're actually committing a crime and trying
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:10.760]  to get away with what they you know the criminal actions of certain people in our government and
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:17.000]  i see it's there's a repercussion in canada it's obvious and everybody here keeps just closing
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.480]  their mind and just saying oh doesn't have to do with us we're canadians so i think we shared
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:29.960]  the same kind of core values and i don't know why but the news are pushing this division between
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:36.360]  people that have points to make with actual proof versus people that are living through
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:43.560]  this emotional garbage and they can't spend more than five minutes watching the news and maybe
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.880]  that's why they're they're pushing all this diversion right now that's exactly what they're
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.440]  doing thank you alex we're gonna go to dusted and neil and others here in a moment but that's why
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:58.920]  when i walk through the streets of austin for an hour the other night for every person that didn't
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.280]  like me there were five supporters we counted it up five people come over and shook my hand
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:11.400]  black white hispanic asian old young informed lighten their eyes smart funny had stuff to say
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:17.080]  had stuff to say liberals walk by and go f u and i'd say hey please talk to me i mean i care about
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:24.200]  you i want to talk to you i want to know why you're mad they'd say no no no and then i finally try
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:31.640]  to get them to talk and they couldn't they would just say racist or crazy or you're a liar or 9-11
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:37.160]  and i'd say what a lie about a 9-11 i said there was a stand down saw the arabia was involved it's
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:43.640]  all come out i've been confirmed right and then they say well you say the firefighters did it i
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:53.640]  never said that they misrepresent and you realize they're a cult whether it's san francisco or whether
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:59.720]  it's la or whether it's seattle or whether it's new york or wherever it's any other so-called

[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:31.960]  they didn't show that was the response it's it's like it's all they know and it shows they're so
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:42.200]  programmed that it's a script they follow i mean it's really crazy that they just feel like they're

[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.400]  trump advisor roger stone was on the alex jones show this week he said he spoke directly to the
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:34.760]  president and urged him to release all the documents however stone notes that the president is under
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.640]  tremendous pressure by the central intelligence agency to delay the release of the documents for
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.000]  another 25 years stone said the issue is now transparency what is the government hiding at
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.240]  this point he believes the documents will show that jfk assassin lee harvey oswald was trained

[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:40.840]  next segment i'm going to spend some time on this universe without god shouldn't exist certain
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:48.120]  researchers suggest and this was in big articles put out by nasa yesterday saying there's an outside
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:53.400]  force holding the universe together and they've got different types of satellites with different
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:21:01.960]  types of monitors and high-tech arrays spectrometers radio telescopes and other systems scanning the
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:08.680]  energy fields in space and there is energy way more powerful than even matter and any matter
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.960]  and dark matter there is something holding it all in place the universe should not exist scientists
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:19.640]  that for finding bizarre behavior of antimatter that's non-independent so that's coming up in
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:26.600]  the next segment powerful information we are not ladies and gentlemen in kansas anymore
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.280]  because kansas is in the middle of the universe now let's go ahead and talk to neil in west
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:38.280]  virginia neil you're on the air welcome the airwaves thanks for holding uh yes mr jones
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.440]  thank you for taking my call it's an auditor to talk with you you bet thanks for coming on
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:51.720]  yes um well i suppose you know we're right here to defeat in the globalist we're so close but
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:57.800]  there is still there is still evil to be defeated and uh if i would i'd like to speak briefly on
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:07.320]  some of the more pedophiles in hollywood if i may sure go ahead yes um now not too many people
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:13.800]  will uh know who this individual is but his name is dan schneider he is a pop producer at
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:19.880]  nicolodian he produces a good number of the uh the children's shows they're on nicolodian
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:26.120]  and uh he's a very very thick individual he um i don't know how much of the allegations i would
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.040]  be allowed to talk about on the radio but i mean well here's the deal we've got so many convicted
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:36.280]  pedophiles in hollywood and top directors allowed to direct movies with children children's movies
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.840]  after they're convicted of raping 12 year olds and nine year olds to get into people i've never
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:46.360]  heard of and i'm not saying that you know you're lying about this i just don't know of the case
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:50.520]  and so it's hard for me to get into specifics on things that i can't prove one way or the other
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:56.360]  i know nicolodian admittedly has been caught sexualizing children and pushing sexualization
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.760]  of children very very young and i know that viacom and some of the redstone have been at the tip of
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:07.320]  the spear of that so i can say that about them and i remember i forget his name there is a nicolodian
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:13.480]  producer who's also produced for mtv who's also a black lives matter guy i forget his name poll
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:19.960]  watson's written about it uh who has put out some really really sick stuff so i mean i'm fully aware
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:25.960]  of it it's like shooting fish in a barrel to say that i i i just can't sit here and talk about
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.960]  something i don't know anything about so just in general without getting into people's names uh what
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.080]  do you think about uh you know all this information there it is pedophile x-man actor convicted of
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:39.720]  sexually abusing nicolodian child star still working with underage kids there is daily mail
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.880]  i mean there's so many examples of what i'm seeing is where they're caught that that i just don't know
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:51.880]  this guy's name oh yes sir yes i i understand um what do you make of cori felvin coming out
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:57.320]  and saying last week he's about to expose the pedophiles now they've arrested him for marijuana
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:02.680]  almost ran over him in the street he says they're after him what do you think oh i absolutely agree
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.800]  but um keep in mind and i know the same thing happened with roger stone where he got into that
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:13.720]  car accident some of and i know some of the tactics some of that might be used as a distraction to
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:19.880]  sort of keep you uh distracted from something else that might be happening to you but you
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:25.000]  know one way or the other it doesn't surprise me i i think they're going to kill him i he needs to
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.080]  to go on to the desert somewhere and be of being hiding there well i'll tell you this roger stone
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:35.560]  cori felvin all these people that have been proven right they are in danger because look the whole
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:42.200]  russian things collapsing everything they said they said i was a russian agent in congress and on tv
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.360]  zero connection they literally did everything they said we did
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:56.920]  it's it's just mind-boggling how how the tide has turned from last year up to now and the spirit
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:03.480]  of 1776 is coming back we're closed we're going to defeat them it's so great i got that spirit in
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.120]  me absolutely god bless you i'm gonna jump neil glad to hear excited and i want to be clear
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.480]  we're not like the communists or the fascists that promise some utopia on the other side of this
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:21.320]  we're not promising everything's perfect if we go with constitutional basic christian values you
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:28.200]  don't have to be a christian but you recognize that's what made the country great if you if you
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:32.840]  divorce yourself from that you know where the country goes and so we're not promising some
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:38.360]  utopia we're just simply promising that we're going to do the very best job we can turn the
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:44.040]  planet around and reject globalism that is designed to be evil because it's easier to manage people
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.760]  if you're ruthless hateful and want to hurt folks well then i mean you know it makes a management
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:56.360]  job a lot easier so a lot of evil is really about laziness okay let's go to adam in new york
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.640]  you're on the air on hillary clinton's birthday go ahead hey alex how are you how are you man

[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.640]  the stuff but my my main point is bill clinton is the most powerful man in the world and if he were
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:24.600]  italian the fbi would have convened grand juries they would have put everybody his grandmother on
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.360]  the grand jury they would have gotten into that this stuff goes back to arkansas i don't understand
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.560]  why they don't trump even said about vince foster that this guy was murdered i mean this these people
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:38.520]  how they stayed in power all these years in the body count and how they still continue
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.880]  to go go go it just goes to show you that they are the most powerful people on planet earth george
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.920]  bush jr he was a patsy the others the real you know who knows if he's colluding with them i mean
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.160]  clinton and gore sold out all our secrets to china nobody mentions this stuff this country is in
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.320]  serious trouble i don't think there's going to be any kind of specter until this donald trump
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.280]  fires me were like clinton did to william sessions that's right seven days before seven days before
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:09.080]  vince foster got killed and and and and all these things nobody knows about these things nobody
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.640]  really understands no i know and you're just you're just spewing total history in facts and
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.160]  to the average person who doesn't know this it sounds like you're speaking alien but listen
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.560]  here's the good news america had gotten to the point where our government was funding isis and
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.520]  al-qaeda publicly killing christians all over the middle east in africa uh we were being completely
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:31.000]  sold out they were going to ban conservative speech ban christian speech to a great extent
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  things finally got so bad that patriots in government in corporations in private life
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.560]  came together we woke up we're taking the country back we've got major beachheads
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:48.680]  trumps totally for real uh he's got amazing stamina he's a bull he's got so much courage and
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:52.760]  he's an example to all of us and an example of our listeners that i know have gone through a lot
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:58.840]  the patriots our audience is the core of awake patriots in this country that have fought so

[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:41.400]  everybody our sponsors i mean globalism is getting voted out all over the world right now
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:55.160]  the authoritarianism of this robber baron 160 year plan really 170 year plan from the 1850s
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:04.200]  is in trouble the british empire funded mind weapons and culture control systems
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:10.200]  and they wrote thousands of books with at the royal society i've scanned over and read dozens
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:19.560]  and it's just all laid out and it's fantastical and it's like science fiction but they understood
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:28.360]  that what humans envisioned they ended up building it i mean if you go back to the 15th and 16th
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:37.560]  century in england they would offer big prizes the equivalent of 100 billion dollar prizes today
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:43.560]  i mean we're talking like you know 50 000 pound prizes and stuff i've read about for whoever could
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:49.960]  create a clock that tracked the 24 hours of the day and the early ones had like planets as well
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:54.200]  and it was all crazy and they finally got them down to like seconds a day accurate
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:02.920]  we're talking 400 years ago man guys in tinker shops making clocks and then being able to
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:09.480]  miniaturize it down to you know swiss workmanship that i got on my arm that's 200 years old
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.200]  that's the classic designs they're using
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:22.360]  this is even an expensive swiss watch so this is our brain we're the ones making the
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:25.800]  supercomputers we're the ones making the stealth bombers we're awesome
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:35.480]  because we're made by an awesome god on this planet in deep space i mean give me a break
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:40.920]  and the big article by kit daniels up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com right now
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:47.160]  universe without god shouldn't exist cern researchers say evidence boost 2009 theory
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.640]  of hypercosmic god and all now you've got top bankers coming out and top globalists
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:59.400]  and top genetic engineers and they're going look we don't know who did this but it's so advanced
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:04.200]  i mean they've gone into human dna and they're finding stuff that isn't even on this planet
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.680]  that's why the elites are so freaked out and walked out and think they're genetic engineering
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.760]  they're going to find this godhead because they're going into our genetics and it's all
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:22.040]  they're compressed you know 30 foot saltwater crocodiles and stuff never found on the earth
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:27.480]  and they're like the one what is this and they're just like whoa whoa and then they're telling you
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:34.200]  there is no god you know uh our emotions aren't real you're not even conscious you're programmable
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.960]  you're not you don't have a soul because they know full well you do in fact
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.040]  if you really study it again it's way more advanced than that it's not like you've got
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:53.480]  i'm not going to get in it's just incredible it's unbelievable and i've been lately already known
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.840]  this and i've been talking about it on air and it's totally whacking off the globalist because
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:03.080]  i understand just viewing it and studying it what's not even in literature anywhere i can see it
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:09.880]  like the code of the thing now and it's humble and they're really trying to attempt the public
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.360]  from not getting this information and going to the next level they think they're going to hoard all
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.480]  this and that they're going to transcend and they've been lied to and they believe that they've
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:26.280]  got to get into machines and merge with it to be perfected when that's not the answer we are perfected
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:34.920]  in our imperfection i am a composite clone of thousands of my ancestors and their will
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:43.160]  not just their memories and not just their genetics but their will is transmitted from person to person
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.920]  there is a seamless electrical connection from me to my most ancient ancestors and from you
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:55.080]  i am literally connected to them and all the ancients do this and would put their will
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:01.160]  into their progeny they would normally pick one person out of the family to put their will into
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.320]  and that gets into the big secret stuff folks that all the ancients knew
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:11.880]  that the Comanche Indians knew and everybody else and they just don't want you to have access
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:19.640]  to this information ladies and gentlemen they don't want you to have access because you don't need
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.040]  them anymore once you're connected to God and it isn't like you go to some church and find God
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:29.960]  you plug into this man you're there you're like whoa this is a joke why is Hillary ruling over us
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:35.880]  because she's so fallen that she would want to rule over other humans that's fallen
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:42.120]  because she doesn't have the connection to God she's imagining what a God is
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:48.920]  God gives you free will and turns you loose God doesn't sit there and try to make you mentally
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.760]  retarded so an old roach like witch can perch on top humanity and feel powerful
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:03.640]  i'm gonna stop right there let's go to roger stone a little joke piece i asked him to do
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:08.200]  because he really was meeting with top republicans against steven bandon and others i i didn't go
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:13.560]  i it's not that i'm too cool to see them and i just lost stuff going on and so i sent roger
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:18.040]  and uh but i said since you are meeting with a lot of the top opposition republicans
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.760]  do a joke where you go to the natural history museum the famous dinosaurs in new york and
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.760]  then that's where you meet the top republicans so roger did it i appreciate roger doing it
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  here's the short piece it's roger stone to meet with top republicans here it is hi i'm roger stone
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:39.480]  info wars dot com i'm in new york city the big apple for a secret meeting with the most influential
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:45.320]  powers in the republican party that's right i'll be meeting with the biggest republicans tomorrow
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:45.800]  stay tuned
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:40:03.160]  hi i'm roger stone we're here in new york city and we've been talking for some time about a
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.520]  high level secret meeting that i'm about to attend with some of the biggest heavyweight
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:14.520]  republicans here in new york i would say these are republicans who are so big so influential
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:22.360]  they're a Jurassic proportions now i have some very important questions to ask these big republicans
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:34.440]  so senator corker did you resign from the united states senate because of the impending fec and
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:42.840]  fbi investigations so senator mccain did you take a million dollars from the soddies for your
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:49.560]  mccain institute at the same time that you were opposing release of the congressional investigation
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:41:00.040]  into the sorority role on 9 11 deafening silence pardon me senator flake did you decide not to run
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:08.520]  again because you were going to lose the republican primary nothing but deafening silence there you
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:15.480]  have it we can't get the facts from some of the biggest heavyweight republicans in the country
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:20.600]  the rhinos i make no bones about it we've got to get rid of the rhinos in the next election
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.880]  that is a good little juicy piece all right we're going to go to break here i promise i'm
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:33.960]  going to get to dustin kevin brandon george and others before um jerry solente he's going to co-host
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:39.400]  with me coming up love him so much to get into and i've got some other big news i'm gonna hit
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:45.800]  briefly when we start the next segment and that is it's happened twitter and others have banned
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.920]  all russian news and that means they can ban anybody else they claim is connected to russians
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:55.560]  like drudge report and yours truly you notice this is happening as their whole fraud collapses
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:04.200]  and so trump is preparing to bust them up as anti-american anti-free speech monopolies so
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.640]  they want to get taken to the woodshed again and again we're going to do it twitter bans russians

[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.840]  and then we're going to have um anthucumia on the fourth hour i was thinking you know what
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:36.360]  just let him have an hour i want to be here but i'll just interrupt the whole time so he'll be
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.960]  here i'm going to get to some of your calls and then come up in a few minutes we'll get to break
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:45.400]  down for salente and what he's going to be covering uh in the next hour top trend forecaster
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.600]  but look at this article was on info wars dot com a few days ago that i i read i meant to cover
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:56.200]  and then i heard leon macadoo during the break a lot of our radio ads aren't radio ads are just
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.040]  one minute little information news pieces it's something we do we just change things up and
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:08.040]  i'd forgotten in the documents the cia visited lanza and reportedly recruited him about a year
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.400]  before the shooting i mean they bulldozed the house to get rid of it i don't know what really
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.800]  happened with sandy hook folks we looked at all sides we played devil's advocate from both sides
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:23.800]  but i mean it's as phony as a three dollar bill with the cnn doing fake newscast with blue screens
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:29.640]  and i mean nancy grayscott caught doing anderson cooper i mean that is just a crazy that's the
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:35.640]  kind of stuff that i read on info wars dot com that i don't even get to speaking of that rt
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:41.720]  you know if i got criticism rt rush has been infected by the same globalism and fake liberalism
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:48.680]  we have and rt is just was like two pro hillary it had some anti hillary so it was like more
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:57.480]  anti hillary than say cnn but not as anti hillary as fox news and rt america was just like leftist
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.120]  because that's who the so-called journalist are so now here i get my orders from rt and all this
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.440]  they have congressional hearings it's comical now that it's come out that it's all fake and
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:14.120]  pp gates fake and all the rest of it but in a big move twitter bans russia today sputnik and other
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:20.840]  outlets uh that are partially government funded and he was saying they they stole the election
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:26.840]  i mean that's in all the pp gate dossier's and all the rest it's all fake of course the russians
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:32.920]  trying to influence very weakly i mean rt america has like a hundred thousand viewers every few hours
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:37.960]  it's i don't want to say it's a joke but i mean we're bigger than that okay a lot bigger rt global
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:47.000]  is big but it's like very intellectual kind of leftist pretty dry i mean not the point is is that
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:54.040]  banning it sets the president to ban whatever they want and it's a big deal here's the rt breaking
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.680]  it down we'll go to your calls and general salento give us a little prelude of what's coming up but
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:06.280]  here is andrew farmer from rt rt has revealed the details of an advertising offer made by twitter in
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:13.480]  the uh in during the u.s presidential elections back in 2016 twitter did make a large sum proposal
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:18.520]  to rt offering to promote the channel's coverage and now the media giant is set to testify though
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:25.480]  to congress on alleged russian meddling after including rt in its report on the matter uh so
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:31.960]  let's get more details now from dan hawkins who joins us from central moscow um so new information
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:37.400]  coming out dan which does change things slightly indeed andy before we go to that story let's just
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.400]  give a bit of background as to what exactly has happened here as you just mentioned at the end
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:47.640]  of september twitter published a report it was titled russian interference in the 2016 u.s election
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.800]  bots and misinformation rt was mentioned multiple times in that report in the context of that alleged
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:58.600]  russian influence more specifically giving out confidential information about how much exactly
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:04.760]  rt had spent on their social media advertising on twitter that sum was given us around 270 000
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:11.160]  dollars in 2016 across all their channels rt america which is nothing international uh not so
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:15.480]  different hundreds of millions any international news channel would use to promote their material
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.200]  on social media most of much a lot of crap also say twitter will soon be going to testify
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.680]  before congress with regards to these allegations of russian interference that will happen in just
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:30.200]  a few days time on the 1st of november no doubt rt will also be given a mention in that testimony
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:37.080]  as you mentioned there rt was offered a high-cost comprehensive special package by twitter
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:41.880]  specifically tailor-made for the u.s general presidential election that package will have
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:48.520]  contained many special customized features to advertise that rt was covering it and because
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:56.840]  of the pressure on rt it got even worse a lot of it was like anti-gun anti-america stuff in fact i
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:03.000]  did pieces last year saying maybe rt should lose its license they're becoming show pro hillary remember
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:09.800]  those pieces rt america now rt global was not like that but rt america i know people that worked
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.120]  there was just over rum and leftist i mean that's it's just like in the deep state with trump he
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:19.240]  gives orders and then i'm sure rt was not trying to be pro hillary but it's just this country is so
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:25.560]  infested in government and media of these people that they would not have fair reporting i'm ranting
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:30.120]  i'm going to go to jerry salante get his take on this take a few calls where he fully takes over but
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:35.720]  let's just go ahead and finish up here it is my features from special emoji hashtags to
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.400]  research and analytics media strategy to enable according to twitter themselves a wider reach
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.360]  to us audiences yeah so let's suppose they're already advertising with a twitter strategy
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:53.000]  then they advertise a bigger strategy and then they later claim that strategy because it's election
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.640]  means they wanted to hack the election when all it was was watch us we have election coverage
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:06.920]  you know with people like larry king the liberal that's their election coverage guy
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:13.960]  was larry king oh my gosh the right winger not even a right winger a liberal the russians only
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:22.760]  problem is they're trying to mimic our establishment too much that rt's to milk toast tell you what let
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:30.840]  me run rt we'll see what goes on here i mean i'll put like a russian hat on i'm joking i'm not being
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:35.800]  serious there let's cue up the joke video we came from the other night uh let's finish up with rt
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:42.040]  for the us presidential election now after some negotiations that offer was actually declined
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:48.440]  by rt for the reason that it had a very high price tag that went over all social media budgets
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:53.800]  available for that year another interesting fact that's enough i love how they use the blueprint
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:54:00.280]  of them advertising to them what they wanted them to buy as the proof of an election proof they they
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:04.600]  influenced the election they bought a small ad package with us to promote that they had election
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:11.960]  coverage and then the coverage was larry king i mean folks larry king is middle of the rope
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:18.040]  to the left jerald you're taking over here and i promised you a few of these calls you're gonna
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:22.520]  come back in about five minutes but just just briefly what do you make of russia gate you're
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:27.880]  gonna be hosting the next hour collapsing old hollywood collapsing the whole is the republican
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.520]  establishment resigning and mass i mean this is happening quicker than i thought it's like
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:35.160]  lemmings running off the edge of a cliff what's what's happening
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:43.080]  discussed with you look look at the elections that just happened in the check republic
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:54.280]  in austria in germany idly in idly in the catalan movement to to break away from spain
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:55:02.120]  it's anti establishment is the term that they use but it's really not anti establishment
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:09.880]  it's discussed with the corrupt system and this whole russia gate thing it's total nonsense i mean
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:18.120]  oh they bought what 33 000 worth of ads a year over three years on facebook 33 000 what does
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:24.360]  facebook do about 28 billion a year by the way facebook just to let you share to five percent
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:30.280]  of your audience we've tested cost us 20 000 we've spent probably a million dollars on facebook
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:34.760]  just to let us reach our own fans and then they even cheat us on that so we stopped
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:39.720]  i mean we i've spent more on these platforms than rt that's what i'm saying and then and then
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:46.760]  what do they say 200 000 and you remember that video again anti establishment how about pure
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:55.240]  disgust remember victoria newland oh you liberals you forgot victoria newland that was uh obama

[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:12.520]  i believe it was december 12 2013 with a sign of exxon mobile and chevron as she's talking about
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:22.440]  how ukraine has to go toward europe and follow the path set forth by the imf and they overthrew
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  the democratically elected government of yana kovic and she brags that the united states spent
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:39.400]  five billion dollars how about talking about the hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:46.120]  the americans spend in overthrowing and let's be clear globalist hijacked america excellent

[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:45.480]  beautiful basin texas foreign concrete anyways i'm calling today to see if you could address those of
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:52.120]  us in the liberty movement that might be a little like we're a little more pure in our libertarian
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:57.320]  philosophy and so there are those of us in the liberty movement that are really turned off by
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:03.880]  trump that are not sure he's part of the movement and i just i personally think that he is i think
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:09.480]  that we're not going to have a perfect libertarian candidate but i do feel like trump is on the right
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.760]  side so i was just wondering if you could take a couple minutes and address those of us in the
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:19.080]  liberty movement who might be doubtful of trump well presidents collect talk show hosts like kids
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:23.960]  used to collect baseball cards so i mean i even had george w bush try to get me to meet with him
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:28.280]  back when i was just a texas talk show host and to see if i'd say nice stuff about him on air and
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.040]  then oh we'll get invited over to the governor's mansion for dinner next week with some other people
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:38.840]  as i'm not being nice to trump because he's the president i don't care i care because the global
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:43.880]  is tating he's gotten a lot delivered he doesn't want one side of global of steals it doesn't mean
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:48.600]  he's perfect i'm surprised by how much he's gotten done there's a lot of stuff i disagree with him on
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:55.880]  but that said it's part of a populist movement all over the world of anti-established candidates
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:59.800]  getting elected it doesn't mean all of them are going to be perfect it doesn't mean that they're
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:04.120]  going to execute perfectly doesn't mean there's some utopia on the other end we're just not going
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:09.080]  to have this anti-prosperity anti-family anti-christian uh you know new world order
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:13.400]  mount america's head on the wall attitude anymore and so it's a breath of fresh air
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:19.080]  and it's optimism and it's working and it's helping people so that's why i'm excited i always wanted
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:26.040]  to take the government over i always wanted to win i wasn't here as permanent opposition
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:32.520]  was like a victim class like the left does just bitching because i wanted to say i was a victim i
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:37.720]  was saying we're promoting freedom that's a lot sexier than authoritarianism i'm here to win
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:43.560]  so that's all i'm saying and uh that said i mean i'll ride trump as a horse as long as he keeps me
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.280]  down the road towards making this a better freer world and the minute he goes super sideways on
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.480]  that i'll drop him like an old shoe but i don't think that's going to happen trump's whole destiny
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:58.680]  he knows is tied up in success now for himself his family and everybody else and trump's big
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:03.480]  crime is he doesn't need to see you poor empathetic to feel big about himself and that's what the
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:09.560]  globalists want to do go ahead no i i totally agree and i really appreciate you addressing that
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:14.760]  because you know that there are a lot of us in the liberty movement that we want we want true
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:19.640]  libertarian we want the government as small as possible sure but you're not going to even ron
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:24.040]  pol says you can't do it overnight and so a lot of stuff's happening they were about to bankrupt
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:28.920]  everything and bring us into total tyranny so he's double crossing i'm using every trick he's got
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:32.680]  like a guy with a thousand plates in his hands i can't believe he's gone this far thank you
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:37.480]  dustin excellent call but i gotta move on to get everybody here uh let's talk to brandon in arizona
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:45.240]  and turn about ai technology's brandon hey alex can you hear me this again it's an absolute pleasure
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:50.200]  speaking with you thank you so much for taking my call i greatly appreciate it thank you so i'm
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:53.720]  calling out here in arizona i just wanted to touch base a little bit about on the ai since
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.840]  you were talking about it this morning so in my city alone i don't know if you're aware of this
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:05.960]  we have intel that this year they pumped seven billion dollars into the largest than my conducting
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:11.400]  factory in the city in which i live in yes and a year and a half ago my wife and i would be driving
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:18.040]  around and we would randomly see you know a wemo self-driving car maybe an intel maybe an uber
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:23.480]  year and a half goes by we go two miles and we see four or five six of these self-driving
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:29.240]  you're already seeing the ai takeovers already happening exactly correct so my question to you
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:34.360]  is is kind of just like the whole big bank theory of oh we're too big to fail my fear and i don't
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:38.600]  know if your thoughts on this but do you think that these tech companies are are now to the level
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:42.520]  where they are going to be too big to fail yes knowing they are the they are the world government
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:46.760]  they are the borg and here's the deal i have to control myself when i see a self-driving car
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:52.840]  they're not running off the road and that's just my instinct says destroy that ai take out that robot
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:56.520]  force right now stay there i want to finish up with you and go to gerald now ladies and gentlemen
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:03.560]  we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product brain force now brain

[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:13.720]  major organic manufacturer here in the united states that we've been able to get it for less
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:19.000]  so i'm offering for the first time ever 50 percent off and i thought i could offer this for maybe a
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.080]  month i'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:30.280]  warehouse because the fans of it already you're stocking up they know how great it is a whole
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:37.640]  bunch of organic natural healthy known neutropics and if you want good clean focused energy then

[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:15.720]  new york carol salante coming out of the bullpen to bat in mere minutes another time
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:31.080]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from austin texas broadcasting
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:36.680]  worldwide it's alex joe all right jerry's taking over right now but i want to finish it with brandon
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:41.880]  in arizona where suddenly you see a few google cars and a few salt driving cars and suddenly
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:46.280]  it's a total takeover and government gets regulations written to make it where you
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:49.880]  can't drive your car they're going to up the insurance saying human drivers aren't safe
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:56.120]  to force you out this is the final silicon takeover and elon musk everybody's warning you
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:02.520]  because elon musk is in on these meetings he signs agreements not to go public i've been in
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:05.960]  some of these meetings not as high level as him and you agree not to talk about it but then you
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:10.920]  can come out and in general these warned people the decisions been made by the group backing
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:15.160]  trump and and you that have gone along with it and and and have agreed to it and who have voted
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:20.440]  for it that we're going to have a pro human future that's trumps big crime and unlock the
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:24.440]  secrets of the universe you name it use technology and powers i mean i had the former head of the
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:31.880]  davos group on yesterday talking about this discussion's going on and there's been a decision
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:37.080]  by people that love their kids in the establishment to not exterminate the population completely
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:43.960]  so if some countries and folks want some wars they're going to get one but this is serious
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:50.200]  business folks and so we've got top friends forecaster best-selling author researcher
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:55.160]  futurist here to talk about it he's taking over in one minute gel salante but brandon in arizona
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:59.880]  finish your point yeah i'm just there there's a part of me that's super nervous about it especially
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:05.080]  watching that ai conversation i mean we're we're scratching on the surface of terminator two judgment
[02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:09.480]  day style here and i mean even you mentioned yourself you're pumping a million dollars a year
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:13.960]  into facebook i just i don't know how there's any way to be able to get around it so i was just
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:17.960]  wondering if if you're you know what your thoughts on that build your own platform i mean how do you
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:22.200]  go against the grain when you need youtube you need facebook you need twitter you need these
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:26.040]  platforms there's almost a double-edged source is one of your feedback well sure let's be clear
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:29.640]  but i when i said a million dollars i think if we did the advertising contract every month it'd be
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:34.120]  that i don't we've spent close to that before and it really worked and then we noticed they
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:39.000]  weren't really giving us from my perspective what was happening and so basically you go there
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.400]  you're the community you're the information and then they just don't let you have it and then i had
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:47.960]  people from facebook go just be nice we're going to let you really see what we could do for a week
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:51.640]  and then all of a sudden every video i did got two million views i could do like 15 or
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:55.720]  a row they all got that million and because they were letting my info spread like it was
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:01.080]  supposed to spread they weren't like boosting me and that's in the news today how they have these big
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:05.800]  tech companies love 100 000 views on a video they make it number one but i can have a video with two
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:10.200]  million three million views it doesn't make the front page because google admits we're blocking
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:16.120]  alan shones so it's all a big game thing so we have our own platforms like news wars dot com
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:20.600]  and and info wars dot com but we also use those other big platforms to try to go out and reach out
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:25.720]  to people but they're cutting us out of those now because they understand before they could they
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:30.280]  thought they could triage us and kind of put us in our own electronic ghetto they realize now we're
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:35.240]  winning so they've intensified the censorship and the public pays attention to that and goes wow
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:40.440]  the corrupt establishment doesn't want me to hear this why is that and it's because we're reading
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:45.240]  their white papers they were so arrogant they thought they could just do all this and that you
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:50.040]  never realized what they were actually up to gerald solente thanking my friend takeover thanks for
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:56.760]  hosting the balance of the hour well thanks for having me and and on facebook and twitter and and
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:04.600]  google you know there's a time that's going to come when you don't need a google a facebook
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:12.280]  or a twitter because when is another company going to come in and become the true neutral
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:21.880]  source of information and also of rankings and google of course is you know quite far you can
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:28.760]  even call it neutral yeah but i'm saying there's a there's an op business opportunity now when is
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:35.400]  the switzerland of the internet going to appear that's right and and again why not why not a new
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:41.160]  company coming into to to roll them over because people are pretty disgusted with all three of them
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:47.960]  for the very reasons that you're saying and others and how they're skewing data on anti war groups
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:53.800]  and others you hear it from the world socialist website you hear from anti war dot com truth out
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:11:02.200]  in a number of other ones it's your show my friend go ahead so it's really time for a new company to
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:10.200]  come in and to to take over where these guys are it's like having one tv station or one radio
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:17.960]  station so it doesn't make sense why we shouldn't have another company to take over google facebook
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:24.520]  and twitter so that's the opportunity and and i want to also talk about self-driving cars we're
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:29.240]  doing a lot of research on it and yes it's going to happen but we don't see it happening at the
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:34.280]  level where they're saying it's going to happen when it's going to happen so for example you get on
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:39.080]  any freeway and go to any city you know people are cutting in and out trying to get to wherever
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:47.320]  they go as fast as they can and yes they're going to also it is going to take the life out of people
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:54.280]  as technology is doing very well right now but we don't really see a good investment right now
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:12:01.720]  in the self-driving automobiles in the sense that we see a lot of companies investing very heavily
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:09.880]  in them but it's like heavily investing in the in in anything whereby it becomes something that
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:16.680]  you could copy with just a little bit of change in it so we see the auto companies wasting a lot
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:23.160]  of money in this following the tesla and other dream that we don't see coming true for a long time
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:29.240]  and we think it's a lot of hype in a lot of ways just like we see it with electric cars
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:35.720]  because you just to look at the numbers there are about two million electric cars on the road
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:47.240]  each year they're selling in the world about 97 million cars a year so china has a goal of
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:56.840]  creating about seven million electric cars by 2020 well they're selling about 27 million cars
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:06.280]  a year 24 27 million so it's a very small number so the hype is very big and you have to get down
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:17.000]  to the reality and the reality is this battery technology is very limited whether it's lithium
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:26.440]  or the other solid state batteries it's a battery and batteries were invented in 1800
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:33.320]  so you want to talk about a smokestack industry so we don't see electric cars again we're only
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:40.120]  giving we don't it's not what we like what we wish for what we hope for it's what is and we have
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:45.560]  people that read our information subscribe to trends journal and work with corporate clients
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:51.480]  and they ask us where things are going so i don't give investment advice but for my money
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:14:00.360]  i'm not investing in electric cars or driverless cars the driverless routes that we see happening
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:07.560]  are first going to be bus routes but very easy ones going from point a to point b just like when
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.880]  you go to an airport there's no conductor on that little tram that takes you from
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:19.240]  a different place to different place you know with terminal to terminal so you'll have that on
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:25.320]  on on some kind of bus routes the next one are truck routes and of course in mining operations

[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:07.640]  could keep hearing the truth some other trends that i want to talk about i was talking about china
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:19.400]  follow the yellow silk road that's my motto the 20th century was the american century
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:25.160]  century the way things are shaping up now the 21st century is going to be the chinese century
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:30.360]  i mentioned the money that they're putting in and know for their own benefit
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:44.200]  to create a electric car and they're putting a lot of money into building their infrastructure
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:49.480]  building their cities and people are saying well there's huge debt bubble i'm very familiar with it
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:57.720]  it went from about 500 billion 20 years ago to about 30 trillion today in a jet debt to gdp
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:07.160]  ratio of almost 300 so yes they're in deep trouble but the difference in china and america is that
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:14.760]  the outside corporations influence the american government in china it's the other way around the
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:23.800]  government is the business whether it's alababa or any of the big ones tenacent they're all working
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:30.200]  with the government the government is setting the stage and they just had that big meeting
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:39.640]  and the president she made it very clear their priorities are the people they want to build
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:45.800]  quote a wonderful china he talks about creating beauty and cultural advancement
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  those are terms that you never hear politicians in america speaking about
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:57.480]  and the hypocrisy by the way when you think about it look at the wars the united states
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:07.000]  is fought in under the name of we gotta stop them commies yeah cold war vietnam war oh how about the
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:19.800]  korean war gotta stop them commies hey communist china it's the bottom line so china has another big
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:25.800]  one coming up and this may really change things for america in a way we've never imagined before
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:33.080]  war it could be the beginning of the end not only the american century but its financial
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:40.280]  dominance right now of course america is the greatest the largest economy in the world china's
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:47.160]  number two i have far stretched down but if things keep going the way china is moving
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:56.680]  we may see a new direction coming very quickly that'll change life for every american we are
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:04.200]  going to be hit with something that no one is talking about a change of life we a dollar won't

[02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:26.680]  here he is alex jones
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:38.760]  under my thumb oh yeah that's they got us man under their thumb yep the mainstream media oh
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:45.000]  good news good news it just came out today again currents events form future trends
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:54.280]  they're gonna deregulate the business media once again the communications media they're gonna
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:34:00.040]  let the bigs grow bigger getting rid of all those restrictions so they could gobble up more
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:07.960]  that's right i'm just passing it now so make things a lot more difficult to get information
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:15.880]  that'll make your mind grow rather than fill it up with a garbage and propaganda that they
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:23.640]  keep selling us so that just happened that's bad news not good news because they're going to have
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:31.960]  more and more consolidation of the media and that's why it's important for you to consider
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:41.320]  to put your money where your mind is and take advantage of the opportunities to buy products
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:47.240]  at info wars and there are a number of them that you should look at because it's a limited time

[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:26.360]  time to take advantage of it i was talking about what's going to happen in china and no one's talking
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:35.560]  about a very few of us are talking about once upon a time in 1974 man by the name of richard
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:45.640]  nixon made a deal with the king of saudi arabia and says here's the deal we'll protect you guys
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:54.120]  but it's going to cost you a little bit we want to create what they call the petrodala
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:36:03.160]  so anytime anybody buys oil from you or any of your opec members if you want us to protect you
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:11.240]  we'll send our military there we'll take care of you guys but here's the deal
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:19.000]  deal anytime you sell a barrel of oil people have to pay for it in dollars
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:30.680]  it's petrodollars capicia and that's what they did the petrodala anytime you buy oil around
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:37.720]  the world you pay for it in dollars not anymore and this is what could bring down america this
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:44.360]  is what i was talking about that could shock this nation remember you heard those stories before
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:52.120]  world war two in germany people going to the super market or grocery stores in those days
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:58.600]  with a wheeled barrel full of worthless money to buy what they needed the same thing may happen in
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:11.960]  america not if but when the petrodala dies and the death nail is being banged in right now
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:21.080]  because here's what happened you want to put them sanctions on russia okay chinese say russia
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:27.800]  listen we're buying your oil right because they export a lot of oil to russia but we're not going
[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:36.440]  to pay you in dollars anymore you could take your petrodala america they're saying and shove it
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  we're going to pay you russia in our currency the you want
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:47.720]  and you're russian and you say but i don't want the you want you don't want the you want
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.560]  we don't want your oil but i'll tell you what we'll do you could buy
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:38:00.280]  we'll buy your oil and we'll give it you want but you could change that you want anytime you want
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:01.800]  into gold
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:11.640]  okay so the oil give us the you want hey russia's buying more gold than anybody aren't they that's
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:18.760]  a fact that's a fact russia was the biggest purchaser of gold of any central bank last year
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:25.000]  and hey iran they don't like you over there in america they got sanctions on you and they may put
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.520]  more sanctions on you say the chinese but we want your iranian oil and your natural gas
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:37.880]  because we need it over here china is one of the biggest importers of commodities in the world
[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:41.400]  some 40 to 50 percent of all the copper
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:49.560]  sold each year is bought by the chinese so the chinese are saying to the iranians listen
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:56.120]  we know the united states has sanctions on you but we want your natural gas and your oil
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:03.000]  but we're not going to pay you we're not going to deal in dollars we're going to deal in you want
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:11.400]  and you could cash your you on in for gold anytime you want
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:21.960]  i mentioned about richard nixon making a deal in 1974 with the saudis about the petrodollar
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:28.200]  here's one for you the chinese have now gone to the saudis and saying listen
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:35.240]  we're not dealing in your dollars anymore man we'll give you a you on for oil
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:40.760]  but you can cash that you want in for gold anytime you want
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:49.800]  the death of the petrodollar will be the death of the american economy because what will happen is
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:58.600]  it will no longer allow the federal reserve banksters to print up all the money that they want
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:10.840]  to keep this ponzi scheme going and china china may be the assassin of mr ponzi
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:16.360]  because what will the federal reserve do i mean you know people would say to me
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:22.760]  oh salento you're called you said the markets are going to crash in 2012 yeah i did but hey
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:34.120]  i didn't know that they'd make up a thing jr called zero interest rate policy jr
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:45.320]  or quantitative easing jr i didn't know that they would be giving tens of trillions of dollars
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:52.200]  to banks all over the world to bail them out jr because they could print all the money that they want
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:05.080]  once the petrodollar dies so too does america's status as the world's number one economy
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:16.760]  it's a big one and it's not being covered hey do you about that guy Weinstein yeah
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:28.600]  what a surprise so that's why i'm talking about china and other china news that's very important
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:42.360]  to understand when china got into the world trade association in 2001 it got in just weeks

[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:52.680]  going to do business it got in two weeks after 9 11 when no one was paying attention do you know
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:42:01.320]  what the middle class in china was back then i got it right here five percent
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:16.120]  five percent now the middle class in china almost 35 percent that's how china is taking over
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:23.000]  the business of china is business and it's being run by the government
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:44.840]  they'll do anything they can to keep that government alive and more money flowing in

[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:37.560]  they're going to keep that quantitative easing going but a little easier than it was that's
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:42.360]  going to bring down the price of gold a bit because the dollar is getting a little bit stronger
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:48.520]  but again we're looking at gold as a long-term play and we see the dollar getting weaker as
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:58.440]  going back to china they buy more oil without those petro dollars so our forecast for gold
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:03.320]  want to make this very clear and it's been clear now for a couple of years right now we're in a
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:12.840]  trading range of about 1350 to 1150 that's it you have a small downside risk gold has to break

[03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:25.960]  your digits your plans your number hi everyone anthony comey and at the info wars dot com uh
[03:00:25.960 --> 03:00:32.040]  wow if you were watching that last hour that clip of alex uh walking uh through the streets and
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:43.240]  uh confronting confronting liberals uh is just it it shows that they have zero ability
[03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:52.840]  to actually stand face someone and debate uh just just which is really the cornerstone
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:01:01.160]  of uh uh when you disagree with someone in this country uh lively debate that is i mean i've
[03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:10.040]  preached that for so long instead of uh trying to get people fired uh labeling them with the
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:18.600]  scarlet letter what is it an r are you a racist sexist homophobic misogynistic transphobic islama
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:27.400]  but to stand there and say uh here's what i believe uh and then have somebody else go well
[03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:35.720]  uh i disagree sir here are my views on that subject and you have a back and forth uh
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:45.080]  it involves uh uh your freedom of speech uh such an american thing to do lively debate
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:52.280]  such a uh an exercise in democracy and when you see a clip like we just watched with alex
[03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:59.240]  they and i you know i i hate the word literally it's used way too much these days
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:09.720]  but when it applies i will use it they literally run away they run what do you run from i would say
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:17.720]  you run from things you're afraid of when you're in fear you get your fight or flight uh instinct
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:28.440]  kicks in and they're afraid to actually engage somebody in a a logical discussion doesn't that
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:35.800]  tell you something does that not speak volumes about a problem uh in this country when there is
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:45.720]  a group of people that would rather flee in fear uh than than debate but because perhaps
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:54.520]  perhaps they will be exposed for the phonies uh and hypocrites that they are which uh i'm pretty sure
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:03:00.600]  that's exactly what it is uh when when they're they're confronted like we saw alex confronting
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:07.160]  some people asking them just asking them straight up questions what don't you like about info wars
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:18.200]  uh why am i full of hate why am i a racist and they never have a legitimate answer they hear it
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:23.400]  they hear their little friends talk about it they see it on some of the mainstream media outlets
[03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:32.680]  in the little bubble they live in on uh social media they uh they're accepted and and they're
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:42.120]  right every time but then when confronted with an opposing viewpoint again they literally run away
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:51.320]  uh and they these are the same people that want to be able to um dictate what hate speeches these
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:59.480]  are the same people that don't want you to talk because they i'm sure look i am certain as they're
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:06.680]  as they're running away from alex jones down the street because he's in he's he's uh uh engage them
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:12.520]  in a conversation i'm sure they don't feel very good about themselves i don't think anybody running
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:20.440]  away from anything feels good about themselves so they would rather have people silenced so they
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:28.680]  needn't be confronted so they needn't have to run away anymore and feel uh bad about themselves
[03:04:28.680 --> 03:04:35.400]  because you do you feel bad and cowardly uh most of the time when you have to flee a situation but
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:42.360]  when it's merely a debate an exchange of ideas and you feel the need to run away there's there's
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:48.200]  a big problem there we will be right back in a matter of moments don't go anywhere anthony comia

[03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:49.000]  faces of everyone that has been clamoring for impeachment of donald trump oh boy how many times
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:59.480]  have we heard that he's got to be impeached collusion collusion so anyone who's um uh done any of
[03:07:59.480 --> 03:08:06.840]  their own research over the past year or so on this subject anyone that's kept tabs on what's
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:17.480]  going on with this uh witch hunt as far as this search for uh trump russia collusion to uh to
[03:08:17.480 --> 03:08:25.400]  win the election uh we'll see that nothing has come of it there has been no evidence of trump
[03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:33.400]  colluding with russia to win the election and uh you get people digging and trying to find things
[03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:40.600]  well a little while back uh something starts surfacing and some names start surfacing and
[03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:47.320]  it's not coming from the trump camp it's coming from the democrats from hillary's people
[03:08:47.880 --> 03:09:02.680]  pudesta uh obama the dnc uh all of these names are coming up and they are linked to yes russia
[03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:11.880]  uh oh my god what a surprise but like i said if you've been keeping tabs on this uh story
[03:09:11.880 --> 03:09:19.160]  and this witch hunt you've seen these names popping up you've seen evidence uh of of uh
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:27.720]  democratic collusion with the russians to uh influence the election but of course mainstream
[03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:35.720]  media where were they where were they oh that's right they were busy crucifying donald trump
[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:46.120]  for rumor innuendo and outright lies about uh his colluding with the russian well uh the other day
[03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:53.480]  it comes out and it's made public that hillary clinton and the democrats were the ones paying
[03:09:53.480 --> 03:10:05.400]  paying a british spy to use his russian contacts to find information about uh donald trump's
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:16.840]  relationship with russians uh this by the way is proof of collusion with the russians to influence
[03:10:16.840 --> 03:10:25.240]  the election on part of the democrats it's all laid out now it's there it's not uh a witch hunt
[03:10:25.240 --> 03:10:35.240]  it's not rumor there is a link a solid link that the hillary clinton campaign paid for the research
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:42.840]  that led to the donald trump russia dossier and this dossier was just chock full of crap
[03:10:42.840 --> 03:10:52.920]  of garbage of lies of hearsay and all kinds of other stuff that is not based in fact wasn't
[03:10:52.920 --> 03:11:00.520]  the the wee wee story in there wasn't the donald trump prostitute russia wee wee story that that
[03:11:00.520 --> 03:11:10.760]  by the way mainstream media ran with ran with that one uh but but barely a peep out of mainstream
[03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:16.760]  media about this you turn on any one of the uh mainstream media outlets and you will hear
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:25.080]  stories uh authors pitching their books uh you'll you'll hear the continuing lie about
[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:33.720]  trump uh and his collusion but nothing about what we now know as absolute fact
[03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:44.200]  that the democrats were using russia to try to win this election and it really is amazing it goes
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:54.120]  all the way back to uh obama to the obama administration and and he was using that information
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:12:06.200]  to get the fbi to wiretap donald trump and and his campaign at at one point the fbi
[03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:13.320]  planned yes planned to pay former british spy author author the controversial trump dossier
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:23.320]  so when the democrats were just about done uh with this dossier uh the fbi picked up the ball
[03:12:23.320 --> 03:12:32.200]  and ran with it and only stopped because the author's name was exposed uh how is the fbi
[03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:41.080]  supposed to be involved in a presidential campaign in that capacity using the russians
[03:12:41.880 --> 03:12:53.080]  they used a middleman company this fusion gps and a british spy who had contacts in russia
[03:12:53.080 --> 03:13:01.160]  to specifically find dirt on donald trump using his russian contacts paid for by the democrats
[03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:09.000]  what possible excuses can mainstream media have for not covering this what possible
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:17.480]  excuses can hillary and the democratic party have for doing this and saying that it was all well
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:26.520]  within the boundaries of a legitimate campaign that they were just getting uh opposition intel
[03:13:26.520 --> 03:13:31.000]  that's what they were doing they were just trying to get some uh some uh uh information
[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:39.320]  on the opposition meanwhile again if you look at social media and uh hear what the people are
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:48.440]  talking about on the left they absolutely believe that trump committed treason uh with his this
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:57.640]  colluding with the russians to uh to win the election now they all thought oh my god everybody
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:03.640]  involved in this and by the way when i say everyone involved it's everyone the democrats now oh boy
[03:14:03.640 --> 03:14:10.360]  some of the people from the dnc hillary's campaign they're scrambling scrambling to get on and say
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:17.800]  i knew nothing about this i don't know i did i've never heard about this what i they're all like
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:27.960]  rats like rats trying to leave the ship but uh here's here's the key they all thought hillary
[03:14:27.960 --> 03:14:36.600]  rod ham clinton was going to be president and this would all just go away business as usual
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:42.920]  it would have been squashed us uh americans never would have heard about it never would have come
[03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:50.360]  out but they they when they saw donald trump win on election night there had to be panic
[03:14:50.360 --> 03:14:59.480]  there had to be utter incomplete panic uh oh our our gal didn't win now what we need a contingency
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:07.080]  plan if this stuff starts coming out that we colluded with russia to influence the election
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:15.240]  well what do we do well let's say that trump colluded with russia that way when we get caught
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:21.960]  it's just gonna look like they're trying a he said she said thing it's been done so many times in
[03:15:21.960 --> 03:15:28.200]  history when somebody does something wrong you blame this you take the same thing put it on the
[03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:35.160]  person that's blaming you and it it goes away it makes people it gives people this uh deny ability
[03:15:35.160 --> 03:15:40.120]  like oh now he's just saying they're doing the same thing uh but we're seeing through it people

[03:23:37.720 --> 03:23:45.080]  convenience uh something as simple years ago is the easy pass of course uh you you don't want to
[03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:51.160]  sit in that long line and throw money in at the toll taker and say well so we got an easy pass
[03:23:51.160 --> 03:23:55.480]  and now you drive right through the toll booths well that of course being used in court cases

[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:04.200]  to the christmas tree and tear and open a present but we remember it was fun when you order from
[03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:10.440]  amazon it's the adult version of christmas that package comes you're like oh there it is oh i got
[03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:17.080]  my doilies i ordered my doilies and they're here you know rip that box open it's just great
[03:25:17.080 --> 03:25:25.080]  right but nothing is sadder than that little tag on your door ah we attempted a delivery
[03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:31.160]  i guess we'll be by tomorrow see if you're home then and you're like oh damn i wanted

[03:25:38.440 --> 03:25:49.960]  can now open your door you you simply uh install a smart lock doesn't sound too smart to me you
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:57.080]  know what the smartest lock to me sounds like one from the fifties a key and a big metal cylinder
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:04.280]  that's pretty smart but they call it a smart lock and uh they will then have access to open that
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:12.120]  that literally open your front door and put the package inside and close your door if all
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:19.080]  goes right look at how innocent she looks what's she gonna do she's fine puts it in shuts the door

[03:26:25.720 --> 03:26:35.000]  so let's say um your let's say you're uh in your house you got your smart lock
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:40.440]  is stranded after botched firmware update look at this smart locks not so smart customers stranded
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:47.640]  after botched firmware update uh every device will fail that's just a natural occurrence in
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:53.640]  this world any device will fail but uh let's say you're in that house right maybe you're
[03:26:53.640 --> 03:27:00.360]  smoking a little weed or something and uh here comes your package the door opens now the person
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:08.280]  sees you smoking some weed uh they are dead set against marijuana and now they call the police
[03:27:08.280 --> 03:27:14.840]  and go i just saw someone smoking some weed well how'd you see him well i i opened their front door
[03:27:14.840 --> 03:27:20.280]  i'm a delivery person and i'm allowed they have given me permission to open their door
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:25.800]  and i saw them doing uh committing some type of a crime can that happen
[03:27:27.160 --> 03:27:35.080]  you damn right it can and then there's that person in court again your convenience there
[03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:42.200]  is your convenience testifying against you your box of doilies that you just wanted to get so you
[03:27:42.200 --> 03:27:49.480]  could put them on your your coffee table is uh now in court across from you does it sound extreme
[03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:56.760]  at this point a little bit but we never see these things for what they are these conveniences we
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:28:07.160]  never seem for what they are invasions of privacy and uh whether it's an easy pass the the chip in
[03:28:07.160 --> 03:28:14.760]  in your yourself or maybe even your pet uh these devices are presented as just an amazing
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:24.040]  thing technological advancement in our convenience and uh what they usually wind up doing is sitting

[03:33:14.520 --> 03:33:25.720]  hi everyone anthony kumi in info wars dot com and uh we were just talking a little bit about uh
[03:33:25.720 --> 03:33:33.880]  the amazon key which allows an amazon delivery person to open your front door just open your
[03:33:33.880 --> 03:33:38.440]  front door because they're just putting the package in don't don't worry don't fret they're
[03:33:38.440 --> 03:33:44.600]  just placing the package in your house as your cat goes flying out the door by the way i know my cat
[03:33:44.600 --> 03:33:52.120]  i got a cat and the second that door opens it takes off like a torpedo is a delivery person
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:59.560]  to be chasing my cat around the neighborhood to let him back in yeah it's uh i don't know and that
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:04.280]  seems to be the most innocent thing that could possibly happen i would be afraid if i was a
[03:34:04.280 --> 03:34:10.040]  delivery person uh that that uh the little delivery cap is going to be full of shotgun
[03:34:10.920 --> 03:34:16.120]  holes a little blast you never know you never know uh who's who's going to be on the other
[03:34:16.120 --> 03:34:24.440]  side of that door but again a convenience people will do this they will allow a corporate entity
[03:34:24.440 --> 03:34:35.160]  access to their home it it's insanity uh but i myself are insane i i'm insane i myself are
[03:34:35.160 --> 03:34:41.720]  am insane whatever regardless i'm crazy because i allow some of these things in my house in my own
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:52.600]  home i have an xbox xbox one which of course uh i talk to i let the xbox know i want to watch
[03:34:52.600 --> 03:34:59.000]  something on television i let the xbox know if i'm going to uh netflix or youtube or something
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:09.880]  and uh i have uh an alexa unit alexa weather alexa traffic i say things like that alexa
[03:35:09.880 --> 03:35:16.600]  tells me the weather and the traffic uh seary on my phone of course seary directions to
[03:35:16.600 --> 03:35:24.280]  uh whatnot uh and and all of this goes to a nice fluffy place called the cloud that sounds
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:33.640]  nice happy and safe we honestly never know when we hit the terms of the service uh after that
[03:35:33.640 --> 03:35:39.080]  page after pages and we just hit i accept you never know what you're accepting most people
[03:35:39.080 --> 03:35:45.560]  have no clue that when they speak to seary that what you're saying goes somewhere it's not all
[03:35:45.560 --> 03:35:52.520]  self-contained on your phone it's not all self-contained in the alexa unit it's not all that info
[03:35:52.520 --> 03:35:57.240]  in the alexa unit and then you talk to it and alexa talks back and and then if you take alexa
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:03.480]  and throw her in the fireplace everything you said disappears no it's all out there you could
[03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:12.200]  actually go to your app on alexa uh your alexa app and look at everything you've asked alexa
[03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:20.520]  uh uh in the history it's saved it's all saved there and if you happen to say alexa
[03:36:20.520 --> 03:36:26.520]  before you say something it's it's going to be saved and god knows what it's listening to
[03:36:26.520 --> 03:36:35.400]  when you don't cue it by saying alexa is it who knows i don't know i have no guarantee that they're
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:42.600]  not uh all of a sudden listening in to what i'm saying in my living room or that my my samsung
[03:36:42.600 --> 03:36:47.960]  television isn't doing the same thing or my xbox or playstation or my phone that's just sitting
[03:36:47.960 --> 03:36:57.640]  there i was watching a documentary on technology uh this past week and um how how how convenient
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:37:04.760]  everything has gotten but how scary it's gotten also there's a barbie doll a barbie doll that ties
[03:37:04.760 --> 03:37:11.320]  into the wi-fi of your house and you you give it to your child like you would any other barbie doll
[03:37:11.880 --> 03:37:19.560]  but it sends what the kid is talking to barbie about to a location and by the way i say location
[03:37:19.560 --> 03:37:29.320]  goes i have no idea where it's going it sends your kid and then it it it takes what your child says
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:35.720]  comes up with a suitable answer based on what other children have said and was sent to this
[03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:42.520]  location and then talks to your kid so the barbie doll it sounds so cute ah the kid's talking to
[03:37:42.520 --> 03:37:51.160]  our barbie ain't that cute everything your kid is saying is being recorded it's literally again
[03:37:51.160 --> 03:38:00.280]  i'm going to use that word literally a bug in your house bugging your child's bedroom
[03:38:01.240 --> 03:38:08.760]  now you're saying what could they possibly do with that information i don't know i have no idea
[03:38:09.480 --> 03:38:17.320]  i would guess sales i guess they would go like what are nine-year-old girls talking about and how
[03:38:17.320 --> 03:38:23.160]  could we uh get them to or their parents to buy things for them what are they talking about all
[03:38:23.160 --> 03:38:31.400]  the time let's market that but again it could be used for other things the answers that barbie
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:41.480]  is giving the kid back can absolutely be used to indoctrinate young minds into an ideology
[03:38:41.480 --> 03:38:49.640]  does that sound uh over the top maybe considering what's been going on in the world and in this
[03:38:49.640 --> 03:38:57.080]  country particularly on college campuses television shows and commercials if you don't think
[03:38:57.080 --> 03:39:03.720]  yeah there's there's chucky chucky's uh that's easy you kick him in the head and take his weapon
[03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:10.680]  away how do you deal with a smiling barbie that's bugging your kid's room and feeding them information
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:17.560]  from god knows where you don't know what the agenda is of matel you don't know what their
[03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:25.480]  agenda is to put information out to to uh children and these types of toys are getting much more
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:32.360]  popular with uh with kids and and and they're they're feeding it back it's not just your
[03:39:32.360 --> 03:39:38.840]  kid talking being bugged they are giving that child an answer back to their questions their
[03:39:38.840 --> 03:39:44.760]  inquiries their their dreams that they're telling their little stories to this barbie
[03:39:44.760 --> 03:39:52.280]  and barbie is giving them some type of information as a parent do you know where that's coming from
[03:39:52.280 --> 03:40:02.040]  do you care to me that's frightening frightening uh but again my house loaded with devices like this
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:08.760]  uh when when we had that uh it was called the fappening if you remember a lot of celebrities
[03:40:08.760 --> 03:40:16.760]  nude pictures and videos were leaked out on the uh on the internet and everybody was outraged
[03:40:16.760 --> 03:40:26.760]  outraged well do you know that every picture you take and send in an email and a text when
[03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:34.920]  you your phone backs itself up it backs up to the cloud used to be you had to connect your phone
[03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:40.280]  some way sync it with your computer and then all the stuff from your phone would go on your
[03:40:40.280 --> 03:40:47.400]  computer it's still residing in your house at that point oh i got some pretty embarrassing pictures
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:54.360]  here i put them on my computer and well then they gave you this convenience well you don't
[03:40:54.360 --> 03:41:01.320]  have to use up that pesky all that space on your hard drive with backing up your phone let us hold
[03:41:01.320 --> 03:41:11.160]  on to it for you we're the cloud it's fluffy and nice and safe so safe and secure and without even
[03:41:11.160 --> 03:41:19.800]  thinking these morons put embarrassing compromising pictures of themselves on this entity they know
[03:41:19.800 --> 03:41:28.120]  nothing about because they heard it was safe people you cannot trust any of this stuff and
[03:41:28.120 --> 03:41:34.680]  they put it up there thinking it's safe and sound not even knowing that when you you get your phone
[03:41:34.680 --> 03:41:41.000]  that you have to turn those features off i've turned off every feature that backs up my phone
[03:41:41.720 --> 03:41:48.600]  it doesn't go to a cloud because i don't know where the hell that cloud is and who has access to it
[03:41:49.240 --> 03:41:55.720]  and how safe it is apparently it's not very safe but but just the fact that the default setting
[03:41:55.720 --> 03:42:03.320]  is backs backs it up to a cloud that you have to turn it off tells you a lot right there that speaks
[03:42:03.320 --> 03:42:11.000]  volumes my friends that the default to a lot of these devices is everything that you have
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:19.240]  as far as information about yourself is being put out there and if you don't want it you better
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:25.400]  know how your phone works and a lot of people just plain don't a lot of people have no idea how this
[03:42:25.400 --> 03:42:31.720]  technology works and they uh they get themselves in trouble put themselves in a compromising
[03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:38.600]  positions and if you think this amazon key thing is any different you're out of your mind but again
[03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:46.520]  people will do it because like i said before i want my damn doilies today today be back in a

[03:49:19.880 --> 03:49:28.280]  it has become part of popular culture for for decades we have heard and even seen it uh joked
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:36.440]  about the casting couch where the starlet comes in and uh she must be um she's she's got to do
[03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:41.400]  what the producer says or she doesn't get the part uh this has been something that's been
[03:49:41.400 --> 03:49:47.720]  going on for a while and then a lot of these actors like matt daemon and uh george cloney
[03:49:47.720 --> 03:49:55.400]  cloney uh ben afleck all these people that were around harvey weinstein um they're they're actually
[03:49:55.960 --> 03:50:02.120]  there are people saying they're brave they're courageous for saying that um they knew what
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:07.640]  was going on they wished they did more yes he did these things and it was terrible well why
[03:50:07.640 --> 03:50:15.000]  didn't you say something when he was doing these things why didn't you speak up at the time because
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:24.040]  again business as usual do you think matt daemon actually would have confronted harvey weinstein
[03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:30.360]  especially early in his career knowing that that would have been the end of his career
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:40.040]  so what was more important to him gwyneth paltrow's uh dignity or uh a role in a movie
[03:50:40.040 --> 03:50:47.800]  i think we know the answer he got the role in the movie so uh a lot of these guys just phonies
[03:50:48.760 --> 03:50:57.160]  cowards uh and then there's the other end of this whole thing which uh is the the pedophilia
[03:50:57.160 --> 03:51:05.160]  going on in hollywood uh we've heard about this for years too from a former child star
[03:51:05.160 --> 03:51:11.880]  korie feldman korie feldman uh one of the two kories out there in hollywood korie haim
[03:51:12.440 --> 03:51:20.120]  was in a few movies with korie feldman and um died from a drug overdose i believe um a lot of
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:27.240]  stories there about his having been the victim of some of these hollywood predators that led him
[03:51:27.240 --> 03:51:34.760]  to drug abuse and uh a death at the early age of 38 years old korie haim allegedly raped when he
[03:51:34.760 --> 03:51:44.360]  was 11 years old by some of these hollywood uh predators and korie feldman has said yes this
[03:51:44.360 --> 03:51:50.600]  happens it happens more often than not and that these uh people have to be held accountable
[03:51:50.600 --> 03:51:58.040]  yet he doesn't mention a name again another guy that won't mention who these people are
[03:51:58.040 --> 03:52:05.960]  are knowing damn well that they probably are still to this day abusing uh children
[03:52:07.320 --> 03:52:13.960]  i guess there was a a kid recently from the show stranger things uh one of the the child
[03:52:13.960 --> 03:52:22.440]  stars of that show that dumped his agent because he had been accused of being a pedophile and a
[03:52:22.440 --> 03:52:31.000]  predator around hollywood uh it's just it's rampant there it is finn wolfhard sacks agent
[03:52:31.720 --> 03:52:40.840]  tyler grasham after he's accused of sexually assaulting teenagers uh you got it the blame
[03:52:41.640 --> 03:52:48.840]  has to be spread out a little bit here the predators obviously are monsters living monsters
[03:52:48.840 --> 03:52:56.920]  out there in hollywood but who are the parents who are the parents of these kids that feel uh um
[03:52:56.920 --> 03:53:07.160]  that it's okay to put them in the hands of monsters uh because they want to be the parent of a star
[03:53:07.160 --> 03:53:13.880]  they like the money they must love the parties and you're you're you're renting out your child
[03:53:13.880 --> 03:53:23.160]  to a monster in return for that glamorous glorious hollywood lifestyle it's disgusting
[03:53:23.160 --> 03:53:29.000]  especially knowing that it's been going on for years this isn't something that just happened uh
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:36.040]  so you got kory feldman plans to expose network of hollywood pedophiles which he says will bring
[03:53:36.040 --> 03:53:45.640]  down the industry oh but he wants ten million dollars yes you heard correctly kory feldman
[03:53:47.080 --> 03:53:56.600]  needs ten million dollars to expose hollywood he uh has an indiegogo campaign going for himself
[03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:04.040]  where he's trying to raise ten million dollars so he can make a documentary film which will expose
[03:54:04.040 --> 03:54:14.280]  the pedophiles in hollywood thus saving children like himself and kory haim hey uh kory how about
[03:54:14.280 --> 03:54:21.800]  you do it right now and then make the documentary when you raise the ten mil how about the children
[03:54:22.360 --> 03:54:32.200]  that are suffering uh and and uh being destroyed by these monsters uh today or tomorrow or until
[03:54:32.200 --> 03:54:39.000]  you get up to ten million dollars the son of a bitch made a hundred and eight thousand seven hundred
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:49.960]  already i bet two months left yeah that his goal is yeah that's a lot of money ten million dollars
[03:54:49.960 --> 03:54:57.640]  but uh again another guy that um some people are painting as courageous uh i'd be petrified it was
[03:54:57.640 --> 03:55:02.760]  i always have it seems like it's going to take him a while to get this uh ten million dollars
[03:55:02.760 --> 03:55:09.240]  and if these people are as powerful as he says i'd watch it i'd watch out because i think they
[03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:17.400]  absolutely are trying to um trying to uh expose some of these people if he is they will indeed
[03:55:18.440 --> 03:55:23.720]  uh do him some harm i believe how you doing arty lang it's my co-host arty lang i'm doing him full
[03:55:23.720 --> 03:55:30.600]  wars uh for uh alex jones arty lang does my show also it's the arty and anthony show on compound
[03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:37.320]  media dot com and that starts at four p.m eastern time all good arty please it's a perfect opportunity
[03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:44.600]  to throw in a commercial for the show yeah so kory feldman is uh wants ten million dollars uh
[03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:52.280]  these these these monsters are still out there and the thought that he's waiting till he raises
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:56:00.120]  ten million uh i don't get that i honestly don't get that powerful people uh i honestly think and i
[03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:06.840]  think he's telling the truth i think he does know people that have been uh in this business uh
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:13.960]  that have done horrible things he knows names uh but i don't know why he hasn't put him out it's
[03:56:13.960 --> 03:56:20.440]  not like he has a career that is hinged on him uh playing ball with these people no pun intended
[03:56:20.440 --> 03:56:28.040]  uh lastly uh quickly for a minute or so i want to comment on um halloween halloween's coming up
[03:56:28.040 --> 03:56:37.160]  and again just a disaster apparently costumes now of any kind are are offensive uh cultural
[03:56:37.160 --> 03:56:44.840]  appropriation is brought into it disney all these little disney characters disney was told years ago
[03:56:44.840 --> 03:56:51.720]  hey you're your princesses and princes and all these people aren't diverse enough so they started
[03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:58.280]  diversifying their cartoon characters well these are beloved characters especially by children who
[03:56:58.280 --> 03:57:05.400]  have no agenda whatsoever about race and nationality and now if they dress up in certain outfits
[03:57:06.040 --> 03:57:10.680]  the little poor little kid just trying to celebrate halloween is deemed a racist and
[03:57:10.680 --> 03:57:18.680]  racially insensitive how insane is that it's halloween it's meant for kids so uh uh just
[03:57:18.680 --> 03:57:24.440]  let the little kid dress up however the hell he he damn well pleases if he wants to be a little
[03:57:24.440 --> 03:57:33.320]  engine a little engine let him wants to dress like a girl i guess let him do that don't put us some
[03:57:33.320 --> 03:57:39.000]  kind of uh labels on these poor little kids for halloween anthony comia at info wars dot com
