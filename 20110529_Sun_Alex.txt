[00:00:05.173 --> 00:00:06.474]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:08.255]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:10.017]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:11.598]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:13.159]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:21.425]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:28.887]  It is Thursday, the 26th day of May 2011.
[00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:36.029]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, so start your engines.
[00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:40.369]  My engine is running a little rough, but I'm here.
[00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:47.191]  I screamed for over an hour off and on at the Texas Capitol yesterday.
[00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:51.043]  In the cacophonous halls.
[00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:56.846]  I absolutely want to salute the hundred or so people that were there when I got there at about 2.45.
[00:00:56.846 --> 00:01:04.891]  Then I came back outside and everywhere I went I saw new people that were arriving and more crowds even showed up over the evening.
[00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:10.895]  The San Antonio paper estimates over 300 over the day.
[00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:16.440]  I saw 100 at one time and more than 100 milling around in other areas.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.002]  So unknown numbers.
[00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:29.210]  I would say conservatively probably 500 people showed up from all over Texas spontaneously because they were putting the phones off the hook or they were busy or they were going to voicemail.
[00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:30.786]  I don't
[00:01:48.055 --> 00:02:00.119]  Simonson, House Member Simonson, Senator Patrick's letters talking about the Feds threatening blockades, releasing the letter from the Feds threatening the no-fly zone over Texas, and that's what it is.
[00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:09.603]  And we put it in an article, and today I tuned through a whole bunch of talk stations, hundreds of news articles, including national news articles, I scanned over.
[00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:22.166]  In Dallas Morning News, San Antonio Express News, Houston Chronicle, Boston Globe, Politico, Forbes, I mean, just everywhere.
[00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.928]  Pretty much unanimously against what the feds have done.
[00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:26.829]  People really see this tyranny.
[00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.871]  We're making the tyrants act like tyrants.
[00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:34.455]  And pointing out that, my goodness, the TSA says it's our way or the highway.
[00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:37.774]  We're going to stick our hands down your children's pants.
[00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:39.115]  We're going to grab you on the outside.
[00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:42.075]  We're going to fondle the genitals of Miss America.
[00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:45.136]  We're going to leave the borders wide open.
[00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:50.637]  And if you don't like it, we'll just have a blockade on you like you're Libya or like you're Iran.
[00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:57.938]  Well, those are just sanctions with Iran, but there is a blockade of Libya, an act of war.
[00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:00.419]  So incredible.
[00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:00.559]  And
[00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:10.567]  Senator Patrick yesterday withdrew his bill and then tried to bring it back to the floor when he thought he had the votes.
[00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:14.051]  He originally had 30 of 31 senators confirmed.
[00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:19.979]  And we've now discovered who the exact culprit is for gutting it at the behest of the Obama administration.
[00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:23.643]  And he's set to try to replace Perry as governor.
[00:03:23.643 --> 00:03:25.163]  He said, or he'll run for U.S.
[00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:29.505]  Senate with Bilderberg Group member Kay Bailey Hutchinson stands down.
[00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:35.287]  He is a former CIA government overthrow specialist.
[00:03:35.287 --> 00:03:39.048]  And he is the real governor of Texas.
[00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:44.650]  After the Civil War, because we had puppet governors down here, they set it up where
[00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:45.991]  I don't
[00:04:07.677 --> 00:04:13.858]  I went to a lot of their offices yesterday, a lot of the different Senate offices, and I could tell when I went to Dewhurst's offices.
[00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:17.279]  I mean, it was Pentagon Central.
[00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:25.221]  I mean, I looked at these guys when I walked in, and it was, we own this country, it's ours, and that's the end of it.
[00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:27.001]  And Dewhurst has always been a monster.
[00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.001]  I've seen him in person.
[00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:32.982]  He's one of those people who looks like Ted Bundy, acts like Ted Bundy.
[00:04:32.982 --> 00:04:35.243]  He's the wealthiest member of Texas government.
[00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:42.608]  And when you're around him, he just radiates evil.
[00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:44.969]  And he is an Obama operative.
[00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.629]  And do hers, no matter how much money you got.
[00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:48.750]  Texas is angry at you.
[00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.310]  It's in every major paper.
[00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.232]  You're going down, you Obama-supporting, anti-Texas, black-ops spook.
[00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:58.673]  He will not bring down Texas like some third-world country boy.
[00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:02.014]  Never happened in America, but it's happening right now.
[00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:05.656]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:12.258]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:05:12.258 --> 00:05:17.641]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.
[00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:23.163]  With our new triple production capacity, you will get the fastest shipments of food in the country to help you get the most for
[00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:23.543]  We're good.
[00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:52.624]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:53.745]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:10.814 --> 00:06:14.135]  It is Thursday, the 26th day of May 2011.
[00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:39.022]  My voice is a bit blown today, but we are here live due to bullhorn-level shouting without the aid of a bullhorn outside and inside the Texas state capitol, the front lines of the fight of the illegitimate globalist power grab via the federal government as they attempt to codify by practice an administrative law
[00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:51.513]  The sexual molestation of women, small children, and men, first outside the pants, now in the pants, now in the underwear, actually grabbing the genitals.
[00:06:51.513 --> 00:06:52.913]  And I have witnessed it with my own eyes.
[00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:55.094]  It's been videotaped countless times.
[00:06:55.094 --> 00:07:00.396]  Just eight months ago, they were denying it in October, November of last year.
[00:07:00.396 --> 00:07:05.278]  Now it's all admitted and it's out in the open, what they're doing that they plan and are now executing the program.
[00:07:06.698 --> 00:07:11.919]  to roll out on the streets of America, seizing the entire infrastructure.
[00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:17.361]  This is martial law in slow motion now going into higher gear.
[00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:18.841]  They will never call it martial law.
[00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:20.482]  It's called security.
[00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:24.543]  And it is the end of the Fourth Amendment, the end of the Republic.
[00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:27.984]  If they succeed, all of this is being done ahead of the economy.
[00:07:28.724 --> 00:07:39.415]  Uh, completely collapsing and going into IMF World Bank receivership to the very private banks that operate through those consortiums, uh, who have maneuvered the country to this position.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:49.405]  And put their corporate and FBI and former intelligence officer people in place over almost every major state and city.
[00:07:49.405 --> 00:07:51.807]  They control the narcotics traffic.
[00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:53.908]  They control the white slavery traffic.
[00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.309]  And it's all on record.
[00:07:55.309 --> 00:08:01.213]  They are an absolute 100% pure mafia that controls our police and military.
[00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:06.714]  But our average police officer, our average military men and women are great people.
[00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:07.355]  I've met them.
[00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:08.195]  I know them.
[00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:14.077]  I've seen them give more money than anybody else combined to Ron Paul in the last election.
[00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:17.978]  Both some of the major independent law enforcement lobbies, but also the military.
[00:08:17.978 --> 00:08:23.419]  And so that really signifies there that they are beginning to wake up.
[00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:25.860]  The problem is they are commanded by this mafia.
[00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:29.212]  It's called tyranny when this happens.
[00:08:29.212 --> 00:08:34.456]  And the Nuremberg defense the Nazis used, if I was just following orders, is not going to work.
[00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:35.596]  So you've got a decision to make.
[00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:43.762]  Now, I've got a million things running through my head, so many incredible issues that need to be covered, and I'm going to go over all of it.
[00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:49.065]  The economy is just accelerating into freefall.
[00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:50.086]  We're going to go over that.
[00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:56.599]  New leak feared it's tricking Japan nuclear plant and just meltdowns full-scale.
[00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:57.959]  Pakistan trims U.S.
[00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:01.380]  military mission as mistrust grows.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.581]  Rick Perry's rethinking his pledge not to run for president.
[00:09:04.581 --> 00:09:11.223]  Yeah, if Perry pledges to do something, then you want to put your money on him breaking the pledge.
[00:09:11.223 --> 00:09:12.944]  Of course he's going to run for president.
[00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:17.572]  If he doesn't think they won't use blackmail against him.
[00:09:17.572 --> 00:09:20.474]  He's got, well, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:09:20.474 --> 00:09:29.460]  Continuing here, we have more on the horrible tornadoes and our hearts and prayers go out to all those people.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:38.606]  I was reading a media report about a man caught on video with his wife and they're running with the baby and his wife fell down and the tornado was right behind him.
[00:09:40.444 --> 00:09:43.566]  He grabbed the baby and kept running.
[00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:45.887]  I've had talks with my wife about things like that.
[00:09:45.887 --> 00:09:53.392]  You know, what if we were in the water and the kids were about to go under and I had to save you or them, what would you do?
[00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.453]  She says, well, save them.
[00:09:54.453 --> 00:09:55.513]  And it's the same way.
[00:09:55.513 --> 00:09:58.315]  But just to realize that our children come first.
[00:09:58.315 --> 00:09:59.175]  It's instinctive.
[00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:00.876]  It's basic.
[00:10:00.876 --> 00:10:06.380]  Any parent who's got their head even screwed on halfway straight would take a bullet for their children.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.702]  So how are we going to let a bunch of miscreant
[00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:14.214]  Unauthorized federal goons do it.
[00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:17.818]  Well, again, if they can get away with this, they can do anything.
[00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:18.778]  Molesting our children.
[00:10:18.778 --> 00:10:21.921]  So I'm going to be going over that.
[00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:26.486]  Also, it's in Wired Magazine, the Associated Press.
[00:10:26.486 --> 00:10:29.028]  Kurt Nemo did a big, detailed report on it.
[00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:32.571]  Oregon Senator reveals secret government surveillance grid.
[00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:33.892]  Here's Wired Magazine.
[00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:35.914]  There's a secret Patriot Act, Senator says.
[00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:41.096]  And that's Senator Ron Wayden of Oregon.
[00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:43.557]  Folks, none of this is secret.
[00:10:43.557 --> 00:10:45.178]  You can read Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:46.599]  It states it in clear English.
[00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:47.660]  If you go follow the U.S.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.301]  Code, it lists.
[00:10:49.301 --> 00:10:57.825]  And if you read the Telecommunications Act, as I've told you, everything is fed over government snooping grids with keyword.
[00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:00.747]  Fax, email, voice, radio.
[00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:05.430]  They've got listening devices all over the place trying to pick up all CB.
[00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.653]  They've got AI computers for at least 30 years.
[00:11:08.653 --> 00:11:12.817]  Highly advanced now with incredible space to be able to basically filter everything.
[00:11:14.572 --> 00:11:24.559]  And the main grid is there to make sure that local police don't bust CIA bringing drugs in or to make sure aircraft with little kidnapped American kids make it out of the country.
[00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.881]  That's been in the Chicago Tribune even.
[00:11:27.881 --> 00:11:32.544]  It's mainly for the criminals to surveil the good guys, which
[00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:38.193]  Skousen thinks there's more people on the dark side in government than not.
[00:11:38.193 --> 00:11:39.894]  Most people are compartmentalized, low-level.
[00:11:39.894 --> 00:11:47.019]  I'd say 20% are dark side, 80% just don't know which end is up, and are just like the general public.
[00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:52.763]  But I guess in positions of power, yeah, more than half are very corrupt.
[00:11:52.763 --> 00:11:55.665]  And we've done an analysis of this, but here it is.
[00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:59.267]  Now, see, it's all illegal, and they're doing it.
[00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:01.268]  Completely illegal.
[00:12:01.268 --> 00:12:03.710]  And none of it has to do with Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:11.360]  Unless it's trying to track other agencies if they're going to launch an Al-Qaeda attack to make sure those agencies are ordered to stand down.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:18.922]  That's why FBI agents were in major newspapers for 9-11 saying it was as if Al-Qaeda had moles in the FBI above us.
[00:12:18.922 --> 00:12:20.543]  Well, of course they had moles.
[00:12:20.543 --> 00:12:24.724]  The commanders of Al-Qaeda weren't above you.
[00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:25.904]  At least the Al-Qaeda patsies.
[00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:38.030]  And that's why the FBI superiors and CIA superiors and special forces superiors and the army would come to the people and say, you're not going to do anything like that was in the news yesterday.
[00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.231]  And even the Associated Press.
[00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:45.616]  Military ordered an intelligence order to not track Bin Laden in the month before 9-11.
[00:12:45.616 --> 00:12:56.999]  Because they had Sybil Edmonds at the NSA, FBI translator for NSA communiques, and she came and said, Al Qaeda's being run, here are the tapes, they're getting ready for something big.
[00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:59.679]  They say they're talking to someone who's Osama Bin Laden.
[00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:02.940]  They're running white slaves, weapons, drugs.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.980]  There's about to be an attack.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.601]  And they said, we'll take those communiques, shut your mouth.
[00:13:09.502 --> 00:13:13.044]  Now, again, this is all on record.
[00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:15.306]  So it's time for folks to grow up.
[00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:17.127]  What is so hard to understand?
[00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:23.952]  A scientific mafia, a corporate mafia, is in control of the federal government.
[00:13:23.952 --> 00:13:26.654]  This same mafia is in control of almost every country in the world.
[00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:36.835]  Rogue countries like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Ahmadinejad in Iran, Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:38.456]  It doesn't mean they're good guys.
[00:13:38.456 --> 00:13:40.317]  See, people think in a one-dimensional way.
[00:13:40.317 --> 00:13:47.882]  Either the criminals that run us are good, or they're bad, or Gaddafi's good, or he's bad.
[00:13:47.882 --> 00:13:47.922]  No.
[00:13:49.082 --> 00:13:58.684]  No, Gaddafi are your normal government control freak people, but nothing compared to the globalists with their scientific evil, who they don't run yet.
[00:13:58.684 --> 00:14:05.005]  They're pieces left on the risk board, or they're a few pieces left on the chess board, and they're being wiped out.
[00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:11.067]  And then domestically, your farms, your ranches, your local factories, your jobs, that's being wiped out.
[00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:17.328]  In this corporate model of total domination, anything they don't own and control is to be destroyed.
[00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:19.925]  And to be taken over.
[00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:22.468]  This is a giant monopoly game.
[00:14:22.468 --> 00:14:25.991]  And monopoly means there's only one group.
[00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:28.213]  It means total domination.
[00:14:28.213 --> 00:14:29.334]  Full spectrum dominance.
[00:14:30.616 --> 00:14:40.619]  And they get these guys up into their criminal orders, their criminal organizations, and they all become fat and wealthy off of us.
[00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:43.380]  And then they commit so many crimes in the process.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.521]  Both political parties, or three political parties in England, it's the same paradigm, same in Europe.
[00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:58.844]  They always set up hardcore secret police systems, crack down on free speech, crack down on demonstration, try to intimidate the public because they better
[00:15:00.585 --> 00:15:06.331]  In Greece, they're stealing the pension funds of paid-in doctors.
[00:15:06.331 --> 00:15:12.677]  And thousands and thousands of doctors took to the street, and the police just went in there and split their heads open.
[00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:20.505]  Boy, when you start doing that to professionals, these countries are going to get overtaken by the people.
[00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:23.287]  And it takes that tyranny for folks to finally wake up.
[00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:30.655]  Once the professional class gets their teeth knocked out or their kids abused, it's over, it's on.
[00:15:30.655 --> 00:15:32.835]  The real resistance starts.
[00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:42.377]  And so they've had the fake terror they've been pushing and staging ahead of knowing real resistance will finally physically mount, and then they're gonna say, oh, that's terrorism.
[00:15:42.377 --> 00:15:46.378]  Well, if you believe that, then George Washington was Osama bin Laden.
[00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:49.719]  If you believe that, Patrick Henry was Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:53.337]  We're good.
[00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:05.602]  Tyranny is here.
[00:16:05.602 --> 00:16:09.543]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:16:09.543 --> 00:16:11.784]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:17.647]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:23.890]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:30.293]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:34.454]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:38.756]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:44.678]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:16:44.678 --> 00:16:48.260]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.221]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:50.661]  It's here.

[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.102]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:17:34.102 --> 00:17:37.944]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:17:37.944 --> 00:17:39.165]  Others don't.
[00:17:39.165 --> 00:17:41.306]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:17:57.674 --> 00:17:58.555]  Others don't.
[00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.213]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:05.133]  Number 1.
[00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:08.556]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:18:08.556 --> 00:18:09.416]  Number 2.
[00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:14.319]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:15.060]  It's true.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.923]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:18:19.923 --> 00:18:20.763]  Number 3.
[00:18:20.763 --> 00:18:24.346]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:18:24.346 --> 00:18:28.048]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:18:28.248 --> 00:18:29.029]  Number 4.
[00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:31.791]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:35.475]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:18:35.475 --> 00:18:36.276]  Number 5.
[00:18:36.276 --> 00:18:40.419]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:45.184]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:18:45.464 --> 00:18:49.630]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:19:02.262 --> 00:19:07.569]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:19:07.569 --> 00:19:09.111]  Saving means to make money.
[00:19:09.111 --> 00:19:17.921]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:19:18.622 --> 00:19:26.166]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:34.170]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:39.393]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:02.542]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:02.542 --> 00:20:04.602]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.602 --> 00:20:07.804]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.490]  The truth is we have psychological warfare terrorists.
[00:20:26.804 --> 00:20:36.686]  Using Madison Avenue tricks, PR propaganda, and they brag and publish books on this, you know, talking about how they've done it, Bernays and others, playing games with people.
[00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:45.688]  But once you know the con, it doesn't matter how coifed Rick Perry's hair is, or David the slimeball black op commander Dewhurst.
[00:20:45.688 --> 00:20:51.789]  It doesn't matter how slick-sounding Obama is reading off a teleprompter.
[00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:55.190]  It doesn't matter anymore once you know they're enemies,
[00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.471]  They're criminals.
[00:20:57.471 --> 00:20:58.791]  They need to be dealt with.
[00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:01.493]  They need to be stood up against.
[00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:05.975]  And they absolutely must be called out now.
[00:21:05.975 --> 00:21:19.501]  People need to stop cowering and bowing down and licking the boots and thinking of government as our authorities, our officials, the excellencies, the honorable ones.
[00:21:19.501 --> 00:21:22.783]  They are the servants.
[00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:24.164]  They are the servants.
[00:21:25.805 --> 00:21:35.331]  of the sacred liberty and freedom enshrined in our republic, the great jewel that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:21:35.331 --> 00:21:40.054]  And when they are servants, they are honorable in their service.
[00:21:40.054 --> 00:21:48.739]  But when they are running around like a bunch of rapacious animals, wolves, chewing our guts out,
[00:21:50.032 --> 00:21:58.021]  Rending and scientifically prosecuting a war against the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:21:58.021 --> 00:22:09.194]  It is now confirmed what we told you nine years ago, because then it was public as well, just not widely circulated, that the TSA is the domestic national security force.
[00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:11.959]  And you notice it's bipartisan.
[00:22:11.959 --> 00:22:14.222]  Bush, Obama, across the board.
[00:22:14.222 --> 00:22:21.488]  They want to make this a Republican-Democrat issue, so when Obama's in, Democrats will support the TSA, and then when Republicans are in, they'll support it.
[00:22:21.488 --> 00:22:23.970]  That's how they divide us in the left-right paradigm.
[00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:31.718]  I don't care if you're a liberal, conservative, libertarian, communist, Easter Bunny, whatever it is, you shouldn't want this to be done to you and your family.
[00:22:31.718 --> 00:22:34.700]  I mean, the Soviet Union, at its height,
[00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:42.872]  Didn't, uh, you know, take Miss Soviet Union or whatever at a checkpoint and stick their hands down their pants.
[00:22:42.872 --> 00:22:44.673]  They would know one, whatever.
[00:22:44.673 --> 00:22:45.933]  Not in Communist China.
[00:22:45.933 --> 00:22:47.653]  I talk to folks that fly there all the time.
[00:22:47.653 --> 00:22:49.654]  Even touch your body.
[00:22:49.654 --> 00:22:54.214]  If they're suspicious or think you're doing something, they call you in behind closed doors and interrogate you.
[00:22:54.214 --> 00:22:58.775]  But again, political correctness, they're not making a mistake here.
[00:22:58.775 --> 00:23:02.396]  Oh, we don't want to target certain groups so everyone has hands down their pants.
[00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:06.283]  It's designed that way.
[00:23:06.283 --> 00:23:11.485]  So they flip it around and say, all of you are guilty.
[00:23:11.485 --> 00:23:13.206]  But I'm digressing.
[00:23:13.206 --> 00:23:17.988]  Here's the points I want to get into.
[00:23:17.988 --> 00:23:31.454]  A, great job to the hundreds of people that showed up during the afternoon and throughout the evening when they closed the day's session at past 11 o'clock at night.
[00:23:31.454 --> 00:23:32.535]  Folks were in the gallery.
[00:23:34.676 --> 00:23:44.899]  And you said traitors, treason, and Dewhurst made sarcastic remarks to the media saying, I guess they don't like all we've done for them.
[00:23:44.899 --> 00:23:54.041]  And then laughed about Patrick and made some sarcastic comments about Senator Patrick, who's now exposed Dewhurst.
[00:23:54.041 --> 00:23:55.422]  I want to talk about the state police.
[00:23:55.422 --> 00:24:00.123]  I had a Dutch film crew with me and they couldn't believe citizens marching into a Capitol
[00:24:01.602 --> 00:24:09.407]  And screaming at the lobbyists, screaming at the senators, going to their offices and screaming at them.
[00:24:09.407 --> 00:24:10.627]  Well, that's what freedom looks like.
[00:24:10.627 --> 00:24:15.670]  If you don't have that, you've got the opposite, what this country's now turned into.
[00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.971]  That's your birthright.
[00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:28.098]  And if you don't like seeing people behave like that and do things like that, and this quote, civil society, when you have an outrageous,
[00:24:29.773 --> 00:24:38.259]  Federal power grab meant to break our will, meant to set a precedent where they can do anything they want.
[00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:41.541]  Extreme tyranny calls for extreme actions.
[00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:43.323]  And this was not extreme actions.
[00:24:43.323 --> 00:24:50.468]  Going down there and showing them that we're angry and getting in their face and then garnering
[00:24:52.133 --> 00:24:54.734]  Literally hundreds of TV stations.
[00:24:54.734 --> 00:24:59.437]  There were hundreds of TV stations there in the final days of the Texas legislature.
[00:24:59.437 --> 00:25:02.279]  And at any one time, I had 20 news cameras around me.
[00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:04.820]  And then my job was done in an hour, hour and 20 minutes.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.782]  I left and I said, okay, all you great patrons that came out, you go be on the media now.
[00:25:08.782 --> 00:25:09.703]  They were all over TV.
[00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:17.547]  Our listeners and all over newspapers and they stay there till past 11 o'clock at night.
[00:25:17.547 --> 00:25:21.529]  Just absolutely incredible to see the people there.
[00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:24.691]  Frankly, a lot of them doing a better job than I did when I saw him on the news.
[00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:26.052]  And there's no way to watch on the newscast.
[00:25:26.052 --> 00:25:33.076]  There are hundreds of Texas newscast, dozens of national newscast, hundreds of newspapers.
[00:25:33.076 --> 00:25:35.777]  Another devastating blow against the globalists.
[00:25:35.777 --> 00:25:36.918]  Oh, they
[00:25:39.474 --> 00:25:42.315]  Unanimously passed it in the House, 138 to 0.
[00:25:42.315 --> 00:25:46.237]  They had 30 of 31 senators, almost unanimous.
[00:25:46.237 --> 00:25:47.898]  And Dewhurst killed it.
[00:25:47.898 --> 00:25:49.439]  And we now know how Dewhurst killed it.
[00:25:49.439 --> 00:25:53.981]  And we won this battle.
[00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:57.223]  Oh, we didn't lose by them engaging in this treachery.
[00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:59.264]  Many Texas papers across the board
[00:26:00.307 --> 00:26:05.188]  Both Democrat and Republican editorial boards are saying Dewhurst is done.
[00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:06.689]  Dewhurst, it's over.
[00:26:06.689 --> 00:26:07.249]  You know why?
[00:26:07.249 --> 00:26:13.411]  He didn't proudly get up and say, I work for the Justice Department, and I want to be a U.S.
[00:26:13.411 --> 00:26:17.052]  Senator, and I'm a toady, and I've worked with Obama's people.
[00:26:17.052 --> 00:26:20.353]  He let senators know, and they're on record, saying, don't let anybody know.
[00:26:20.353 --> 00:26:21.733]  I can't have fingerprints on this.
[00:26:21.733 --> 00:26:22.773]  We're going to kill it.
[00:26:22.773 --> 00:26:23.714]  And he worked the floor.
[00:26:24.674 --> 00:26:27.555]  And made threats and made promises to kill it.
[00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:33.438]  And knocked the 31 votes down to almost zero with some of these cowards.
[00:26:33.438 --> 00:26:39.001]  Always acting like they're constitutionalists while they're the ones involved gutting things.
[00:26:39.001 --> 00:26:43.483]  Obama, Bush, Dewhurst, at that level, they're all on the same team.
[00:26:43.483 --> 00:26:52.848]  Now continuing, ex-CIA spook Dewhurst sabotaged anti-TSA bill for Obama administration.
[00:26:54.827 --> 00:27:11.755]  The man who was instrumental in working with the federal government to sabotage a bill that would have made TSA grope downs a felony in the state of Texas was Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, a former CIA agent and establishment insider, considered to be the wealthiest man in Texas politics.
[00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:20.640]  As we have documented, the anti-pat-down bill, and it was even called the anti-grope bill, our state just told it like it was, straight talk.
[00:27:21.653 --> 00:27:37.003]  The anti-pat-down bill was derailed in the Texas Senate, having unanimously passed the House 138-0 votes after the Department of Justice sent a letter threatening to impose a no-fly zone over Texas and shut down Texas airports.
[00:27:37.003 --> 00:27:41.867]  The warning was nothing short of a federal blockade and an act of financial terrorism.
[00:27:41.867 --> 00:27:43.308]  It's an act of war under international law.
[00:27:44.158 --> 00:27:59.705]  But the federal assault was aided by a traitor from within the state, Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, who only serves to amplify the threats made by the DOJ in communicating them to members of the Senate, convincing them to cave in.
[00:27:59.705 --> 00:28:01.146]  It was a total bluff.
[00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:03.867]  They were holding a junk hand.
[00:28:03.867 --> 00:28:05.448]  They claimed it was a royal flush.
[00:28:05.448 --> 00:28:07.048]  Call their bluff.
[00:28:07.048 --> 00:28:08.229]  Let them run a blockade.
[00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:10.030]  Come on, you terrorist.
[00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.591]  We know you're the ones carrying out the attacks anyways, you scum.
[00:28:14.417 --> 00:28:27.067]  Continuing, to members of the Senate convincing them to cave in and forcing the hand of Senator Dan Patrick to withdraw the bill before it could be shot down permanently.
[00:28:27.067 --> 00:28:35.174]  He came up with the elaborate political ploy to kill the bill without any fingerprints since Senator Patrick, Republican Houston, adding his fingerprints are all over it.
[00:28:35.174 --> 00:28:39.137]  Then he goes in and says he witnessed him on the floor, talked to everybody, he's the one.
[00:28:39.137 --> 00:28:41.619]  With DOJ hacks with him.
[00:28:43.342 --> 00:28:46.604]  Which, by the way, they're not supposed to lobby on the floor of the federal government.
[00:28:46.604 --> 00:28:48.264]  That's a whole nother scandal.
[00:28:48.264 --> 00:28:50.986]  I mean, this guy's a black op guy here to bring down America.
[00:28:50.986 --> 00:28:51.906]  What do you expect?
[00:28:51.906 --> 00:28:54.808]  You think they'll overthrow other countries to suck them dry and won't do it here?
[00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:56.989]  This guy is a voracious monster.
[00:29:01.508 --> 00:29:05.532]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:29:05.532 --> 00:29:08.776]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:29:08.776 --> 00:29:13.581]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:19.968]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:22.211]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:23.031]  Tim Geithner?
[00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:23.551]  Bernanke?
[00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:24.212]  They're arsonists!
[00:29:24.212 --> 00:29:25.492]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:27.754]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:29:41.641 --> 00:29:48.931]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:29:48.931 --> 00:29:58.043]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:30:00.123 --> 00:30:03.104]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[00:30:03.104 --> 00:30:06.725]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[00:30:06.725 --> 00:30:13.347]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.161]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.775 --> 00:31:42.457]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.457 --> 00:31:46.680]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[00:32:00.865 --> 00:32:02.587]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:07.893]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:09.435]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:18.225]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:18.946 --> 00:32:26.491]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:26.491 --> 00:32:34.496]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:34.496 --> 00:32:39.719]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:33:19.162 --> 00:33:25.148]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.427 --> 00:33:37.509]  That's right, 50,000 unstoppable watts.
[00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:44.675]  Add all our AM and FMs together, the internet, global shortwave satellite, it's billions of watts.
[00:33:44.675 --> 00:33:47.057]  Billions of unstoppable watts.
[00:33:47.057 --> 00:33:58.007]  In the info war, ladies and gentlemen, all of our listeners, great activists out there ringing the alarm bells as watchmen and women on the wall rallying free humanity against the tyranny of the globalists.
[00:33:58.007 --> 00:33:58.227]  Okay.
[00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:10.761]  Let me just, in a succession, give you a report of exactly what happened yesterday here in Texas.
[00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:26.365]  The TSA announced Tuesday evening and sent lobbyists on record to work behind the scenes with Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, behind the scenes.
[00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:39.873]  To have him go threaten, via the letter, a federal blockade, a federal no-fly zone, that's what it is, over the state of Texas.
[00:34:39.873 --> 00:34:42.874]  No aircraft allowed in or out.
[00:34:42.874 --> 00:34:45.995]  And if that was resisted, what would they do?
[00:34:45.995 --> 00:34:54.097]  Just so incredible that Janet Napolitano up there says, this will not be discussed.
[00:34:54.097 --> 00:34:55.658]  Take our offer or drop dead.
[00:34:57.833 --> 00:35:01.756]  We are going to continue sticking our hands down your pants.
[00:35:01.756 --> 00:35:14.724]  And then, of course, what's coming after that, as we predicted for years, is a trusted traveler where you waive all your rights, get into a system, then they tell you if you're allowed to fly or not, and then you swipe a special biometric card and a retina scan.
[00:35:14.724 --> 00:35:22.149]  I notice the lobbyists, the politicians, their handlers, they all get to bypass security at the Texas Capitol that they just put in a few months ago.
[00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.490]  And the same system is now going into the airport.
[00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.351]  So this is how they heard us into accepting it.
[00:35:28.351 --> 00:35:32.152]  So it's a total societal takeover.
[00:35:32.152 --> 00:35:33.292]  And it's outrageous.
[00:35:33.292 --> 00:35:35.933]  And so I was trying to call them live on air.
[00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:38.634]  It was going right to voicemail, even the general switchboard number.
[00:35:38.634 --> 00:35:39.534]  And I said, that's it.
[00:35:39.534 --> 00:35:41.174]  I'm going down there at 1230.
[00:35:41.174 --> 00:35:46.055]  We had an hour and a half left in the broadcast, 1230 Central Time.
[00:35:46.055 --> 00:35:48.876]  And I got down there about 245.
[00:35:48.876 --> 00:35:50.837]  And there was about 80 people outside.
[00:35:50.837 --> 00:35:51.977]  I went inside another
[00:35:52.777 --> 00:35:54.778]  60, 70, 100, I don't know, had already gone in.
[00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:56.418]  Everybody was split up all over the Capitol.
[00:35:56.418 --> 00:36:01.459]  When I came back out an hour and a half later, there were a bunch of people I hadn't met or talked to everywhere.
[00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:03.920]  More people arriving, cars pulling up.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.521]  I'm told that it increased several hundred throughout the next few hours.
[00:36:09.521 --> 00:36:16.963]  And people were just there all day right up until past 11.30 at night when they closed the session, that day's session.
[00:36:19.418 --> 00:36:25.961]  Absolutely booing, just fulfilling, because I don't like being on the defense.
[00:36:25.961 --> 00:36:33.145]  I don't like seeing the tyranny grow, the creeping evil, watching people cower, watching America lose its fighting spirit.
[00:36:33.145 --> 00:36:41.429]  It was so good to see old people, young people, black people, white people, Hispanics, Asians, everybody.
[00:36:42.548 --> 00:36:51.357]  You know, just a true cross-section of Texans, of Americans, with liberty and the same light of freedom burning in their eyes to shake their hands.
[00:36:51.357 --> 00:36:56.842]  People bringing their wonderful, dear children to the event.
[00:36:56.842 --> 00:37:03.568]  And we went in, we sat there and rebuked the metal detectors they put in.
[00:37:04.818 --> 00:37:10.401]  And pointed out that soon there would be even more and then they would phase in groping and that was the plan.
[00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:19.185]  We marched through and I just yelled in my drill sergeant's loudest voice and I doubt that's one gift God gave me.
[00:37:19.185 --> 00:37:21.806]  I doubt folks anybody could get louder than this.
[00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:23.527]  I mean this was loud.
[00:37:23.527 --> 00:37:27.049]  It was shaking the building.
[00:37:27.049 --> 00:37:28.390]  I had sent as a
[00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:31.811]  I think?
[00:37:54.279 --> 00:37:57.262]  It was like 10 guys in there, 20-something gone.
[00:37:57.262 --> 00:38:02.366]  They were just all sitting there, hitting buttons, just committing crime right in front of everybody.
[00:38:02.366 --> 00:38:06.589]  Well, we've been doing it for decades, so it's all right.
[00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:08.531]  I mean, it was incredible.
[00:38:08.531 --> 00:38:09.291]  People won't believe that.
[00:38:09.291 --> 00:38:18.659]  If you just type in, uh, Texas, uh, you know, representatives vote for each other or something like that, you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll pull up the incredible newscast.
[00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:19.920]  But we have footage of it.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.901]  We're going to be putting that out.
[00:38:20.901 --> 00:38:22.282]  We just got so much footage to go through.
[00:38:23.695 --> 00:38:32.697]  And before I get to the real big story today, the big breaking news dealing with this, I'm just setting the table in the background, but people have a full spectrum view of what was going on.
[00:38:32.697 --> 00:38:35.158]  It's important to look at things very in a complex way.
[00:38:35.158 --> 00:38:37.678]  The media is always dumbing things down by design.
[00:38:37.678 --> 00:38:39.458]  They've got white papers on that.
[00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:44.600]  Always dumbing the cartoons, the culture, the movies down to dumb you down.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.400]  It's not you're dumb, you want dumb things.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.681]  Sure, after you've been fed on poison for a long time, you start thinking it's mother's milk.
[00:38:52.406 --> 00:39:09.535]  But to make a long story short here, folks all over America are commenting in the news articles and on YouTube and all these different news sites going, I've never seen people act like this, marching in, screaming in people's faces, aggressively talking to their officials that way.
[00:39:09.535 --> 00:39:12.697]  Well, no, they're our servants, and they've done something horrible.
[00:39:12.697 --> 00:39:15.599]  A unanimous House did the right thing.
[00:39:16.459 --> 00:39:21.381]  138-0 and the Senate had 30 of 31 votes and it was going to pass.
[00:39:21.381 --> 00:39:25.582]  Perry claimed he was going to sign it, but he used his minion, Dewhurst.
[00:39:25.582 --> 00:39:27.022]  That's Perry's master of that.
[00:39:27.022 --> 00:39:30.183]  Kill things quietly, then he claims he would have signed it.
[00:39:30.183 --> 00:39:31.844]  It's just perpetual with Perry.
[00:39:31.844 --> 00:39:32.524]  I live here, folks.
[00:39:32.524 --> 00:39:33.024]  I study him.
[00:39:33.024 --> 00:39:34.565]  He's a Bilderberg attendee.
[00:39:34.565 --> 00:39:35.385]  He's a snake, but...
[00:39:36.491 --> 00:39:37.332]  I digress.
[00:39:37.332 --> 00:39:40.774]  Talks all the right talk, doesn't walk the walk.
[00:39:40.774 --> 00:39:44.276]  So there was rage.
[00:39:44.276 --> 00:39:58.106]  And even though I was screaming when they wouldn't let us into the Senate gallery and blocked us, even though I was screaming at the top of my lungs, traitors, criminals, sellouts,
[00:39:59.953 --> 00:40:03.197]  Most of the state police were smiling and nodding, saying hi, Alex.
[00:40:03.197 --> 00:40:06.781]  And when there wasn't a camera on saying, you know, we agree with you.
[00:40:06.781 --> 00:40:07.702]  Well, of course they agree.
[00:40:07.702 --> 00:40:11.786]  They don't want their wives and daughters and husbands having people stick their hands down their pants.
[00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:20.015]  So even though I was like a wild rhinoceros bellowing and running around in there, the police didn't see me as the enemy.
[00:40:21.081 --> 00:40:28.405]  Even though, quite frankly, I was seeing the lobbyists, the entire government system, as a giant affront in my rage.
[00:40:28.405 --> 00:40:37.110]  They understood the anger, and now that I can look back on the videos and in hindsight think about it, and I think are the model
[00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:45.116]  The way the state police behaved of what peace officers and public servants are supposed to act like.
[00:40:45.116 --> 00:40:51.280]  And I've certainly seen bad behavior from the Texas State Police as well before, but checkpoints and things.
[00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:58.577]  This, this was what America is all about and why this country is special.
[00:40:58.577 --> 00:41:01.320]  I am so upset about what's going on in this country.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.541]  It's why I don't have a lot of rallies.
[00:41:02.541 --> 00:41:07.928]  I don't have a lot of demonstrations because my anger is real, ladies and gentlemen, and it is massive.
[00:41:09.293 --> 00:41:20.378]  And I get out there in these positions and it takes a toll on me, on my voice, on my diaphragm, on my mind.
[00:41:20.378 --> 00:41:25.620]  But at the same time, this was fulfilling because even though they killed
[00:41:26.946 --> 00:41:30.188]  The bill now we're exposing the evil.
[00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:37.492]  Many times in a war, you've got to do a probing action to see the response and call the enemy out.
[00:41:37.492 --> 00:41:44.997]  And then to build our forces and to show the establishment we're coming with 20 plus other states moving to do what Texas attempted to do.
[00:41:44.997 --> 00:41:46.598]  And they will not succeed in every case.
[00:41:46.598 --> 00:41:48.479]  And there will be other states.
[00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:53.242]  I would imagine Montana, Wyoming, Utah, they're all moving where they will call the feds bluff.
[00:41:53.622 --> 00:41:55.724]  Let them run a blockade over business.
[00:41:55.724 --> 00:41:58.407]  Let them try to shut things down.
[00:41:58.407 --> 00:42:00.970]  They will fold.
[00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:03.052]  Every time they're confronted, they will fold.
[00:42:03.052 --> 00:42:05.435]  Their position is untenable.
[00:42:05.435 --> 00:42:06.356]  It's indefensible.
[00:42:08.553 --> 00:42:36.008]  And so I just want to say to the state police and you know I don't sit here and kiss up to to quote authority because it's become a religion to do it but it was fulfilling and good and genuine and edifying to see the state police even in the face of a rampaging and that's how the media described it you know Texans stormed the Capitol you know Jones exploded I mean they've got a bunch of descriptions of it and
[00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:40.113]  It was good to see the police in the face of that behave themselves.
[00:43:01.223 --> 00:43:16.692]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:43:16.692 --> 00:43:20.354]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:43:21.383 --> 00:43:34.135]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:43:34.135 --> 00:43:41.401]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:43:42.102 --> 00:43:52.476]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:43:52.476 --> 00:43:56.401]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:43:56.401 --> 00:43:59.505]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:44:00.106 --> 00:44:04.667]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:05.567]  Number 1.
[00:44:05.567 --> 00:44:08.988]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:44:08.988 --> 00:44:09.848]  Number 2.
[00:44:09.848 --> 00:44:14.749]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:44:14.749 --> 00:44:15.489]  It's true.
[00:44:15.489 --> 00:44:20.370]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:21.190]  Number 3.
[00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.771]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:44:24.771 --> 00:44:28.472]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:44:28.672 --> 00:44:29.473]  Number 4.
[00:44:29.473 --> 00:44:32.236]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:35.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.721]  Number 5.
[00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:40.866]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:44:40.866 --> 00:44:45.631]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:45:59.615 --> 00:46:02.597]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[00:46:02.597 --> 00:46:06.240]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.

[00:47:01.161 --> 00:47:04.764]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.764 --> 00:47:13.211]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:13.211 --> 00:47:17.995]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:47:17.995 --> 00:47:22.958]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:22.958 --> 00:47:25.821]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:47:31.732 --> 00:47:37.874]  We've taken some calls from folks that went down to the storming of the Texas Capitol.
[00:47:37.874 --> 00:47:51.259]  When the House did the honorable thing with a unanimous vote against tyranny, what else could they do against the groping of our poor defenseless children being trained to be victimized by people in uniform and discrediting everybody in a uniform?
[00:47:51.259 --> 00:47:53.060]  The state stood up and said no to them.
[00:47:54.744 --> 00:48:00.405]  Despite the fact that I was behaving like a wild rhinoceros, were very professional and did their job.
[00:48:00.405 --> 00:48:01.886]  But you should.
[00:48:01.886 --> 00:48:05.007]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:08.007]  As Barry Goldwater said, you're supposed to be mad.
[00:48:08.007 --> 00:48:09.848]  This is a normal behavior.
[00:48:09.848 --> 00:48:12.368]  They continue to push because we don't get mad.
[00:48:12.368 --> 00:48:18.790]  Our ancestors, for far less, and I'm not saying go there, hung people, tarred and feathered them.
[00:48:20.037 --> 00:48:22.318]  Okay, wrote them out of town on a rail.
[00:48:22.318 --> 00:48:28.160]  Because old timers knew, you let a bunch of scum in government start ruling over you, they're gonna rob you blind.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.861]  They're gonna hire a bunch of thugs to carry it out on you.
[00:48:30.861 --> 00:48:34.543]  Our ancestors and every culture have gone through this over and over again.
[00:48:34.543 --> 00:48:41.506]  And your anger, your focus, that they shunt off into sports and things, where you care so much about your team.
[00:48:41.506 --> 00:48:44.127]  Your team's supposed to be your liberties, your freedom, your family.
[00:48:44.887 --> 00:48:48.550]  That's what all those energies are for.
[00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.994]  And I don't go out to a lot of demonstrations and things, especially when I'm around globalists.
[00:48:52.994 --> 00:49:00.561]  Because when they're laughing and making jokes, as some lobbyists and some senators were doing, Kirk Watson locked himself in his office.
[00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:06.263]  Almost started coughing up blood, I was screaming so loud.
[00:49:20.811 --> 00:49:31.193]  As I'm told, even bigger crowds are showing up and infesting the Capitol with liberty to drive out the globalist roaches, the lobbyists that scattered like roaches when they saw us coming.
[00:49:31.193 --> 00:49:42.436]  Describe what you saw throughout the evening, people getting out on the gallery when they destroyed the bill past 11 a.m., past 11 p.m., excuse me, at night, what you saw last night being there.
[00:49:43.775 --> 00:50:11.438]  Well, I was there earlier in the afternoon, and one of the main things that I found offensive is, after visiting Kirk Watson's office, a group of about seven or so info warriors that we all kind of found each other, headed to the Senate gallery doors, and they... One by one, as we approached the doors, you know, they let each person in, and then they stopped me, and they said, you can't go in there with that shirt on, and the shirt that I had on was the Kearney Response Team shirt.
[00:50:12.238 --> 00:50:25.505]  So they let everybody else go in that was part of the group except for me and I was told by the head of security that that was considered a protest banner and if I wore the shirt into the gallery that I would have to be arrested.
[00:50:25.505 --> 00:50:34.129]  So I didn't want to get arrested so I backed down and just kind of hung out in the foyer there in front of the gallery until everyone else came out.
[00:50:34.129 --> 00:50:40.872]  So shortly after that there was a wonderful woman handing out all sorts of pens and signs for all of us to make
[00:50:42.523 --> 00:50:47.545]  And then we headed back down to the main foyer, which was right about the time that you were entering in.
[00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:50.467]  And of course, we followed around with the crowd after that.
[00:50:50.467 --> 00:50:57.010]  But I think that the tyranny response team shirts are very powerful and that they're afraid of that message.
[00:50:57.010 --> 00:51:00.692]  So I definitely encourage anybody that doesn't have one of those.
[00:51:00.692 --> 00:51:08.916]  If we can have protests like this in the future where 50 or 100 people show up wearing those specific shirts, I think it would be really fantastic.
[00:51:09.528 --> 00:51:23.081]  And I'd just like to say that for those that have never done anything like what happened yesterday, the adrenaline of participating in something like that is unlike anything that you've ever experienced before.
[00:51:23.081 --> 00:51:28.526]  I mean, who cares about going to the Super Bowl or other things that may seem exciting in life?
[00:51:28.526 --> 00:51:35.252]  If you're actually there participating in the overthrow of tyranny, what could be more important on this entire planet?
[00:51:36.118 --> 00:51:39.300]  And not going and just holding signs and groveling.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:51.427]  When they're trying to literally molest us, you've got to let these perverts, these criminals, these tyrants that want to break our will, let them know, scum, we're aware of what you're doing.
[00:51:51.427 --> 00:51:53.628]  We know you don't care about keeping us safe.
[00:51:53.628 --> 00:51:57.411]  You want to be able to get rid of our basic liberties.
[00:51:57.411 --> 00:51:59.052]  Everything this country was founded on.
[00:51:59.052 --> 00:52:00.733]  Jennifer, great to hear from you.
[00:52:00.733 --> 00:52:02.394]  Cory in Texas at the rally.
[00:52:02.394 --> 00:52:02.774]  Go ahead.
[00:52:04.983 --> 00:52:05.683]  Hey, can you hear me?
[00:52:05.683 --> 00:52:06.944]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:06.944 --> 00:52:07.804]  Hey there.
[00:52:07.804 --> 00:52:09.444]  Well, I just want to say I'll make it quick.
[00:52:09.444 --> 00:52:26.470]  You know, I was sitting on my couch yesterday twiddling my thumbs and I heard the call to go down and help out and speak my voice and I hopped in the car and drove right down and I just want to say to everybody that's listening how wonderful of an experience and invigorating that was.
[00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:33.332]  You know, we went marching around the state capitol there and just letting our voices be known and it just felt so good.
[00:52:34.132 --> 00:52:39.655]  I drove home just high on life and high on it all, man.
[00:52:39.655 --> 00:52:44.418]  And every day can be like that because we literally routed that Capitol.
[00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:49.781]  I mean, they describe it in the news that the booming chanting just totally took over.
[00:52:50.882 --> 00:52:51.442]  I don't
[00:53:12.701 --> 00:53:30.097]  38 to zip, they were all gonna vote for it but one, and that's Dewhurst we now learn, and Dewhurst with the feds, which violates state ethics rules the media is reporting, with federal lobbyists on the floor, went around and basically threatened people and said, you don't tell anybody I'm doing this.
[00:53:30.737 --> 00:53:34.440]  But you don't do this or we're going to have the feds shut down transportation.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.121]  And we have the letter as well.
[00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:39.784]  I mean, Dewhurst is unbelievable.
[00:53:39.784 --> 00:53:45.208]  This guy needs to get out of Texas, much less he should not be our lieutenant governor.
[00:53:45.208 --> 00:53:49.311]  I mean, that guy makes me want to throw up.
[00:53:49.311 --> 00:53:51.373]  I completely concur, Alex.
[00:53:51.373 --> 00:53:51.973]  I do.
[00:53:51.973 --> 00:53:53.935]  I do.
[00:53:53.935 --> 00:53:55.456]  What do you think of Dewhurst now, though?
[00:53:55.456 --> 00:54:00.480]  I mean, it's not just that he brought the feds in and did this, but he wanted to keep it secret.
[00:54:01.345 --> 00:54:16.652]  Well, here's the thing, you know, I was having the thought that, you know, there's... I think that there's far more good people in this world than bad, but it just seems that bad people seem to have the hand on the power and can sneak their way in and wiggle their way in to control us, you know?
[00:54:16.652 --> 00:54:22.194]  But there's enough good people out there if we just stand up and let our voice be heard, you know?
[00:54:22.194 --> 00:54:24.315]  And that's what yesterday was about for me.
[00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:31.551]  Well, it's important for everybody to call Dewhurst's office, but also call other senators' office and say it's going to be a litmus test.
[00:54:32.552 --> 00:54:55.149]  And let it be remembered that Dewhurst secretly sided with Obama to destroy the will of the Texas House and the Senate, and to violate the Constitution and Bill of Rights of the federal and state government, and that he is a deceptive weasel who, one newspaper reported, celebrated after its defeat and made jokes.
[00:54:55.149 --> 00:54:56.730]  So he has a hatred
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:10.269]  Such a hate of liberty and freedom and honor that he's willing to pose as a conservative so he can sabotage things and sit there and lie and say he supported the bill.
[00:55:10.269 --> 00:55:12.891]  I mean, is that not just sickening?
[00:55:12.891 --> 00:55:15.994]  Low as low could be, man.
[00:55:15.994 --> 00:55:17.555]  It is sickening.
[00:55:17.555 --> 00:55:19.176]  You're right.
[00:55:19.176 --> 00:55:23.539]  Well, let it be known, David Dewhurst is a Benedict Arnold.
[00:55:23.539 --> 00:55:25.441]  David Dewhurst is a deceiver.
[00:55:26.765 --> 00:55:31.007]  I mean, you notice folks that support this groping openly, I hardly even attack them.
[00:55:31.007 --> 00:55:33.588]  I just say they're wrong and they're tyrants.
[00:55:33.588 --> 00:55:43.431]  But he is a spy, and of course he is former CIA and reportedly worked with Klaus Barbie in violent overthrows in Latin America.
[00:55:43.431 --> 00:55:48.773]  Ex-CIA spook Dewhurst sabotaged anti-TSA bill for Obama administration.
[00:55:48.773 --> 00:55:50.214]  We have all the footnotes and links to it.
[00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:54.635]  And, you know, these guys live in a world of deceit.
[00:55:54.635 --> 00:55:56.276]  Well, we know they're liars.
[00:55:56.276 --> 00:55:57.196]  So the game's over.
[00:55:57.196 --> 00:55:58.696]  I appreciate your call, Corey.
[00:55:58.696 --> 00:56:02.617]  Ronnie, who's been calling for years, finally met him down there yesterday.
[00:56:02.617 --> 00:56:04.038]  Ronnie was at the rally.
[00:56:04.038 --> 00:56:06.218]  Tell us what you witnessed, Ronnie.
[00:56:06.218 --> 00:56:16.281]  Well, for one, I saw Lieutenant Governor Screwloose years ago at the meeting of a question-and-answer thing, and I asked him about the CIA, and he angrily shot me this evil thing.
[00:56:16.281 --> 00:56:17.281]  You talked about it earlier.
[00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:18.042]  He's evil.
[00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:19.262]  I mean, he radiates evil.
[00:56:20.408 --> 00:56:22.310]  Lieutenant Governor Screwloose, anyway.
[00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:22.650]  Are you there?
[00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.352]  Uh, yeah, so you mean Dewhurst, yeah, Screwloose.
[00:56:25.352 --> 00:56:26.232]  Well, yeah, Screwloose.
[00:56:26.232 --> 00:56:29.895]  I mean, he's gotta have a Screwloose to think he's gonna get away with this delusion.
[00:56:29.895 --> 00:56:36.239]  So what did he say at the CIA, uh, when you brought the CIA up?
[00:56:36.239 --> 00:56:48.708]  Well, uh, you know, there was a bunch of conservative guys, the Lake Travis Republican Men's Club, and he just kind of, you know, they all, he just looked at me, he just looked at me with this evil thing, he just, yes, you know, he just kind of, yes, but how dare you ask me?
[00:56:51.612 --> 00:56:53.674]  Well, it's not that he even was at the CIA.
[00:56:53.674 --> 00:56:56.736]  A lot of them are analysts or you can look at their histories.
[00:56:56.736 --> 00:57:02.159]  He has a death squad history with Klaus Barbie, a top Nazi.
[00:57:02.159 --> 00:57:04.541]  Admittedly, he was under the CIA control.
[00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:07.623]  And we have all the links to mainstream news in our article about it.
[00:57:07.623 --> 00:57:09.764]  So of course he doesn't want you to bring it up.
[00:57:09.764 --> 00:57:12.186]  I mean, I mean, this guy is a tyrant.
[00:57:13.194 --> 00:57:24.761]  And he thinks, because he's a smiley-faced fake Texan with a fancy suit, that we're all here to bend over, and that it's cute that pot-bellied pigs want to grope our daughters and sons.
[00:57:24.761 --> 00:57:27.042]  Dewhurst, you're the one calling for this.
[00:57:27.042 --> 00:57:28.323]  You're the one pushing it.
[00:57:28.323 --> 00:57:31.925]  You're the one trying to basically urinate all over Liberty.
[00:57:31.925 --> 00:57:32.946]  Well, we're not putting up with it.
[00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:55.774]  Tyranny is here.
[00:57:55.774 --> 00:57:59.696]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:57:59.696 --> 00:58:01.937]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:58:01.937 --> 00:58:07.800]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:14.044]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:58:14.464 --> 00:58:20.448]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:58:20.448 --> 00:58:24.631]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:58:24.631 --> 00:58:28.914]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:58:28.914 --> 00:58:34.859]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:58:34.859 --> 00:58:38.421]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:58:38.421 --> 00:58:40.402]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:58:40.402 --> 00:58:40.843]  It's here.

[00:58:51.268 --> 00:58:52.989]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.989 --> 00:58:58.292]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.292 --> 00:58:59.833]  Saving means to make money.
[00:58:59.833 --> 00:59:08.598]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.338 --> 00:59:16.884]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:16.884 --> 00:59:24.890]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:30.113]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:59:30.113 --> 00:59:32.275]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:51.271]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:51.271 --> 00:59:52.812]  Coast to Coast.
[00:59:52.812 --> 00:59:54.874]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:54.874 --> 00:59:58.057]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.847 --> 01:00:07.391]  Let's go ahead and talk to Aaron in Texas.
[01:00:07.391 --> 01:00:09.954]  Go ahead, you were at the rally.
[01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:15.279]  Yes, thank you very much Alex for deciding to change your mind and get active again.
[01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:19.283]  And because I think you're a great leader, I've always thought that.
[01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:22.866]  But please stay focused and keep doing it, that's all.
[01:00:22.866 --> 01:00:24.087]  I mean, one time is not enough.
[01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:26.690]  Man, are you willing to keep on keeping on?
[01:00:27.472 --> 01:00:29.273]  What do you mean one time's not enough?
[01:00:29.273 --> 01:00:38.040]  I fly around, speak to groups of people, been to hundreds of demonstrations, dozens of black op, gun confiscation drills.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:47.567]  I've gone to Bilderberg, I've been arrested, detained, and people call me up and say, you need to make your bones, boy, you haven't done anything.
[01:00:47.567 --> 01:00:50.669]  And I appreciate you saying I'm a leader.
[01:00:50.669 --> 01:00:54.472]  Look, look, here's the reason I don't go to a lot of demonstrations and things.
[01:00:54.472 --> 01:00:56.273]  It's up to the citizens.
[01:00:57.074 --> 01:00:57.634]  to do that.
[01:01:28.235 --> 01:01:31.897]  It's a wild situation, okay?
[01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:49.869]  And also, I can electronically, in the time I go out and do a demonstration or something, and maybe have a little local media coverage or something, and that's good for everybody else to do because the aggregate is huge, I can sit here and do radio, TV interviews, do special reports that reach millions of people a day who are new.
[01:01:50.749 --> 01:02:12.278]  And so, I'm trying to spur the overall awakening, and if I am a general in the fight for liberty, which quite frankly, I'm one of the biggest generals out there, after Ron Paul, then I need to be out there generally breaking down the enemy operations, not always charging around the field.
[01:02:12.278 --> 01:02:18.580]  I mean, I was a private a long time ago, and then I was a sergeant, and then I was a captain, and at a certain point,
[01:02:20.874 --> 01:02:23.976]  Here's another issue.
[01:02:23.976 --> 01:02:37.126]  When I have events or announce events or go to other things with a long-term position, that gives COINTELPRO a chance to get in position and try to manipulate it or deceive people or put provocateurs in.
[01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:40.569]  A head's easy to cut off.
[01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:43.890]  Uh, ahead is easy to politically discredit.
[01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:52.295]  That's why if I can spontaneously announce something and go do it, it'll be a success because they don't have time to maneuver their fake patriots into position to cause problems.
[01:02:52.295 --> 01:02:54.236]  Does that, uh, clarify things for you, Aaron?
[01:02:55.735 --> 01:03:00.557]  Well, again, if you stay active in whatever measured way, it would be great.
[01:03:00.557 --> 01:03:06.280]  And doing the TV channel idea, where you're on a TV channel type thing, I think that's what you have going forward, right?
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.601]  That's really going to be a great idea.
[01:03:07.601 --> 01:03:15.184]  That's really the alternative media going more full-fledged, with the full cornucopia of options for people.
[01:03:15.184 --> 01:03:18.826]  Aaron, so overall, what was your view of what happened yesterday?
[01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:27.494]  Oh, I just think it's the greatest thing ever, because I know when you get these Texans riled up, they're going to do the right thing, the American thing.
[01:03:27.494 --> 01:03:30.817]  So I'm, you know, so happy about it.
[01:03:30.817 --> 01:03:31.878]  God bless you, Aaron.
[01:03:31.878 --> 01:03:32.658]  Action.
[01:03:32.658 --> 01:03:33.139]  I hear you.
[01:03:33.139 --> 01:03:38.183]  Listen, well, that is why it was so empowering, because we shook that place.
[01:03:38.183 --> 01:03:39.344]  We dominated the media.
[01:03:40.305 --> 01:03:48.369]  The media that was covering the House and Senate, dozens and dozens of cameras came, newspapers, and it's all over the world that people are resisting.
[01:03:48.369 --> 01:03:55.172]  And now it's in every major paper out there that I've looked at that Dewhurst is a sneaky little creature.
[01:03:55.172 --> 01:03:58.013]  And that the Republicans were going to blame Democrats for killing this.
[01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:01.410]  Well, it was a Republican.
[01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.831]  It was Dewhurst with Obama.
[01:04:03.831 --> 01:04:05.732]  And so we've drawn them out.
[01:04:05.732 --> 01:04:06.832]  It's a big victory.
[01:04:06.832 --> 01:04:08.313]  Big victory.
[01:04:08.313 --> 01:04:12.215]  Let's talk to Christy in Texas who was there.
[01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:16.416]  Christy, welcome.
[01:04:16.416 --> 01:04:17.197]  Can you hear me?
[01:04:17.197 --> 01:04:17.897]  I can, Christy.
[01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:19.017]  Welcome.
[01:04:19.017 --> 01:04:20.518]  Hello.
[01:04:20.518 --> 01:04:23.940]  We were there a little while after you got there yesterday.
[01:04:25.743 --> 01:04:36.872]  My family and I, my two daughters and my husband went and a friend of ours and came in and heard the noise and found you upstairs.
[01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.013]  It was just amazing.
[01:04:38.013 --> 01:04:41.016]  It was an awesome experience for the girls.
[01:04:41.016 --> 01:04:46.400]  I'm told that my voice but then all the chanting literally filled the entire Capitol and it's giant.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.326]  Rob said that he was in the chambers of the Senate and heard us three levels down just taking over the entire chamber.
[01:04:59.226 --> 01:05:03.769]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:04.689]  Number 1.
[01:05:04.689 --> 01:05:08.111]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.111 --> 01:05:08.972]  Number 2.
[01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:13.875]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:14.615]  It's true.
[01:05:14.615 --> 01:05:19.478]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.478 --> 01:05:20.319]  Number 3.
[01:05:20.319 --> 01:05:23.901]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:23.901 --> 01:05:27.804]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:27.804 --> 01:05:28.084]  Number 4.
[01:05:28.584 --> 01:05:31.345]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:35.026]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.026 --> 01:05:35.826]  Number 5.
[01:05:35.826 --> 01:05:39.968]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.968 --> 01:05:45.029]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:49.191]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.191 --> 01:05:50.991]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.991 --> 01:05:55.593]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-877-422-4222.
[01:05:55.913 --> 01:05:56.173]  877-327-0365.
[01:05:56.173 --> 01:06:04.146]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:06.950]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:43.743]  Okay, we've got some big breaking news with Dr. Jerome Porcey is PhD from Harvard University political science Currently a senior staff reporter for World Net Daily where he works as investigative reporter Of course in 2004 he co-authored the number one New York Times bestseller unfit for command Swift boat veterans speak out against John Kerry Regnery
[01:06:44.815 --> 01:06:47.917]  He's an expert on political violence and terrorism.
[01:06:47.917 --> 01:06:56.142]  In 81, he received the top-secret clearance from the Agency of International Development, where he assisted in providing anti-terrorism training to embassy personnel.
[01:06:56.142 --> 01:07:10.591]  For 25 years, beginning in 81, under Corsi, he developed work with banks throughout the United States and around the world to develop financial service marketing companies to assist banks in establishing broker-dealers and insurance subsidiaries to provide financial planning products and services to their retail customers.
[01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:11.711]  Now, I'd like to have Dr.
[01:07:13.252 --> 01:07:13.893]  I don't know.
[01:07:30.202 --> 01:07:33.384]  By the way, available at InfoWars.com if folks want to get it.
[01:07:33.384 --> 01:07:36.246]  Excellent hard copy with all the exhibits and documents.
[01:07:36.246 --> 01:07:39.908]  You find out this guy isn't who he says he is, he's covering up his history.
[01:07:39.908 --> 01:07:45.471]  They released that other birth certificate receipt, said that was the long form, nothing else existed.
[01:07:45.471 --> 01:07:52.536]  Governor Abercrombie couldn't find it when he went into the stacks and tried to, then magically it appeared, then breaking here last Friday.
[01:07:53.476 --> 01:08:02.799]  Dr. Corsi went over the fact that he believes he knows who did it, and now he's going to move to file criminal charges.
[01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:07.700]  And that news is up on PrisonPlanet.com today, in Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.241]  It's also at Infowars.com and WorldNetDaily.com.
[01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:20.429]  He sent me the actual Kenyan government documents where they admit that they can't find it and appears the record has been altered or removed.
[01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:23.933]  He went to Kenya, of course, to start ferreting out this information.
[01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:31.599]  And when he comes out and says, this is a fake, it's been altered, our people looked at it, we had other experts look at it, it's been altered.
[01:08:31.599 --> 01:08:32.961]  Again, I've not been a big birther.
[01:08:32.961 --> 01:08:34.082]  I've had other issues to cover.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:42.727]  But we've spent time looking at it over the years because they spent over two million dollars at the White House blocking releasing what they've now released.
[01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:49.473]  Now, we're going to go over all the latest news with Dr. Corsi for the balance of the hour, but before we go there, last week,
[01:08:51.377 --> 01:09:01.246]  On this radio broadcast, he called out Donald Trump, who's a big Democratic contributor, big eminent domain supporter, socialist healthcare supporter.
[01:09:01.246 --> 01:09:13.317]  As Lou Rockwell and others have pointed out, if this guy's a conservative, the seediness of the penny stocks, the seediness of the casinos, I mean, we might as well hire, well, I'm not gonna get into it.
[01:09:13.317 --> 01:09:15.920]  The point is that Donald Trump is a joke.
[01:09:17.188 --> 01:09:21.051]  And with all his slick salesman talk, America's like, we like him.
[01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:22.952]  Conservatives, a lot of them, we want him.
[01:09:22.952 --> 01:09:24.453]  He did this birth certificate thing.
[01:09:24.453 --> 01:09:26.135]  He brought it to a head.
[01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:29.377]  Then he kind of floundered around and acted embarrassed.
[01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:35.702]  Then he came out and did a bunch of cussing tirades he's never done before, tailored to discredit.
[01:09:35.702 --> 01:09:43.647]  And then magically, he gets the $60 million NBC re-up contract with bailout money from Bush, then Obama going to NBC.
[01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:44.348]  That's on record.
[01:09:46.509 --> 01:09:49.151]  Of course he calls him out boldly.
[01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:53.335]  Well, Donald, the Donald, had called him twice wanting the book before it was published.
[01:09:53.335 --> 01:09:54.656]  He got it to him.
[01:09:54.656 --> 01:09:57.758]  We wonder where that went.
[01:09:57.758 --> 01:10:02.622]  And now he's got all his casino deals in Chicago and ROMs their man in Chicago.
[01:10:02.622 --> 01:10:04.204]  And so, of course, he calls this out.
[01:10:04.204 --> 01:10:06.906]  Well, the Donald called him today.
[01:10:06.906 --> 01:10:08.007]  This is breaking here.
[01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:10.668]  The Donald called today!
[01:10:10.668 --> 01:10:13.650]  The Donald's concerned!
[01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:16.032]  Dr. Corsi, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:16.032 --> 01:10:18.994]  Please reveal to us your discussion with the Donald.
[01:10:18.994 --> 01:10:19.814]  Yes, Alex.
[01:10:19.814 --> 01:10:22.756]  In fact, I just got off the phone with him a few minutes ago.
[01:10:22.756 --> 01:10:29.041]  Donald Trump called today, and Corsi, as usual, is pumping me for information.
[01:10:29.041 --> 01:10:33.143]  He wants very much to know what I'm doing next.
[01:10:33.143 --> 01:10:35.465]  And I said, well, you know, Donald, we published an article,
[01:10:36.543 --> 01:10:50.533]  World Net Daily, you should have seen it, about how the Kenyan government searched for 1961 birth records and determined that 1961 birth records were criminally tampered to destroy evidence of Obama's birth.
[01:10:50.533 --> 01:10:51.414]  He said, why didn't you see that?
[01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.215]  I said, well, give it to your people, I'll send it to you.
[01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:54.456]  He said, well, that's alright, I'll look for it.
[01:10:54.456 --> 01:11:00.220]  I mean, he is completely uninterested except to know, you know, what I'm doing.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:00.721]  What's next?
[01:11:01.893 --> 01:11:23.383]  I indicated to Donald Trump, and this may be breaking news too, now the criminal charges, we're working with a top expert in scanners, worldwide expert, who is preparing, will be reporting on it in WND World Net Daily, hopefully the end of the week, maybe Monday or Tuesday at the latest.
[01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:27.645]  Criminal charges are going to be filed, criminal complaints filed with the FBI,
[01:11:29.088 --> 01:11:38.056]  I'm charging that the long-form birth certificate released by the White House on April 27th is fraudulent.
[01:11:38.056 --> 01:11:40.918]  And I've been working back and forth with the expert on that.
[01:11:40.918 --> 01:11:42.660]  I've read the charges.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.541]  They're very credible.
[01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:45.022]  They're going to be very difficult to answer.
[01:11:45.022 --> 01:11:48.084]  I told Donald Trump that's coming.
[01:11:48.084 --> 01:11:53.669]  So Trump, you know, if he's feeding information to the White House, he certainly knows what I'm doing, and I'm not hesitating to tell him.
[01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:55.651]  I'm happy to let the White House know what I'm doing.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:05.654]  I published Where's the Birth Certificate with that title, hoping I could get the White House so frightened that they would release this long-form birth certificate, which they did.
[01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:12.064]  The President has now endorsed his own involvement in the chain of evidence, saying he sent his attorney out to get it.
[01:12:12.648 --> 01:12:16.531]  Coming out of the White House press room and saying, this is my birth certificate.
[01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:21.274]  Now the administration rises and falls on the authenticity of that document.
[01:12:21.274 --> 01:12:35.665]  So Donald Trump, I think, I told Donald, I said, look Donald, if you want to be credible here, I mean, told him basically he didn't accuse me or badger me for saying that I thought he was working with the Obama White House, but I said, told him I'm correct.
[01:12:36.408 --> 01:12:41.212]  If you don't want people to be suspect on what role you're playing in this, then get out there.
[01:12:41.212 --> 01:12:43.574]  Get out there vocally.
[01:12:43.574 --> 01:12:45.495]  Question the document.
[01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:53.422]  Say you want forensic testing of the original paper, long-form document that's in the vault of the Hawaii Department of Health.
[01:12:53.422 --> 01:12:55.844]  Say you want the Dr. Sinclair's records released.
[01:12:56.488 --> 01:13:03.414]  See if Ann Dunham was a patient and say you want the records of Kapi'olani Hospital released so we can see if Ann Dunham was ever there.
[01:13:03.414 --> 01:13:05.295]  Family changed their tune.
[01:13:05.295 --> 01:13:08.418]  It was originally that Baba was supposed to be born at Queens Hospital.
[01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:09.899]  Now it's Kapi'olani.
[01:13:09.899 --> 01:13:12.121]  Let's see the patient records for Ann Dunham.
[01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.743]  Trump didn't seem interested in any of that.
[01:13:14.743 --> 01:13:16.865]  But he was very interested in knowing what I was up to next.
[01:13:17.538 --> 01:13:22.702]  All right, I want to pump you on the Trump issue because we can get some key intel out of that.
[01:13:22.702 --> 01:13:33.389]  But for internet viewers at PrisonPlanet.TV, this is all linked up in your WorldNet Daily story, also Paul Joseph Watson's story at PrisonPlanet.com if radio listeners want to see it.
[01:13:33.389 --> 01:13:36.712]  But for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, I'll show folks a document cam shot.
[01:13:37.552 --> 01:13:41.177]  Here is one of several documents that you sent to me a few days ago.
[01:13:41.177 --> 01:13:42.939]  Now your report's out today.
[01:13:42.939 --> 01:13:50.889]  Republic of Kenya, Office of the Vice President, Ministry of State for Immigration and Registration of Persons.
[01:13:50.889 --> 01:13:53.412]  This is the classified document you got them to release.
[01:13:54.491 --> 01:13:59.355]  And it says, however, there is no evidence within our records that supports this position.
[01:13:59.355 --> 01:14:17.191]  The information we in the ministry have is that some documents have been removed by unknown persons at unknown dates or are missing from birth registry records, thus denting the prospects of uncovering the facts of this matter.
[01:14:18.326 --> 01:14:18.948]  I don't know.
[01:14:29.266 --> 01:14:33.828]  Greg Maternity, wing of the Coast Provincial General Hospital.
[01:14:33.828 --> 01:14:38.831]  And they go on, on the letterhead of the government, with the phone numbers there, and say that it's been removed.
[01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:40.872]  It's been tampered with.
[01:14:40.872 --> 01:14:41.812]  Criminally.
[01:14:41.812 --> 01:14:42.212]  Criminally.
[01:14:42.212 --> 01:14:43.833]  They go on to say it's criminal.
[01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:50.016]  So this is a pretty powerful smoking gun here.
[01:14:50.016 --> 01:14:54.559]  And then if I was Donald Trump and you went on this big syndicated radio show,
[01:14:55.535 --> 01:15:04.559]  And drop the bombshell, and it was read by millions of people all over the web, our stories, our videos, went completely viral with that interview with you last week.
[01:15:04.559 --> 01:15:18.966]  And then Donald Trump calls you up Tuesday, and if I was innocent, and you were saying that I worked for the president and I was Donald Trump, or that I was conduiting info months ago when you gave me the book if I was Donald Trump, I'd say, Corsi, how dare you, pal?
[01:15:21.215 --> 01:15:25.362]  If I was guilty, I would just, you know, ignore it.
[01:15:25.362 --> 01:15:27.225]  Or if I was innocent, I'd probably ignore it.
[01:15:27.225 --> 01:15:28.828]  I mean, those are the different things you would do.
[01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:32.895]  You wouldn't call up and just pump for more info and be nice.
[01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:34.457]  That's a pretty creepy phone call you got.
[01:16:00.484 --> 01:16:03.466]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:16:03.466 --> 01:16:07.088]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[01:16:07.088 --> 01:16:13.691]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:16:53.759 --> 01:17:00.464]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:17:00.464 --> 01:17:01.625]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:08.550]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:10.812]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:17:11.092 --> 01:17:16.476]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:17:16.476 --> 01:17:19.518]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:17:19.518 --> 01:17:21.839]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:17:21.839 --> 01:17:28.083]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:31.465]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:17:31.465 --> 01:17:37.249]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:17:37.249 --> 01:17:38.890]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:40.011]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:17:40.171 --> 01:17:42.852]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:17:42.852 --> 01:17:47.073]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:17:47.073 --> 01:17:51.694]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:17:51.694 --> 01:17:54.275]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:17:54.275 --> 01:17:57.296]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:17:57.296 --> 01:17:57.896]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:18:01.991 --> 01:18:05.954]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:05.954 --> 01:18:14.821]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:18:14.821 --> 01:18:19.465]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:18:19.465 --> 01:18:30.274]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:18:30.894 --> 01:18:40.418]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:40.418 --> 01:18:45.840]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:53.344]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:18:53.344 --> 01:18:56.085]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:05.270]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:08.511]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:13.312]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:19:13.312 --> 01:19:19.694]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:19.694 --> 01:19:21.935]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:19:22.475 --> 01:19:22.795]  Tim Geithner?
[01:19:22.795 --> 01:19:23.275]  Bernanke?
[01:19:23.275 --> 01:19:23.636]  They're arsonists!
[01:19:23.636 --> 01:19:24.416]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:24.416 --> 01:19:26.757]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:41.383 --> 01:19:43.244]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:43.244 --> 01:19:48.667]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:19:48.667 --> 01:20:01.334]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:01.334 --> 01:20:02.855]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:02.855 --> 01:20:04.916]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.916 --> 01:20:08.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:12.295 --> 01:20:14.217]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:20:14.217 --> 01:20:15.599]  A lie!
[01:20:15.599 --> 01:20:17.601]  No man is obsolete!
[01:20:17.601 --> 01:20:19.463]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:20:19.463 --> 01:20:22.707]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:20:22.707 --> 01:20:28.173]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:20:28.173 --> 01:20:29.855]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:20:29.855 --> 01:20:30.917]  A crawling insect!
[01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:36.022]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:20:36.022 --> 01:20:37.504]  I am a human being!
[01:20:37.504 --> 01:20:45.272]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:20:45.272 --> 01:20:45.973]  I don't care!
[01:20:45.973 --> 01:20:47.975]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:20:47.975 --> 01:20:48.836]  I'm a human being!
[01:20:48.836 --> 01:20:49.516]  I exist!
[01:20:50.586 --> 01:20:56.711]  If I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:20:56.711 --> 01:20:59.873]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:20:59.873 --> 01:21:07.559]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:21:07.559 --> 01:21:12.923]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[01:21:14.594 --> 01:21:18.702]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:21:18.702 --> 01:21:20.405]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:21:48.274 --> 01:21:53.818]  Describe what Donald Trump said to you, how long the conversation was, how he behaved.
[01:21:53.818 --> 01:21:56.580]  Well, the conversation lasted about 15 minutes.
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.821]  And Donald Trump was friendly.
[01:21:58.821 --> 01:22:05.946]  He did not confront me aggressively that I said I think he's working for the Obama White House.
[01:22:05.946 --> 01:22:09.989]  I went out there on your show, Alex, very publicly about that.
[01:22:09.989 --> 01:22:16.433]  And Trump was saying, you know, and I told, Trump was, his purpose of the call was he wanted to know what I was doing, what was next.
[01:22:17.364 --> 01:22:19.746]  The story didn't get any traction.
[01:22:19.746 --> 01:22:24.510]  I told him about the documents from Kenya that we've been publishing in World Net Daily.
[01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:27.392]  The documents... I was there in Kenya in 2008.
[01:22:27.392 --> 01:22:30.995]  I've continued to receive documents from Kenyan sources.
[01:22:30.995 --> 01:22:32.217]  You see some of them right now.
[01:22:32.217 --> 01:22:33.097]  You're reporting on them.
[01:22:33.097 --> 01:22:44.587]  We've reported World Net Daily criminal tampering of birth records in... of 1961 birth records in Kenya to disguise or remove Barack Obama's birth records in Kenya.
[01:22:45.373 --> 01:22:47.754]  I thought that was an explosive story.
[01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:49.474]  Trump wasn't real interested in it.
[01:22:49.474 --> 01:22:56.035]  I told him where the criminal charges are going to be filed with the FBI by a top expert.
[01:22:56.035 --> 01:23:04.677]  Again, Trump was interested in that, but I said to him, you know, he went back and forth and said, well, I said, Mr. Trump, are you going to get back into the story?
[01:23:04.677 --> 01:23:09.478]  I told him, so people are saying, you know, you got this big payoff from NBC.
[01:23:09.478 --> 01:23:13.319]  It sure looks like you dropped out over that payoff in relationship with the White House.
[01:23:14.395 --> 01:23:20.976]  And Trump said, well, you know, even when you're as rich as I am, it's $60 million times $220 million.
[01:23:20.976 --> 01:23:21.897]  Isn't Trump changed?
[01:23:21.897 --> 01:23:23.977]  That's the way I understand that, Mr. Trump.
[01:23:23.977 --> 01:23:26.978]  Nobody's offered me $120 million recently.
[01:23:26.978 --> 01:23:30.999]  But you can understand where a lot of people think that compromises your position.
[01:23:30.999 --> 01:23:32.219]  Maybe why you dropped out.
[01:23:32.219 --> 01:23:34.179]  You know, I didn't drop out.
[01:23:34.179 --> 01:23:37.700]  I said that the documents, I still want to know if the documents are real.
[01:23:38.442 --> 01:23:39.423]  And that was a big problem.
[01:23:39.423 --> 01:23:48.611]  So Trump comes out, builds it to a head, and then right as it comes to a head, there's the big media spectacular to discredit the whole thing.
[01:23:48.611 --> 01:23:54.176]  And then we saw the next big stunt a few weeks later to then wipe that controversy off the map.
[01:23:54.176 --> 01:23:59.640]  Obama daringly gets Osama bin Laden.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.762]  He's just so wonderful.
[01:24:01.762 --> 01:24:05.305]  And then that launches the next phase of starting a war with Pakistan.
[01:24:06.506 --> 01:24:11.449]  And the fact that Trump comes out and says, Ron Paul can't win.
[01:24:11.449 --> 01:24:13.510]  And look at these Republicans, they're pathetic.
[01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:18.673]  And the fact that he's given two to one to Democrats and hangs out in New York with Bloomberg and Schumer.
[01:24:18.673 --> 01:24:23.496]  I mean, it's so obvious that this guy, from my perspective, is a ringer.
[01:24:24.216 --> 01:24:34.204]  And you've got this government money going to NBC, and then right into Trump's pocket, and that ridiculous preening peacock show, The Apprentice.
[01:24:34.204 --> 01:24:38.928]  And he's on the phone with you wanting to know what you're going to do next.
[01:24:38.928 --> 01:24:41.410]  Very bizarre, Jerome Corsi.
[01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:51.358]  I mean, if you're a discredited kook, and he's been discredited, you think he would be fighting to continue to expose, but instead he wants to lay there like a possum.
[01:24:52.014 --> 01:24:54.283]  Well, I said it from today on the telephone.
[01:24:54.283 --> 01:24:57.416]  I said, look, get involved if you want people to believe that...
[01:24:58.064 --> 01:25:05.187]  You know, you're still on the side of disbelieving, disbelieving Obama that asked for authentication.
[01:25:05.187 --> 01:25:07.728]  We have, nobody has seen the original document.
[01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:13.551]  In a court of law, the best evidence would not be this electronic birth certificate the White House released.
[01:25:13.551 --> 01:25:17.313]  Electronic birth certificates didn't even exist in 1961.
[01:25:17.313 --> 01:25:22.775]  The best evidence is in the vault in the Department of Health in Hawaii, the original birth certificate, if it exists.
[01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:24.798]  And we can't see that.
[01:25:24.798 --> 01:25:27.460]  We can't get it subjected to forensic analysis.
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.042]  And Mr. Trump pressed that case.
[01:25:29.042 --> 01:25:30.103]  He seemed uninterested.
[01:25:30.103 --> 01:25:35.647]  He said, you know, if it got to be an issue again, he would jump back in.
[01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:39.471]  I said, well, Mr. Trump, jump back in now.
[01:25:39.471 --> 01:25:42.473]  And, you know, he said, well, do you have any mainstream media supporting it?
[01:25:42.473 --> 01:25:49.880]  I said, you know, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Trump, I've run these campaigns before when I did on Pittsburgh Command with John O'Deill and Swift Boatman.
[01:25:50.655 --> 01:25:53.521]  Published by myself, Abomination, 2008.
[01:25:53.521 --> 01:25:55.985]  It was number one bestseller for a month.
[01:25:55.985 --> 01:25:57.087]  They never wanted to support that.
[01:25:57.087 --> 01:26:00.514]  New York Times ran a front page article blasting the book.
[01:26:01.576 --> 01:26:12.538]  I'm not counting on any mainstream media, and I'm not expecting to get invited to the White House Christmas party, but Mr. Trump, neither should you be expecting to get invited to the White House Christmas party.
[01:26:12.538 --> 01:26:21.560]  Get out there and pound this issue if you want people to believe that you're really on the side of wanting the truth and asking for where's the birth certificate.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.280]  Go on the record.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.961]  If you don't believe that this is legitimate, say it's a fraud.
[01:26:25.961 --> 01:26:26.881]  He wouldn't do it.
[01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:30.622]  He was unenthusiastic and not responsive when I made those suggestions.
[01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:37.301]  Well said.
[01:26:37.301 --> 01:26:46.528]  For me, the biggest piece of evidence here, and I know as a journalist... And also, Alex, he asked me to call him before we made our next move so he'd know what we were doing.
[01:26:46.528 --> 01:26:50.090]  I mean, the whole call was, what are you up to?
[01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:52.972]  And please tell me first before you do it.
[01:26:52.972 --> 01:26:54.814]  Now, I mean, I'm happy to talk to Trump.
[01:26:54.814 --> 01:26:56.695]  I'm happy to tell him what I'm doing.
[01:26:56.695 --> 01:27:00.218]  Did he comment on the fact that you've called him out?
[01:27:00.218 --> 01:27:01.639]  No, he never made a comment about it.
[01:27:02.441 --> 01:27:03.382]  Didn't say a word.
[01:27:03.382 --> 01:27:04.783]  But you brought that up to him.
[01:27:04.783 --> 01:27:07.425]  Well, I didn't say I'm out there saying it.
[01:27:07.425 --> 01:27:08.666]  I made the charge to him.
[01:27:08.666 --> 01:27:23.137]  I said, Mr. Trump, if you don't get out of the Donald, really, well, kind of on a first-name basis at this point, the Donald, look, if you don't get out there and start doing this, nobody's going to believe that you're really opposing Obama.
[01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:25.159]  It looks like you're supporting Obama.
[01:27:26.705 --> 01:27:41.252]  I told him that even with, I saw him on Fox News, I believe it was yesterday, Trump is saying, attacking the Republican candidate, saying he's going to get back in the race if the Republicans keep with such lousy candidates.
[01:27:41.252 --> 01:27:43.753]  I said, that sounds like Obama's line.
[01:27:43.753 --> 01:27:45.934]  Are you feeding Obama's line to the American people?
[01:27:45.934 --> 01:27:47.815]  I said, well they are lousy candidates.
[01:27:47.815 --> 01:27:53.878]  I said, look, if you're going to attack the other Republicans, you're not going to get anywhere convincing people that you want to run as a Republican.
[01:27:54.497 --> 01:27:56.839]  Trump said, well, should I run as an independent?
[01:27:56.839 --> 01:28:09.489]  I said, Mr. Trump, if you run as an independent, you're going to 100% convince everybody that you're, you know, you're in cahoots with Obama, trying to split the vote of the Republicans so that the Obama wins.
[01:28:09.489 --> 01:28:17.736]  Look, look, that casino owner, that good old boy, good fella, knows exactly, of course, exactly what he's doing.
[01:28:17.736 --> 01:28:20.078]  Now, now this was a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:28:21.479 --> 01:28:25.702]  And I want to preface this question now and then come back and have you answer it.
[01:28:25.702 --> 01:28:40.835]  For me, I think one of the biggest pieces of evidence you've got of this being fraud is not just the Kenyan government saying their records were tampered with criminally and expunged on Obama and that their intelligence agency does have intel that he was born there.
[01:28:41.576 --> 01:28:50.726]  Bigger than that is that you were told three weeks before by a source inside the government of Hawaii that it wasn't there, now it's there.
[01:28:50.726 --> 01:28:55.831]  And you say you have the email evidence with Joseph Farah telling him that.
[01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:57.593]  That's not giving up a source.
[01:28:57.593 --> 01:28:58.834]  You need to release all that.
[01:28:58.834 --> 01:28:59.415]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:00.489 --> 01:29:05.052]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:29:05.052 --> 01:29:05.953]  Number 1.
[01:29:05.953 --> 01:29:09.375]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:29:09.375 --> 01:29:10.236]  Number 2.
[01:29:10.236 --> 01:29:15.139]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:29:15.139 --> 01:29:15.879]  It's true.
[01:29:15.879 --> 01:29:20.743]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:29:20.743 --> 01:29:21.583]  Number 3.
[01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:25.165]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:29:25.165 --> 01:29:28.868]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:29:29.068 --> 01:29:29.868]  Number 4.
[01:29:29.868 --> 01:29:32.629]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:36.311]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:29:36.311 --> 01:29:37.091]  Number 5.
[01:29:37.091 --> 01:29:41.233]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:29:41.233 --> 01:29:46.295]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:01.581]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:01.581 --> 01:30:08.525]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.525 --> 01:30:11.086]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.086 --> 01:30:16.449]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.449 --> 01:30:19.511]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.511 --> 01:30:21.552]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:21.812 --> 01:30:28.056]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.056 --> 01:30:31.438]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.438 --> 01:30:37.221]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.221 --> 01:30:38.862]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:38.862 --> 01:30:40.163]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.163 --> 01:30:42.824]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:42.824 --> 01:30:44.245]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:30:44.525 --> 01:30:47.046]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.046 --> 01:30:51.669]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:54.270]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:30:58.132 --> 01:31:00.133]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:00.133 --> 01:31:03.114]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:31:03.114 --> 01:31:06.436]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[01:31:06.716 --> 01:31:13.342]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:32:04.309 --> 01:32:05.570]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:09.432]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.432 --> 01:32:11.734]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.734 --> 01:32:17.598]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:23.842]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.262 --> 01:32:30.246]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.246 --> 01:32:34.409]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.409 --> 01:32:38.712]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.712 --> 01:32:44.657]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.657 --> 01:32:48.219]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.219 --> 01:32:50.180]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:50.621]  It's here.

[01:33:30.216 --> 01:33:33.338]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:33.338 --> 01:33:39.463]  We are here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:39.463 --> 01:33:39.763]  Central.
[01:33:52.724 --> 01:34:06.414]  And if you believe that Obama is telling us the truth about his true identity and his history, we know he's been caught in lies repeatedly, and I guess you want to buy some oceanfront property in Arizona.
[01:34:06.414 --> 01:34:10.997]  To quote George Strait, we're going back to Dr. Jerome Corsi, author of Birth Certificate.
[01:34:10.997 --> 01:34:12.398]  Where's the Birth Certificate?
[01:34:12.398 --> 01:34:13.299]  Here in just a moment.
[01:34:13.299 --> 01:34:15.200]  First, some of our great sponsors.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:21.545]  Interfood is a revolutionary 100% organic green superfood that's been a sponsor of ours, I don't know, for six years now.
[01:34:22.485 --> 01:34:27.887]  Energy drink with powerful nutrition for better health, energy, mental clarity, and immune system support.
[01:34:27.887 --> 01:34:29.467]  My wife just loves it.
[01:34:29.467 --> 01:34:33.528]  It was even voted best superfood by our friend Mike Adams from Natural News.
[01:34:33.528 --> 01:34:38.849]  It is composed of nearly 50% of chlorella, spirulina, kelp, and dulse.
[01:34:38.849 --> 01:34:43.971]  It also is high in naturally occurring iodine, which is just so good for the entire body.
[01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:46.653]  Give them a call today at 866-762-9238.
[01:35:03.266 --> 01:35:03.807]  That's one word.
[01:35:32.591 --> 01:35:37.535]  And in closing here with the plugs, remember the alternative media is financed by your support.
[01:35:37.535 --> 01:35:42.880]  The establishment has done everything they can to kill this book because where there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:55.332]  And this book deals with his entire bizarre background and all of the weirdness and just the, I mean, the tranny nannies, all the different names, the different daddies.
[01:35:55.332 --> 01:35:57.794]  It's now come out that his purported dad,
[01:35:59.375 --> 01:36:06.160]  The State Department wanted to get him out of the country because of all the fake marriages and pregnancies and women, and he looks nothing like his father.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.981]  Dr. Corsi's broken all that down.
[01:36:07.981 --> 01:36:09.662]  The book, Where's the Birth Certificate?
[01:36:09.662 --> 01:36:12.744]  The case that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president.
[01:36:12.744 --> 01:36:14.465]  Remember, I'm nonpartisan.
[01:36:14.465 --> 01:36:15.386]  I don't like Bush.
[01:36:15.386 --> 01:36:16.407]  I don't like Obama.
[01:36:16.407 --> 01:36:19.589]  I don't like any of these New World Order corporate front men.
[01:36:19.589 --> 01:36:20.930]  The point is, this guy
[01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:36.254]  This guy's got something he's hiding, and he's got that snake coiled up around him with this whole con on the public with Donald the Donald Trump.
[01:36:36.254 --> 01:36:44.296]  So, I hope you get the book, Where's the Birth Certificate, at Infowars.com, and check out all the other books and videos we carry on the films that I produce.
[01:36:44.296 --> 01:36:45.996]  You can also call us toll free to get it, 888-253-3139.
[01:36:49.517 --> 01:36:49.697]  I don't
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.021]  Esquire put out saying the book had been recalled.
[01:37:11.021 --> 01:37:24.825]  Farrah had said it was all lies and discredited and that everybody should send their books back and you'd give them their retail price back that would bankrupt you guys to try to create a run on the bookstores of people demanding their money back so they pull the book.
[01:37:24.825 --> 01:37:28.485]  How badly economically has it hurt you guys?
[01:37:28.485 --> 01:37:32.166]  I mean it was a number one New York Times bestseller before it came out.
[01:37:32.166 --> 01:37:33.887]  How much damage has this done to the book?
[01:37:34.207 --> 01:37:38.330]  Well, I think, first of all, the attack was vicious by Esquire.
[01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:41.112]  It was intended to destroy the marketing of the book.
[01:37:41.112 --> 01:37:47.676]  In the first hour, Esquire later said it was satire, and it wasn't very funny.
[01:37:47.676 --> 01:37:49.937]  It certainly didn't appear as satire.
[01:37:49.937 --> 01:37:56.102]  It appeared as a news story, and you could reasonably read it and have been fooled by it.
[01:37:56.102 --> 01:38:01.165]  Some radio hosts that interviewed me were fooled by it and started out their interviews asking why we pulled the book.
[01:38:02.262 --> 01:38:05.704]  Look, World of Daily is going to sue Esquire.
[01:38:05.704 --> 01:38:07.985]  Joseph Harris announced that.
[01:38:07.985 --> 01:38:11.347]  So the economic damage had to have been important and severe.
[01:38:11.347 --> 01:38:15.009]  Certainly the intent to damage was important and severe.
[01:38:15.009 --> 01:38:16.330]  World of Daily will do just fine.
[01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:24.775]  The book is selling, but we had to scramble very hard to reestablish the market and to reassure distributors that the book had not been pulled.
[01:38:24.775 --> 01:38:25.915]  The book is alive and well.
[01:38:25.915 --> 01:38:28.376]  It's out there everywhere in bookstores.
[01:38:28.376 --> 01:38:30.878]  All the electronic outlets are selling the book.
[01:38:31.779 --> 01:38:33.962]  I still rated it on Amazon.com.
[01:38:33.962 --> 01:38:34.403]  Take a look.
[01:38:34.403 --> 01:38:37.126]  It's out active all through the market.
[01:38:37.126 --> 01:38:44.776]  And it was a vicious attack by Esquire aimed at, you know, I guess, projecting what the White House wanted to believe what was true.
[01:38:44.776 --> 01:38:45.798]  I think the White House hoped
[01:38:46.423 --> 01:38:52.865]  The book would be withdrawn, but I published this book with Joseph Aaron because I knew he had the courage to keep the book out there.
[01:38:52.865 --> 01:39:09.149]  A mainstream media publisher, one of the big publishing houses that I've published with big publishing houses before, the White House might have intimidated them by calling up and, you know, threatening not to give them access to authors or whatever to get a major publishing house to withdraw the book.
[01:39:09.893 --> 01:39:12.235]  At this case, I knew that there was no chance it would happen.
[01:39:12.235 --> 01:39:16.258]  Joseph Farah was as resolute as I am that the book is true.
[01:39:16.258 --> 01:39:24.585]  We still want to know where the birth certificate is, and we're taking every possible step to demonstrate Obama was not born in Hawaii, he was born in Kenya.
[01:39:24.585 --> 01:39:36.135]  I'm convinced of that now, and here you've got a situation where the birth certificate released by the White House is a fraudulent document, which means criminal fraud was created, committed in the White House.
[01:39:36.135 --> 01:39:36.856]  President Obama is
[01:39:37.626 --> 01:39:40.487]  Personally identified as a chain of evidence.
[01:39:40.487 --> 01:39:42.467]  He sent his lawyer out to get this document.
[01:39:42.467 --> 01:39:47.268]  President Obama showed up in the White House press room to say, here's the document is.
[01:39:47.268 --> 01:39:50.329]  He's correctly involved in the chain of evidence.
[01:39:50.329 --> 01:39:57.231]  At the White House, the future of the Obama presidency will depend on that document remaining authentic.
[01:39:57.231 --> 01:40:03.492]  If it's proved, as I believe it will be, that the document is fraudulent, it's hard to see how the Obama administration will remain in office.
[01:40:04.895 --> 01:40:11.538]  Well, this is only getting bigger, and people don't buy anything that the White House puts out there.
[01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:18.500]  And I know you're under such attack, Jerome, but you normally will tell folks what your dead reckoning says.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:32.446]  But isn't it suspicious that right on the heels of them with the stunt birth certificate that is as phony as a $3 bill, and you're coming out with the evidence and going to file these criminal charges, that then magically
[01:40:33.346 --> 01:40:33.466]  They
[01:40:48.283 --> 01:40:51.005]  Well, I just haven't gone into the OBL situation.
[01:40:51.005 --> 01:40:52.826]  I've got my hands full with the birth certificate issue.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:25.322]  But, you know, what I'm going to comment on is that here for three years, Obama spent a couple million dollars with lawyers.
[01:41:25.322 --> 01:41:33.824]  He even moved his lawyer from Perkins Coie into the White House to be his White House counsel.
[01:41:33.824 --> 01:41:35.725]  And that, to me, is very suspicious.
[01:41:35.725 --> 01:41:38.566]  Fighting the release of this birth certificate.
[01:41:40.724 --> 01:41:41.886]  A book is going to be published.
[01:41:41.886 --> 01:41:58.327]  Now, if this event document was available three years ago, why did we have to go through all this nonsense about the certification of live birth in the short form that Attorney Robert Bauer, together with Anita Dunn, his wife, who is the attack dog again,
[01:41:59.068 --> 01:42:06.690]  Fox and any other media that dared to raise questions about the Obama administration, they're now paid by the White House.
[01:42:06.690 --> 01:42:08.391]  I've seen it done, it's gone.
[01:42:08.391 --> 01:42:16.373]  Power's still there under the government payroll, defending Obama in eligibility cases, and suddenly this document miraculously appears.
[01:42:16.373 --> 01:42:23.455]  Long-form birth certificate that Abercrombie, the governor in Hawaii, said wasn't there about six weeks ago.
[01:42:23.455 --> 01:42:25.175]  He couldn't find it.
[01:42:25.175 --> 01:42:28.156]  Well, that's where, to go to the comment you asked about,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:41.567]  Alex, before the break, I got a call from one of my top intelligence sources in Hawaii that warned me that the document had been forged and inserted into the law book in Hawaii.
[01:42:41.567 --> 01:42:56.336]  In fact, a person who was very connected in the department went in, related to the department, let's say didn't work for the department, but a source, let's say buried to the department, went in and read us the document.
[01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:07.738]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:43:07.738 --> 01:43:12.902]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:43:12.902 --> 01:43:21.630]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:25.694]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:43:25.694 --> 01:43:27.635]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:43:30.117 --> 01:43:34.701]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:43:34.701 --> 01:43:38.544]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:43:38.544 --> 01:43:39.765]  Others don't.
[01:43:39.765 --> 01:43:41.907]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:43:41.907 --> 01:43:43.708]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:46.590]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:43:55.918 --> 01:43:58.280]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.161]  Others don't.
[01:44:00.282 --> 01:44:04.845]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:44:04.845 --> 01:44:05.746]  Number 1.
[01:44:05.746 --> 01:44:09.169]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:10.049]  Number 2.
[01:44:10.049 --> 01:44:14.933]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:44:14.933 --> 01:44:15.673]  It's true.
[01:44:15.673 --> 01:44:20.557]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:44:20.557 --> 01:44:21.378]  Number 3.
[01:44:21.378 --> 01:44:24.960]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:28.863 --> 01:44:29.664]  Number 4.
[01:44:29.664 --> 01:44:32.427]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:44:32.427 --> 01:44:36.111]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:44:36.111 --> 01:44:36.891]  Number 5.
[01:44:36.891 --> 01:44:41.036]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:44:41.036 --> 01:44:45.801]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:45:26.848 --> 01:45:34.852]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:46:08.334 --> 01:46:13.138]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:46:13.138 --> 01:46:19.524]  I have tremendous influence on our president and congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:46:19.524 --> 01:46:21.767]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:46:22.267 --> 01:46:23.467]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:46:23.467 --> 01:46:24.228]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:46:24.228 --> 01:46:26.568]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:46:41.192 --> 01:46:43.313]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:46:43.313 --> 01:46:48.475]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:47:17.344 --> 01:47:32.428]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:47:32.428 --> 01:47:35.029]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:38.288 --> 01:47:49.275]  This is such a big deal that I want to put the question back out there, and I'm not like the type of talk show host unless I really am, you know, shocked, but I already knew about this info, so I'm not shocked.
[01:47:49.275 --> 01:47:53.238]  I've already, you know, had the revelation who will, ooh, ah, now listen up.
[01:47:53.238 --> 01:47:54.319]  This is big.
[01:47:54.319 --> 01:47:56.800]  Folks, understand the magnitude of this.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.502]  But all of that is a prerequisite here.
[01:47:59.502 --> 01:48:03.925]  You're somebody who's always very careful about what you say and do, going back for decades.
[01:48:03.925 --> 01:48:05.746]  You're somebody who really does do the research.
[01:48:05.746 --> 01:48:08.028]  You're coming out saying there's no doubt it's fraudulent.
[01:48:08.868 --> 01:48:16.214]  You're going forward saying you're going to attempt to file criminal charges on this and you revealed here for the first time last week
[01:48:17.088 --> 01:48:25.113]  That you have a source who three weeks before the president went public, went in, was able to see it, and said it wasn't there before.
[01:48:25.113 --> 01:48:29.356]  Your source inside, your mole, it's been added now.
[01:48:29.356 --> 01:48:33.439]  You have the emails with Farah, proving that these discussions went on.
[01:48:33.439 --> 01:48:37.382]  You can't give up the source, but you've got the proof with your Farah emails.
[01:48:37.382 --> 01:48:38.622]  And Farah says, what do we do?
[01:48:38.622 --> 01:48:40.604]  And you say, let's go ahead with it.
[01:48:40.604 --> 01:48:42.545]  This is exactly what we want, Joe.
[01:48:42.545 --> 01:48:44.226]  We've got him now.
[01:48:44.226 --> 01:48:45.887]  Now I'm paraphrasing what you said last week.
[01:48:45.887 --> 01:48:46.648]  Take your time.
[01:48:47.248 --> 01:49:02.773]  Walkthrough exactly what happened three weeks before Obama released the latest long-form supposed final real birth certificate and what the new intelligence source Well the new information that the intelligence source is giving you because folks.
[01:49:02.773 --> 01:49:04.794]  I mean what what dr. Coursey saying here is
[01:49:05.214 --> 01:49:07.395]  You know, they could have a grand jury come after him.
[01:49:07.395 --> 01:49:08.416]  He could be pulled into court.
[01:49:08.416 --> 01:49:10.157]  He could be forced to release this.
[01:49:10.157 --> 01:49:15.019]  He wouldn't be doing this right now if this wasn't true and going on.
[01:49:15.019 --> 01:49:28.366]  So I hope you understand, we're now entering the realm of total proof, not just that he fought it for three years with two million, moved the lawyer into the White House who was fighting it, stonewalling saying with his operatives, Mr. Maddow and Mr. Slimeball,
[01:49:28.866 --> 01:49:32.530]  That this is the birth certificate two and a half years ago.
[01:49:32.530 --> 01:49:36.054]  I mean, just desperate activity on their side.
[01:49:36.054 --> 01:49:38.596]  The thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:49:38.596 --> 01:49:44.783]  The Republic of Kenya classified document release that, yes, the Obama records have criminally been removed.
[01:49:44.783 --> 01:49:46.965]  There's evidence he was born in Mombasa.
[01:49:46.965 --> 01:49:47.746]  I mean, here it is.
[01:49:47.746 --> 01:49:48.547]  He's releasing it.
[01:49:48.547 --> 01:49:51.110]  Of course he wouldn't be doing this now if he didn't
[01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:53.551]  100% think he had the bonafide.
[01:49:53.551 --> 01:49:58.092]  So, slowly, go over your mole inside as much as you can give us.
[01:49:58.092 --> 01:50:02.833]  And when are you going to have Farrah come out and substantiate this verbally, swear to it publicly?
[01:50:02.833 --> 01:50:03.513]  I believe you.
[01:50:03.513 --> 01:50:04.373]  You wouldn't be doing this.
[01:50:04.373 --> 01:50:06.614]  Well, I did even more than that.
[01:50:06.614 --> 01:50:08.974]  I'll give you the exact chronology.
[01:50:08.974 --> 01:50:11.915]  It was just before February 24th.
[01:50:11.915 --> 01:50:19.237]  I got a call from, by source in Hawaii, that said that someone had gone into the logbook, a very trusted mole,
[01:50:20.577 --> 01:50:27.499]  And the long-form birth certificate for Obama had suddenly appeared and was inserted in the book.
[01:50:27.499 --> 01:50:31.720]  Read it enough to know that Kapi'olani Hospital was identified as the hospital.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.861]  Knew a doctor was listed and couldn't, at that time, or was too scared to get the name of the doctor.
[01:50:36.861 --> 01:50:41.522]  Now on February 24th, I'm looking at it right now, I drafted an article.
[01:50:41.522 --> 01:50:44.363]  It's date-stamped February 24th at my computer.
[01:50:44.363 --> 01:50:45.203]  I could send it to you.
[01:50:46.093 --> 01:50:47.494]  Alex's proof.
[01:50:47.494 --> 01:50:55.198]  The article was written, as WND warned, to block possible future release of fraudulent Obama birth record.
[01:50:55.198 --> 01:50:57.639]  And this is, this is February 24th.
[01:50:57.639 --> 01:51:01.181]  It's date stamped this way in my Microsoft Word file.
[01:51:01.181 --> 01:51:03.523]  So you even wrote a story that you didn't release?
[01:51:03.523 --> 01:51:04.163]  We didn't.
[01:51:04.163 --> 01:51:09.806]  We decided not to release it because we, it decided we hoped the White House would release this document.
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:14.543]  See, we named the book, where's the birth certificate, to try to frighten the White House.
[01:51:14.543 --> 01:51:17.925]  I knew the White House could not tolerate if anybody read this book.
[01:51:17.925 --> 01:51:19.246]  He will read this book, Obama.
[01:51:19.246 --> 01:51:25.470]  And their hoax that they had released it was falling through, and so you forced them out in the open.
[01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:29.533]  Yeah, and I knew that Joseph said, we're not going to publish this story.
[01:51:30.333 --> 01:51:39.019]  You've got to release that original story with... Okay, but I don't want to publish it first if it's... If you want to, I'll talk to Joseph.
[01:51:39.019 --> 01:51:40.880]  Maybe we can do a story on it immediately.
[01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:59.292]  Yeah, but you see my point.
[01:51:59.292 --> 01:52:03.957]  The fact that that's the proof that you knew this was going on before it happened, man, this is big.
[01:52:03.957 --> 01:52:14.408]  The proof paragraph of this story is WorldNetDaily has been warned that certain government officials in Hawaii have been contemplating releasing fraudulent Obama birth records.
[01:52:15.865 --> 01:52:22.308]  The WND knows, it has in its possession, information that will be able to prove the forgery.
[01:52:22.308 --> 01:52:24.029]  We have information that will prove the forgery.
[01:52:24.029 --> 01:52:29.972]  See, even when I wrote this in February 24th, I knew that we were going to release it, and I knew we could prove it was a forgery.
[01:52:29.972 --> 01:52:40.177]  And we didn't publish this article because we didn't want to tip off the White House, but we knew that we were going to release the fraudulent document that we could prove it was a forgery.
[01:52:40.177 --> 01:52:41.258]  I'll send you the article.
[01:52:42.233 --> 01:52:45.274]  Well, we need to, uh, absolutely.
[01:52:45.274 --> 01:52:50.437]  If you send it to us, I'll have one of my writers, uh, do a report on it right now and then you can follow up or vice versa.
[01:52:50.437 --> 01:52:51.217]  I don't care.
[01:52:51.217 --> 01:53:05.664]  But for me, and I'm asking if you agree, Dr. Corsi, that is such incredible proof that you had the intel, uh, inside and, and that you knew it was coming, uh, just a few weeks before and had this article ready.
[01:53:06.084 --> 01:53:08.485]  I want to read you these two paragraphs quickly.
[01:53:08.485 --> 01:53:20.369]  World and Daily's confidential source further warned that any fraudulent Obama birth records originating in Hawaii will be sufficiently expert that the forgery can only be detected by forensic examination of the original.
[01:53:21.622 --> 01:53:22.002]  Unbelievable.
[01:53:22.002 --> 01:53:22.102]  Now,
[01:53:47.222 --> 01:53:57.488]  Again, read us for those that have not seen the unpublished report that you had ready, but Farah and you decided not to release so that you could catch them with their pants down.
[01:53:57.488 --> 01:54:00.190]  Read us that headline and as much of the story as you can to us.
[01:54:00.190 --> 01:54:07.374]  Well, the headline said, World News Daily warned to block possible future release of fraudulent Obama birth record.
[01:54:10.345 --> 01:54:26.109]  WorldNetDaily has been warned that certain government officials in Hawaii have been contemplating releasing fraudulent Obama birth records and that WorldNetDaily has in its possession information that will be able to prove the forgery.
[01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:36.472]  According to a top-level WorldNetDaily confidential source with access to officials within the Hawaiian government, the long-form birth certificates issued to the Nordic twins one day after the Obama
[01:54:37.262 --> 01:54:38.323]  Barack Obama was born.
[01:54:38.323 --> 01:54:49.794]  Create a barrier for anyone attempting to produce the fraudulent long-form, Kapi'olani hospital-generated birth certificate for Obama.
[01:54:49.794 --> 01:54:54.179]  What I'm referring to there is, we knew that they were going to continue the document as 10641.
[01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:59.391]  And the birth date, which was registered August 8.
[01:54:59.391 --> 01:55:03.013]  Three days later, the Nordyke twins were registered August 11.
[01:55:03.013 --> 01:55:06.315]  They were 10637 and 10638.
[01:55:06.315 --> 01:55:09.677]  From the time of the certificate of live birth, the forger picked the wrong number.
[01:55:09.677 --> 01:55:12.139]  They've been locked into that to the beginning.
[01:55:12.139 --> 01:55:15.781]  And what my source in Hawaii said is, press the Nordyke numbers.
[01:55:16.545 --> 01:55:23.634]  Because that shows that anything fraudulent that the Obama administration releases is the long-form birth certificate.
[01:55:23.634 --> 01:55:28.019]  As long as it's got the original 10641 on it, it's a fraudulent document.
[01:55:28.019 --> 01:55:31.383]  For those that don't know, that was a big old-fashioned numbering machine.
[01:55:31.383 --> 01:55:33.065]  A fake numbering machine.
[01:55:33.065 --> 01:55:36.589]  One of those fake automatic machines that incremented by one.
[01:55:37.603 --> 01:55:47.910]  And I have the 1955 article from Charles Bennett, who is the guy who created... He was the Registered General of Hawaii's Department of Health.
[01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:51.312]  He created the system of birth certificates.
[01:55:51.312 --> 01:55:59.218]  The article specifies that the birth certificates were numbered immediately after the Registrar General stamped it.
[01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:01.859]  It went into the books with the number he stamped.
[01:56:01.859 --> 01:56:07.063]  That's impossible for a birth certificate that was registered three days earlier to have a higher
[01:56:07.947 --> 01:56:12.115]  Number as a birth certificate birth certificates registered three days later
[01:56:14.738 --> 01:56:26.786]  Well, I'm just speechless right now, and not only did you write this three weeks before Obama released the birth certificate, you called everything in the article that was unpublished.
[01:56:26.786 --> 01:56:27.626]  What happened?
[01:56:27.626 --> 01:56:28.827]  This is incredible.
[01:56:28.827 --> 01:56:33.870]  We had the document read to us from within the vault in Hawaii.
[01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:38.853]  The person went in and read the article, and we knew what was on the document because it was read to us.
[01:56:38.853 --> 01:56:41.535]  And correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the absolute key.
[01:56:41.535 --> 01:56:42.836]  Your same mole
[01:56:44.253 --> 01:56:48.557]  Previously it said it's not there, but now they call you and they go, suddenly it's there.
[01:56:48.557 --> 01:56:48.917]  That's right.
[01:56:48.917 --> 01:56:54.762]  We've been told when Abercrombie was looking that it didn't exist and then it suddenly existed.
[01:56:54.762 --> 01:57:04.210]  And that's confirmed by Abercrombie thinking he's off record with the reporter who kept the recorder going and just added it as a footnote in his article that Abercrombie said, yeah, we thought it'd be there.
[01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:05.211]  It's not.
[01:57:05.211 --> 01:57:08.054]  And I think it's equally important to what we've released.
[01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:10.396]  You've got the Kenyan documents there.
[01:57:10.396 --> 01:57:11.757]  Kenyan government stationary.
[01:57:13.295 --> 01:57:17.817]  Grandma, Sarah, has been saying for years Obama was born in Kenya.
[01:57:17.817 --> 01:57:19.898]  The Kenyan government took it seriously.
[01:57:19.898 --> 01:57:31.923]  Kenyan government determined 1961 birth records in Kenya were criminally altered so as to erase Barack Obama's birth certificate record and to disguise the fact that they'd ever been there.
[01:57:31.923 --> 01:57:32.583]  Well, I'm just saying this.
[01:57:32.583 --> 01:57:33.664]  That's what they reported.
[01:57:33.664 --> 01:57:35.305]  You've got the second document.
[01:57:35.305 --> 01:57:40.807]  The Kenyan government even told that to Ranenberger, our ambassador in Kenya.
[01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:45.810]  Under George W. Bush was inquiring about Obama's birth certificate.
[01:57:45.810 --> 01:57:49.753]  George Bush administration had reason to think Obama was born in Kenya.
