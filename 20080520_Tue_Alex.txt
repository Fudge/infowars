[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:22.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:34.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It is already the 20th day of May 2008, and we are going straight into a big interview right here at the start of the show.
[00:34.000 --> 00:45.000]  He'll be with us for the next 40 minutes. He is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, also Hollywood movie star, Navy Seal, and so much more.
[00:45.000 --> 00:57.000]  He's also a best-selling author, former TV host on MSNBC, and he was on with us about a month ago, and it made headlines in hundreds of newspapers, the Associated Press, and National Television.
[00:57.000 --> 01:06.000]  When he came on the show and questioned the official 9-11 story, and I was just talking to him before we went live, and he said, he's got something he wants to complain about.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  So you'll find out what that is with me right now.
[01:09.000 --> 01:25.000]  Governor Ventura, thank you for coming on with us. Hi, Alex. Great to be here again. I hope I could say that. No, I'm laughing because I guess when you do your show, you automatically make it on Billy Riley's idiot list.
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  I think that's what happens, yes. Now, I'm confused over that, Alex. How come we're not allowed to ask any questions today?
[01:34.000 --> 01:49.000]  Well, this broadcast has about 2 million listeners per show, and then it's all magnified on the web, and they don't like the fact that there is a large alternative radio show with more than 60 affiliates, and that's number one internet show.
[01:49.000 --> 02:07.000]  Maybe it's something like that because I can't believe how I simply asked some questions in the way you're attacked for simply asking questions. Is our country really become that, that you're not even allowed to publicly question the government?
[02:07.000 --> 02:25.000]  You know, I say this, Alex, because in looking back on my 56 years on the planet, the government's lied to me a great deal, and they don't have great credibility with me, so why wouldn't I question them when they tell me something?
[02:25.000 --> 02:38.000]  Oh, I totally agree with you. I mean, how many times have they been caught lying, and isn't it more suspicious, me thinks they protest too much, that they don't want us to ask about Building 7, the firefighters on tape saying the government blew it up?
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  I mean, why aren't we supposed to talk about that?
[02:40.000 --> 02:52.000]  I don't know. You know, one of the most interesting interviews that I've seen now has been William Rodriguez.
[02:52.000 --> 03:07.000]  Absolutely. When I watched the DVD of William Rodriguez, this guy is totally talking from what he remembers. You can clearly see it. He's not making anything up.
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  Well, he was there. The firefighters and police say that he stayed in to get a lot of them out on things that were starting to collapse.
[03:13.000 --> 03:25.000]  No, he's a hero's hero. There's no doubt about it, and when you hear him talk and he tells about what he knows there, how can you not question what went on that day?
[03:25.000 --> 03:35.000]  Well, that was my first question. What do you think of the massive media attack that you have gone through for simply asking a question?
[03:35.000 --> 03:44.000]  Well, I don't think you can address what you actually said on the show, and the majority of Americans and Poles have the same questions. It's all that you're bad to ask those questions.
[03:44.000 --> 04:00.000]  Well, yeah, it's been pretty eye-opening to say the least, but if you do ask a question out there, it's like you're not allowed to today, and that's what really troubles me the most is this attitude.
[04:00.000 --> 04:16.000]  And that reflects the fact that, and here's what I truly believe, I think people have this hidden, almost screen around them in many ways that because they don't want to believe that it could be true,
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  they just put that screen up and won't allow anything to penetrate it to the effect that it might be true.
[04:24.000 --> 04:33.000]  Right, it's a bubble of denial, their little imaginary world, and anything that conflicts with that they say isn't allowed.
[04:33.000 --> 04:50.000]  Yeah, it really is that way, and that to me is what has to come down, is the fact that, you know, and I like to refer a great deal to the movie that was just out with, I'm John Adams, because it was very profound.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  Governor, stay there, tell us about that after this quick break.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[05:09.000 --> 05:22.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  They have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need, they're after power.

[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:00.000 --> 08:09.000]  Well, he needs no introduction. He's Jesse Ventura. He's going to be with us for most of this hour. Very thankful for that.
[08:09.000 --> 08:18.000]  And I was going to get into his book being on the New York Times bestselling list. And I was going to get into his run for the Senate.
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  Is he really going to do it? We know he's looking at that when we get a final answer. And we will cover that in the second half of the interview after the bottom of the hour.
[08:25.000 --> 08:33.000]  But out of the gates, he brought up 9-11. Now, I have to say, Governor Ventura, I have never seen anyone. And I said this on air.
[08:33.000 --> 08:43.000]  My whole staff said this. All the emails we got said it. I've never seen anyone trounce Sean Hannity like that just from a position of strength, a position of knowledge.
[08:43.000 --> 08:50.000]  When he says, hey, we don't stage the news. We're not told what to say. And you said, oh, you really want to cover Ann and Nicole Smith for six months.
[08:50.000 --> 08:58.000]  And he just looked like a cat that had been caught eating the canary. He looked totally guilty and turned red faced and smiled like a Cheshire cat.
[08:58.000 --> 09:07.000]  I mean, it's asinine. It's come out of the Pentagon's planning propaganda. They have hundreds of people in the payroll claiming they're not putting out this info about the war.
[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  We know there's propaganda in media. We know they have talking points. They have talking points to attack 9-11 truthers.
[09:14.000 --> 09:23.000]  But I have to tell you, you absolutely kicked Hannity's butt. I've never seen anything like it. He was speechless.
[09:23.000 --> 09:33.000]  Well, you know, I'm going to give him his due. I actually found him on and off camera the day that I was there. Kind of enjoyable.
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.000]  And I know that seems weird to say. It's because I think that with me, he took a slightly different posture than he did with most people.
[09:41.000 --> 09:53.000]  Well, he knows. The thing is, they want me on later this month, but it won't be in the studio. I fully expect them to be far more aggressive with me when I'm not there in person.
[09:53.000 --> 10:03.000]  But it's not just that they weren't being aggressive. Everything he threw at you, you totally turned around on him. And I've told my listeners that is now the textbook example of how to deal with these people.
[10:03.000 --> 10:11.000]  Well, I deal with it the only way I know how, and that's kind of pulled the strap the years back and pulled the door ahead.
[10:11.000 --> 10:22.000]  I'm that way about things. And the truth of the matter was I worked in that business. I know what goes on because I thought it myself when I worked at MSNBC.
[10:22.000 --> 10:30.000]  Every day they would send me down the topics they wanted on the show after telling me that my show I could have complete control of.
[10:30.000 --> 10:40.000]  Well, there were topics that, yes, I remember distinctly the one was the murder in California of the pregnant girl.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  Yes.
[10:41.000 --> 10:53.000]  And I mean, that's important to California, but there's 10,000, 12,000 murders a year that take place. How is one more important than another in this country?
[10:53.000 --> 11:02.000]  And those are local stories that should be dealt with with local media. They are not national stories, nor should they be made national stories.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  They're national inquirer stories.
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  Well, we know what they do.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  They do those strictly to get ratings.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  I was about to say, and it fills up the news time with these issues that don't affect the power brokers.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  Meanwhile, there's no time to talk about how three more US troops died today.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  Yeah, exactly. They fill it up with this God, God, Bologna. And the bad part is we as a culture are accepting it.
[11:26.000 --> 11:36.000]  But hopefully the listeners that listen to you and the internet are very dangerous to that because it's becoming more and more powerful all the time, as we know it.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  Rest assured, the internet will be the next thing the government will try to control.
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  By the way, Joe Lieberman has called for federal control over the internet.
[11:47.000 --> 11:56.000]  He wrote a letter to Google's head and said that they need a self-censor and that the government would give them a list of things that weren't allowed to be covered.
[11:56.000 --> 12:05.000]  Thank God Google said no, but they're talking about taxing the web, regulating it, making you have a IP address that certified, making you thumb scan to get online.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  What's your view on that, Governor?
[12:07.000 --> 12:16.000]  I think that's horrible. You know, to me, we better wake up. You know, oh, guess what? I got a great story for you that'll tie right in.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  I just came across the Mexican border from Mexico to the US, right?
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.000]  Yes, sir.
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.000]  And this will tie into what you just talked about. All through Mexico, I was waved through every military stop.
[12:29.000 --> 12:39.000]  They have now down there what are called hassle-free zones, where US citizens can drive and you won't be hassled by the federalies or any of that stuff.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  Who want their little bite? They're Morditas.
[12:43.000 --> 12:53.000]  Well, but the point of the matter was I wasn't stopped until the US border, and they stopped me. I crossed at Megalus by below Tucson.
[12:53.000 --> 13:02.000]  And when they stopped me, they recognized who I was. I drive an RV. They sent me over to the inspection area.
[13:02.000 --> 13:13.000]  And I was inspected and he knew who I was. Guess what they confiscated from me?
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  What?
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  This is Homeland Security for you. My dog's dog food.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  Keeping it safe from al-Qaeda. Gotta stop that dog food.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  Now, here's the thing that troubled me. This was dog food. I have a very special dog.
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  And I carry the dog food from Minnesota to Mexico and back and I bring enough.
[13:33.000 --> 13:41.000]  And so the dog food was purchased in the United States. It just was taken out of its original wrapper.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  Well, they had to have authority over it.
[13:44.000 --> 13:53.000]  If I word, Alex, when I said that to them and said, but this is United States dog food, it didn't matter that I vouched for it.
[13:53.000 --> 14:03.000]  And the fact that only my dog would be eating it. It wasn't like I was bringing in, you know, 30 cartons worth of Mexican dog food.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  I'm a private vehicle carrying dog food and they confiscated it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:15.000]  Well, the point is that criminals are running wild, murder and crime is way up and meanwhile Homeland Security is taking over almost every federal agency.
[14:15.000 --> 14:24.000]  And you have a former governor, you know, an individual who is well known to everybody and they had to have that little enforcement.
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  That little, we're the boss. You did something wrong. They're training Americans how to be slaves.
[14:29.000 --> 14:39.000]  I don't know about that, but I thought it was utterly ridiculous that they confiscate dog food from you when you when you state that it originated here.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  What about your word? Doesn't that mean anything anymore today?
[14:42.000 --> 14:52.000]  No, it means nothing to them. Let's go back, Governor, to when out of the gates you talked about the media attacking you, but the media saying how dare you question the official 9-11 story.
[14:52.000 --> 15:02.000]  Never addressing any of the specific facts you listed. So we were talking during the break and you said you'd like to go through the scientific evidence from another perspective.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  Let's talk about 9-11.
[15:03.000 --> 15:11.000]  Well, OK, I'll come at it a little more from a professional standpoint and maybe I'll make it on a Riley again.
[15:11.000 --> 15:22.000]  I served three years with the Navy underwater demolition team 12 West Coast and our specialty and what I was trained in was blowing things up.
[15:22.000 --> 15:34.000]  And from a professional standpoint and watching how these three buildings fell, it sure looks like demolition to me and I believe I have an eye for it.
[15:34.000 --> 15:45.000]  Having been trained in it and trained by the best that our military has and especially building number seven, no doubt on that one.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  When you look at it from my viewpoint, that looks like demolition explosions bringing it down.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  And I view that as a member of the underwater demolition team.
[15:55.000 --> 16:05.000]  But then we have them staging the Gulf of Tonkin. We have our own government staging the attack on Iran.
[16:05.000 --> 16:15.000]  And now the White House admits they funded real Wahhabist al-Qaeda, number three in al-Qaeda, has been going on for four years to attack Iran and stage terror attacks there.
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.000]  A former general came out on Fox earlier this week and said that we need to, quote, have terror attacks inside Iran.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  But then the media turns around and says Iran is al-Qaeda when Iran is Shi'ite.
[16:26.000 --> 16:34.000]  I mean, that's incredible when our government's funding real al-Qaeda to attack Iran, but then saying Iran is also al-Qaeda.
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  Well, I can't answer to that because I'm not as privy as you on that information.
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.000]  Remember, I just returned from Mexico and I don't get all the news that you get on that.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  So I can't really respond to that at all.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  I can only listen to what you have to say and be appalled over it if it's indeed true.
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  Let's go back and look at 9-11 from this angle.
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.000]  Why did you decide? I mean, I interviewed you in June of 2006, almost two years ago.
[17:01.000 --> 17:09.000]  You said, I have questions, Operation Northwoods, I have questions, Gulf of Tonkin, other staged events, but you went that far.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  And then last time I didn't press you on 9-11, you brought it up during a break and said, I'd like to talk about it.
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.000]  Why did you decide to take that plunge and go ahead and write about it and question in your book and then go even further on my show?
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.000]  I mean, what spurred me to do it?
[17:25.000 --> 17:30.000]  First of all, I was like everyone. I couldn't comprehend or did I want to believe the worst.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  And we all know what the worst is.
[17:33.000 --> 17:40.000]  And when it happened, I also was embarrassed a little bit that when it happened, I went on full military mode.
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  I didn't question anything because I was the governor at the time.
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.000]  And I feel bad about that now because I could have been even more powerful then in questioning it.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  But I didn't because, again, I kind of went on military mode. Our country's been attacked.
[17:55.000 --> 18:01.000]  I believed what I was told, believed it, and went accordingly.
[18:01.000 --> 18:13.000]  Well, then after I got out of office shortly thereafter, and of course the invasion of Iraq happened, which I opposed, I couldn't understand why if Al Qaeda, indeed, truly attacked us.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  Why would we not be fighting them in Afghanistan?
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.000]  Instead, we're focusing and going in this other direction to Iraq who had nothing to do with any of it.
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  In fact, Saddam Hussein feared Al Qaeda as a problem for him.
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  So it didn't make sense to me on that aspect.
[18:32.000 --> 18:39.000]  And so when we invaded Iraq was when I truly, truly started to question President Bush and his policies.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  Because I opposed that war before it even happened.
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.000]  And that's when I thought that my son kept on me.
[18:47.000 --> 18:54.000]  He kept telling me about this loose change that was on the internet, and I'm not very savvy to the internet, generally.
[18:54.000 --> 19:03.000]  And finally, he kept on me saying, you got to watch this, and I kept even fighting with him, saying, come on, Ty, you can't believe everything on the internet.
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.000]  You know, there's no way these guys had to have attacked us, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[19:08.000 --> 19:20.000]  Well, then we got home from Mexico a couple years ago, and one Sunday afternoon my wife and I both said, you know, let's watch that loose change thing that my son keeps telling you about.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  And so we had an hour or whatever it was, we went up to the computer room and we watched it.
[19:25.000 --> 19:32.000]  And when I watched it, it hit me like this punch in the stomach, the things that are brought up in it.
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  So your instincts, your instincts then picked up the truth of it?
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  Yeah. Well, I guess you'd call it my instincts.
[19:40.000 --> 19:49.000]  I just, as I watched it and started putting things together and the fact that why would George Bush drag his feet on any investigation?
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.000]  I put myself in that position as a governor or as a president.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[19:57.000 --> 20:07.000]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[20:07.000 --> 20:14.000]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[20:56.000 --> 21:02.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[21:54.000 --> 22:03.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt, but the truth be told public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[22:03.000 --> 22:11.000]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[22:11.000 --> 22:17.000]  The US economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  It's bad enough that the US citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[22:25.000 --> 22:32.000]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[23:53.000 --> 24:13.000]  Governor Jesse Ventura, author of the new book that's on the best seller list.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  A bunch of the different best seller lists. Don't start the revolution without me.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  We have links where you can get it at infowars.com, but it's in stores everywhere.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  I'm going to talk more about that before he leaves us.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  Governor Ventura, you were going over during that last segment that some stations didn't get.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  Why hasn't there been an investigation when there's an investigation of a cop having an auto accident and getting hurt?
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  Or there's an investigation of a jumbo jet blowing up or an investigation of the bridge collapse.
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  I mean, it's not just that. Then we have how they've used 9-11 to take our liberties and freedoms and how they directed us at the wrong country.
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  You mentioned Iraq and Afghanistan and how Bush then said, I'm not looking for bin Laden. I don't care where he is.
[24:57.000 --> 25:03.000]  And now how they're using anti-terror laws against the American people and federalizing everything.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  Can you give me your take on that, Governor?
[25:05.000 --> 25:13.000]  Well, I certainly don't like it. We're called the United States of America, and that means states' rights.
[25:13.000 --> 25:22.000]  And for many things, I think states' rights should prevail. We always have a constant takeover by the federal government going on.
[25:22.000 --> 25:34.000]  And we have to stand up to it, and you have to find a way to do it, because we don't want to be the United States with no states.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  And that's the direction we seem to be going at.
[25:37.000 --> 25:47.000]  And that was one of my big disappointments in George Bush when he first took office. He said that he was going to be an old federal-style president powered by the states, which I agreed with.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  And every decision he's made has been just the opposite.
[25:51.000 --> 26:01.000]  And case in point, like, what is it now? 11 or 12 states have voted for medicinal use of marijuana, and yet the federal government won't allow it.
[26:01.000 --> 26:14.000]  Or again, I know twice as voted for dignity and death, that if you're not going to live and you're dying, you have the right to be in control of your life, and the federal government says no.
[26:14.000 --> 26:27.000]  And so things like that are very disturbing to me, because I like to have an option in this country that the state that I live in thinks a lot like me, and I have the option in which to live there.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  But more and more, I'm seeing that leave, so I tend to live in Mexico more today.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  Would you say that in any respects, a third-world country like Mexico has more freedoms than we have here?
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  Well, I'll put it to you this way. I could still go in the bar and have a cigar at a sports event.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  Smoke a cigar in the bar, you can't hear.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  Well, that's the control freak nanny state, which is just...
[26:53.000 --> 27:00.000]  I mean, I say that laughingly. The other thing is too, I'm not saying Mexico has a great government, but at least you know they're corrupt.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  I agree.
[27:01.000 --> 27:13.000]  So you know that going in. But the thing that I find where I live, there's nobody of government anywhere around, so you just govern yourselves and we all get along great.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  It's like a libertarian paradise where I'm at.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  Well, I take care of myself, Alex, and my family, and we help each other.
[27:24.000 --> 27:34.000]  My neighbors help if they need help. You pull each other out of the ditch because I live in a pretty rugged area, and everyone pitches in, and it doesn't require government at all,
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  even though there's all these laws and everything. Hey, if they're not around, they don't apply to anybody. Just take care of each other.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  What kind of dog you got, Governor?
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  I have a Belgian Malinois.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  Oh, those are neat dogs.
[27:47.000 --> 27:54.000]  He's so smart when he arrived here. He was literate in three languages, which made him the smartest in the house.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  We're going to break him.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  He's soon learning Spanish, number four.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  Amazing. We're going to break and come back with our final segment with the governor.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  Unless I can twist his arm to stay even longer, maybe to the end of the hour.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  But I want to come back and talk some about the book. I want to talk about a Senate run.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  Let's go ahead and get into that now. I mean, are you going to run for the senator? How long until we know?
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  Here's how I feel right now. I don't know yet, and I have till July to decide.
[28:19.000 --> 28:28.000]  I feel like this. I believe strongly that on every ballot, federal, local, or whatever, there should be none of the above.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  So you can vote a vote of no confidence in your government. With this deficit, we should have no confidence in them.
[28:34.000 --> 28:42.000]  And I may offer myself up as that because it doesn't officially, it isn't officially on the ballot, none of the above.
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  But if I go file and put Jesse Ventura down, I then become none of the above.
[28:48.000 --> 28:55.000]  And so any disgruntled voter, and all I'll try to do at that point is run a very minimal campaign,
[28:55.000 --> 29:01.000]  and all I ask is to be allowed in the debates. Because if I can debate him, I can beat him.
[29:01.000 --> 29:06.000]  Well, no doubt we need your voice in the U.S. Senate because you are a maverick.
[29:06.000 --> 29:15.000]  You are a somewhat of a renegade. And you're only a renegade because you're what we'd call an old-fashioned American independence, liberty, freedom.
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  And we need you. So I would certainly support you from Texas for a run for the Minnesota Senate,
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  because you could certainly wreak havoc on their plans and use a bully pulpit up there to expose what they're doing.
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  So Governor, we totally support you. We're going to be back in three minutes with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  And we'll also talk about his new book, Don't Start Revolution, without me.
[29:37.000 --> 30:03.000]  I'm drafting you, Governor. I think you need to go ahead and run for the Senate. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[30:03.000 --> 30:09.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Is that their objective, the world domination?
[30:09.000 --> 30:15.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[30:15.000 --> 30:22.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[30:22.000 --> 30:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  Yes, they're after music.

[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[30:53.000 --> 31:02.000]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[31:02.000 --> 31:05.000]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[31:05.000 --> 31:12.000]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[31:12.000 --> 31:21.000]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[31:53.000 --> 31:59.000]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American Empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[32:04.000 --> 32:10.000]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.

[33:24.000 --> 33:28.000]  And we have a short time left with Governor Minteros. I'm going to try to move quickly.
[33:28.000 --> 33:36.000]  Governor, final comment on 9-11. I want to play you a clip that came out and was in major newspapers last week.
[33:36.000 --> 33:46.000]  You may have missed it, where I'm sure you've heard about how they, all these major quote, wartime correspondence or experts they have on Fox, CNN, MSNBC,
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  are really on the Pentagon payroll. They're all former generals, of course, and colonels.
[33:50.000 --> 33:56.000]  And that they're putting out unified propaganda. They've now released hundreds of hours of these tapes and on the tape,
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  they say, wouldn't another terror attack get the people behind the war?
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  We have Republican memos saying the same thing.
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  And Rumsfeld says, yeah, the cure for the people not wanting to go into Iran or other places is another attack.
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  Here's that one minute clip. I want to get your take on this.
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.000]  I mean, this president is pretty much a victim of success. We haven't had an attack here in five years.
[34:17.000 --> 34:32.000]  Help. The perception of the threat is so low in the society that it's not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment.
[34:32.000 --> 34:43.000]  And the same thing is in Europe with a low threat perception. The correction for that, I suppose, is an attack.
[34:43.000 --> 34:54.000]  And when that happens, then everyone gets energized for another person. And it's a shame. We don't have the maturity to recognize.
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  So the American people don't have the maturity to give up their liberty, so there's got to be another attack.
[34:58.000 --> 35:06.000]  The PNAC documents written by Dick Cheney in September of 2000 called for massive Pearl Harbor events to mobilize the empire.
[35:06.000 --> 35:13.000]  The Brazilian Brzezinski's book, Grand Chess Board, calls for giant terror attacks. Your take on that, sir?
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  Well, first of all, I got to apologize. There was a lot of static out there.
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.000]  And my years are not any better than they used to be before I had a hard time hearing it clearly.
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.000]  Kevin, let me just tell you what he says. He says, quote, the correction for the people not wanting military action is another attack.
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.000]  And he said that's the cure for it. But barring having another one of those, the people don't support the war.
[35:38.000 --> 35:39.000]  And who said this?
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[35:40.000 --> 35:51.000]  Wow. Well, if this stuff's true, then my book is right on. We've got to have a revolution and take our country back.
[35:51.000 --> 35:59.000]  Well, I agree. The book is on a bunch of the bestseller list. I mean, why did you decide to write the book? Don't start a revolution without me.
[35:59.000 --> 36:08.000]  Well, as a wake-up call, I actually, with two New York Times bestsellers, I, you know, I got paid great front money and all that to do those books.
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  This book I did with none. I wanted to do it down in Mexico with Dick Russell.
[36:13.000 --> 36:22.000]  And we got together every week, and we'd work on it. And I wanted it to be more of a message and a wake-up call to try to wake up the United States of America,
[36:22.000 --> 36:30.000]  that the two-party system is corrupt, and that the two-party system, that you have to change the system in which to change the government.
[36:30.000 --> 36:40.000]  And we've got to wake up to that fact, because if we don't, we could very much lose the Republic, because that's what Thomas Jefferson warned about.
[36:40.000 --> 36:51.000]  That's what John Adams warned about, that political parties would eventually strangle the Republic, because decisions would be made on behalf of the political party,
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  not on behalf of the Republic. And that's what we're getting today.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  An interesting case in point, you know, and we'll tie it back to 9-11 a little.
[37:00.000 --> 37:10.000]  I find it very interesting that the Whitewater investigation, which, you know, in the end, that it was turned up that the president cheated on his wife with an intern,
[37:10.000 --> 37:17.000]  they spent $100 million on that. For 9-11, they only spent $9 million.
[37:17.000 --> 37:25.000]  And I find that peculiar that, you know, thousands of people were killed in one, and nobody died.
[37:25.000 --> 37:33.000]  And I know of where they couldn't prove maybe one person did. I guess they talk about it, but they spent $100 million to investigate that.
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  What do you think of Barack Obama and Hillary wanting socialized health care?
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  And Barack Obama is saying, we need to have the government control how many calories we eat.
[37:42.000 --> 37:50.000]  I mean, if you think the Nanny State's bad with San Francisco saying you can't drink bottled water, and most cities banning smoking cigarettes even outside,
[37:50.000 --> 37:58.000]  and not letting people smoke in their own houses in some cities, cops are getting fired who get caught and reported by other officers for smoking cigars on their bass boat.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  I'm sure you've heard about those cases. What do you think of the Nanny State that's being pushed by the Democrats?
[38:03.000 --> 38:12.000]  Well, and that's just as bad. You know, I know that I come down hard on the Republicans probably a great deal more because they're in power right now.
[38:12.000 --> 38:22.000]  But the Democrats will be no better. In fact, they will be even worse because Democrats, they want no liberties for you at all, hardly.
[38:22.000 --> 38:31.000]  They want everything government controlled. I remember when I ran for governor, Hubert Skip Humphrey, no matter what subject came up during the race,
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  he had a government program waiting to take care of it.
[38:35.000 --> 38:42.000]  And it was like I looked at him at one point and said, Skip, who pays for all this, you know? Government laws and moral laws.
[38:42.000 --> 38:50.000]  What people need to understand, Alex, is that every time a legislature passes a law, there's a money tag with that.
[38:50.000 --> 38:59.000]  It costs money to implement that law. As a chief executive of a state or country or whatever, you have to do it.
[38:59.000 --> 39:07.000]  You can't arbitrarily, to yourself, go, well, this is a stupid damn law. I won't implement it. You're not given that ability.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  Absolutely. Folks, find out more about his new bestselling book.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  We're out for about a month. He's already a bestseller up on infowars.com. We have links through to where you can get.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  Jesse Ventura, don't start the revolution without me.
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.000]  Governor, I'm not trying to press you because I know you haven't made the decision yet, but what are you leaning towards?
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  I guess you're saying we're going to find out if you're going to run for the Minnesota seat for the U.S. Senate.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  We're going to find out if you're going to...
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  July.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  We're going to find out in July and right now...
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  July is when filing takes place. And see, I won't just run to win.
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  I'll run to set an example to turn around America, and that will be this.
[39:45.000 --> 39:53.000]  Whenever I run for office, I do not spend more money than what the office will pay me.
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  I did it as governor. I only raised $300,000. I was paid $480,000.
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  You know why I do that? Because of what my dad said to me when I was a kid.
[40:03.000 --> 40:11.000]  When I was a little kid growing up, my dad was a World War II vet, eighth grade education, but he gets smarter every day.
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  And he said to me one day, he said, you know, our politicians are crooks.
[40:16.000 --> 40:21.000]  And I said, Dad, come on, how can you say that? That's a blanket statement like that.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  And he said easy. He said because they spend a million dollars for a job that pays a hundred grand a year.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  Absolutely. The evidence is right there. That's what one of my grandpas would always say.
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  And so I make it a point that when I run for office, I do not spend more money than what I will make.
[40:38.000 --> 40:46.000]  Now, as a U.S. senator, I will make close to $950,000 through the course of that six-year thing.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  So that means I could probably spend about three-quarters of a million to get the job.
[40:51.000 --> 41:00.000]  But I will not spend over that. And, you know, if I do it, I'll decide in July because I believe these campaigns are far too long and far too expensive.
[41:00.000 --> 41:08.000]  Well, we need you also during this national election cycle to be injecting sanity, and that will up your profile if you run for Senate.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  I think it's a no-brainer. I'm begging you to do it. We need you to do this, Governor.
[41:12.000 --> 41:17.000]  The problem is that, Alex, is then I have to do it. Then you can't go surfing.
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.000]  That's right. Then I can't go down the Baha and watch sunsets down there and take my surfboard out and fall down as I try to learn how to do it.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  Absolute heaven down there. I certainly envy you down there.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  There's no one watching over me.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  No big brother telling you.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  No big brother is down there. Do you know what I also do with all my new vehicles? I disconnect that on-star.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  What's traction? Yes, sir.
[41:39.000 --> 41:46.000]  Absolutely. People think that they can track you anywhere you go if you got that hooked up on your vehicle.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  Governor, I want to run through a bunch of questions quickly because we're almost out of time.
[41:49.000 --> 41:56.000]  A government drug dealing. They had a CIA aircraft right at four tons of pure cocaine, showing it came from the source.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  One of the CIA rendition flights, same plane, CIA-owned, crashed in Yucatan Peninsula.
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.000]  Nothing on our press all over the foreign press with the CIA pilot, killed the people on board, filled with pure cocaine.
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  Now, should we decriminalize drugs A and B?
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.000]  The experts I've had on here believe that over 85% of all narcotics is brought in and licensed by the government.
[42:18.000 --> 42:26.000]  Well, I think absolutely we should decriminalize it because of the fact that when I was in Mexico, the Virginia Tech thing happened.
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  And the headlines in Mexico said USA 33, Mexico 20.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  Because that day there were 20 people killed and the war on drugs on the border, only differences, theirs happens every day.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  And now it's spread all the way up into Indiana, up into Dallas.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.000]  Quote, military, our government trained or now, quote, helping the Mexican drug cartels?
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  I don't know anything about that.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  Oh, yeah, that was finally in the Houston Chronicle.
[42:53.000 --> 43:00.000]  Just a side issue, what do you, I know he's your buddy, and I know you've been in some films with him, like Running Man and Predator.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  And I know you're a loyal person, but Schwarzenegger, you talk about big government, gun control on a lot of these issues.
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  What do you think of the job Schwarzenegger's done as governor?
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  Well, remember this, Arnold is not a true Republican.
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  Arnold is very liberal on the social issues, much like I am.
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.000]  I don't care about gay marriage, it's none of my business, things of that nature.
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  And remember, Arnold's also a populist.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  He tried the hard-line Republican position in California and he got hammered.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  His popularity went down the toilet, so he made a turn.
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.000]  And now he's doing things that apparently the Californians are more popular with.
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  But what about gun control?
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  Arnold is not a dummy.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  You know, Arnold knows where his bread gets buttered, depending on what he's doing.
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  Yeah, but you could do that too. You could go with how the bread's buttered and probably be president.
[43:52.000 --> 43:59.000]  I mean, there is a difference here. You're not for gun control. You're not for drug criminalization. Arnold is.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  Well, I don't think Arnold's for drug criminalization.
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  Is he? Because he's not bothering the pot shops out there for the medical stuff.
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  He lets the feds come in and go after him. He hasn't been trying to repeal these drug laws.
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  But the point is he can't stop the feds anyway.
[44:14.000 --> 44:23.000]  Federal jurisdiction takes priority over state. Otherwise, if I was governor, I could stop our National Guard people from going to Iraq.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  You don't have the power.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  When's the last time you talked to Arnold? Has he read your book?
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  I have never talked to him since he took office.
[44:31.000 --> 44:36.000]  Well, I know that he said that he modeled a lot of his campaign off the fact that he saw that you could win.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  That may be true, but I haven't spoken to him at all.
[44:39.000 --> 44:46.000]  I stopped by one time when I was giving a speech in Sacramento, and he had already gone home, you know, back to LA.
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  And so he wasn't in that day. I just left a note for him and gave him my best regards.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  And I haven't talked or heard from him since.
[44:54.000 --> 45:01.000]  Jesse, talking about the police state all over the country now, they don't just do breathalyzers.
[45:01.000 --> 45:07.000]  They're taking blood at checkpoints from Illinois to Texas, from Arizona to New York State.
[45:07.000 --> 45:13.000]  They're now having, quote, federalization drills where they get tens of thousands of police in three, four state areas
[45:13.000 --> 45:18.000]  to randomly search pedestrians now, not just cars set up checkpoints.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  What's your take on that?
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  Well, if it's true, we're in tough shape.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  The only thing I can comment on is what goes on in my life.
[45:27.000 --> 45:34.000]  And I am concerned because when I crossed the bloater this year, inside the bloater was a second immigration checkpoint.
[45:34.000 --> 45:41.000]  Well, according to the Constitution of the United States, once I show at the border that I'm a U.S. citizen,
[45:41.000 --> 45:48.000]  I should not be required to be asked any type of identification as I travel throughout the continental United States.
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  And now they're building those deeper and deeper over a hundred miles in, and they're going after citizens.
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.000]  Oh, yeah. Everybody, like the car in front of me, I saw the people showing passports, and they were from California.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  Well, for some reason, they waived me through because I turned to my wife and I go,
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  I am not, I'm going to see if the Constitution protects me.
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  I will not show these people anything, even though they're immigration.
[46:11.000 --> 46:12.000]  What happened?
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  I'm a U.S. citizen. If it's a state trooper, that's different.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  You're on a highway that you show your driver's license.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  But as a U.S. citizen, I am not required to show anything.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  What happened?
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  What happened?
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  As I travel throughout the country, the Constitution guarantees me that.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  Governor, what happened when you did that?
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  For some reason, they always waived me through.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  Every time they don't question or do anything, I get waived through.
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  So I don't get a chance to really turn them down because they never asked me for anything.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  But it is racial profiling because I happen to have blue eyes.
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  That might be part of the reason I'm waived through.
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  Unbelievable.
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  Governor, we have a little bit of issue with the line. Can you hear me?
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  Sure.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  Okay, good. We went to back up there. I'm in Texas there in Minnesota.
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  This only happens. We got a huge guest on with us.
[47:04.000 --> 47:11.000]  Governor, in closing with three or four minutes, we've got left other points, other key issues that you want to impart.
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  Anything else on 9-11? Anything else you want to talk about with the future of this republic?
[47:15.000 --> 47:21.000]  Well, you know, the main thing I want to talk about is the fact that we better wake up and we better pay attention
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  and not to believe everything that the status quo tells you
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.000]  because they're not necessarily talking the truth and I'm finding that out more and more and more.
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.000]  And I personally have no trust in the government anymore
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  because they've been so deceitful to me on everything, it seems.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  And that we've got to change.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  And I think the other thing I'd like to bring out is this.
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.000]  Having lived outside of the United States now for three years in a row for half a year,
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  my belief is that you're not a world power by carrying a crub and beating everyone up.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  And our status throughout the world has dropped dramatically now.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  The most popular t-shirt you see in Mexico amongst young people now is a photo of George Bush
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  and it says, Weapon of Mass Destruction.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.000]  And I really don't think it should be part of as the United States
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  and it's time for us to change direction.
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  So when Obama says about talking to our enemies, I see nothing wrong with that
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  because it should be the last option.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  Where should never be the first option is what we've made it today.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  Well, you're right, Governor. Our name has been destroyed
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  and the so-called conservatives that still support the war,
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  against the will of the people, only 30% support the war still,
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  and B, they have bankrupted us.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  The dollars being devalued, inflation is in double digits.
[48:48.000 --> 48:54.000]  The fellow reserves denying it, but oil just went to 130 a barrel today.
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  130 a barrel.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  Did I tell you my take on oil?
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  No, sir.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  I think this is what's happening on oil.
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  I think they're driving the price up to battle the environmentalists.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  I think they want to get drilling in Alaska.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  They want to get offshore drilling.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  This is a ploy by the oil companies, in my opinion,
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  to drive the price up to where the American people say it's $5 a gallon.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  I don't care about the environment drill.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  I've got to have my gas.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  Well, that's a part of it, I think, but largely the dollar has been devalued.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  Oil is dollar denominated.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  And so if the dollar's been devalued by more than half, oil's going to double.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  Yeah, down that end too, very good point.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  Very good point.
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  I noticed that in Minnesota, because we had some of our local guys at work,
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  the network came out and shot some video of you talking,
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  and you wouldn't address the press, but you would address them.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Why were you not talking to the mainstream press?
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  Well, I talked to the mainstream press, except not the Minnesota mainstream press.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  I've made it my personal vendetta that I never speak to them again,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  because when I was in office, they attacked my children.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  And so the only way I can fight back is to not talk to them, not make them money.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  And so I speak to the open press in Boston, I speak to them in LA,
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  anywhere else, but I will not speak to the Minnesota media,
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  because it's my personal vendetta against them.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  And, you know, us Navy SEALs, we don't get mad, we get even.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  That's our thing.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  And so my only way of getting even with them is to not speak to them.
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.000]  That's why I did speak to your people, but on purpose, I do not speak to them.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  And it is because they attack my kids, my son refuses to live in Minnesota now.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  Governor Ventura, I want to say one more word to you during the break and then let you go.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  The book is on the best seller list, we need to make it even bigger.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  It is Don't Stop the Revolution Without Me, Governor Jesse Ventura.

[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  Another untoldstory.com.
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  This story comes from some of the darkest, earliest hours of America's forgotten history
[52:20.000 --> 52:26.000]  at a place called Valley Forge where General George Washington and his army barely hung on.
[52:26.000 --> 52:32.000]  There were enemies without and enemies within and Michael Whitman was an enemy within.
[52:32.000 --> 52:38.000]  He was, as one history book tells, caught and tried as a turncoat collaborator
[52:38.000 --> 52:43.000]  giving invaluable assistance on numerous occasions to the British.
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  He was found guilty of spying and sentenced to hanging.
[52:47.000 --> 52:52.000]  But on the eve of his execution, an old white haired man named Peter Miller
[52:52.000 --> 52:57.000]  who had done many favors for Washington's army was allowed to see the general.
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.000]  And when he did he requested a favor of the general.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  Pardon the treacherous spy, Michael Whitman.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  The untold story in all of this is why.
[53:08.000 --> 53:16.000]  Why was the pardon requested and why did General Washington do what he did that night?
[53:16.000 --> 53:22.000]  That's the untold story and to learn of it go to anotheruntoldstory.com.

[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  And coming up, the unmasking of bottled waters.
[53:57.000 --> 54:03.000]  Consumers react to word that many of their pricey favorites come straight from the tap.
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.000]  Do us have access to some of the cleanest tap water in the world?
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  Nevertheless, many people have come to depend on bottled water.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  So much so, it's become a multi-billion dollar industry.
[54:13.000 --> 54:20.000]  Sure, it's convenient, but many also believe they're paying for water from naturally pure sources.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  As Rob Marciano reports, that's often not the case.
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.000]  Don't let that scenic logo fool you, this water is not bottled from a mountain stream.
[54:30.000 --> 54:38.000]  Now PepsiCo plans to spell it out for consumers, adding the words public water source to the label of its Aquafina brand.
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.000]  And in case you didn't know, Aquafina is actually just purified tap water.
[54:43.000 --> 54:49.000]  That would make me never want to buy Aquafina again knowing that it was bottled public water.
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.000]  Just tap water in a bottle, that's what am I paying for? Wow.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  How does that make you feel?
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  Like I've been bamboozled and poo-wing all this time.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  In a statement on Friday, PepsiCo said, quote,
[55:02.000 --> 55:08.000]  if this helps clarify the fact that water originates from public sources, then it's a reasonable thing to do.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  Coca-Cola's Dessani does the same thing, purifies and bottles public drinking water.
[55:14.000 --> 55:20.000]  An environmental group found at least 25% of bottled water is actually just tap water.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  Sometimes purified, sometimes not.
[55:23.000 --> 55:30.000]  We are now exposing an underbelly truth that is a big percentage of bottled water in this country is tap water.
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  San Francisco's mayor banned city workers from buying bottled water, citing environmental concerns,
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  and saving the city half a million dollars a year.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  And let's face it, it's expensive.
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  People like Fiji can cost 8 bucks a bottle or more at high-end hotels.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  Ironic that droughts have led to water shortages on the island that exports it.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  In total, Americans snapped up 11 billion dollars worth of bottled water last year.
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  All in a country that has some of the cleanest public water in the world.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  Spring water, artesian well water, purified tap water.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  Not too long ago, it would have seemed a little wacky to sell bottled water,
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  but now it's become part of our culture.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  And sales of these bottles rank second only to carbonated soft drinks.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  So in this saturated market, it's increasingly important for you to know exactly what you're paying for.
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  Rob Marciano, CNN, Douglasville, Georgia.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  That's the incredible propaganda they're putting out.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  Those tap waters are filtered in reverse osmosis.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  They are filtered several times.
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  Now it's filtered and they are much better than tap water.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  They've cut out the chlorine, they've cut out some of the fluoride.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  The best thing to do is get an expensive filtration system and filter your water.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  But if you've got a choice, well, everybody knows tap water tastes like crap.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  And so that's why people go out and get bottled water.
[56:52.000 --> 57:00.000]  Obviously an Evian or a Pellegrino had a famous, you know, multi-thousand-year-old springs in the case of Pellegrino.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  The Romans were getting it out of there.
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  It's really delicious artesian water that's got all these great minerals in it.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  Oh, you don't want that.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  You don't want Fiji volcanic water.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  No, you want tap water.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  The government loves you.
[57:17.000 --> 57:30.000]  Total lies about how clean it is and how great it is and how wonderful it is with hundreds of drugs and herbicides and pesticides and mercury and lead and arsenic and just absolutely hellish things in it.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  Let me give you a news tip.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  Fish and turtles, if you put them in tap water, will die.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  You put an aquatic turtle in tap water, it dies in a few days.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  You put a fish in it, they die.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  You put frogs in it, they die.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  You shouldn't be drinking it.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  Your skin, also the largest organ, absorbs it.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Hey, what an amazing Ventura interview.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  And of course, I've got to get rid of ISD in lines.
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.000]  Some idiot phone company guy happens about once a month, always wins.
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  Charlie Sheen's on.
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  It even happened right before I had Charlton Heston on.
[58:01.000 --> 58:08.000]  The phone company comes in and hooks into our lines and hello, hello, you couldn't hear it on the network.
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.000]  But on the internet and coding we've got for prismplanet.tv members, because that was live on the web.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  And what we had put on the web today, it's going to be on there.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  Hello, hello, hello.
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.000]  This is great technology to be, of course, we went to Skype after that happened.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  It's great technology to be here in Austin, there in Minnesota.
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  But man, I mean, the phone company, I've just had enough of these idiots.
[58:32.000 --> 58:38.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[58:43.000 --> 58:48.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:48.000 --> 58:53.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.000 --> 59:12.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.000 --> 59:18.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  They're after power, that's their affidavit.

[59:39.000 --> 59:53.000]  Blue Prep for Global Inslating. You have been warned.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  Well, we're on the heels of an amazing Jesse Ventura interview, 50 minutes long.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  We've got to get a transcript of that, we've got to get it out of the press to make sure they bite on it.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  More 9-11 truth, more people waking up.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  I meant to ask him about a challenge to the media, but that's basically what he was saying.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  He was challenging the media to cover him on the facts and to not just say,
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  I'm a First Amendment right to question the official story, I meant to have Jim Tucker on at 40 after,
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  but I, to get into the Builder Bird situation, but then I forgot about that because we had Ventura on
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  and we've got a bunch of other big guests today.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  Do we have Tucker or is he unable to do it now?
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Oh, we have Jim Tucker.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Jim, I apologize in between technical difficulties with the idiot phone company
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  and everything else, I got lost in the fog of war.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  I want to hold you for this three-minute segment, about five minutes on the other side,
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  and we're going to get to gun confiscation in Pennsylvania.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, you heard me right, with an eye witness to all this.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Jim Tucker, Jim Tucker, AmericanFreePress.net, formerly the spotlight.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  We heard that they were, that really a week and a half ago that Builder Bird met in Athens, outside Athens, Greece.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  You said you didn't believe that.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Greek paper reported it.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  BuilderBerg.org reported it.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Tony Gosling.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Then we had the major Dutch news report.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  They were going to be meeting the fifth through the eighth in Chantilly as they met a few years ago in Virginia.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Tell us what you think's really happening, Jim Tucker.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Well, this one is right.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  It's a Chantilly.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Yes, somebody gave us that Dutch email too, and I called the Dutch embassy.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Well, in fact, the number they provided called got me into the Netherlands, but they transferred me back still to a charge on the phone.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  That's it.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  I'm going to Virginia.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  The United States.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  And they confirmed yes.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  I asked the question twice to make sure I got it right.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Yes, they will be at Chantilly.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  And of course, it will be the Westfields Marriott.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  They didn't have the specific address in Chantilly.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  Because where they met before, the only place they can meet in Chantilly was where they met several years ago, Westfields.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  And Westfields is all booked up.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  And also, a man who for 20 years has helped inside Bilderberg, pinned them down,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  gave it further confirmation that we'll be at the Westfields Marriott Conference Center, 14750.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  We'll have this on our website, Conference Drive, Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, Virginia.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  They've got their telephone number.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  So this isn't even out yet. This is huge breaking news.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Hey, wait a minute. I thought probably everybody had internet this stuff by now.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Well, no, we knew that it might be, but now you're pinning it down.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  Well done, Jim Tucker.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Yeah, I'll be checking.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  I'll be out there on Wednesday, June the 4th, checking into the Hilton in Herman, Virginia.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  From experience, I know that's the closest motel nearby.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  And cheapest if you consider $270 a night for the cheapest room.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Oh man, this is going to be spook central. Jim, isn't it unusual that they would have it in Canada, in North America, then in Istanbul?
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Because usually they go, as you said, four years in Europe and then one year in the Americas.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Isn't this unusual?
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  It surprised me, really, because they're here two years ago and they're routine in some like three years in Europe and one year somewhere in North America.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  Canada are the United States and that had been their drill.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  And for a while we thought possibly Japan because for no other reason that the G8 is meeting in Japan for the first time ever,
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  which makes no sense because the G8 has a state or all from Europe and North America.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Canada, the United States and the European countries.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  But their meeting in, of course, that's public information was no effort at all to be told where the G8 is going to meet.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  It's going to be that island in Japan.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  But nevertheless, Bilderberg is that gently and we certainly hope a lot of readers will turn out because, well, in Europe, as you know from experience,
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  there's a lot of broadcasters and newspaper men.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Yeah, we have more of a news blackout here in Land of the Coward, Home of the Slaves. Stay there, Land of the Disinfo.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Stay there, Jim Tucker. Final segment with you after this quick three minute break.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Major breaking news. Jim Tucker confirms it's in Virginia.

[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, for those of you that just joined us, this is live breaking news.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  What appears to be this info was put out as they always do that they'd already met as they meet in May or early June in Greece.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  Jim Tucker had been covering for 35 years on the ground, the father of exposing the global elite and the secret shadowy cabal that runs our society.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  The media just 10 years ago did not even exist.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  He has confirmed that it is in Chantilly, Virginia, they met in Istanbul, Turkey last year, 125 of the world's movers and shakers.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  He believes they're meeting here in the United States where they don't normally meet because there's a better media blackout because our press is more controlled.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  So, Jim, just to recap, go over all the evidence, why you think this isn't another ruse.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  And again, he's got them for 35 years straight, never been defeated. Sometimes they find out the day of though that goes on for three days.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  You have a source inside Bilderberg who's involved that's confirmed it.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And so you're 100% on where it's being held.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  Go over your evidence, Jim Tucker.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Well, they didn't have me nervous and grabbed out of the pair of socks when they talked about the place they had met in Greece a few years ago, being all filled up and so forth.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  But they cannot tell me there are armed guards outside the gates, although I was ready to grab out of the pair of socks and run.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  But I had some doubts about it, and I called three people, these swell secretaries of three people to always attend Bilderberg meetings under a ruse and a social event.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  And they were all going to be in Washington that weekend, so I stayed here, becoming very doubtful.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  And then when we got this thing from a Japanese chap telling us that it came off of the Dutch website for domestic consumption or inside the house website saying it would be in Chantilly.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Then I called the Dutch embassy, and they bounced me back to the embassy in the United States, which specifically confirmed Chantilly.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  I asked the question twice to make sure there's no misunderstanding, routine of mind.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  They're definitely at the Westfields.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  Then a man who's an international financial consultant who knows a lot of Bilderberg people personally, he got interested about 20 years ago when I showed him a recent list 20 years ago of participants.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I know this guy, I got to do business with him, and he's always so much fun.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  He's helped us locate Bilderberg many times.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Obviously, I can't give his name, but there's one time when they were meeting in some European city.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  We knew the city for sure.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  We knew the dates for sure.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  This precise location we did not know.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  I met the press club with my other pair of socks back waiting to take a shuttle to Dulles Airport when he called and named the precise place, the precise location.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  I called the newspaper back and they were able to redo page one to put in the precise location.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  There's other times when he's been very helpful, he has also talked to his Bilderberg buddy who gave us additional confirmation just this morning that Chantilly is the scene of the crime.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  I'm hoping a lot of your listeners and our readers at American Free Press will show up to help make up for the lack of help we'll get from the...
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  Oh, I'm going to be there. You can absolutely be assured of that, Jim.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  You're sure you're going to be staying at the Hilton Hinden?
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Okay, let me... Jim, let me do this. When are you going to be at the officer home today?
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  I'll call and confer like we did last time when I went with you to Canada.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Okay, it's going to be on our website today, including my put-out check-in to whatever hotel it'll all be there.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  Yeah, I wonder if they're going to harass me and arrest me like they did when I went to Canada inside the U.S.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  This is going to be fine.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  I doubt if you don't say anything about Bilderberg on the flight, I doubt they would be.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Yeah.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  So many flights into Dallas. If they don't know why you're coming, if you don't...
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Well, they surveil everything we do, Jim.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  Yeah.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  Are you kidding? I mean, because we're here fighting them destroying the country and they can't stand it.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Well, any other key tidbits we need to know. So you're saying you're 100% this isn't a ruse, is that what you're saying?
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Yes.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  This is triple confirmed. Okay, I'm going to book passage by air right now and bring my crew.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  I'm going to get the telephoto lenses out.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Expanding on that, Jim Tucker, in closing, then do you believe this was a planted ruse with what we saw out of the Greek news?
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  It's possible that some Bilderberg kid put something on the Internet to believe people the wrong way.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  I don't know. It's possible because they do not like to be exposed. As usual, they'd prefer.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  By now, they're probably aware that there will be public knowledge the way they search Internet and so forth.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Well, this is convenient for you that you live in Virginia. You can just get in the car and drive over.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Well, my home is in a deep central Virginia. I stayed at a motel in Washington, but it is more convenient.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  I'll just have to, I'll be checking into the Hilton in Herdon, Virginia, which is where I stayed the last time they were here.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  It's the closest motel to the scene of crime, and it's also the cheapest. It's $270 plus tax every day.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  That's great. Jason Burmese is going to be sitting in for those days while I'm there. The excitement just continues as we cover the global crime syndicate.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Jim, so how are you going to be at the office today so I can call you?
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  I really don't know. It depends on how fast I can kick stuff out the door.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Okay, so when I call this home number, that's another part of Virginia.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  Yeah, and I won't be there until, let's see, Thursday afternoon.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  But if I miss you later after the show today, you're going to be at American Free Press. So I can just call the newspaper, or should I call you in the morning?
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Well, I'll be at American Free Press.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Okay, Jim, thank you for the update. Thank you for nailing that down. That's confirmed. Jim has never been wrong before.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Thirty-plus years, you've been able to find out where they are, and I've been able to cover it, Jim.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  It's been a lot of fun, and you can be sure the Washington Post and the Washington Times will be there, and you'll not read a word about it.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Well, we need to have protest while we're there in front of their papers. Then in the free country, the cops will no doubt come and say,
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  no demonstrations allowed without permits, and then taser us and land to the slaves, home of the cowards.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  I mean, I love this country, folks, and that's what we've turned into, but I don't care.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  I'm going to, you know what, they'll probably tell me I can't videotape without a permit in this God-forsaken country, because that's what they're having over here.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Well, the answer is, I'm on a public sidewalk, and I've told the cops that many times. This is a public sidewalk, a taxpayer sidewalk.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Not this country's gone. This country's in so much trouble. Folks, join us there. This is big news, and it's the fifth through the eighth, correct?
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  And tell folks the name of the hotel again.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Well, the billaberg will be at the Westfields Marriott, 1475, the conference center driving Chantilly. We will be at the Hilton Internet, which is right next door,
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  and that is 13869 Park Center Road, Herndon.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  And does that Hilton have any places for me with telephoto video lenses?
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  The hotel we'll be staying at.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Yeah. I mean, is that in view of the other facility?
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  No, you have to drive a few miles, but it's a closing spot.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  Yeah, I hear this one's hard to cover. Is that true?
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  Yeah, well, there's been a lot of billaberg bees where I had to get a cab, or sometimes readers would be there with cars and save the company a nickel by driving.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  Yeah, I'll drive you. Don't worry, Jim. We're going to be all over you, because you're the guy that knows how to track the enemy.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  All right, enemies of the Republic. Jim Tucker, I'll talk to you soon.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  Very good.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  There goes Jim Tucker. I apologized. Our next guest, who had to hold an amazing individual headline, gun owners, protest police action, times tribune.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  This is out of Pennsylvania, Dixon City. They were having their local gun club meet, and, you know, it's open carry there, and they had their guns there.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  And so some snitch called the police. There was no law, but the cops confiscated their guns.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And our next guest bravely spoke up to the media and spoke up to them and went to city council.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  And we appreciate Bill Grumbine for coming on with us. Let's play Bill's comments to the local newspaper that also posted this video.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  You want to live your life as a free man and be able to say the things that are guaranteed to you under the First Amendment, then you need to be able to exercise your Second Amendment.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  It ain't about hunting, and it's not even really about self-defense. It's about protecting us from overbearing government.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Great.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  And what was seen up here on Friday night was overbearing government, when they can come in and do whatever they want, regardless of what the law says. That is overbearing government.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to him. Then I've got some person groveling. It scares me, citizens with guns. I only want men in black ski masks to keep me safe.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  We're going to break in a moment, sir, but break down for listeners that just tuned in. What exactly happened in Pennsylvania?
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Well, up in Dixon City, a group of guys from Pennsylvania's firearms owners association got together with their wives and children for dinner.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  And they were carrying their guns openly. I was unable to attend this particular event, although I've been to previous events.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  And somebody got scared and called the police. And when the police showed up, things got kind of rough.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Slaves aren't armed. You don't have slaves outside slave quarters. And you don't have them with weapons. This was scary to the other slaves.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  Well, it was certainly scary to somebody because they called the police. And then they have the right to call the police for that.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  And the police have the right to come out. But once they got there and ascertain the situation, that's when they should have a nice dinner and walk away.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  But they didn't because they saw their slaves armed. What happened?
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  Well, what happened was, you know, I'm asked for identification. They started hauling people out of the restaurant right in the middle of their dinner.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  And one of the men who's been very active in our group here and in the movement for open carry was asked to produce ID.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  When you are on foot in Pennsylvania, you only have to give a verbal ID.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  Yeah, it's right to refuse. If there's a Supreme Court ruling out of Pennsylvania, one out of Austin, Texas too, but they don't care. Stay there, sir.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Quick break will come back and hear what transpired there. Stay with us.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the man and bringing them to justice.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over. They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  They oppose everything that is God and truth. They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:20:50.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[1:23:47.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  I'm going to Virginia to cover Bilderberg. Can't turn that down. Spook Central.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  I'm going to have my room, my door barricaded at night. They love to kill you in Virginia, boy. They'll shoot you up, throw you in the bathtub.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  Shifting gears, ladies and gentlemen. Big show today. We had Jesse Ventura on for 50 minutes and Jim Tucker.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Now we've got Bill Grumbine who stood up for the Second Amendment, spoke out with the city council and talked about it. Okay, tell us what happened, sir.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Well, the original event was all these folks having dinner and the police came and roused the amount of the restaurant in the middle of their meal.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Then one of my friends that I mentioned was arrested for being unwilling to give information that he was not required by law to give.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  He identified himself verbally, but that wasn't good enough for the police officer and they cuffed him and threw him in the car.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  They also threatened his wife, who was videotaping the event that if she didn't shut off her recorder, she could be arrested too.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  They were going for the First and Second Amendment last night. One of the other men had a gun taken from him and a number of people had their guns taken from them.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  They were run through the imaginary illegal database at the Pennsylvania State Police maintain.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  It's not supposed to be there. There isn't supposed to be a record of our fire when they take people's guns and run the serial numbers.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  I don't know what kind of record they're checking it since they don't have this thing, but they are.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  And so with no probable cause, they then also engage in a Fourth Amendment violation, raping.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  Well, they pretty much did that.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  They eventually let everybody go. They let Rich go. They still have his one gun. They didn't give that back to him yet.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  So we're waiting to see what the outcome of that is.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  Now, you were at the city council meeting, weren't you?
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Yes, I did go to that.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  And the people going, I'm afraid of citizens with guns. How do we get this pathetic?
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  I mean, here in Texas, the law says you can drive around with your rifle in your gun rack, but you don't do that.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  They'll swat team you. You get killed half the time.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  I mean, there's billboards up everywhere saying, report illegal guns with pictures of revolvers and rifles.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  So when a carpet cleaner's in your house, it happened to me. They call the cops on you.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  I mean, they think guns are illegal in Texas.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  And all these folks from New York and California are moving here and they see you putting a deer rifle in the back of your truck to go hunting.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  They call the cops and the cops go ahead and come out.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  I mean, this is scary when we can't even follow the law.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Well, it is scary.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And what it is is people were transferring an irrational fear to an inanimate object.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  When I was a kid back in the seventies, we used to bring our guns to school.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Same thing with my dad.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  My own brother, my younger brother, was on the rifle team.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  And he carried his.22 caliber rifle on the school bus.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  And all the bus drivers said to him, just make sure it's not loaded before you get on.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  And then magically, now we take the guns out of schools and we have mass shootings. Go ahead.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  Yes, but can you imagine today if some kid got on the school bus with his.22 rifle to take it to school for the shooting team?
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  They'd call the army out. They'd shut down half the city.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  There'd be guys in black uniforms running around like an ant hill had been overturned.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  But one of our goals is open carries.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  First of all, we're exercising our rights.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  It's like a muscle. If you don't exercise it, it's going to atrophy and it's going to go away.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  But the other thing we want to do is we want people to learn that there are many, many thousands of us out there who are normal everyday family men, family women.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  And that makes crime go down.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  And what you're saying is key because I said, I should do what you're doing, but I picked my battles.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  I, if I'm going to go to the shooting range now, pull the car up to the garage and look around because the chicken neck cowardly domesticated public will call a SWAT team on me if they see a gun.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  That's how enslaved we are here in Texas. Same thing in Pennsylvania, obviously.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  And you're right because we haven't shown our guns like we used to.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  We let them cower us and the cops harassed us into this that we're going to lose it all now.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  Well, we're working real hard to make sure that doesn't happen. And there are quite a few police that that do know the law.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  In fact, we have one gentleman involved in our group who was the assistant chief in the neighboring municipality up there.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  And it would have been nice if he could have been there that night.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  It would be interesting to see what would happen if they were arresting him.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Well, I know that in polls, the most pro gun group in the country are police, but they still get bonuses and extra money for, you know, quote,
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  stopping gun crime. But that gun crime is citizens doing nothing.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  And what did you think about the groveling locals going, I'm scared of guns. I'm scared.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  But you know, they like cops with guns, but not us with guns.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  Well, I did. There's not much you can do about somebody being scared of something that's like people being scared of spiders and snakes except try and educate them.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  But I think what has to happen with our public officials is they can say, yes, we understand you're scared.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  But no, those people aren't doing anything wrong.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Stay there. Stay there. Three minute break, sir.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  Let me come back with five minutes with you on the other side just so you can finish up.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Tell folks about your group in Pennsylvania.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Maybe our listeners can come join you.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  What you're doing, we all owe you a debt for, sir.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Absolutely, because they're creating the perception that guns are already illegal.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  They're brainwashing the public.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Well, they're right back.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  But their objective being world domination.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  They have all the money they need.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  They're after power.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  That's their affidavit.

[1:30:49.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  Have been warned.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually with a worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with oxysilver.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  That's 1-877-817-9829. Do it now.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  Some folks are born made to wave the flag. The red, white, and blue, the red, white, and blue.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  And when the band plays hell to the chief blood, no, they point the cannon at you.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  All right, we're going to be talking to Cody Deets and Sam Lugelow.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  We are Change, who went to the NRA Convention of All Places.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  They're pro-gun, by the way. Asked Oliver North about the FEMA camp programs he ran, the Senate hearings,
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  and they had them tackled and arrested with press passes, and then they stole their equipment.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Then we got Aaron Zelman, Jews of Preservation of Farms, ownership, kind of a Second Amendment theme today,
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  about the incredible attacks on the Second Amendment that are happening everywhere.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  That's coming up.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  Finishing up with Bill Grumbine, who's part of the local Second Amendment group that wears their guns openly.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Now, understand, my dad's only 58 years old, and he would go into a pretty big-sized school with a shotgun
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  to go hunting with the coaches after school, order the rifle club, take his rifle.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  Big cities, just until a decade ago, New York City had a gun club, and they weren't afraid of it,
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  and people were taught it.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  Now you have these domesticated people that are scared to death of guns.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  I've told the story of one of my dad's friends who works for a major magazine.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  I'll leave it at that. He's the editor of a national magazine.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  This was back in college when I kept my guns and my parents' guns safe.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  I didn't live with them. I moved out when I was 18, but I was going over to their house to get the guns.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  I was walking out with a rifle, and it was in a case, but he acted real scared and freaked out as I walked by the living room.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  He goes, is that a gun? It was like a king cobra or a mingled tiger was running around in the house.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  The guy's smart, not brain dead, even lives in Texas, shouldn't be so stupid.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  I go put it up. I go, what's the big deal? My dad goes, oh, come on.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  He goes and gets his revolver. He shows it. He goes, look, it's unloaded.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  Come on, get over your fear. The guy's going, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  He's like, come on. You don't get scared when you see a cop with a gun.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  He goes, look, he goes, just please get it out of here.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  It's irrational, but they see Billboard, Singapore legal guns.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  They watch the shows, the drama shows, the fiction shows based in New York, in Boston, in Chicago, in LA, where they have basic gun bands.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  And the people think guns are all banned, and so they're just like, oh, oh, oh, oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  And they're just, I mean, how these men raised their daughters and sons and then let them leave the house and never teach them how to have a gun.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.600]  you know, so that they can defend themselves.
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:03.920]  These women get raped, they get killed,
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:05.680]  they always call 911 and go,
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:08.400]  he just busted in, no, don't kill me.
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:10.080]  And they rape them and kill them.
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:12.280]  And then they leave the average times 11 minutes
[1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:13.600]  by the time they get there.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:16.000]  I mean, it's so, you should be historically scared
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.160]  of armored vehicles, face canning cameras,
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:19.760]  cops running around in black uniforms,
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:21.280]  running warrantless checkpoints.
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:23.440]  That historically is what's dangerous,
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:25.680]  not citizens with guns.
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:27.360]  And I want more citizens with guns.
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:29.640]  Kenesaw, Georgia had the highest crime rate in Georgia.
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:31.720]  Said everybody had to own a gun by law.
[1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:33.600]  Crime rate dropped by 95%.
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:35.560]  That's main government numbers.
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:37.680]  Look at the cesspits, New York, Chicago,
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:38.720]  wherever they have a gun ban,
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:40.080]  they have the highest crime rates,
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:42.600]  three, four times anywhere else.
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:44.240]  I'm gonna shut up and go to our guest
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:45.680]  and let him finish up.
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:48.160]  Bill Grumbine, we commend you for what you're doing.
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:50.360]  How do folks in Pennsylvania get involved
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:52.360]  with your group, wear their guns openly?
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:55.240]  Well, anybody can walk out the door
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:56.080]  as long as they're walking
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:36:58.040]  and then wear their gun openly.
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:00.520]  In Pennsylvania, you do not need to have any kind
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:03.000]  of license or permit from the government.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  If you are going to get into a vehicle
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:06.120]  with your loaded gun, though,
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:09.880]  at that point you need a license to carry firearms.
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:11.640]  And that's-
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:12.960]  How do you move your guns around then?
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:15.840]  Or do they say it's gonna be locked in the trunk,
[1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:19.160]  but they still take it to jail for that, like Texas or what?
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:21.000]  Well, there are certain technicalities
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:21.960]  that have to be observed.
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:24.000]  If you don't have a permit, you've gotta be,
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.080]  or I shouldn't say permit,
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:26.680]  I should say license to carry firearms.
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:28.320]  If you don't have that,
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:30.360]  you need to be traveling to or from a range
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:33.720]  or a gun dealer or something like that.
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:36.720]  But if you want to carry your gun concealed
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:39.120]  or transported in a vehicle loaded,
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:41.560]  then you need your license to carry firearms.
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:43.560]  The best place to get all the details,
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:46.000]  rather than have me try to give an old Pennsylvania law,
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:51.680]  would be www.pafoag.org.
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:55.120]  That's the Pennsylvania Firearms Owners Association.
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:57.840]  For those of your listeners who are not in Pennsylvania,
[1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:00.760]  but want to find out what their own state laws are,
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:05.600]  they can go to www.handgunlaw.us.
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:07.760]  And then there's also-
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:08.800]  Now give out your local,
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:10.480]  give out your local contact points.
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:11.320]  Okay.
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:16.320]  Yeah, another local contact point would be www.paopencary.org.
[1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:20.120]  PAopencary.org.
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:22.160]  PAopencary.org.
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:25.080]  And I agree, they've already got citizens
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:26.920]  thinking guns are illegal in our houses.
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:29.640]  And tattling in the cops usually go ahead and swatemia,
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:30.840]  even though they know it's not the law,
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:34.040]  there's any excuse to savagely attack freedom.
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:37.120]  And I just had enough of these criminals,
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:39.520]  and I've had enough of the ignorant slave public.
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:40.360]  And that's what they are.
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:42.280]  They're chicken-necked, cowardly slaves
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:44.720]  that want us all to live in fear like they do behind
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:46.200]  10 bolted doors.
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:47.920]  They won't even fight with a baseball bat
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:49.440]  as their wife's raped in front of them.
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:50.720]  I see these cases all the time.
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:51.800]  These aren't men.
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:53.800]  These are cowardly pieces of filth.
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:55.560]  And I'm sorry, they're coming after our guns,
[1:38:55.560 --> 1:38:57.000]  they're brainwashing our kids.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:57.920]  We got to turn it around.
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:00.480]  How do people come out and help your local group
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:02.680]  defend the flagging Second Amendment?
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:04.680]  Well, the first thing they can do
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:06.800]  is get their license to carry firearms.
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:08.360]  They can take a class on how to handle
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:09.480]  that weapon appropriately,
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:13.160]  and then they can join our website, join the discussion.
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:16.160]  The website is growing tremendously.
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:18.240]  We've got more and more people from all over the state
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:20.280]  getting to know one another,
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:22.760]  making friendships, eating dinner together,
[1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:26.560]  out and showing the flag as they stay,
[1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:28.240]  which is our gun.
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:31.320]  Letting people know that we're normal, regular people,
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:33.840]  and we're just exercising our rights
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:34.960]  in a normal, regular way.
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:37.160]  And the more we can do that,
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:38.760]  the less weird it becomes
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:41.640]  for those people who aren't used to seeing it.
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:42.680]  You know, thinking the first time
[1:39:42.680 --> 1:39:44.200]  that people saw somebody with orange hair
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:45.720]  walking down the road.
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:48.480]  Now nobody pays any attention to them.
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:50.640]  When they see enough people carrying guns,
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:53.600]  those are normal, regular, law-abiding citizens.
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:55.440]  It won't be so bad anymore.
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:57.160]  In the back, guys.
[1:39:57.160 --> 1:39:58.200]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:00.520]  No, I mean, I have a little instant access pistol safe.
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:01.840]  I notice they move things around in here
[1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:03.640]  and set a cabinet over it.
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:05.000]  And I hadn't thought about that in the last month.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.480]  I just noticed it took me a while to get to it.
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:09.320]  But, you know, I'm showing people right now
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:11.240]  watching on the TV feed, you know,
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:14.600]  my Evil 357 Magnum 7 shot.
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:16.400]  And I have a lot more sophisticated, you know,
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:18.880]  complex semi-automatic handguns and rifles.
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:21.760]  But this is for, if some nut comes in my office,
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:23.760]  it doesn't malfunction very often.
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:25.440]  It's very easy. It's very accurate.
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:28.440]  It's also a strong, you know, very strong round.
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:30.840]  And this is to defend me.
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:32.040]  It's not that I'm a, you know,
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:34.560]  someone who wants violence or is crazy or anything like this.
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:38.120]  It's that I have the responsibility to defend myself
[1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:39.720]  in my employees and I have a couple of...
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:42.880]  Well, that's exactly right.
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:44.920]  And I said that up there at that council meeting,
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:48.320]  you know, we don't want to use our guns to shoot people
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:50.640]  anymore than somebody else wants to use the airbag
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:53.560]  in their car or the fire extinguisher in their house.
[1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:56.680]  But if it's there and you need it, you need it.
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:40:58.960]  And if it's not there, it's not going to help you.
[1:40:58.960 --> 1:41:00.520]  And it's going to be too late.
[1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:04.480]  Absolutely. And people need to get familiar with these.
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:06.680]  If you're not a gun owner, you need to go out,
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:08.800]  buy a revolver first.
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:11.280]  Probably a revolver 22 is what I would start on
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:14.000]  for an adult, for children, single shot bolt action,
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  you know, Marlins or Remington and go out
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.160]  and practice shooting, but go out and take some classes
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:23.080]  at a local gun range, take three or four of them,
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:27.360]  learn the basic safety and then go out and start shooting
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:29.360]  at least once a month, folks.
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:33.040]  And it's such a feeling of security that if somebody comes
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:34.920]  in my house with my family, they're dead.
[1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:37.800]  I got three instant access pistol safes cause I have children
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:40.400]  and it takes me about three seconds to get to my gun
[1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:43.240]  in my house and you need to every few weeks,
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:47.200]  remember to go get in there, practice your safety case number
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:50.000]  to get into it fast and defend yourself.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.960]  And if somebody breaks into your office with a weapon
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:57.480]  of your home, just draw down on them and defend yourself.
[1:41:57.480 --> 1:41:58.840]  That's what this country was built on,
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:01.880]  not being a bunch of peasant slaves from Europe
[1:42:01.880 --> 1:42:04.400]  or peasant slaves from China who have no history
[1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:05.440]  of being able to defend themselves.
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:08.880]  Our ancestors who were slaves in Europe under feudalism
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:11.280]  could not arm themselves, only the lords and the nobility
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:12.640]  and their enforcers could.
[1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:15.840]  And the Magna Carta in 1215 that a lot of our ancestors
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:18.160]  fought and died for is what began,
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:20.000]  what became our second amendment.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.160]  And the war started in Lexington and Concord
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:23.920]  when they came for our second amendment.
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:26.240]  And I just want to commend you and thank you for all
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:28.400]  that you've done, sir, for coming on with us.
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:29.240]  Well, thank you very much.
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:30.160]  It was good to be here.
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:32.760]  Any other local websites you want to give out?
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:33.760]  Oh, that should do it.
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:36.760]  Then once they get to those places,
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:40.280]  they can find plenty more where they can get more information.
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:42.800]  Thank you for spending time with us, sir.
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:44.400]  Take care.
[1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:47.240]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:48.280]  Apologize to our other guests.
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:49.640]  We kind of got backed up today.
[1:42:49.640 --> 1:42:51.080]  We got more big guests, two more guests.
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:52.960]  Chuck Baldwin, head of the Constitution Party,
[1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:55.040]  President's candidate coming up the fourth hour.
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:57.800]  Aaron Zellman in the next hour, JPFO.
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:01.120]  Right now, let's go to Cody Deets and Sam Logaloo.
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:04.200]  Both we are changed Ohio, we are changed Kentucky.
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:05.480]  We've already had Adam Cuttington,
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:07.600]  we are changed Kentucky on twice.
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:09.640]  Gentlemen, continuing with the attack
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:12.280]  on the First Amendment, Freedom of the Press and Assembly,
[1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:15.560]  you were authorized, you had the slave cards to be there.
[1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:16.920]  That wasn't enough for them.
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:18.080]  You were assaulted.
[1:43:18.080 --> 1:43:20.680]  Tell us what happened to you when you faced up against.
[1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:22.080]  And I want to just add this.
[1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:23.520]  I wanted to make sure my memory served,
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:24.560]  even though I already knew it.
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:25.880]  I spent an hour last night
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:27.480]  refreshing myself on Oliver North,
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:30.880]  this fake conservative, this monster, this pig,
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:33.720]  this hater of liberty who poses as his conservative.
[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:35.440]  I remember growing up with conservative friends.
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:37.800]  I was conservative just worshiping Oliver North.
[1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:40.920]  And I remember, oh, I love Oliver North.
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:43.960]  You know, when I was like 15, 16, a young conservative,
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:45.440]  when I found out the time I was 18
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:47.880]  that he really was involved in massive narcotics trafficking,
[1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:49.000]  he ran that.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.160]  Then I've interviewed all these DEA and CIA people
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:52.720]  that saw him dealing it.
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:56.640]  And I mean, tons every day, tons of Coke brought in.
[1:43:56.640 --> 1:43:58.040]  The money they made is incredible.
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:00.080]  The Swiss bank accounts are incredible.
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:01.920]  I mean, the cocaine, the drugs,
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:05.720]  the putting out the crack ingredients, how to make that,
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:07.680]  the scourge, the crime it created,
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:10.160]  the non-crack heads that were murdered.
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:11.840]  In Dallas, I remember during the crack epidemic,
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:13.760]  they'd have five, six murders a day.
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:15.320]  I mean, the robberies, the home invasion,
[1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:18.080]  I remember in the 80s, mid and late 80s in Dallas,
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:19.800]  it was a war zone.
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:21.280]  I mean, in the nice neighborhoods,
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:22.640]  the crack heads were like zombies.
[1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:25.440]  That was the CIA ingredients, CIA how to do it,
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:27.440]  just like they introduced LSD.
[1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:29.680]  And then to learn how horrible he was
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:33.640]  and how evil he is and how he supports a police state
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:35.560]  and how he wants to attack Iran.
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.400]  And he is just a monstrous evil demon.
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:40.400]  And his private guns directed the police
[1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:42.800]  to attack these young men.
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:44.520]  So let's bring up Cody and Sam.
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:45.520]  We are Change Ohio.
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:46.440]  Men, you've got the floor.
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:47.720]  Tell us what happened.
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:52.640]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, I need my footage, Mr. Jones.
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:56.800]  I'm not sure I was, I was pretty positive the police had it,
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:00.160]  but now they're claiming no involvement in the incident.
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:01.000]  And so that's-
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:01.840]  But see how nice you are,
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:04.360]  you say now they claim no involvement in it.
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:09.360]  They initially said there was no involvement,
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:12.800]  but then later retracted that and said
[1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:14.680]  that they did have two officers there
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:18.120]  that showed up after the initial confrontation.
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:20.840]  So they're witnesses to harassment at the least.
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:22.200]  Okay, I want to stop you right now.
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:26.040]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:27.560]  Listen, I want you to talk about stuff,
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:28.840]  but I want you to be clear.
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:31.760]  They took your bubble sticks, they took your memory sticks,
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:33.040]  they took your batteries,
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:35.720]  they stole them, and so we've been trained
[1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:38.480]  subliminably as slaves at a subliminal level
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:41.080]  to say, oh, well now they say they never did it.
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:41.920]  Let's be clear.
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:44.040]  Are they lying scum?
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:48.200]  Yes, they are at LMPD on their shoulder sleeves.
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:51.900]  Okay, now for the listeners, what did the lying scum do?
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:57.560]  Well, the full interview with officer Phil Russell
[1:45:57.560 --> 1:46:00.240]  is at WeAreChangeOhio.com right now
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:02.320]  for the listeners to listen to.
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:05.640]  And that's his full statement on the situation.
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:07.440]  So you can quote him on that.
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:09.680]  Okay, tell us what happened, tell us.
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:13.520]  He just, he basically said that they showed up later
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:17.600]  and witnessed everything and that they did not have
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:19.120]  the footage in their possession
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:22.240]  and they weren't sure where the footage was exactly.
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:25.880]  But it was taken from my hand by an LMPD
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:27.200]  uniformed officer.
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:28.920]  Now, whether or not he was telling me
[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:30.640]  that there's so many different departments
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:33.960]  and organizations in fact the convention center
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:37.520]  and the NRA hire off-duty police officers
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:40.080]  to patrol their events and he was suggesting
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:43.400]  that that's what happened and I was mistaken.
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:44.480]  Yeah, they're passing the buck.
[1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:46.800]  It's a classic distraction op.
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:48.240]  Probably in his desk drawer.
[1:46:49.400 --> 1:46:52.640]  Okay, describe exactly what happened.
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:53.960]  Now, so we've got Sam.
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.880]  Sam, you're the one that was tackled, correct?
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:46:56.720]  Yes, sir.
[1:46:56.720 --> 1:46:59.520]  Okay, the jack boot assaulted you.
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:01.000]  Tell us what happened.
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:04.320]  Okay, they were escorting us out of the building.
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:06.240]  They told us that we had to leave
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:08.840]  and they said that they would let us leave peacefully
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:12.440]  and a plain clothes officer.
[1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:14.280]  I did not know he was a police officer
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:16.120]  or any kind of law enforcement at the time
[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:18.520]  was walking behind me and all of a sudden-
[1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:22.080]  You didn't know a God force.
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:24.560]  A living God was behind you.
[1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:26.840]  What did the living God do?
[1:47:26.840 --> 1:47:28.920]  He said, give me that camera
[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:31.040]  and he tried to snatch it out of my hand
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:32.480]  while he was walking behind me.
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:35.360]  What did you think when you for the first time saw a God?
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:40.880]  I just thought, hey, I can't let this person
[1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:43.080]  take the camera and I jerk back on it
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:46.440]  and all of a sudden the rest of them just pounced on me
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:51.200]  and the one guy wrapped his arm around my neck,
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:54.280]  not choking me, but as a control measure
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:56.400]  and they took me down to the ground.
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:00.200]  Hardcore Assault, Hardcore Assault.
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:03.080]  Yeah, I said, I mean, you tackle a cop now,
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:03.920]  they gun you down.
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:05.560]  It was a guy in San Diego, didn't touch him
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:06.800]  and they shot him four times.
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:08.920]  He started trying to get back up
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:10.280]  and they just blew him away again
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:12.160]  and the police are saying, we kill you now
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:13.040]  if you don't submit.
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:14.120]  It's not just tasers.
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:17.200]  Go ahead, tell me what the devil force did.
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:18.760]  Okay, so they take me down to the ground
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:20.800]  and I say, easy, easy, easy.
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:22.720]  And then I say, I'm not resisting.
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:25.120]  I'm not resisting because there are witnesses around.
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:26.520]  This is a very public place.
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:28.360]  You know, as a means to protect myself.
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:29.200]  Yep.
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:31.360]  And I basically, for the most part,
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:33.520]  I went limp, except for just, you know,
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:35.040]  trying to make sure that I didn't slam
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:36.440]  or anything like that.
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:40.360]  And they cuffed me and they picked me up
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:42.320]  and almost carried me out of there
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:43.800]  and while they're carrying me out there,
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:45.320]  talking about how I was fighting them
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:46.680]  and that this is federal charges.
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:48.480]  And you know, just, just basically-
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:51.160]  Frame ups, lies, hardcore criminal activity.
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:54.560]  And I told him like, hey, you're trying to set me up.
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:55.840]  And then they took me out.
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:48:56.880]  Well, they're psychopaths.
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:58.200]  You got to talk to them like that.
[1:48:58.200 --> 1:49:00.280]  I have a wife, I have children.
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:01.480]  I'm a human.
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:03.720]  It's wrong to lie about me.
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:06.400]  I'm a person and sometimes they have some humanity.
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:08.520]  Let me go, look, you talk to them
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:10.040]  like you talk to a kidnapper.
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:11.520]  Go ahead.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:12.360]  Yeah.
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:13.720]  And you've been kidnapped at that time.
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:16.000]  What did the kidnappers do next?
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:17.640]  Well, they took me outside
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:19.800]  and they stood me up against the wall.
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:22.600]  And I saw that my three friends
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:24.280]  were also out there at this point.
[1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:27.480]  And I saw them try to snatch the camera out of Cody's hand.
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:33.360]  Yeah, I was filming the arrest and assault of Sam
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:36.320]  at which time I was told to shut off my camera.
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:40.080]  I did not comply feeling that this was our only evidence
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:42.080]  of abuse and assault.
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:44.200]  At which time they said, get them.
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:49.200]  And I was attacked by two officials taking to my knees.
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:51.880]  No, no, public servants, you just did it.
[1:49:51.880 --> 1:49:53.680]  You just see you've been conditioned.
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:57.320]  Okay, but so you can either call them your servants,
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:59.480]  what they are, or if you're gonna call them officials,
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:03.720]  that means God, that means authority, officials, the boss.
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:05.680]  Now, are you gonna call them God
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:07.280]  or are you gonna call them servant?
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:10.840]  I'm gonna go with servant as far as the servant
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:11.680]  is driving me down like me.
[1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:13.520]  We have to stop calling them officials and authorities.
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:15.200]  That's part of their programming.
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:17.720]  Okay, so it's a servant, not a God.
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:19.640]  What did the servant do?
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:23.240]  Well, I went for my video stick out of my video camera,
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:26.240]  you know, as I was being assaulted,
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:28.000]  at which point the servants told me
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.840]  that that was a felony defense,
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:34.840]  given the fact that it's evidence and an investigation.
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:37.000]  Yeah, so the criminal frame up,
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  hardcore criminal activity continued from there.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:44.240]  Hardcore criminal forces waging war against freedom
[1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:45.480]  in the United States.
[1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:49.960]  Hardcore former Iraqi troops coming home to rule the slaves.
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:54.320]  Terror storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[1:50:54.320 --> 1:50:55.840]  Loose change, final cut.
[1:50:55.840 --> 1:50:58.040]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:50:59.960]  The true story of the Bilderberg group,
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:03.200]  the late great USA, America, freedom to fascism.
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:04.760]  These are just a few of the hundreds

[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:50.760]  Join the info war today.
[1:51:50.760 --> 1:51:52.440]  Wake up Protestant America.
[1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:54.640]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned
[1:51:54.640 --> 1:51:56.080]  to join church and state.
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:51:58.560]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics,
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:51:59.840]  and Protestant denominations
[1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:02.160]  will form one huge political voting block.
[1:52:02.160 --> 1:52:04.480]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:06.160]  and morality by legislation.
[1:52:06.160 --> 1:52:07.800]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:09.800]  to guarantee all Americans this freedom,
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:10.960]  liberty of conscience.
[1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:12.480]  History and the Bible proved to them
[1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:14.360]  that these two systems, church and state,
[1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:15.600]  must be kept separate.
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:18.000]  It must be our love of God and of country
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:19.680]  that prompts or constrains us.
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:22.280]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:24.720]  From history, we saw that when church and state united,
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:27.600]  known as papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:29.400]  This union would go directly contrary
[1:52:29.400 --> 1:52:31.200]  to the great principles of our nation.
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:34.040]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[1:52:34.040 --> 1:52:36.800]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[1:52:36.800 --> 1:52:38.720]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:41.480]  Jesus is coming soon for free materials
[1:52:41.480 --> 1:52:45.720]  call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says,

[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:01.160]  at the Center for Disease Control reports
[1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.600]  of suffering from internal parasites.

[1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:00.440]  America's changing.
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:02.640]  You can't deny it's turning into a cesspit.
[1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:05.160]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[1:54:05.160 --> 1:54:06.800]  You can't deny that we're pushed around,
[1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:09.600]  treated like slaves, and we aren't.
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:11.480]  We're debt slaves, we're owned by foreign banks.
[1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:13.680]  It's all fraud, we can say no any day.
[1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:19.160]  I know there's a lot of good police out there too,
[1:54:19.160 --> 1:54:21.000]  but the system's corrupt and evil.
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:24.240]  And I have seen it so many times
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:27.600]  where they've tried to frame me, talked about framing me,
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:29.920]  lied to the media about us.
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:31.960]  I mean, again, I grew up where the local sheriff
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:35.000]  dealt the drugs and they still busted the kids.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.040]  Or where the police knew there was a crack house
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:40.080]  but would only bust you when you bought the crack.
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:42.400]  And I grew up seeing all this.
[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:45.240]  And I mean, I know Oliver North's the drug dealer.
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:47.160]  I hate him, I hate drugs.
[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:52.160]  And I just, you know, to hear about these poor men captured
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:55.000]  as they're talking about setting them up.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.880]  I mean, we're human beings, you can't do that.
[1:54:57.880 --> 1:54:59.320]  And I'm tired of it.
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:02.000]  I got so many squad car videos that have come out on the web
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:03.880]  where you see cops planting drugs on people
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:06.480]  and they get caught and don't get in trouble.
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:08.440]  I mean, let me just, you know, I'm scared to death.
[1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:10.000]  They're gonna pull me over sometime.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.640]  Though Austin is known for not being one of the worst cities
[1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:16.040]  with police and planting drugs on me.
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:18.320]  I don't use anything folks other than coffee.
[1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:21.560]  I drink a beer this weekend too.
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:23.800]  I've tried to completely quit that, I should.
[1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:25.400]  But let me go back to these gentlemen.
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:26.480]  Sam, what happened next?
[1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:28.880]  They were started saying that the,
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:30.240]  what was that Cody talking about?
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:31.160]  How they started saying that,
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.080]  oh, you were trying to take your memory stick out.
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:35.640]  That's covered up federal evidence, boy.
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:36.720]  Go ahead.
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:38.080]  Yeah, and my question is,
[1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:40.360]  well, if I was tampering with federal evidence,
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:42.440]  where is that federal evidence now?
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:43.480]  And where is the crime?
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:45.640]  Where, you would have to be evidence in a crime.
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:47.040]  It's just totally made up.
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:49.920]  Yeah, we were charged with helping.
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:51.520]  I need that footage, Mr. Jones.
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:55.040]  Phil Russell with LMPD told me to contact
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.360]  the Kentucky Convention Center
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:55:57.880]  because they're tired of getting phone calls
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:00.680]  from every great info warrior out there
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:01.920]  that has done a great job.
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:03.440]  They're passing the buck.
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:06.200]  Give these creatures, these desk spots,
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:07.880]  phone numbers out right now.
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:10.000]  Let's hit them with 5,000 calls.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Kentucky Exposition Center Security is 502-367-5360,
[1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:22.840]  and they'll have a full mailbox by the end of the night.
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:24.400]  Well, listen, we don't want to just do that.
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:25.920]  We want to call the main police.
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:27.480]  They're passing the buck, it's pure bull,
[1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:29.040]  it's their jurisdiction.
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:30.920]  And I want to expand on this.
[1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:32.800]  We are changing to stop putting up with this.
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:34.560]  You clearly got them, you need,
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:37.400]  some lawyer needs to call, just file the suit,
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:39.240]  and they'll start, you know, you know,
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:41.080]  whatting in their pants, then they'll try to settle,
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:43.040]  just say, give us the stuff back.
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:44.480]  You need to go ahead and go after them
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:46.800]  for official oppression, false arrest,
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:49.640]  aggravated kidnapping, I'm serious.
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:52.000]  So they made a big mistake not going ahead
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:52.840]  and setting you up.
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:54.920]  That's why most of them will just do that.
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:56.040]  Continue with what happened.
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:56:58.600]  Because I heard there was like an hour-long celebration
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:00.440]  as the Marine Corps screamed at you
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:02.240]  and told you you were slaves.
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:04.800]  Yes, sir, it was a typical bootlicking.
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:09.600]  We are the supreme gods, and you will comply to our will.
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:10.840]  And if you don't comply,
[1:57:10.840 --> 1:57:13.720]  you're going to jail for life situation.
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:14.720]  Oh, they said that.
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:18.640]  You will comply would be a quote.
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:23.640]  And as far as if you don't comply,
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:26.440]  we're gonna throw the book at you basically.
[1:57:26.440 --> 1:57:28.080]  Yeah, they're ready to put us in furnaces.
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:29.280]  That's the next step.
[1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:31.280]  Lighting us up. I've seen them train to do it.
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:32.920]  So, you know, God help us.
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:34.520]  I guess we're not allowed to fight back when that's happening.
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:37.080]  Just get on the flatbeds and go to the death camp.
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:39.400]  So now these guys,
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:42.400]  I'm talking to some of the other guys.
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:45.080]  They look like they just gotten off the boat from Iraq.
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:47.160]  I don't know about that.
[1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:50.200]  That were, that were, these were,
[1:57:50.200 --> 1:57:55.200]  these were older gentlemen between 40 and 45, 50.
[1:57:56.080 --> 1:57:58.360]  Okay, so there weren't any young guys there.
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:57:59.640]  Okay, thought I've been told that.
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:00.880]  Well, there were a few.
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:03.960]  It was mostly a middle-aged men though.
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:06.640]  Who were having their victory against freedom in America.
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:08.320]  Who had some reporters,
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:11.240]  yeah, evil reporters that had passes
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:13.040]  and they dare ask about camps.
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:14.840]  These Americans were going to be shown
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:17.120]  that here in this country, we don't have freedom.
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:19.360]  You understand you degenerate filth.
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:21.920]  You serve the authorities, the officials.
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:25.760]  You're here to pay my check and lick my boots, boy.
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:26.600]  Stay right there.
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:29.800]  Come back to both of you slaves, both of you are scum.
[1:58:33.480 --> 1:58:35.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:44.240]  It is a big idea.
[1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:46.040]  A new world order.
[1:58:46.040 --> 1:58:47.840]  In the near future,
[1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:50.960]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:52.960]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:55.960]  But their objective being world domination.
[1:58:55.960 --> 1:58:58.960]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:01.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:06.960]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.960 --> 1:59:11.960]  For the first time in history,
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:14.960]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:59:16.960 --> 1:59:18.960]  the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:21.960]  Builder Bird is making great progress through the world government.
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:22.960]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:23.960]  They're not after money.
[1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:24.960]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:25.960]  They're after power.
[1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:26.960]  That's their affidavit.

[1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:38.960]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:59:38.960 --> 1:59:52.960]  You have been warned.
[2:00:09.960 --> 2:00:11.960]  You can be in Austin, Texas.
[2:00:11.960 --> 2:00:13.960]  You can be in New York City.
[2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:15.960]  You can be clean cut.
[2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:17.960]  You can have children with you.
[2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:19.960]  The police will walk right over and say,
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:22.960]  you're not allowed to stand here with a sign,
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:23.960]  with a political view.
[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:25.960]  And if you say no, they're going to say,
[2:00:25.960 --> 2:00:27.960]  I'm going to arrest you.
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:29.960]  I'm going to take your camera.
[2:00:29.960 --> 2:00:30.960]  And you've got to stand your ground.
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:32.960]  And sometimes they still arrest you.
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:34.960]  And man, they feel good when they hurt this country
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:35.960]  and hurt it bad.
[2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:37.960]  And that's why I'm mad at you.
[2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:39.960]  Let me tell you, I know how bad it is.
[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:41.960]  When a government will arrest you for videotaping
[2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:42.960]  or arrest you for talking
[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:44.960]  or arrest you for demonstrating peacefully,
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:46.960]  you're one inch from death camps.
[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:47.960]  It goes over the edge.
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:49.960]  We're already over the edge.
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:51.960]  And I'm trying to claw my back up a hill
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:53.960]  and I'm so upset, cops.
[2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:55.960]  Your whole future is being destroyed, too.
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:00:57.960]  Your masters are going to,
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:00:59.960]  this is all about destroying our economy, our future.
[2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:01.960]  It's land of the free, home of the brave.
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:03.960]  It's the United States.
[2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:06.960]  It's supposedly a free society.
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:07.960]  And I'm really bitter.
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:08.960]  I'm upset.
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:09.960]  I'm angry.
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:11.960]  Because I know this country's going to hell in a handbasket
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:13.960]  and I'm upset and I'm mad at you.
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:14.960]  You're not authorities.
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:15.960]  You're not officials.
[2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:16.960]  You're peace officers.
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:17.960]  You're public servants.
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:20.960]  And I think about these young men surrounded by evil
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:22.960]  for their courage to go in and ask Oliver North
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:24.960]  that narcotics trafficking piece of trash
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:27.960]  who trained death squads that killed men, women, and children.
[2:01:27.960 --> 2:01:29.960]  You know, those death squads killed tens of thousands
[2:01:29.960 --> 2:01:30.960]  and they've dug up all these graves
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:33.960]  that have got little two-year-old toddlers in them.
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:35.960]  And I got to watch you waddle around
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:37.960]  and talk about how you're conservatives
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:40.960]  and how you're good.
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:42.960]  I know who the government is.
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:44.960]  They're death squad hardcore killers.
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:46.960]  They ship the drugs in, they rule.
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:48.960]  And now they want the bank accounts.
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:49.960]  They want the businesses.
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:50.960]  They want the roads.
[2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:51.960]  They want to tax you.
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:52.960]  They're going for broke.
[2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:54.960]  They're not going to give us quarter you dumb cops.
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:56.960]  You work for killers.
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:59.960]  And I'm tired of you going along with it
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:03.960]  and enjoying butcher in my country with so much enjoyment.
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:05.960]  I've had enough of it.
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:08.960]  You're tearing my heart out here.
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:10.960]  You go with the CPS pedophiles
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:12.960]  that sees people's kids for no reason.
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:15.960]  So five times more likely to rape them like you do.
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:18.960]  You scum.
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:20.960]  You're all on power trips.
[2:02:20.960 --> 2:02:22.960]  How it's all about you and how you're the boss.
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:23.960]  I got news for you.
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:24.960]  I'm tired of it.
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:26.960]  We're going to Aaron Zelman on after the break,
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:28.960]  but I may even hold you guys over with him.
[2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:29.960]  Look, I'm going to try to shut up.
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:31.960]  Just give out the main police number in Louisville.
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:33.960]  Say anything else you want.
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:34.960]  I'm too angry.
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:36.960]  I do want to let the people know
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:38.960]  that I have a full interview with me
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:42.960]  and Phil Russell of the Louisville Metro Police Department.
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:44.960]  He is their public advisor.
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:47.960]  That's posted on WeAreChangeOhio.com in full.
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:50.960]  And you can also check out the rest of the story
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:51.960]  from the beginning.
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:52.960]  It's all posted on there.
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:53.960]  How long is it?
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:55.960]  It's a little over 12 minutes.
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:02:57.960]  Can we play that at the end of the show today?
[2:02:57.960 --> 2:02:59.960]  You're asking my permission?
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:00.960]  Yes, sir.
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:02.960]  Yes, I would appreciate it a lot.
[2:03:02.960 --> 2:03:03.960]  All right.
[2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:05.960]  Give out the Ohio change again.
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:09.960]  WeAreChangeOhio.com.
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:11.960]  How are these guys looking at you?
[2:03:11.960 --> 2:03:13.960]  You said they were saying things, too.
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:15.960]  I mean, people have to see the celebration of evils,
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:16.960]  what I call it.
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:18.960]  What was the celebration of evil like?
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:20.960]  Well, luckily, I get my footage.
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:22.960]  We'll all get to see that.
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:24.960]  But it was very degrading.
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:26.960]  They made me feel less than human.
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:30.960]  And next time I go through anything like this,
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:31.960]  I'm going to lay down on the ground,
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:32.960]  put my hands behind my back,
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:33.960]  and tell them to take me to jail.
[2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:36.960]  I'm not going through the harassment again.
[2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:38.960]  It will never again.
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:41.960]  One thing is that it was mainly uniformed officers
[2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:43.960]  who were taking the chips out of our cameras.
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:46.960]  And it was, I believe, Officer Reem,
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:49.960]  who got in my face and said,
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:51.960]  we're taking your cameras, the evidence.
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:53.960]  And then he stood there and he stared at me,
[2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:54.960]  kept looking at me.
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:59.960]  And he was like, you got a problem with that?
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:00.960]  What did you say to him?
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:01.960]  According to Phil Russell,
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:03.960]  Officer Reem is not an officer
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:06.960]  with the Louisville Metro Police Department.
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:08.960]  He was just in their uniform.
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:11.960]  Yeah, right.
[2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:13.960]  What did you say to him?
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:15.960]  What did you say to him when he said that to you?
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:18.960]  I mean, I was just completely baffled.
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:21.960]  I mean, I was asking him how with
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:24.960]  Louisville Metro Police Department on his sleeve
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:28.960]  is he not a member of their police organization.
[2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:30.960]  He replied to me that they were off duty
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:32.960]  and that they have separate organizations
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:34.960]  for the whole Metro County
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:36.960]  and all this blotty-blot
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:38.960]  and that the Louisville Metro Police Department
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:40.960]  isn't accountable for his actions.
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:42.960]  Because that means he was part of a group of officers
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:45.960]  that sell their merc services out.
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:47.960]  Stay there. Stay there, both of you.
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:50.960]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs

[2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:50.960]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:52.960]  deep behind enemy lines,
[2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:55.960]  the information war continues.
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:58.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:58.960 --> 2:08:00.960]  We got Chuck Baldwin,
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:01.960]  an amazing individual,
[2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:04.960]  presidential candidate
[2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:09.960]  for the Constitution Party
[2:08:09.960 --> 2:08:11.960]  for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[2:08:11.960 --> 2:08:13.960]  Got Aaron Zellman for the rest of this hour.
[2:08:13.960 --> 2:08:17.960]  Aaron was just listening and shot during the break.
[2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:19.960]  You understand that the BATF,
[2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:21.960]  you can have a legal AR-15
[2:08:21.960 --> 2:08:24.960]  if it misfires as they do occasionally
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:27.960]  and shoots two rounds instead of one.
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:29.960]  The gun rangers are trained to call the police on you.
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:30.960]  You'll be held,
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:32.960]  and the BATF will say,
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:35.960]  yeah, we know it's a misfire going to prison for 10 years.
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:36.960]  We'll talk about that today.
[2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:38.960]  We'll talk about Pennsylvania cops confiscating guns
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:40.960]  of legal gun owners and saying,
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:42.960]  we don't care, there's not a law.
[2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:44.960]  All the things that are happening,
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:45.960]  the tripling of the BATF,
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:47.960]  the new reign of terror that's taking place.
[2:08:47.960 --> 2:08:49.960]  But both of you,
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:52.960]  both Cody Deets and Sam Lugalo,
[2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:54.960]  we are Change Ohio that we're in Louisville,
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:56.960]  and all this happened to you.
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:08:58.960]  Both of you,
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:00.960]  just how did this end?
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:01.960]  What would you like to see happen here?
[2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:04.960]  Give out the Louisville main number.
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:05.960]  For me personally,
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:07.960]  I would appreciate it if the local Louisville people
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:09.960]  would get involved as much as possible.
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:11.960]  I'm all the way here in Ohio,
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:13.960]  and I can't do all the footwork
[2:09:13.960 --> 2:09:15.960]  of actually going to these places.
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:18.960]  And if we could also get their local media involved,
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:20.960]  that would put some pressure to find out
[2:09:20.960 --> 2:09:22.960]  where all this stuff is.
[2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:24.960]  The main thing is,
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:25.960]  I'd like to get the footage back,
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:27.960]  what they stole from us.
[2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:29.960]  And you keep asking this for the phone number.
[2:09:29.960 --> 2:09:31.960]  Personally, I don't have a computer in front of the phone here.
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:34.960]  But if you do go to WeAreChangeOhio.com,
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:37.960]  the phone number is at the bottom of the article there.
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:40.960]  Oh, I actually have it here in front of me.
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:46.960]  The number to the police department is...
[2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:48.960]  One second.
[2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:54.960]  It's 502-574-7111.
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:58.960]  And I would advise restraint just a little bit.
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:00.960]  Not to sympathize with them,
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:02.960]  but they haven't gotten a lot of calls lately.
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:04.960]  No, I mean, don't give them excuses to get mad at you.
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:06.960]  Don't act like they act.
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:09.960]  Call up and go, how dare your people threaten to frame folks,
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:11.960]  how dare them kidnap them,
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:15.960]  and then steal their video camera tapes,
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:18.960]  chips, and, of course, batteries.
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:20.960]  That's got to be...
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:22.960]  How many cameras?
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:27.960]  We had five cameras between the four of us.
[2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:33.960]  Okay, so that's five batteries, four memory chips, a CD.
[2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:36.960]  I mean, that is like $500 right there or more.
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:38.960]  Yes, sir, they were pretty nice.
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:40.960]  Pretty nice memory.
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:45.960]  Well, I mean, two gig, three gig members sticks like $100.
[2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:47.960]  How big were they?
[2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:49.960]  Yeah, they were all...
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:51.960]  I think four gig was the lowest.
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:53.960]  Oh, well, that's like $150.
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:55.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:59.960]  And we're having a hard time getting gas money for cars and stuff,
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:01.960]  so it's like, what do we do now?
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:04.960]  I was going to use my camera today, and I can't even use it without a memory.
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:05.960]  Well, that's your headline.
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:07.960]  Louisville Police and Convention Center,
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:10.960]  steal $600, $700 worth of equipment.
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:12.960]  Well, I mean, according to Phil Russell,
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:16.960]  there were no Metro Police Department there until the end,
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:20.960]  and I'm, you know, as much as they witnessed, I'm not sure, but it's just...
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:24.960]  I mean, how do you go about when someone completely denies anything?
[2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:26.960]  How do you, I mean...
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:28.960]  Well, that's what will happen when they come pick you up at your house
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:30.960]  and take you to a lime grave.
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:32.960]  They just say, we don't know where Alex went.
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:34.960]  We don't know where Cody and Sam went.
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:36.960]  You know, we don't know what...
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:38.960]  People said guys in black uniforms grabbed them.
[2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:41.960]  You know, they'll gun the whole family down right there.
[2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:42.960]  I mean, that's how this works.
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:43.960]  That's what Oliver North ran.
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:45.960]  That's why this is so dangerous.
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:46.960]  I want to bring Aaron Zellman up.
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:48.960]  Aaron, what do you think of this?
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:51.960]  Well, as I said, Alex, at first I've heard of this,
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:57.960]  and it's really shocking that the NRA would be associating with Oliver North
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:01.960]  and then mistreating folks who come to their convention
[2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:06.960]  who were seeking the truth by asking a few simple questions.
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:13.960]  However, with that said, the NRA has been in bed with the ATF for years,
[2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:18.960]  and so anything that has to do with destroying freedom
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:23.960]  or misleading the membership, perpetuating the fraud known as the NRA,
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:25.960]  does not shock me.
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:28.960]  Well, they had press passes too,
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:32.960]  and then the police just came up and tackled Sam.
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:39.960]  Well, you know, if people think that the police are on the side of the people,
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:42.960]  they're engaged in the grand fantasy.
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:46.960]  I would encourage people to read a little booklet called Ordinary Men
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:53.960]  about how the Nazis used the local police to carry out the murdering of citizens.
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:58.960]  And today's police are even better equipped to murder citizens.
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:00.960]  It's all happening all the time.
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:02.960]  I tell you, we're in red-level crisis.
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:05.960]  Well, guys, talk to me as this develops, and we really appreciate it.
[2:13:05.960 --> 2:13:09.960]  Give out the Louisville number and then give out the Scumbag Convention Center number.
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:16.960]  All right, sir, Louisville Metro Police Department is 502-574-7111.
[2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:18.960]  They're political.
[2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:21.960]  It's Phil Russell, if you ask for him.
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:29.960]  The security department for the Kentucky Expo Center is 502-367-5360,
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:34.960]  and my full interview with Phil Russell is at WeAreChangeOhio.com.
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:36.960]  All right, good job, man. Thanks for coming on.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:38.960]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.960]  It takes a lot of courage, Aaron, to get the press passes, go in, ask the questions.
[2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:47.960]  We AreChange is being attacked everywhere for asking about the camps and other issues.
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:49.960]  We have free speech zones.
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:51.960]  They're banning free speech everywhere.
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:53.960]  I mean, this country is in a lot of trouble.
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:58.960]  You not only are the head of the Jews, the preservation of firearms ownership.
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:00.960]  You also have an anti-police state organization.
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:02.960]  I mean, I'm tracking it.
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:05.960]  Jail time for speeding, 10 years.
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:12.960]  They're now saying hardcore jail time, first offense for taller than three-inch grass in major cities.
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:14.960]  I have that in the stack today.
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:17.960]  Banana peel. They're talking six months in jail.
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:19.960]  They're building prisons everywhere.
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:22.960]  I mean, Aaron, this is getting bad.
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:25.960]  Well, we have a government that's gone bad.
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:30.960]  We have a citizenry that the majority of people don't seem to care.
[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:35.960]  And so, sure, yeah, things are going to get bad, but sometimes Alex versus better,
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:39.960]  the more people have their ox gored, the more people have a wolf at the door,
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:43.960]  the more people who start to wake up.
[2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:47.960]  We're going to find out, Alex, apparently in a very near future,
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:54.960]  if the American people truly understand the significance of the Second Amendment.
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:58.960]  There's 80 million gun owners in this country, as I'm led to believe.
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:05.960]  And we're going to find out what percentage of them are going to be worthy of being a gun owner.
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:12.960]  That's right. That freedom was paid for in rivers of blood.
[2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:15.960]  And people don't appreciate that.
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:18.960]  Well, I think that one of the problems we have, as you know, Alex,
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:23.960]  is that there's an awful lot of people in America who haven't got a clue about American history.
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:26.960]  They don't understand how this country came about.
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:32.960]  They don't understand how World War II Americans had to go die in foreign lands
[2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:36.960]  to keep fascism from coming to America.
[2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:43.960]  We have some fascism here now, but it was nothing like what was going to be here during World War II.
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:50.960]  So we have a populace that is just simply not knowledgeable about the history of America
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:58.960]  and certainly not knowledgeable about what it takes to create freedom and to keep freedom alive.
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:01.960]  What's wrong with the average cop?
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:05.960]  Because more and more, they look at us like we're the enemy. They act crazy.
[2:16:05.960 --> 2:16:09.960]  I know it's been incremental brainwashing, but man, we're in trouble.
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:13.960]  Well, I'm not sure I have a real good answer about the average cop.
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:20.960]  I think that what we're seeing is what I call the militarization of the police,
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:25.960]  where the federal government is making more and more goodies available in the way of armament
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:31.960]  and devices to control the citizens to the police departments.
[2:16:31.960 --> 2:16:36.960]  Police departments, for some reason, seem to think they need all of this equipment.
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:44.960]  In fact, I found it amazing in Texas when they had the raid on the, what's it called, the FLDS.
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:48.960]  Yeah, they had a Bradley without the turret.
[2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:55.960]  Exactly. It's a sheriff on the side, and I thought, what is going on here? What were they expecting?
[2:16:55.960 --> 2:16:58.960]  So it shows you the mindset.
[2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:04.960]  Well, I guess the bottom line would be Alex, that it's going to be us against them.
[2:17:04.960 --> 2:17:10.960]  That's the mindset that they've already developed, and now the American people have to decide if they want to share the same mindset.
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:16.960]  No, that's it. The entire attack profile of the government, they're saying the average people are the enemy.
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:22.960]  They are attacking us, and now, if you're even unarmed, they just gun you down.
[2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:26.960]  I see cases every day where right in front of witnesses, they just decide to kill you.
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:30.960]  And before cops would go to jail, now they just say, that's the way it is.
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:38.960]  Well, that's true. I'm not so sure that's the way it is in Wisconsin at the moment, but it may very well be that way.
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:44.960]  But I think that we have a situation where apparently there's something afoot in the country.
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:53.960]  It's going to be some type of severe problem, and the government is afraid that the people will react against the government.
[2:17:53.960 --> 2:18:02.960]  So the government is taking a strategic step to, or if I can call it a preemptive strike against the people.
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:06.960]  No, no, that's it. Exactly. They are doing martial law drills everywhere and admitting it.
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:14.960]  It's in the legislation past. They're just questioning people on the street corners, setting up random checkpoints, saying they're all giving them M16s.
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:21.960]  They're going to attack us, and that's the proof they're the terrorists because they're going to stage more terror, Aaron.
[2:18:21.960 --> 2:18:24.960]  Well, that shouldn't shock anybody at this point.
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:34.960]  But if I could comment just a moment on something you were saying about the ATF, and if your firearm shoots more than two shots with one pull the trigger.
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:35.960]  Yes.
[2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:46.960]  If you have a moment. That decision comes out of a court case dealing with a David Oleson here in Milwaukee, and it was just about, I think, a week or 10 days ago.
[2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:59.960]  The expert witness, Len Savage, who was part of that court case, when he was in the courtroom, the federal prosecutor made it very clear to the judge,
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:09.960]  they did not care what kind of weapon malfunctioned if it had more than two shots with one pull the trigger, including your double barrel shotgun,
[2:19:09.960 --> 2:19:18.960]  or including a single action Western style revolver, and that's possible. They considered it an illegal machine gun.
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:28.960]  And so I want everybody who's listening to realize that they may very well be blamed or charged with owning an illegal machine gun if the gun malfunctions.
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:29.960]  Stay there.
[2:19:29.960 --> 2:19:36.960]  Yeah, yeah. Violent offenders aren't the target. They let them out. It's you. They want your farm. They want your ranch.
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:43.960]  They're called all the time gunning families down to get their property. They're coming. They're coming to kill you. They want to kill you and your family.
[2:19:43.960 --> 2:20:07.960]  I'm not joking. We'll be right back.
[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:30.960]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library,

[2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:16.960]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, executive order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:23.960]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business. The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[2:21:23.960 --> 2:21:26.960]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.

[2:22:47.960 --> 2:22:57.960]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods. I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:23:03.960]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce and it has now finally caught up with us.
[2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:09.960]  In the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:17.960]  It's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:24.960]  Remember our trade deficit? Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:31.960]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[2:23:31.960 --> 2:23:58.960]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com.
[2:23:58.960 --> 2:24:06.960]  Folks, if I sound angry, even an act, I can barely contain myself, not knocking holes on the wall, overthrowing things.
[2:24:06.960 --> 2:24:13.960]  I see police now and I become nauseous. I can't sleep, I can't enjoy my life because you know what, I know they've built death camps.
[2:24:13.960 --> 2:24:22.960]  It's in the mainstream news. I know the people that run our country put Saddam into power, put Mao into power, put Hitler into power, put Lenin into power.
[2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:30.960]  I know they want power and control and now they've brainwashed our poor police and they've brought back hundreds of thousands of troops to become police that were all brainwashed.
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:35.960]  One in ten college grads is going to be Homeland Security related. They admit they're spying on all Americans.
[2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:47.960]  I mean, this is classical tyranny. John Yu writes memos and then gets, you know, top chairmanship at major colleges saying they can torture a two-year-old with pliers sexually.
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:57.960]  I mean, look, torturing children sexually is wrong. I can't believe I've even, I'm in a twilight zone. Aaron Zelman, do you ever feel like you're in a twilight zone episode?
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:05.960]  I mean, do you understand the feelings I'm having? They're normal, healthy instincts. I have to control myself, not out of fear because I want to see the end.
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:11.960]  I want to go through it. I want to see them go to hot war so I can, you know, defend myself. But at the other side, I don't.
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:18.960]  I like, have to control my instinct to flee, you know, to get my family out of here. Is this Nazi Germany? Is this Soviet Russia?
[2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:21.960]  I mean, do you see the thing I'm saying here, Aaron?
[2:25:21.960 --> 2:25:29.960]  Well, I think for any of us who have a little gray hair and remember Barry Goldwater, this is not the America that we were raised in.
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:37.960]  I'm not sure what this country is anymore. But no, you're right. In other words, there's something is extremely wrong in this country.
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:44.960]  They've been very clever in bringing about in a gradual way. But as some people say, we're approaching the endgame.
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:58.960]  I'm not trying to be alarmist. There's something very wrong in this country when we have the legislation that's being put forth to destroy freedoms to spy on people.
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:03.960]  When you have the NRA who's made it very clear they don't want to abolish the ATF.
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:10.960]  When you have Congress people who Congress Critters call what you will, they really don't care whether you write them or not.
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:12.960]  And by the way, that's what you say.
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:15.960]  By the way, the BATF is ballooning in size right now.
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:27.960]  That it is. And it's really, in fact, all of government is, you know, government has been at all levels of government is getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[2:26:27.960 --> 2:26:34.960]  And now they tell us that our dollar's gone. We're totally devalued. That's it. They're just going to take everything we've gotten when we scream.
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:36.960]  They're going to blow our heads off.
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:44.960]  Well, maybe in other words, there's a lot of, there's some unknowns.
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:51.960]  We don't know who's really in charge of the computers, who's willing to hack them if that's possible at all.
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:57.960]  We really don't know what some people have been planning to do that are pro-freedom.
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:26:59.960]  So there's some unknowns out there.
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:05.960]  Although I don't want to give anybody any false impressions that anything good's going to happen.
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:07.960]  I don't want to mislead anybody.
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:12.960]  But we're facing a situation that is, I'm surprised we even have this conversation.
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:15.960]  I never thought we've had a conversation like this 20 years ago.
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:20.960]  But here we are talking about America or what used to be America.
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:24.960]  No, there's no doubt they're going for hot war on the people.
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:27.960]  And they're ratcheting it up, but it's not incremental anymore.
[2:27:27.960 --> 2:27:31.960]  It's huge, I mean, going back to the John U memos.
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:36.960]  How does the White House say we torture little children with pliers, rip their genitals off?
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:41.960]  I mean, what the hell? What the hell, man? I want them all arrested now.
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:49.960]  I'm pissed, man. I'm pissed. I want these sacks of murder and trash out of my government.
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:56.960]  And how dare the police with relish and demonic looks in their faces enjoy destroying our liberties?
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:00.960]  Why are they going along with it, Aaron? Is it just their mindless power trips?
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:02.960]  I don't know. It's beyond that.
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:08.960]  I think that, you know, if you give somebody the, as pointed out in this little book called Ordinary Men,
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:12.960]  encourage people to go buy a copy. It's probably 12 bucks in the stores.
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:17.960]  You will learn that once a person is given a badge and some power,
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:21.960]  they will then follow through and do whatever they're told to do.
[2:28:21.960 --> 2:28:25.960]  With a rare exception, when you find someone who says no thank you and walk away,
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:27.960]  assuming he's not shot in the back.
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:30.960]  And so this is what we have in America today.
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:34.960]  If you look at these people who are at the airport, the Homeland Security goons,
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:41.960]  that these are, most of these people are really just average people who've been given a badge and some power and authority,
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:45.960]  and they will use it and abuse it to the fullest extent possible.
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:47.960]  And that's human nature.
[2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:52.960]  Well, the feds admit that's to train us for this on the streets and now they're doing that.
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:56.960]  I mean, I'm tired of people coming up to me wanting my papers or checkpoints.
[2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:59.960]  I mean, I'm getting, I just can't believe it, Aaron.
[2:28:59.960 --> 2:29:06.960]  Well, I would suggest to all of your listeners that maybe you can help them along this road,
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:10.960]  but everybody really needs to get their hands on a little camera, a video camera.
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:16.960]  And they need to start creating some footage, B-roll as it's called, I think.
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:18.960]  And they need to start making it available.
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:22.960]  You know, they're the best way to deal with this issue is to shine a light a day on it.
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:26.960]  Stay there, Aaron. I agree. I want to give out the website how people get involved with your group.
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:29.960]  Any key points you want to talk about? I'm sorry I'm blowing up.
[2:29:29.960 --> 2:29:32.960]  I just feel trapped, folks. I know it's evil. I know what's going to happen.
[2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:35.960]  I told you what would happen in the past. It's bad, folks.
[2:29:35.960 --> 2:29:37.960]  They're going to kill millions of us.
[2:29:37.960 --> 2:29:41.960]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:41.960 --> 2:29:47.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:47.960 --> 2:29:52.960]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:57.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:29:57.960 --> 2:29:59.960]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[2:29:59.960 --> 2:30:02.960]  What their objective being world domination?
[2:30:02.960 --> 2:30:05.960]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:08.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:13.960]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:30:16.960 --> 2:30:21.960]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:25.960]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:28.960]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:30:28.960 --> 2:30:31.960]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:33.960]  They're after power. That's their after-easy.

[2:30:47.960 --> 2:30:52.960]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[2:30:52.960 --> 2:30:58.960]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[2:30:58.960 --> 2:31:05.960]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.

[2:31:47.960 --> 2:31:50.960]  Hemp, the super food for you and your family.
[2:31:50.960 --> 2:31:54.960]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[2:31:54.960 --> 2:31:57.960]  Hemp, used for food, clothing and shelter since time began.
[2:31:57.960 --> 2:32:04.960]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers but legal to import.
[2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:08.960]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[2:32:08.960 --> 2:32:12.960]  The protein powder, seeds and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:23.960]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids and nutrients not available in other plants.
[2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:28.960]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:30.960]  Could this be the government's best kept secret?
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:37.960]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds and oil can do for you.

[2:32:57.960 --> 2:33:16.960]  Stanford, Princeton, they've all done famous studies where they found more than 90% of graduate students, people that already have degrees, intelligent, would shock someone to death.
[2:33:16.960 --> 2:33:33.960]  They believed it was real. They hired actors and in a jail situation they were told that incrementally it took about a day to do it that 90 plus percent was about 8% in one study, about 5% in another said no, you can pull these up.
[2:33:33.960 --> 2:33:39.960]  There's even film footage of them doing it and they would flip a switch and have the fake smoke come out and they were murdering them.
[2:33:39.960 --> 2:33:47.960]  And that's the problem. Most people are followers and it was 5% that beat the British government.
[2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:55.960]  We had a lot of supporters also in England at the time by the way and it's going to be 5% of us that beat it again.
[2:33:55.960 --> 2:34:00.960]  And look, the time for denying this is going on is over.
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:11.960]  Aaron Zellman, JPFO.org, just preservation of firearms ownership works closely with Gunners of America, a real Second Amendment group, both of them.
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:24.960]  The answer to my question though, do you feel, not just intellectually, it tells me we're in grave danger that it's really coming to the head, but in my gut, which has never been wrong, when I was younger I didn't follow my gut, I've learned to listen to it because it's always right.
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:34.960]  My gut tells me, I mean, this is as bad as it could get, that the diabolical people, and don't think it goes away when Bush leaves, it's going to get worse, folks, gets worse with each president.
[2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:43.960]  The corporate interest and all their documents I have and what they're planning, they plan to take all the pension funds, the stock market, everything, and when people riot, they're just going to gun us down.
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:52.960]  They've got microwave guns, Sunshine Project, got congressional secret documents, they have helicopters with knockout gas positioned in every city for at least a decade.
[2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:59.960]  I mean, they're planning some really bad stuff, Aaron, and I guess the average cop listing is going to follow orders when it happens.
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:03.960]  Well, his pension comes first, so yes, he's going to follow orders.
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:20.960]  I'm not anti-police, I'm not anti-peace officer, but I'm very much concerned about law enforcement officers, LEOs, because they will enforce the law, that's all they care about is enforcing the law, and the law to them is not the bill of rights.
[2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:31.960]  So you're right, in other words, there are some nasty people afoot, and as I told you probably a year and a half ago, I'm not so sure we'll even have elections, but we'll find out.
[2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:33.960]  Hopefully I'm wrong.
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:35.960]  Well, I don't think it'll make any difference at this point.
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:37.960]  What does your gut tell you, Aaron?
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:46.960]  Well, my gut tells me that there is a great deal of evil afoot and that the American people would be wise to prepare for the worst.
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:36:00.960]  Well, you know, there's a line from the Godfather that, I forget the exact line, that women and children have the luxury of not worrying and running around and having fun, but men don't, and men particularly should have the intellect, the history, the instincts.
[2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:06.960]  And I just look at my family, I'm like, this is such a great country, there's so many good things involved.
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:18.960]  And people see the facade of the pretty green hills and the blue sky, and they think everything's going to, it's not, I mean, they are, it's not Alex Jones saying it 10 years ago, or Aaron's element saying it 10, 12 years ago.
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:25.960]  It's the Houston Chronicles saying, yeah, we've built camps for illegals and for American citizens, and it's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:36.960]  It says Bush is dictator and can take over the states and arrest whoever he wants, and they won't let Homeland Security Committee and Congress see the continuity of government plan.
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:49.960]  The cover sheet says the president's a dictator, and I see police everywhere, running around and cameras going up, and they admit they're spying on all of us, and it's all just so a bunch of bankers and elitists can own everything.
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:59.960]  Well, let me just mention the cameras, if you don't mind. One of the bright sides of this whole thing is, you know, England has gone to cameras, if I can put it that way.
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:09.960]  They have surveillance cameras everywhere. After doing this for about two or three years, they've come to a conclusion, these cameras are not terribly efficient.
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:14.960]  They've spent a fortune of millions of pounds, and they're not getting their money's worth.
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:18.960]  Billions of pounds and crimes exploded, 10 million cameras in the country.
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:22.960]  So, you know, these surveillance cameras are not everything that the government's hoping they would be.
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:26.960]  And by the way, it's the control loss.
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:37.960]  Let me share something with you. In a fictional book that I wrote, a co-authored that called Out of the Grey Zone, there were cameras everywhere, and you know what people did?
[2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:46.960]  They wore great big floppy hats. You couldn't see their face. So I just share that with you for what it's worth.
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:49.960]  By the way, they've started that in London, and a lot of people wear hoods now.
[2:37:49.960 --> 2:37:50.960]  Hoods? Well, yeah.
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:38:09.960]  And the police were talking about not letting people wear hoods. Did you see the New York Times article where they said that it's up 44% nationwide, the tattletail lines, and that grandmothers are turning in grandsons for warrants, for speeding tickets, and marijuana, saying I need $500?
[2:38:09.960 --> 2:38:22.960]  Well, that comes with the territory. You're going to see a lot of that. The government's going to encourage that, and so be careful who you talk to and make sure you know who your true friends really are.
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:28.960]  Well, that brings me to the next thing. You said the break, shine a light, be out in the open, be bold, or it's over, they win.
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:42.960]  But you're saying also be careful who you talk to. The key is that if you are doing something quasi-illegal and everything is now, don't let the idiot neighbor know. But shouldn't we all be bold about the tyranny right now, or they're going to win?
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:39:00.960]  I think that to quote John Ross, who wrote the book on intended consequences, hide in plain sight. In other words, be out front, make as much noise as you can, because if you're missing, someone will notice it right away.
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:06.960]  If you're quiet and hiding in the corner, being the usual ghetto coward, when you're missing, no one will notice.
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:15.960]  Now, I want you to briefly tell, and you've got a book, at least last time I checked, you sell about this, The Battle for Athens, and that's a real story, and then what unintended consequences covered?
[2:39:15.960 --> 2:39:34.960]  Well, we don't have the book Battle for Athens anymore. It's sold out, but it is on our website. In 1946, when World War II GIs came back to Athens, Tennessee, that's in McMinn County of Tennessee, they were greeted with what some of their loved ones had been writing them.
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:46.960]  They were greeted with a bunch of goons who were running the city and who were locking people up until they paid money to get out of jail, and all kinds of criminal activities.
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:59.960]  The GIs created the GI party and ran for elections, and ran for public office and won. But before they could take office, the ballot boxes were stolen by the corrupt sheriff.
[2:39:59.960 --> 2:40:09.960]  He took it to the jail. He said, we'll have an honest count, a real honest election. Make a long story short, the GIs had a resort to using their firearms that they had brought back.
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:18.960]  Farmers came in with their shotguns and such, and 800 bullets were sent into that jail, and the sheriff finally surrendered.
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:23.960]  One more thing had to be done. They had a dynamite off the front door, and that was done.
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:29.960]  The sheriff called the governor, asked him to sign up for the National Guard, and the governor laughed at him.
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:37.960]  He said, if you think the National Guard is going to come shoot at World War II veterans, you're crazy. And the sheriff indeed was crazy. He was replaced.
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:39.960]  Today they call in 18 war hogs.
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:49.960]  That's on our website, and that happened, and so it's called the Battle of Athens, Athens, Tennessee, and we encourage people to come to our website, apfo.org, and read about it.
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:53.960]  It's what real Americans did when they were confronted with tyranny.
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:59.960]  Twice in Texas, Reconstruction went on for a decade. It was really abusive, no matter what side of that war you were on.
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:13.960]  And I had ancestors, in fact, one of them who led the operation, and they came into the court, fired at it with cannons, the Capitol, and removed the carpet bag and governors, and kicked them out.
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:28.960]  Well, that's what happened in the Battle of Athens. So again, it's at JPFO.org. We encourage people to stop by and just go to our search engine, put in Battle of Athens, and these articles will pop up, and I think you'll find it fascinating.
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:40.960]  We encourage people to send it around the country, download, make copies of it, do whatever you can to show Americans what true Americans have done in the past to preserve freedom.
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:49.960]  Well, Aaron, the number I've got is more like 100 million gun owners, but let's say it's 80 million gun owners, but we're seeing a reassergence of people going out, women going out, guns.
[2:41:49.960 --> 2:42:02.960]  But let's say 1% of 80 million fight back. That's 800,000. Everything that they wrote about, that he wrote about it, unintended consequences, seems like that's where we're going. Tell folks about that book.
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:23.960]  Well, as best as I remember it, because I didn't write it, I just read it, like a lot of other people, but the book is probably a five or six hundred or seven hundred page novel about people getting tired of the ATF and other government agencies and taking their country back by taking action.
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:42.960]  There's an expression in the book, it's called, It's Time to Feed the Hogs, and I'll let you peel that onion as to what you're going to feed the hogs. But it's an interesting book, and it's been around for a number of years, but if you can, at the moment, I forget the name of the publisher.
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:45.960]  Didn't they harass him for the book?
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:43:06.960]  Well, in fact, in our film called The Gang, we interviewed John Ross, and he finally had to offer a $10,000 reward for the names and defecations of the ATF agents who tried to harass booksellers at gun shows, try to convince them not to sell the book.
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:22.960]  There's always been a lawless group of Kurds, for those that don't know, they were the ones that would go around raping and killing at all the little whiskey brewers, the moonshine makers, because people were poor, starving in Tennessee and North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, everywhere, Alabama, Florida.
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:41.960]  And they were the first federal officers, and after federal marshals, and they would run around, shaking you down, stealing your money, stealing your whiskey, because you hadn't paid the tax, and there were also rebellions against them, because back then you couldn't find anybody in the government who would go out and rob people and snitch and tattle.
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:47.960]  Americans wouldn't do that back then, and so they have always been the cream of the scum, haven't they, Aaron?
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:59.960]  Well, as far as we know, there may be something worse, but we know them to be thugs and to engage in criminal acts, and they're very proud of it.
[2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:20.960]  Now, again, on our film, The Gang, in fact, there's a trailer on YouTube called The Gang trailer, or trailer for The Gang, I forget which one we call it, but you can actually see an ATF supervisory official telling ATF agents to lie in court.
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:39.960]  That's documented. We've seen a bunch of federal court cases now where they say the Constitution is inadmissible and banned from the court, and there was just a case in New York where the Mayor Bloomberg has got a gag order on the term Second Amendment.
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:54.960]  Well, Mayor Bloomberg's a good example of greed personified, and he's no credit to America, and it's really disgraceful. He considers himself to be a Jew.
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:45:11.960]  Isn't this a self-fulfilling process? They say there's terrorists everywhere. They spend tens of billions a year to fight terrorists domestically. They're training the neighbors to spy on each other. The local FBI calls anti-terror meetings with locals, then says, tell us if your neighbor's going to marijuana.
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:26.960]  They're gearing up, they're arming, the military industrial complex owns the red light cameras, they raise the money now, Lockheed and others, and they know they're going to push, push, push, push, push, then we're going to fight back, and they're going to tell the cops, see, there's terrorists everywhere.
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:34.960]  You know, there is a solution to this whole problem, and I think I sent you a DVD about, it's called Take Your Money Back, and I won't go into a great deal about it.
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:36.960]  Well, go ahead, plug the DVD.
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:38.960]  Pardon me?
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:39.960]  I mean, tell us about it.
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:46:01.960]  All right, well, I decided to come up with a solution to a problem. I think it's doable, and people have to realize that this reality, if money is power, then as long as the government can continue to take our money, confiscate it through taxation, they'll always have the power to take more money and to destroy the American people.
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:14.960]  So I think one of the things that we have a short period of time to do is to organize people and to create a national movement, as I call it, Take Your Money Back, and we created a little DVD.
[2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:30.960]  It's $4.95 postage paid, and we also set up a website called TakeYourMoneyBack.com, and I think we have a solution to the problem if, big if, but if we can make it a national movement.
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:41.960]  We can defund the United States government without people going to jail, and it's possible that this is all possible to do, but it has to be a national movement.
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:43.960]  What's the program? Not pay taxes?
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:55.960]  Well, what you do is you educate your neighbors to how taxes are destroying them financially, and you appeal to people's greed, and you get people on board who are going to say, I don't want to do that.
[2:46:55.960 --> 2:47:03.960]  Well, that's already happened. We already have something like 35 to 45 debated non-filers, and they say it's growing exponentially.
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:18.960]  Well, we're not talking about non-filing, because that's something the government can come after you with. We're showing people how their money is being stolen, and how the average American could accumulate a half a million to a million dollars if it wasn't for the federal income tax.
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:25.960]  So we're not going to tell people to go do something that is considered illegal, although I think it's morally correct, but the government says it's illegal.
[2:47:25.960 --> 2:47:28.960]  You're just educating them how we're financing our own destruction.
[2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:29.960]  Exactly.
[2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:30.960]  Then they make their decision.
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:36.960]  So I would encourage people, if you don't mind, send them to takeyourmoneyback.com as well as JVFO.org.
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:43.960]  Aaron, we really appreciate you. We need to get you a show here on the network on the weekend or something, because your knowledge is so great, and we really appreciate you.
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:51.960]  You know, I really am getting to the freakout point, though, because I want to screw around. I want to joke around. I want to go bowling with the guys. I want to take my kids fishing.
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:58.960]  And all I can think about is this now, because I know we're coming towards the end of the finish line, and I'm just so mad at the police. I don't even dislike them.
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:05.960]  I'm just disgusted with government. I can't believe it's this bad. I can't believe my wife had a baby four months ago.
[2:48:05.960 --> 2:48:06.960]  Congratulations.
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:17.960]  Oh, you bet. I mean, it's wonderful. She had the baby, and I can't believe that they sit there now into a database right to CPS, and they ask you to leave the room, and then they ask the wife, is he beating you?
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:24.960]  You know, we're all guilty into proven innocent. Secret police are everywhere. This country is a cesspit.
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:29.960]  Well, all the more reason to defund the government by taking our money back.
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:42.960]  But, I mean, it's archetypal bad. It's like they've made a list of every tyrannical activity, every despotic activity, and they've marked and checked each one, and are overdoing each one more than any.
[2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:43.960]  I mean, it's insane.
[2:48:43.960 --> 2:48:54.960]  Well, it's only because I think that they think they can get away with it. In other words, the American people, and let's be honest, a lot of American people come under the category of fat, dumb, and happy.
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:55.960]  Dumb as a box of rocks.
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:49:05.960]  And so, that's a good expression. It's really accurate. And so, you know, well, dumb feels good, so that's why they're dumb.
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:17.960]  But I think there are others of us. You know, there are people out there like us who are not dumb, and we're being overwhelmed, not so much by the evil, but by the apathy and stupidity of some of our neighbors.
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:21.960]  I mean, the real danger in this country is people who won't do anything.
[2:49:21.960 --> 2:49:28.960]  Well, Aaron, I'll tell you what freaks me out. All the squad car videos that are coming out are people planting cameras, like you said, in their own cars and catching it.
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:33.960]  I mean, there's like 10 a day. I don't even watch them all. I don't like enjoy it. I can't make myself watch them anymore.
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:39.960]  I get too upset, and I can't be upset all the time. And where they just plant drugs on people for no reason.
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:48.960]  I mean, it's getting worse. And I mean, how does a cop frame somebody? I mean, even normal criminals aren't that bad. I mean, I don't understand.
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:57.960]  Well, they're trained. I mean, you ask how well they're trained. I mean, if they did this on their own without permission, they could get in trouble.
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:01.960]  Or if someone wasn't going to look the other way. So they're trained to do it.
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:07.960]  Well, I know the whole Dallas Department, which again is our money being used to train people to destroy us.
[2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:10.960]  Well, I use this example because there's thousands, but I use the one that's well known.
[2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:18.960]  Did you hear about Dallas where the whole narcotics squad was doing it? They had low level police doing it. And then the lab certified it and the deputy chief certified.
[2:50:18.960 --> 2:50:25.960]  They just pulled nice cars over, dropped a bag of chalk in, seized the cars. I mean, it's just bandits, period.
[2:50:25.960 --> 2:50:34.960]  Well, that's why I'm encouraging people to get out those video cameras. Let's get them up on YouTube and let's try to wake up millions of Americans.
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:44.960]  Oh, God. Aaron Zelman, stay there. I got a few other questions for you on the other side. Folks, when tyranny comes, it's never pretty.
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:46.960]  And I think it's going to be the worst ever here in this country.
[2:50:48.960 --> 2:50:52.960]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:57.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:03.960]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:51:03.960 --> 2:51:16.960]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:25.960]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:33.960]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their aptitude.

[2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:57.960]  The election cycle draws near and we don't have much time left. If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[2:51:57.960 --> 2:52:11.960]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason. The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging, educating and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:19.960]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[2:52:19.960 --> 2:52:26.960]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices, be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[2:52:26.960 --> 2:52:34.960]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since freedom to fascism and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:44.960]  We invite you to make the change. Help take back our government now. Go to TakeBackWashington.com and get the tools you need for the information war. We have a plan to take back our government.

[2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:28.960]  We're streaming live on PrisonPlanet.tv for all our PrisonPlanet.tv members and up on the screen I'm going to post a computer feed image of the armored vehicle with the SWAT team guys from the Polygamous Compound.
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:43.960]  We're streaming live on PrisonPlanet.tv for all our PrisonPlanet.tv members and up on the screen I'm going to post a computer feed image of the armored vehicle with the SWAT team guys from the Polygamous Compound.
[2:54:43.960 --> 2:55:03.960]  We're streaming live on PrisonPlanet.tv for all our PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and up on the screen I'm going to post a computer feed image of the armored vehicle with the SWAT team guys from the Polygamous Compound.

[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:58.960]  We're streaming live on PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and up on the screen I'm going to post a computer feed image of the armored vehicle with the SWAT team guys from the Polygamous Compound.
[2:55:58.960 --> 2:56:13.960]  We're streaming live on PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and up on the screen I'm going to post a computer feed image of the armored vehicle with the SWAT team guys from the Polygamous Compound.
[2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:29.960]  What is the purpose of having violent criminals on the U.S. government payroll?
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:44.960]  Well, it would be interesting if we opened up the American prisons considering all the innocent people there. I'm afraid the government's afraid to do that when you think about it.
[2:56:44.960 --> 2:56:49.960]  We have so many innocent people have been thrown into prison. The government doesn't want to open our prisons.
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:57:02.960]  Oh my God, it's true. I remember seeing these on tanks. The Midland Sheriff's Department has kills on it. In World War II they put how many zeros or measure smits or folk wolves had been shot down.
[2:57:02.960 --> 2:57:12.960]  The image I've got up right now is a mainstream photo. I remember seeing this in the newspaper. I'm going to ask my computer operator where he got it and it's got kills on it.
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:22.960]  It says the vehicle is a, and the guy gave me his number. Have this guy call in. Go ahead and call this guy. The vehicle is a USM113 APC. I'm a veteran Army tank driver.
[2:57:22.960 --> 2:57:32.960]  Notice the kill marks painted on the top hold. Two pedestrians, one car. You do this to display your combat kills. And notice the coward snipers.
[2:57:32.960 --> 2:57:41.960]  We used to shoot enemy snipers on site. They were considered cowards and dishonorable. Now they are the favorite sons of the military and police. What do you think of that?
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:54.960]  Well, of course they are. But you know, this is a, to be quite blunt about it. I told people on your program two or three years ago to master the use of a long range rifle.
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:57:56.960]  God help us. Just God help us.
[2:57:56.960 --> 2:58:00.960]  I don't know if anybody listened to me two or three years ago, but I'm saying it again.
[2:58:00.960 --> 2:58:06.960]  Aaron Zelman, Jews, the preservation of firearms ownership. Give them the website. Tell folks how they can join.

[2:59:40.960 --> 2:59:51.960]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:51.960 --> 3:00:09.960]  He died the police department show on Discovery Channel. Had to be 10 years ago. And it showed police wearing hockey masks with devil horns. And they said that was for intimidation. I mean now they're going to run around in devil outfits. That's what the bad guys always do.
[3:00:09.960 --> 3:00:23.960]  I'm looking at the Midland County Sheriff's armored vehicle. Treaded armored vehicle. And I remember seeing this on the news and wondering what it was. I didn't put two of them together. But it is. It's kills. They've got how many U.S. citizens they've murdered.
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:36.960]  And I know a lot of these SWAT teams are just guys like to kill people. And I've seen famous video. I saw it here in Austin after they killed a guy they were doing high fives. And man we're just gone folks. We're gone, gone, gone, gone.
[3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:43.960]  Aaron Zellman what do you think about them having how many U.S. citizens they've killed on the side of their armored vehicle, their tank?
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:54.960]  Well first I've heard of it but obviously it's shocking. But at the same time it's a sign of the times. We're confronted by police who see us as the enemy.
[3:00:54.960 --> 3:01:02.960]  And I think that I don't know what it's going to take to get to the majority of the American people to say no more. We're not going to finance this.
[3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:17.960]  Have you seen any of the hundreds? You guys are fired, yeah. I agree. Have you seen any of the hundreds of videos where it shows U.S. military killing dogs, throwing people over things, shooting random cars up and back dead and laughing?
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:23.960]  I've seen some of them, yes, yes. I mean what is their, I mean that is insane.
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:34.960]  Well maybe it's because we're putting felons into uniforms. Maybe it's because we're putting people into uniforms who enjoy violence in Mayhem.
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:41.960]  And we want to train them so we can bring them back here to give them a job. Maybe Blackwater wants to hire them.
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:47.960]  Well God bless you Aaron Zellman. I want to get you up more often than once a year. I'd like to get you up for a couple hours to take calls the next few weeks.
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:59.960]  Give out that number again. Our office number is 262-673-9745 on the website, JPFO.org where you can learn more about the Battle of Athens.
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:03.960]  You can learn more about the collusion between the NRA and the ATF.
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:08.960]  And everybody and regardless of who you or Jen Tal can join. Aaron thanks for coming on with us.
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  Thank you very much Alex.
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:14.960]  Take care. I hope we're talking again in a few months. Take care. Let's go ahead. Thank you Aaron.
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:19.960]  Let's go ahead and bring up Gary in Colorado who we put the photo up on the video feed. He's watching.
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:27.960]  I've since then gone and looked on another computer that is on all the photos and it is. They have their kills on the side of the tank.
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:34.960]  And I remember seeing those from World War II in Korea and Vietnam and Iraq. Now they put kills on the tanks.
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:38.960]  Again the military kills enemies. We have a militarized police. We're the enemy. We die.
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:41.960]  Gary tell us about this as a tanker.
[3:02:41.960 --> 3:02:43.960]  Oh hi Alex. How are you?
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:44.960]  Good.
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:49.960]  Yeah I'll give you a little background. I was a U.S. Army tank crewman.
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:57.960]  I drove those vehicles M113 and M60 main battle tanks for the United States Army in the early 1980s.
[3:02:57.960 --> 3:03:09.960]  And it was a common practice and has been for a very long time to kind of brag about your combat victories by painting a kill mark on the side of your tank.
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:14.960]  Every time you scored a hit or a kill.
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:23.960]  I found that image. That image by the way credits back to Google images but that image was released right after the raid took place at the church.
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:26.960]  It hit all the media hours.
[3:03:26.960 --> 3:03:38.960]  But when I finally got a chance to look very closely at that armored vehicle I was kind of shocked that police agencies are now painting kill marks on the side of their tracked vehicles.
[3:03:38.960 --> 3:03:42.960]  Good God. It's over. They're just...
[3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:55.960]  Yeah it was pretty bizarre. It's actually pretty bizarre actually looking at the way those individuals went in armed to raid a church full of women and children.
[3:03:55.960 --> 3:03:58.960]  I'm kind of speechless.
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:08.960]  But for those that don't know we're going to hold you over during the break and check Baldwin on after in the main show. I've got the image up. I've got the pointer on the web pointing right where they are.
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:10.960]  People can go find this for themselves.
[3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:16.960]  Bob who's in there running the show. What was your search to pull this up?
[3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:18.960]  Armored vehicle what?
[3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:25.960]  I want to be able to write search to find this. I can find a bunch of photos that have the kills on it. What is it?
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:28.960]  Okay Gary sent this to us. Gary what was the search you did to pull this?
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:34.960]  Oh I just went into Google images and put in Texas church raid.
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:45.960]  Yeah Texas church raid and it'll come up and I just did share of SWAT vehicle and it came up. Stay there. We're going to talk during this break.
[3:04:45.960 --> 3:04:49.960]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[3:04:49.960 --> 3:04:54.960]  In the near future Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:04:54.960 --> 3:04:57.960]  It's known as the builder bird.
[3:04:57.960 --> 3:05:00.960]  What their objective being world domination?
[3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:03.960]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[3:05:03.960 --> 3:05:13.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:05:13.960 --> 3:05:19.960]  For the first time in history the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:23.960]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:05:23.960 --> 3:05:26.960]  America is making great progress toward the world government.
[3:05:26.960 --> 3:05:30.960]  Most people have no idea they're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[3:07:24.960 --> 3:07:43.960]  Best of all, you can be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less. It's that simple. Just go to www.orderfreetv.com. That's www.orderfreetv.com. To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[3:07:54.960 --> 3:08:01.960]  Yeah, during the breaks I went and checked and it's accurate and I blew it up here at the prisonplanet.tv viewers that are watching us live right now.
[3:08:01.960 --> 3:08:17.960]  The large armored, treaded APC, the USM113 APC that the black ski mask police drove to go into the polygamous compound to violate or do process rights, regardless of what you think of the group.
[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:25.960]  It has two kills on it. And we got an army tanker. He was in there in the 80s in Germany calling in to say, yeah, that's the kills.
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:32.960]  And I know our troops in Iraq put kills on and that's how they look. They'll show a vehicle. They'll show an armored vehicle. They'll show people.
[3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:42.960]  And this has got two kills on one side of it. You can look at other photos. It's there. We've got it blown up for people. In fact, I'll even blow it up even more for folks here.
[3:08:42.960 --> 3:08:50.960]  But I mean, this is just absolutely amazing. We're about to go to Chuck Baldwin.
[3:08:50.960 --> 3:08:56.960]  He's the presidential candidate for the Constitution Party and a great guy I've interviewed many times.
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:08:59.960]  He's, of course, a radio show right here on this network and others.
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:09.960]  A great guy. We wish Ron Paul was running, but hey, when he, you know, went in there after the convention, which he said yesterday he wasn't going to be, you heard him, then we need to support Chuck Baldwin.
[3:09:09.960 --> 3:09:15.960]  We're about to go to him. But anything else you want to add, Gary?
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:27.960]  Well, Alex, I just find it really extremely disturbing. I mean, I don't have any delusions about what this government has turned into and what the police agencies role in this are going to be.
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:31.960]  I'm completely realistic about what's happening.
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:42.960]  But I do find it disturbing to the degree that these people are uparming. They're uparming far beyond anything that would be within the description of domestic police activity.
[3:09:42.960 --> 3:09:52.960]  You don't need tanks and assault rifles and body armor and Kevlar helmets and 50 caliber sniper rifles.
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:10:03.960]  And, you know, I mean, you don't need that for normal police duty. You need that if you're preparing for war.
[3:10:03.960 --> 3:10:17.960]  Plain and simple. That's warfare equipment. That is implements of war. That's stuff that I, as an individual, would need a class three license to own most of that gear.
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:24.960]  And right there are our citizens they've murdered, citizens they've killed. They're proud of killing the enemy.
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:32.960]  And there they are displaying it for everybody to see. God help us, ladies and gentlemen. God help us is all I can say.
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:35.960]  Well, thank you for the info, Gary. Thanks for calling in.
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:36.960]  No problem, Alex.
[3:10:36.960 --> 3:10:42.960]  You bet. Let's go ahead now and go to Chuck Baldwin. Chuck, thank you for coming on with us.
[3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:45.960]  You're a mighty welcome, Alex. Good to talk with you.
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:47.960]  What do you think of the story you just heard?
[3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:52.960]  Well, I was just catching the last few minutes of your conversation while I was waiting to come on.
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:55.960]  And that is disturbing.
[3:10:55.960 --> 3:11:05.960]  One of the things that I have written on as you have spoken on so well through your program over the years is the militarization of our local law enforcement.
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:15.960]  And I find that very disturbing. And if God smiles on our campaign and allows me to take the oath of office for president of these United States of America,
[3:11:15.960 --> 3:11:21.960]  that's one thing that my administration will put a serious curtailment upon.
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:36.960]  We believe that the Constitution of the United States does not provide for law enforcement to be conducted by the federal government on the most part.
[3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:40.960]  It's a local and state matter. We would certainly frown on the militarization of local and state police.
[3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:52.960]  We would encourage proper law enforcement at every level. And we would certainly not approve of things that happened back in Waco, Texas.
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:12:01.960]  I was kind of thinking of that as I was listening to your conversation and how those folks at Waco were killed by that attack by FBI and ATF agents and so forth.
[3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:05.960]  And that would never happen under my administration.
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:12.960]  They ran the American flag up over the place they'd burned down and they posed with human skulls.
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:18.960]  This was, I guess, their coming of manhood and they're not going to go over and fight insurgents in Iraq.
[3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:22.960]  I guess a lot of them are coming back from that. I guess they're going to fight us.
[3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:31.960]  Well, that's the impression that people are getting and I can understand the sentiment of the caller a minute ago that you were speaking with and his concern.
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:43.960]  One of the things that I think is very discouraging to the American people, and I share it, is the distrust that is developing between, especially the federal government and its citizens.
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:49.960]  That's one of the things that is very important to the security and the safety of our country.
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:55.960]  There must be a high degree of trust between the people and its government.
[3:12:55.960 --> 3:13:06.960]  And whenever we find a situation where there is that trust, not in evidence, that does not pretend good things for our country internally or abroad.
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:15.960]  And one of the things that I would seek to do would to have an administration that would be honest and transparent so that the American people could once again trust it.
[3:13:15.960 --> 3:13:25.960]  Well, again, I can't think of a finer person to be president. And regardless, you're going to inject real issues into the debate going across the country. You need people's support.
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:33.960]  We'll give out the campaign website and other contact info before you leave us. We want you to be able to check in with us as often as you can, sir, at least every few weeks, to let us know how things are going.
[3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:43.960]  Well, thank you, Mr. Baldwin. Again, Chuck Baldwin running for president on the Constitution Party. Got that nomination. He's there now.
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:54.960]  When police start wearing black ski masks, we always knew what it was for, but now documents have come out. The police chief in Boston, one of the suburbs, said that they wear the mask A to protect our identity and B to intimidate us.
[3:13:54.960 --> 3:14:01.960]  I mean, well, since when does the government want to scare us and, quote, hide who they are? I mean, is that land of the free home of the brave, sir?
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:16.960]  Right. No, that's not our tradition. That's not our heritage whatsoever. I think we have to recognize that over the years we have developed in this country a propensity to militarize our law enforcement.
[3:14:16.960 --> 3:14:22.960]  I think we've also had a propensity to globalize our institutions of government.
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:32.960]  Instead of looking out for the best interests of the United States, we seem to be concerned about international interest and global interest, and right down there where you are in Texas.
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:47.960]  I mean, you got this immigration situation that is absolutely disgraceful. Why in the world are we sending troops, including National Guard troops, to Iraq to guard the borders of that country while we leave the borders of the United States wide open?
[3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:58.960]  That just makes no sense whatsoever. You got the NAFTA Super Highway coming up from Mexico into your state and going up into the middle of our country and all the way up to Canada eventually.
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:15:08.960]  You know, you have the complete breakdown of law and order along the border. I mean, you talk about the potential of criminal activity, MS-13 coming across the border.
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:16.960]  We've got gun violence and even paramilitary and military violence right along the border with Mexico, with gang activity.
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:23.960]  Well, we have mass deaths, police being killed, but they won't send armored vehicles down there. Our troops are told to turn back and run.
[3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:28.960]  Our troops can't have ammo, but they can have ammo against us, the American people.
[3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:34.960]  All they're building the fence for is to keep us from getting out. They admit that the illegals are going to be allowed in under the SPP plan.
[3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:38.960]  What would you do if you were President Chuck Baldwin immediately?
[3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:47.960]  Because this is something you could do because Congress hasn't been allowed to see SPP be involved in it. It's all being done executively, so you could just rattle it from the executive.
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:56.960]  Absolutely. And the day that I'm sworn in as President, the SPP is dead. The North American Union is dead. The NAFTA Super Highway is dead.
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:07.960]  The NAFTA agreement is dead. The CAFTA agreement is dead. FTAA is dead. All of those issues are dead on arrival the day that I take the White House.
[3:16:07.960 --> 3:16:17.960]  We would put our National Guard troops on the border. We don't have to have a fence. I mean, I'm not opposed to the fence to secure the border, but I'm saying that we don't have to have a fence to secure the border.
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:26.960]  Well, what's happening with the fence is, I'm sorry, but you're right. They're building it maybe 100 miles. They built like 55 miles of it.
[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:32.960]  It's designed for, quote, animals to go under it, so it's got four-foot holes in it. I mean, it's a complete joke.
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:36.960]  What we need is to prosecute employers, and that'll shut it down real fast.
[3:16:36.960 --> 3:16:46.960]  Absolutely. That's the second plank of my platform in that regard. The first is to use our border patrol and our National Guard and any other force that we need to secure the border.
[3:16:46.960 --> 3:16:51.960]  I mean, we're going to shut it down. We're going to close the border. And then the second thing we're going to do is we're going to drop the money supply.
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:59.960]  And the way you do that is just by what you said, we're on the same page. I would aggressively prosecute any employer who hires illegal aliens.
[3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:07.960]  I mean, they don't pass code. They don't collect $200. They go straight to jail. When you shut down the food supply, the illegal aliens are going to go home.
[3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:09.960]  It's plainly that simple.
[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:18.960]  Exactly. Forget fences. That's only to keep us in. I mean, at the big crossing areas, I say building for security. But the key is go after the employers.
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:24.960]  Absolutely. And being willing to use whatever force is necessary on the border to keep people out.
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:34.960]  Oh, listen, that's what our military is for, as you know, is that when Mexican troops come across three miles and kidnap the sheriffs and drag a truck full of cocaine back across,
[3:17:34.960 --> 3:17:42.960]  immediately an airstrike is called in and those troops are all killed. And we've already had two wars with Mexico in like 20 scrimmages.
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:48.960]  They want to attack us again. I said we go all the way to Mexico City. I am tired of this country that hates our guts attacking us.
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:58.960]  Well, and then we have the Republican nominee, John McCain, who is going to be speaking to La Raza, which is an organization that is funded by people that actually believe that
[3:17:58.960 --> 3:18:08.960]  Mexico is going to retake the Southwestern United States for itself. I mean, these are people that are, that see a potential war situation developing.
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:12.960]  They actually want to reclaim the Southwestern U.S. for Mexico.
[3:18:12.960 --> 3:18:20.960]  No blacks and whites, no blacks and whites in their own charter, their motto, of course, you know this, for our race, everything goes outside the race.
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:26.960]  Nothing. Why doesn't he go talk to the Ku Klux Klan? I mean, their justice is tasteful, but they don't have 30 million members.
[3:18:26.960 --> 3:18:38.960]  Well, it's plainly pandering to a Hispanic element for votes. But the point is, does John McCain not realize the kind of people that are behind La Raza,
[3:18:38.960 --> 3:18:45.960]  does he not understand their agenda? And I'm out of belief that he does understand, and yet he's still willing to do this.
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:53.960]  And I think what this demonstrates is this international, I mean, he was just on the, I just heard him on CNN News a few hours ago, John McCain.
[3:18:53.960 --> 3:19:00.960]  And he was talking about how the people of Latin America and the United States have a common destiny. That was his quote, a common destiny.
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:08.960]  Now, where'd you get that from? That's not from the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence. That's not from any of our founding documents or sentiments of the founding fathers.
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:20.960]  What is this common destiny stuff? The United States of America is a free, independent and sovereign state. But people like John McCain want to merge us into a globalistic empire.
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:27.960]  Chuck Baldwin, stay with us. We'll give out campaign websites, contact points, phone numbers for folks that want to volunteer and get involved.
[3:19:27.960 --> 3:19:35.960]  Bottom line, whether you've got a snowball chance at hell or winning or not, you've got a chance of really injecting real issues and having a big effect.
[3:19:35.960 --> 3:19:44.960]  And I think you can get a lot of votes if people get behind you. I know Ron Paul would have. Chuck Baldwin.
[3:19:44.960 --> 3:19:49.960]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:19:49.960 --> 3:19:54.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:19:54.960 --> 3:19:59.960]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:19:59.960 --> 3:20:13.960]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:22.960]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:20:22.960 --> 3:20:25.960]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:20:25.960 --> 3:20:30.960]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. Yes, they're after easier.

[3:20:43.960 --> 3:20:54.960]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship. Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight. It's going to be incremental.
[3:20:54.960 --> 3:20:59.960]  This country is already teetering on the edge. Any incidents, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.

[3:21:45.960 --> 3:21:53.960]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:21:53.960 --> 3:22:04.960]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[3:22:04.960 --> 3:22:12.960]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[3:22:12.960 --> 3:22:18.960]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[3:22:18.960 --> 3:22:24.960]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:34.960]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future.

[3:23:53.960 --> 3:24:11.960]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed. Everybody knows the war is over. Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:27.960]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed. The poor stay poor. The rich get rich. That's how it goes. Everybody knows.
[3:24:27.960 --> 3:24:41.960]  We had Governor Jesse Ventura on for 50 minutes, huge breaking news on a senatorial run on a 9-11-million-inside job and a lot more.
[3:24:41.960 --> 3:25:00.960]  He was on immediately when the broadcast started. It's not posted anywhere yet. If you want the audio, it will be re-streamed at infowars.com right when the show ends.
[3:25:00.960 --> 3:25:15.960]  I know you like Alan. He seems like a nice guy. I know you don't want to say anything mean. I'm glad that you got it.
[3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:31.960]  Thank you very much. I was a little surprised and shocked at the margin of victory. Alan lobbied hard for the nomination. He brought in his staff at the convention there in Kansas City.
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:46.960]  They were holding delegates throughout the week and taking them up to the room and talking with them and lobbying them for their votes. A lot of work was done by them.
[3:25:46.960 --> 3:25:52.960]  Alan is a very articulate, intelligent, educated man. He's a great personality.
[3:25:52.960 --> 3:26:08.960]  He brought his message to the convention. While I and so many others appreciate his stand on abortion and things of that nature, it was his issues regarding foreign policy, etc.
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:22.960]  Some of the issues that you talk about all the time on your program, things that I write about in my columns, and the Constitution Party just could not accept it. When the vote was made, it was 74% for Chuck Baldwin and 24% for Alan Keyes.
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:28.960]  I won on the strength of the message. It wasn't personality. It was the message.
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:44.960]  I think that's a signal that all this fake conservative stuff's over. We're done. Can you believe McCain, an open border, pro-abortion, gun control, pro-war, new world border piece of trash, and that's who the Republican nominee is?
[3:26:44.960 --> 3:26:57.960]  I wrote in the column just a couple of days ago with Obama, Hillary, and McCain. What we have is three P's in a pod because really when you look at their policies and their positions, there's very little difference between them.
[3:26:57.960 --> 3:27:03.960]  I think that many of the Christians and many of the conservatives this year are looking for an alternative.
[3:27:03.960 --> 3:27:17.960]  You're running in the strongest year I've ever thought of for a Constitution Party, for a true conservative party. I know you've got Howard Phelps behind you with his big coalition. I want to get him on soon. Fire out your website for folks that want to get involved.
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:34.960]  Thank you very much, Alan, for letting me do that. It's Baldwin2008.com. That's Baldwin2008.com. We just had, just to let your audience know, we've had two retired Brigadier Generals that have officially endorsed our campaign.
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:51.960]  Brigadier General Charles Jones and Brigadier General Ben Parton have come out and publicly supported our campaign. They realize what's going on in this country that affects our military, and they are very proud and happy to support us, and we're excited about that.
[3:27:51.960 --> 3:28:02.960]  And I think that more of the military people, as they listen to us, as they hear us, they're going to like the message you're going to, because it's the message of truth. It's the message of the Founding Fathers. It's the message of freedom of independence.
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:17.960]  Well, that's now known as the message of Al Qaeda. I mean, I'm sure you've seen all the training manuals and news articles where they arrest you. You have an anti-UN sticker. The police are being trained that the Founding Fathers are bad. I mean, how do we ever get this far?
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:41.960]  Well, it's been about a half-century process. It started back in the late 50s, early 60s, as you know, and it's been increasingly intensifying since then. I think they've set a goal. They, the globalists, the New World Order types, have set a goal to have all this come to fruition by 2010 and then later 2015 to bring it all together.
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:29:00.960]  2010 for the Northern Hemisphere and then 2015 for the world. They want to bring America into this North American Union, very similar to the European Union, complete within a marrow, and Jerry Corsi, who supports us, has done Yeoman's work of research on this particular regard, and he's a great guy.
[3:29:00.960 --> 3:29:13.960]  And they want to bring that in by 2010. And if any of these three candidates, McCain or the two Democrats, get an office, it's going to be a reality. They're going to push it through. If I get in, we're going to stop it.
[3:29:13.960 --> 3:29:30.960]  Pastor Baldwin, stay there. I want to come back and give you just five more minutes on the side. I know you're busy. To give us your basic platform without me interrupting. Then I've got a bunch of news. I'm going to blitz through, ladies and gentlemen, that I haven't even gotten to with all these huge guests today. Ron Paul yesterday, Jesse Ventura today, Chuck Baldwin today.
[3:29:30.960 --> 3:29:45.960]  And it only gets better throughout this weekend next week. We'll be right back.
[3:29:45.960 --> 3:30:00.960]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more. Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[3:30:00.960 --> 3:30:11.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

[3:30:58.960 --> 3:31:09.960]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[3:31:09.960 --> 3:31:20.960]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[3:31:45.960 --> 3:31:53.960]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air. One child in 10 suffers from asthma. How can we improve the air we breathe?
[3:31:53.960 --> 3:32:13.960]  The answer is clear. Himalayan crystal salt lamps from Ionic salts. These lamps naturally improve indoor air quality without adding toxic ozone. Lighted Himalayan crystal salt lamps neutralize allergens and irritants in the air including dander, pollen, mold, and fungi and are effective in reducing symptoms of asthma, allergies, headaches, and airborne vapors from paint, furniture, and carpeting.
[3:32:13.960 --> 3:32:25.960]  Ionic salts provides premium quality lamps, handcrafted from salt, which has been in solid form for 215 million years. It is indeed a pristine piece of our planet containing no man-made chemicals or pollutants.
[3:32:25.960 --> 3:32:39.960]  Ionic salts is your place to find peace and pleasure, ambiance with benefits. Visit Ionic salts.com to see for yourself the true beauty of Himalayan crystal salt lamps, along with many other great purely natural products. That's I-O-N-I-C salts.com.
[3:32:39.960 --> 3:32:43.960]  Ionic salts. See the beauty. Breathe the difference.
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:22.960]  Two years ago I gave him my films that woke him up partially. Then he said his son made him watch loose change, woke him up all the way, and he's going public there.
[3:33:22.960 --> 3:33:31.960]  Shipping gears back to the Constitution Party presidential nominee. I couldn't think of a better one. And when I heard it was Alan Keyes before I was cringing.
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:40.960]  Acts nice, acts friendly. He's right on so many issues, but he's a neocon at heart. And I've just had enough of it. I've had it.
[3:33:40.960 --> 3:33:52.960]  And a true conservative, a true freedom fighter, a true American, a great writer, a great researcher, a great pastor. Chuck Baldwin. Chuck, in closing, give people your basic rundown.
[3:33:52.960 --> 3:33:57.960]  What you're going to be out there preaching the message of liberty, what your message is, what your platform is, what you would do.
[3:33:57.960 --> 3:34:05.960]  Thank you, Alex. Well, we would do what we said a moment ago. The first thing we would do is close that border. We would end illegal immigration.
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:15.960]  We would get out of the North American Union, the NAFTA Superhighway, get out of NAFTA, the FTE, the FTAA, the so-called free trade deals of their history.
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:26.960]  The New World Order comes crashing down the day that I take office. We would end a foreign aid, no more nation building, empire building, interventionism around the world.
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:36.960]  My goal would be to get America out of the United Nations entirely and get the United Nations out of America. We would get out of UNESCO.
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:48.960]  We would get out of NATO. We would do our best to overturn the 16th Amendment and the personal income tax. We would lead the charge to get rid of the Federal Reserve System.
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:56.960]  We would try to restore the Constitution, again, to America, limited government freedom. We would restore the Fourth Amendment.
[3:34:56.960 --> 3:35:06.960]  The Patriot Act is abysmal, this incessant spying and eavesdropping on American citizens without warrant, and the name of security is atrocious.
[3:35:06.960 --> 3:35:15.960]  It stops the day that I take office. We're going to restore constitutional government to America, Alex. We're going to store freedom to America.
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:19.960]  We're going to bring our troops home from Iraq. We're not just going to talk about it. We're going to do it.
[3:35:19.960 --> 3:35:29.960]  The next time we invade a country, we're going to have a declaration of war before we do it. We're not going to allow our troops to be the personal militia for the United Nations.
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:40.960]  We're going to protect America, our territory, our people. We're going to fight whenever it's necessary for our country, but we are not going to be tools for the United Nations anymore.
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:48.960]  We're going to protect what is our interest, not the interests of the United Nations and the global corporate leaders of this world.
[3:35:48.960 --> 3:35:56.960]  So we have a vision of freedom. It's the same vision that our founding fathers gave us over 200 years ago. It's the message that we're going to take to the American people.
[3:35:56.960 --> 3:36:06.960]  And as I told the Constitution Party in my acceptance speech a few weeks ago, Alex, in Kansas City, the problem is not that the American people have rejected our message.
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:15.960]  The media would have us believe that. That's not true. The American people have not heard our message. We've not been able to get into the debates.
[3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:23.960]  They try to ignore us. They ignored Ron Paul. And by the way, I think you know this, that I was a supporter of Ron Paul during the primary season.
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:30.960]  I campaigned for him aggressively in several states. I wrote copiously on his behalf and I believe in his message.
[3:36:30.960 --> 3:36:37.960]  And I know that the media did everything they could to keep him out of the debates and to mistreat him. They do that all the time.
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:46.960]  Well, you're right. Here's another point I want to throw in just briefly. I am not going to be supporting libertarian presidential candidates, CIA officer, pro drug war, pro gun control votes.
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:55.960]  He then acts like he's a good guy on the NRA board, Bob Barr. He is just there to neutralize and make sure that party goes nowhere.
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:37:00.960]  And I can say that authoritatively. I wouldn't trust Bob Barr as far as you can throw him and I've had him on a few times.
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:09.960]  He knows full well who I am and I just don't trust him. I trust you. So Ron Paul better put his support behind you once he's out of it after the convention.
[3:37:09.960 --> 3:37:21.960]  I talked to Ron Paul just the last week in Washington. We had a good talk. He's very supportive of our campaign. He and I have been friends for a long time and I'm glad to call him my friend.
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:26.960]  Let me tell you something. I really believe that we are at a historic opportunity in our country, Alex.
[3:37:26.960 --> 3:37:37.960]  I think the American people are beginning to recognize that the two major parties are marching in the same direction with the same agenda, motivated and funded by the same people.
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:45.960]  And I believe that many of the American people are looking for an alternative. We need help. We need to help in our campaign financially as you do on your show.
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  Trust that your listeners will support your money bomb and will help you. I'd like to think that some folks would find us worthy and would help us.
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:38:01.960]  I have an 800 number that if I could give out. We're trying to get on the right in ballot in Texas as well.
[3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:07.960]  And if your supporters down there in the great state of Texas could help us, that would be greatly appreciated.
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:16.960]  The number that anybody can call that would like to help us is 1-800-2. That's the number too. 1-800-2-VETO-IRS.
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:24.960]  That's 1-800-2-VETO-IRS. Also, the Constitution Party website is ConstitutionParty.com.
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:32.960]  All one word. ConstitutionParty.com. My website is Baldwin2008.com. It's not quite finished yet.
[3:38:32.960 --> 3:38:38.960]  Hopefully, by the end of this week, the webpage in its entirety will be up and so forth.
[3:38:38.960 --> 3:38:42.960]  But right now, people can donate online at Baldwin2008.com.
[3:38:42.960 --> 3:38:48.960]  Well, we really appreciate you coming on. I want to get you back up in the next few weeks to take calls and really flesh some things out.
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:54.960]  But I'm supporting you, Pastor Baldwin, Chuck Baldwin, at Baldwin2008.com. Thanks for spending time with us.
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:38:57.960]  I'm very happy to do so, and thank you, Alex, very much. Keep up the good work.
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:04.960]  Take care, sir. Well, that's a great American right there, and yes, he just now reminded me of our money bomb.
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:10.960]  I don't know. I think it's like $45,000. People have pledged. I started plugging it last Thursday, last Friday.
[3:39:10.960 --> 3:39:16.960]  You know, Ron Paul could raise $7 million, $6.5 million on one money bomb. We don't expect to do that.
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:22.960]  But you have my word that we will spend 100% of the money that comes on this money bomb.
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:27.960]  We'll go into office, staff, computers, cameras, airtime.
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:36.960]  And by airtime, I'm going to start doing a more official internet, you know, TV news show that's well, you know, highly produced every day.
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:44.960]  And then I'm going to put that on Dish Network, and we have the big enough buzz or direct TV of the 30-something million, 50-something million subscribers on another
[3:39:44.960 --> 3:39:49.960]  to get everybody to tune in. Kind of a hardcore democracy now. They have tens of millions of viewers.
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:54.960]  We could do that very quickly with a lot of money, with a million dollars or something. We could do it overnight.
[3:39:54.960 --> 3:40:02.960]  We could do it in a few weeks, crawling the way I do with having to spend a little bit of savings I've got and mess with personnel and not have enough staff
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:07.960]  six months a year. So go to my website, buy all my books and videos.
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:12.960]  If you want to do that as a donation where you know you're getting something, you can get out to other folks now in effect.
[3:40:12.960 --> 3:40:15.960]  You know, there's a markup of all the items, so that funds us.
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:19.960]  Or you could just sign up for the Money Bomb. It's happening next week.
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:25.960]  It's happening not this weekend, but next weekend on Saturday, the 31st of May. That's when folks decided to do it.
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:32.960]  I wasn't involved, Mr. Nordstrom, Air Force Officer, but it's our side. It's going to be our PayPal.
[3:40:32.960 --> 3:40:35.960]  People are asking, is this you? Yes. It's going to be our PayPal.
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:41.960]  We're going to have a toll-free number for that 24 hours with a couple people here answering the phones to take your donation.
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:45.960]  And we need your support. We need your help.
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:49.960]  And if you want to write us a check now and say it's for the Money Bomb, we'll add that towards the total then.
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:55.960]  Or if you want to buy the books and videos now, we just need to see a lot of capital come in.
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:59.960]  And $50,000, $100,000, $200,000 is the bare minimum.
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:04.960]  And I was intending just to crawl about a week and a half ago, two weeks ago, I was thinking,
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:11.960]  should I just go for a weekend show on free speech TV style deal?
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:17.960]  And I'm like, well, that cost almost as much to build the stage, buy the cameras, set it up, put in the blue screen
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:20.960]  or monitors, produce video to play in the background to make it look good.
[3:41:20.960 --> 3:41:24.960]  Mainstream to really affect people, really reach the mainstream.
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:29.960]  I said, you know, I don't know what I should do. Should I go ahead and get this big office?
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:35.960]  Should I go ahead and do this? And I was kind of hesitating and then Money Bomb pops out of nowhere without me even mentioning it.
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:38.960]  And I think it's a sign.
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:41.960]  And so 100%, you know, I fight like nobody else.
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:46.960]  You know, I'm always doing interviews, always on the air, always getting the word out, always trying to do a better job.
[3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:50.960]  The economy is going to hell in a handbasket. I know it's hard to donate.
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:55.960]  I know it's hard to give, but I'm going all the way.
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:41:59.960]  You know, I'm going to go to Virginia in two weeks, a week and a half.
[3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:02.960]  If they're really having Goldberg, I'm going to go to that and believe me, it's not fine.
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:05.960]  We had having goons following around and the rest of them being harassed.
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:07.960]  But I'm going to do it because it's a commitment.
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:12.960]  I mean, I'm going all the way for humanity and I'm in this for you for the long haul.
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:18.960]  I'm Mr. Real and I will spend 100% of the money you give me towards fighting the new old order.
[3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:20.960]  That's my pledge.
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:24.960]  In fact, a lot of the money that comes in, I'm going to match with my major savings.
[3:42:24.960 --> 3:42:28.960]  I want to blow the savings we've got so this operation can handle litigation if we're litigated.
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:30.960]  So we can litigate if need be.
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:34.960]  So we can pay employees and keep going if all the money was shot off tomorrow.
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:37.960]  We've tried to build a bulwark to be somewhat resilient.
[3:42:37.960 --> 3:42:39.960]  Like I had extra bandwidth and extra servers.
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.960]  Now those have been used up.
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:46.960]  I got one CDN that's five grand a month, another that's what, eight and a half grand a month.
[3:42:46.960 --> 3:42:48.960]  And then the other servers.
[3:42:48.960 --> 3:42:56.960]  Like what's, what's eight, 8,700 and 4,800 or whatever it is.
[3:42:56.960 --> 3:43:02.960]  And then the other servers, I guess that's more like 15,000 and servers.
[3:43:02.960 --> 3:43:06.960]  It's about, you know, more than that 16,000 servers.
[3:43:06.960 --> 3:43:10.960]  I pay for WWCR 10 grand a month or nine and a half.
[3:43:10.960 --> 3:43:17.960]  I pay for, you know, 14 employees.
[3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:20.960]  So a lot of money comes in here.
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:26.960]  And I've been successful because not only am I impassioned, somewhat intelligent, hardworking.
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:32.960]  It's kind of a perfect storm in that I also spend my money on fighting the new world order.
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:35.960]  Like my cars got bald tires and I got money to put new tires on them.
[3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:40.960]  I'm so busy and don't have the staff or assistance that I'm driving around on bald tires.
[3:43:40.960 --> 3:43:41.960]  They're so dangerous.
[3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:43.960]  I need to get those fixed.
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:46.960]  My AC's broke and it's already 95 degrees down here.
[3:43:46.960 --> 3:43:50.960]  I've been driving around for a month with no AC and now it's just hellish because I don't have time.
[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:51.960]  I just, well, I just want to have an AC.
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:52.960]  I'm not whining.
[3:43:52.960 --> 3:43:55.960]  I'm saying I'm so focused like a bird dog chasing a quail.
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:43:57.960]  You know, I mean, I am like a dog chasing a rabbit.
[3:43:57.960 --> 3:43:59.960]  I mean, I am dedicated.
[3:43:59.960 --> 3:44:03.960]  Is there anyone that is more a slave for you that fights for you?
[3:44:03.960 --> 3:44:05.960]  I mean, I am consumed.
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:08.960]  I just constantly am obsessed with liberty and freedom.
[3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:09.960]  I'm freaked out.
[3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:10.960]  I wake up in the middle of the night.
[3:44:10.960 --> 3:44:11.960]  I'm not trying.
[3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:12.960]  I'm not whining here.
[3:44:12.960 --> 3:44:15.960]  I am committed like no one else.
[3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:17.960]  And I need more personnel.
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:19.960]  I need bigger offices.
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:20.960]  I need them now.
[3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:23.960]  Moneybomb, infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:26.960]  I also have sponsors that support us.
[3:44:26.960 --> 3:44:29.960]  I also have prisonplanet.tv when you're a member there.
[3:44:29.960 --> 3:44:31.960]  Go get a, become a member right now.
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:32.960]  I want to see thousands of you go be members.
[3:44:32.960 --> 3:44:34.960]  That would help us right there.
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:35.960]  15 cents a day.
[3:44:35.960 --> 3:44:36.960]  $5.95 a month.
[3:44:36.960 --> 3:44:37.960]  Three months free.
[3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:41.960]  And, you know, kind of here at the end of the shower, Jesse Ventura is coming up in 15 minutes.
[3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:42.960]  Incredible interview.
[3:44:42.960 --> 3:44:45.960]  This is a new one that's happened today on the 20th of May, 2008.
[3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:47.960]  Not the one we did a month ago that was groundbreaking.
[3:44:47.960 --> 3:44:49.960]  We need your help.
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:50.960]  I'm helping you.
[3:44:50.960 --> 3:44:51.960]  I need your help.
[3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:52.960]  I can't carry the ball without you.
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:45:01.960]  I need you to get the video that's going to be posted in the next 30 minutes at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:03.960]  I need you to cut that up.
[3:45:03.960 --> 3:45:04.960]  Cut out the phone company.
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:08.960]  Cutting Emma Lintera was on like 15 times saying hello, hello.
[3:45:08.960 --> 3:45:10.960]  We don't even have the staff to edit that.
[3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:12.960]  We're just throwing it out there.
[3:45:12.960 --> 3:45:14.960]  Help us get that edit the best parts together.
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:15.960]  I know there's 100W.
[3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:16.960]  Don't count on somebody else to do it.
[3:45:16.960 --> 3:45:17.960]  100W, the editor shows.
[3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:18.960]  Get it up now.
[3:45:18.960 --> 3:45:22.960]  Get it out to the press, the media, so it has an effect, so they attack 9-11 truth again,
[3:45:22.960 --> 3:45:24.960]  so more people find out what's happening.
[3:45:24.960 --> 3:45:25.960]  This is a fight.
[3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:26.960]  This is life and death.
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:27.960]  I've committed my life to this.
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:31.960]  Another way we fund this operation, it's very meager with the deals he offers.
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:34.960]  He has Ted Anderson offering gold and silver.
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:38.960]  And I've asked him, it's about a 4% markup on average.
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:44.960]  And that lets him take the order and put a little bit into the network.
[3:45:44.960 --> 3:45:46.960]  People complain about 4-5% markups.
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:47.960]  It's insane.
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:50.960]  But he does happen to have silver dollars back in.
[3:45:50.960 --> 3:45:51.960]  Silver's way up.
[3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:57.960]  Gold went way back up because oil just hit $130 a barrel.
[3:45:57.960 --> 3:45:59.960]  Folks, it's going to go up and up.
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:04.960]  It will probably go up to $145 in the summer, I'm guessing, and then it'll go back down
[3:46:04.960 --> 3:46:06.960]  to $120 during the winter.
[3:46:06.960 --> 3:46:08.960]  Again, in a year from now, it's going to be $200.
[3:46:08.960 --> 3:46:09.960]  I mean, that's how they do it.
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:10.960]  I know they're playing.
[3:46:10.960 --> 3:46:12.960]  We have spies inside them.
[3:46:12.960 --> 3:46:13.960]  I call the head of the Kissinger Group.
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:14.960]  He knows who I am.
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:16.960]  He starts laughing at me.
[3:46:16.960 --> 3:46:17.960]  I mean, an evil giggle.
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:18.960]  I mean, this is serious.
[3:46:18.960 --> 3:46:20.960]  Folks, there's a bullet with my name on it.
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:22.960]  We got to beat them.
[3:46:22.960 --> 3:46:25.960]  So Ted Anderson comes on with us right now.
[3:46:25.960 --> 3:46:27.960]  I hadn't been on about a month.
[3:46:27.960 --> 3:46:28.960]  Ted, you got some gold.
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:30.960]  You got some silver offers for folks today.
[3:46:30.960 --> 3:46:32.960]  Gold and silver are both going back up again.
[3:46:32.960 --> 3:46:33.960]  They can't suppress it.
[3:46:33.960 --> 3:46:34.960]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:36.960]  Hey, it's always a pleasure to be on Alex.
[3:46:36.960 --> 3:46:39.960]  And I really love the idea that Chuck Baldwin's running for president
[3:46:39.960 --> 3:46:41.960]  and running on that platform.
[3:46:41.960 --> 3:46:44.960]  I mean, I can't believe it that we have somebody stepping in like that.
[3:46:44.960 --> 3:46:49.960]  I mean, the Republican Party most definitely should have endorsed Ron Paul.
[3:46:49.960 --> 3:46:52.960]  All the conservative candidates had to quit.
[3:46:52.960 --> 3:46:54.960]  And here we end up with this liberal.
[3:46:54.960 --> 3:46:58.960]  You know, I mean, it's like, why don't we just give the country away?
[3:46:58.960 --> 3:47:02.960]  Why even, you know, I'm really happy to hear Baldwin step up to the plate.
[3:47:02.960 --> 3:47:05.960]  What a, what a, what a, what a, what a thankless cause that is.
[3:47:05.960 --> 3:47:07.960]  I can tell you right now.
[3:47:07.960 --> 3:47:08.960]  Yeah, you're right.
[3:47:08.960 --> 3:47:12.960]  Right now I'm, I'm offering a walking Liberty half silver pieces because the, I mean,
[3:47:12.960 --> 3:47:15.960]  I couldn't get these for what, three months there, Alex.
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:17.960]  I had to stop selling them.
[3:47:17.960 --> 3:47:20.960]  Gold or silver went down to about $16.
[3:47:20.960 --> 3:47:23.960]  And now it's right now it's high as $17.71.
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:25.960]  The dollar continues to fall.
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:27.960]  Oil continues to rise.
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:30.960]  And the silver market is finally coming back up again.
[3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:34.960]  And I locked these in at $16.50 an ounce.
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:36.960]  And it's a really good buy.
[3:47:36.960 --> 3:47:40.960]  The walking Liberty halves right now, I trade them in rolls of 20.
[3:47:40.960 --> 3:47:42.960]  They're $182 a roll of 20.
[3:47:42.960 --> 3:47:47.960]  Last time I've been able to sell these things, they're closer to 250.
[3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:56.960]  So right now at $18.20 per dollar face and silver at $17.71 per dollar face.
[3:47:56.960 --> 3:47:58.960]  Yeah, almost, it's almost a parody.
[3:47:58.960 --> 3:48:00.960]  It's really a very good buy, Alex.
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:01.960]  There's no question about it.
[3:48:01.960 --> 3:48:04.960]  I also have the British sovereign gold pieces.
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:06.960]  I picked those up at the lower price too.
[3:48:06.960 --> 3:48:12.960]  The British sovereigns right now are at $250 a piece and I recommend them too.
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:17.960]  But I can tell you right now, Alex, just three months ago, I wasn't a hundred percent sure
[3:48:17.960 --> 3:48:20.960]  if I was going to be able to deliver everything I sold.
[3:48:20.960 --> 3:48:22.960]  I was very nervous about that.
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:27.960]  We got everything to the, everything that we, that the people bought from us have got all of it.
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:31.960]  I right now have the ability to sell these walking Liberty halves, silver pieces.
[3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:35.960]  And I also have the ability to sell it at about a buck under spot.
[3:48:35.960 --> 3:48:39.960]  You know, because spot went up that much since I locked these in.
[3:48:39.960 --> 3:48:42.960]  And right now, Alex, this is a really good time to buy it.
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:46.960]  And obviously, we're doing it here to support you and support the network as well.
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:48.960]  But that's not even the issue.
[3:48:48.960 --> 3:48:51.960]  People need to get out of US dollar.
[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:53.960]  The US dollar is dead.
[3:48:53.960 --> 3:48:58.960]  If you haven't realized that yet, wake up because the United States dollar,
[3:48:58.960 --> 3:49:05.960]  we're about ready to receive every single one of us that file a tax form is about ready to receive 600 bucks.
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:08.960]  Most everybody will deposit that into the bank.
[3:49:08.960 --> 3:49:11.960]  And by the way, they're going to take that letter in taxes with interest.
[3:49:11.960 --> 3:49:13.960]  Oh, it's, it's, it's just a total gimmick.
[3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:17.960]  It's putting us further on the hook debt to the Federal Reserve system is what's going on.
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:22.960]  But we're going to take that money deposited into the bank and the banking system is going to multiply that
[3:49:22.960 --> 3:49:24.960]  by 10 times the money supply.
[3:49:24.960 --> 3:49:27.960]  What do you think is going to happen to the value of the dollar when that happens?
[3:49:27.960 --> 3:49:32.960]  We are definitely in a position right now that the United States dollar is doomed.
[3:49:32.960 --> 3:49:33.960]  There's dead.
[3:49:33.960 --> 3:49:34.960]  Ted, give them the number.
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:35.960]  Tell them about the offers.
[3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:39.960]  Okay, right now, again, we're offering the walking Liberty half.
[3:49:39.960 --> 3:49:44.960]  The walking Liberty half is currently right now trading at $182 per roll of 20.
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:47.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:50.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:49:50.960 --> 3:49:52.960]  He's got it in stock.
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:53.960]  It's shooting back up.
[3:49:53.960 --> 3:49:54.960]  This is at the price.
[3:49:54.960 --> 3:49:55.960]  He got it a few days ago.
[3:49:55.960 --> 3:49:58.960]  It's already gone up a couple of bucks since then.
[3:49:58.960 --> 3:50:01.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:50:01.960 --> 3:50:03.960]  Are you offering any gold debt?
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:04.960]  Yeah, we do.
[3:50:04.960 --> 3:50:06.960]  Like I said, we do have the British sovereign coin.
[3:50:06.960 --> 3:50:07.960]  They're at 250.
[3:50:07.960 --> 3:50:09.960]  We've also talked about that, that Frank coin.
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:12.960]  And right now they're currently at 199.
[3:50:12.960 --> 3:50:15.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:18.960]  Two gold coins, one silver coin.
[3:50:18.960 --> 3:50:19.960]  These half dollars are gorgeous.
[3:50:19.960 --> 3:50:21.960]  Are those the ones from World War II?
[3:50:21.960 --> 3:50:23.960]  Yeah, they're the ones back in World War II.
[3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:24.960]  I got a bag of those.
[3:50:24.960 --> 3:50:25.960]  I love them.
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:27.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:30.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:50:30.960 --> 3:50:32.960]  Give Ted's brokers a call right now.
[3:50:32.960 --> 3:50:33.960]  Get your orders in now.
[3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:36.960]  Convert Federal Reserve notes before they totally evaporate.
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:38.960]  This is a buying opportunity.
[3:50:38.960 --> 3:50:40.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:50:40.960 --> 3:50:41.960]  Thanks, Ted.
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:42.960]  Yeah, thanks for having me up again.
[3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:44.960]  Final segment straight ahead.
[3:50:44.960 --> 3:50:49.960]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[3:50:49.960 --> 3:50:54.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:50:54.960 --> 3:50:57.960]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:00.960]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:51:00.960 --> 3:51:03.960]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:51:03.960 --> 3:51:06.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[3:51:06.960 --> 3:51:11.960]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:15.960]  For the first time in history,
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:19.960]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:51:19.960 --> 3:51:23.960]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:26.960]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:51:26.960 --> 3:51:27.960]  Most people have no idea.
[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:28.960]  They're not after money.
[3:51:28.960 --> 3:51:29.960]  They have all the money they need.
[3:51:29.960 --> 3:51:30.960]  They're after power.
[3:51:30.960 --> 3:51:31.960]  That's their affidavit.

[3:52:14.960 --> 3:52:15.960]  Let's face it.
[3:52:15.960 --> 3:52:18.960]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[3:52:18.960 --> 3:52:21.960]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:26.960]  and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.

[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:51.960]  They get closer and closer
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:52:54.960]  and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[3:52:54.960 --> 3:52:57.960]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?

[3:54:01.960 --> 3:54:04.960]  Oh, man has invented his doom
[3:54:04.960 --> 3:54:07.960]  What an incredible four-hour radio show today
[3:54:07.960 --> 3:54:09.960]  that we're about to conclude.
[3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:12.960]  The minute the next show starts
[3:54:12.960 --> 3:54:14.960]  at InfoWars, if you're listening on the internet
[3:54:14.960 --> 3:54:16.960]  to the InfoWars streams, you gotta go there.
[3:54:16.960 --> 3:54:17.960]  People keep getting confused.
[3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:19.960]  Gotta go to infowars.com.
[3:54:19.960 --> 3:54:20.960]  The show's on 24 hours a day.
[3:54:20.960 --> 3:54:22.960]  It's on 20 hours a day.
[3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:25.960]  Re-transmitted them or live for four hours.
[3:54:25.960 --> 3:54:26.960]  Sometimes we go over.
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:27.960]  I interviewed Jesse Ventura.
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:29.960]  It was even more hardcore interview
[3:54:29.960 --> 3:54:31.960]  for 50 minutes, 51 minutes if you want to get technical.
[3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:33.960]  We even did some behind the scenes talking.
[3:54:33.960 --> 3:54:35.960]  Those videos are all going up.
[3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:37.960]  YouTube's going up in the next few hours.
[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:39.960]  But for members, prisonplanet.tv,
[3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:42.960]  it's now up on prisonplanet.com.
[3:54:42.960 --> 3:54:44.960]  Go get it.
[3:54:44.960 --> 3:54:46.960]  And it's just amazing.
[3:54:46.960 --> 3:54:47.960]  Absolutely amazing.
[3:54:47.960 --> 3:54:48.960]  It's nowhere.
[3:54:48.960 --> 3:54:49.960]  It hadn't been posted yet.
[3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:51.960]  If you want the Jesse Ventura interview,
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:53.960]  you'll have to tune in in three minutes if you missed it.
[3:54:53.960 --> 3:54:55.960]  And we don't have him at the start of the show
[3:54:55.960 --> 3:54:56.960]  to surprise you.
[3:54:56.960 --> 3:54:58.960]  That's just when he keeps wanting to do interviews
[3:54:58.960 --> 3:55:01.960]  is 11 a.m.
[3:55:01.960 --> 3:55:03.960]  Now, I'm going to plug a few final news stories
[3:55:03.960 --> 3:55:04.960]  because it was 6-7 yesterday.
[3:55:04.960 --> 3:55:06.960]  I didn't have a chance to get to a lot of the news.
[3:55:06.960 --> 3:55:08.960]  But remember, our sponsors.
[3:55:08.960 --> 3:55:10.960]  That's why I'm doing a lot of plugging here at the end.
[3:55:10.960 --> 3:55:12.960]  I had so much that I'm trying to get you to fund us now
[3:55:12.960 --> 3:55:13.960]  here at the end of the show.
[3:55:13.960 --> 3:55:16.960]  And one great sponsor is New Vitality.
[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:18.960]  And they make hundreds of great products.
[3:55:18.960 --> 3:55:20.960]  Big banner up on infowars.com.
[3:55:20.960 --> 3:55:22.960]  You can link through at New Vitality.
[3:55:22.960 --> 3:55:25.960]  One of their product lines that I know is good
[3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:26.960]  and I know is effective.
[3:55:26.960 --> 3:55:29.960]  They have all the mainline stuff that's been documented
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:31.960]  for decades, some cases centuries,
[3:55:31.960 --> 3:55:33.960]  to have health effects that are good.
[3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:35.960]  Aloe's colon body cleanse.
[3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:37.960]  It's aloe vera, mainly aloe vera concentrate
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:38.960]  with some other herbs.
[3:55:38.960 --> 3:55:39.960]  Flushes you out.
[3:55:39.960 --> 3:55:40.960]  A lot of toxins in there.
[3:55:40.960 --> 3:55:41.960]  Very important.
[3:55:41.960 --> 3:55:43.960]  1-800-569-4056.
[3:55:43.960 --> 3:55:45.960]  1-800-569-4056.
[3:55:45.960 --> 3:55:47.960]  They also have super beta prostate.
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:49.960]  Really good for your prostate if you're 40 or older.
[3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:51.960]  1-800-569-4056.
[3:55:51.960 --> 3:55:54.960]  Those are things that I know are well documented to be good.
[3:55:54.960 --> 3:55:57.960]  And like Ted Anderson with the gold and silver,
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:55:59.960]  it's a mini markup.
[3:55:59.960 --> 3:56:01.960]  That's what allows us all to operate and go on here
[3:56:01.960 --> 3:56:02.960]  and you get a good deal.
[3:56:02.960 --> 3:56:04.960]  You convert your fellow reserve notes over to something.
[3:56:04.960 --> 3:56:08.960]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:10.960]  And don't forget the infowars.
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:12.960]  Moneybomb.com.
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:15.960]  I mean, I don't want to be only raised 50,000, 100,000.
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:18.960]  I think Ron Paul did it half as donations
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:20.960]  in the first half of his campaign game from this show.
[3:56:20.960 --> 3:56:22.960]  I can raise everybody else money but myself.
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:24.960]  I'd really like to go see a pledge in there
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:26.960]  to give $10, $100, $50.
[3:56:26.960 --> 3:56:28.960]  We will spend it to fight the New World Order.
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:31.960]  Some of the news, it's just incredible that I didn't get to.
[3:56:31.960 --> 3:56:35.960]  And it's all disinfo.
[3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:38.960]  Members of parliament, back creation of human animal embryos.
[3:56:38.960 --> 3:56:40.960]  Half human, half cow, half monkey, half spider.
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:42.960]  They've been doing this for at least 10 years.
[3:56:42.960 --> 3:56:44.960]  They're just now admitting it to the slaves.
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:47.960]  Oil crosses 129 for the first time.
[3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:49.960]  Heads for 130.
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:52.960]  Lieberman sends a letter to Google to manage YouTube's censor.
[3:56:52.960 --> 3:56:55.960]  By the way, the government has its new office.
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:56:58.960]  They've set up and they've had hearings, the radicalization act,
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:02.960]  and they list 9-11 truth sites that need to be shut down.
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:04.960]  They're coming for us, folks.
[3:57:04.960 --> 3:57:07.960]  White House denies Army radio report on plan to attack Iran.
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:09.960]  Israel media says the U.S. is told
[3:57:09.960 --> 3:57:13.960]  and they will be attacking Iran before Bush leaves office.
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:15.960]  Just all this incredible news here.
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:17.960]  Showdown expected over abortion vote.
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:19.960]  Good news in England.
[3:57:19.960 --> 3:57:22.960]  Members of parliament are set to vote to ban abortions
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:26.960]  from up to the day of birth to only 14 weeks.
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:29.960]  Which isn't perfect, but it's better than nothing.
[3:57:29.960 --> 3:57:31.960]  Something good there.
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:34.960]  Canton Council proposes jail time for tall grass.
[3:57:34.960 --> 3:57:38.960]  I remember Roland Ellingston in the early 90s here in Austin.
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:41.960]  Korean War vet, 3-inch grass, dying of cancer.
[3:57:41.960 --> 3:57:44.960]  And they came and arrested him for 3-inch grass.
[3:57:44.960 --> 3:57:47.960]  Canton Council sees all jail time for nothing.
[3:57:47.960 --> 3:57:50.960]  General Frankstown's constitutional survived WMD attack.
[3:57:50.960 --> 3:57:52.960]  That just goes on and on.
[3:57:52.960 --> 3:57:55.960]  Back tomorrow live, 11-2, Central Standard Time.
[3:57:55.960 --> 3:57:57.960]  Great job, John Harmon.
[3:57:57.960 --> 3:57:59.960]  Great job to Bob in there.
