[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:28.560]  welcome ladies and gentlemen this is going to be an incredibly informative and powerful
[00:28.560 --> 00:38.400]  transmission today we got a call yesterday from Lindsey Williams literally short of
[00:38.400 --> 00:44.440]  breath and in the last few days he talked to his former head of a major big three oil
[00:44.440 --> 00:49.600]  company who has attended Bilderberg meetings and such and the intel he's given us about 90% of
[00:49.600 --> 00:56.200]  it has turned out to be absolutely accurate including you know six months before oil went
[00:56.200 --> 01:02.320]  from $50 a barrel to a hundred and forty nine Lindsey Williams called it exactly from his
[01:02.320 --> 01:07.520]  source and then he said it was going to go down and it went down just total precision on so many
[01:07.520 --> 01:17.040]  fronts and he called us his source is dying has terminal cancer and completely spilt his guts
[01:17.040 --> 01:24.960]  to him so and by the way I know who the person is Dr. Stan Monty checked it for himself and was
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.880]  able to figure it out and called the person a few years ago and all this first broke so Lindsey
[01:29.880 --> 01:34.320]  is certainly telling the truth about this source the question is you know is somebody feeding
[01:34.320 --> 01:45.160]  the source this info and the evidence unfortunately shows that they're not so this is amazing what
[01:45.160 --> 01:54.640]  the globalist are planning according to this what's coming up with Russia and China Iran the
[01:54.640 --> 02:04.240]  mortgages crude oil back to a hundred and fifty five dollar gallon gas within eight months golden
[02:04.240 --> 02:10.720]  silver won't slow down will skyrocket from this point and then he has a separate contact that
[02:10.720 --> 02:17.480]  had dinner with Janet Napolitano and what she told him she said get six months of food and water
[02:17.480 --> 02:28.320]  ready now so Lindsey Williams joining us in the next hour and coming up in about 12 minutes 14
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.560]  minutes from now we've got Wayne Madsen popping in I could have Madsen or Tarpley on the subject
[02:33.560 --> 02:38.920]  or both experts so am I quite frankly for that matter studying this over the years but I want
[02:38.920 --> 02:46.960]  to get their view on it oh it's big exclusive big exclusive in fact Paul Watson didn't even
[02:46.960 --> 02:51.800]  toot his horn on this I want you to get Watson on the line at the start of the next segment I
[02:51.800 --> 02:57.800]  want to briefly give him today's directive because I want Paul to toot his horn and not that
[02:57.800 --> 03:01.840]  old Paul Watson's great or Alex Jones is great we need to point out we already told you this
[03:01.840 --> 03:09.920]  going back four years ago we identified this guy as their top al-Qaeda operative controlled by the
[03:09.920 --> 03:20.920]  CIA and I mean he runs everything the Fort Hood situation the list just goes on and on the
[03:20.920 --> 03:31.200]  underwear bomber the Times Square dud bomb all of it he basically finds mentally ill loose cannon
[03:31.200 --> 03:39.080]  Muslims and then provocateurs them into attacking so this isn't a purely stage terror attacks this
[03:39.080 --> 03:44.040]  guy acts as the vehicle and it came out that Congress has been told its national security that
[03:44.040 --> 03:50.480]  they can't see all the emails that the threat fusion centers the feds run knew for two years that
[03:50.480 --> 03:57.720]  Major Hassan was going to attack and kill he thought he was talking to Anwar al-Lawaki and he
[03:57.720 --> 04:03.640]  was and Anwar told him you know go ahead and do this attack and of course the Pentagon grabbed
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.000]  the surveillance camera footage from 9 11 same thing happened in Fort Hood they grabbed the
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.760]  surveillance camera footage people's private tapes private cell phone videos ordered it all
[04:12.760 --> 04:21.080]  erased it's in it and it's always Anwar al-Lawaki it's always this guy it's always him and and
[04:21.080 --> 04:29.680]  we told you every time he's running the patsy's or the dupes the useful morons and here's Fox
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.440]  News it's an exclusive it's not really an exclusive we already told you this but they got the actual
[04:35.440 --> 04:41.400]  documents the exclusive al-Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months after 9 11 even though
[04:41.400 --> 04:46.840]  they'd already fingered him in the media as one of the masterminds of 9 11 and it's always the same
[04:46.840 --> 04:55.000]  these guys al-Qaeda is a hundred percent CIA command operation sometimes they purely stage
[04:55.000 --> 05:02.400]  attacks or they find useful idiots but they're being funded by these people hundreds of nations
[05:02.400 --> 05:08.640]  have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as
[05:08.640 --> 05:13.960]  we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've
[05:13.960 --> 05:19.760]  determined its influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[05:19.760 --> 05:26.560]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies
[05:26.560 --> 05:32.920]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[05:32.920 --> 05:38.080]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.640]  more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody
[05:42.640 --> 05:49.760]  does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of

[08:01.000 --> 08:13.040]  t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network okay coming up in about five minutes
[08:13.040 --> 08:20.360]  we're going to have a former member of the national security agency naval intelligence rights for
[08:20.360 --> 08:25.560]  some of the biggest publications of the country Wayne Madison's gonna pop in on anwar al awake here
[08:25.560 --> 08:31.360]  I hear the media pronounce it two different ways but we've been covering him for at least five years
[08:31.360 --> 08:39.600]  as the key CIA al-qaeda handler and it doesn't matter if it's the underwear bombing the time
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.080]  square attempted bombing the ford hood shooting it's always this guy running the operation and
[08:46.080 --> 08:53.160]  being protected and here's the Fox News headline exclusive al-qaeda leader Dan a dined at the
[08:53.160 --> 08:59.760]  Pentagon just months after 9-11 again headline al-qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just months
[08:59.760 --> 09:07.640]  after 9-11 and over the last five years we have written multiple articles yearly at info wars
[09:07.640 --> 09:14.880]  dot com and prison planet dot com fingering him directly and proving that he is a CIA operative
[09:14.880 --> 09:20.280]  and so we have the new headline out at prison planet dot com today two articles by Watson by Paul
[09:20.280 --> 09:25.680]  Watson al-qaeda is a front group for the U.S. military industrial complex and then it goes
[09:25.680 --> 09:35.680]  through Ahmad Salam it goes through David Headley which is now mainstream news reportedly
[09:35.680 --> 09:42.000]  commanding the Mumbai attacks we've got Prince Bandar Bush and his comments about it as someone
[09:42.000 --> 09:49.960]  bin Laden being admitted CIA Rashid a SWAT masterminding the 7-7 and it came out mainstream
[09:49.960 --> 09:55.960]  news that he was MI 6 and being protected and so there's purely staged events like Gulf of
[09:55.960 --> 10:04.640]  Tonkin or 9-11 or Operation Ajax or other battle plans that they didn't implement like Operation
[10:04.640 --> 10:09.880]  Northwoods or USS Liberty which was implemented but then there's other events where you have the
[10:09.880 --> 10:15.320]  western intelligence agencies MI 6 does it Mossad engages in it Germans engage in it the
[10:15.320 --> 10:21.480]  U.S. has been caught over and over again and they go out and find clan groups in the U.S. that
[10:21.480 --> 10:27.880]  came out in Texas monthly back in 1998 that the FBI had created a clan group and tried to get
[10:27.880 --> 10:31.240]  them to blow stuff up but they couldn't get them to do it so they still busted them for it I mean
[10:31.240 --> 10:40.200]  you see this over and over and over again but this particular Anwar Al-Walki he is just one of the
[10:40.200 --> 10:48.320]  most important ones involved in this and there it is hidden in plain view that he met at the
[10:48.320 --> 10:58.520]  Pentagon a couple months after 9-11 with the highest level brass at the event with the central
[10:58.520 --> 11:08.200]  intelligence agency and with the head of the army and others okay so this guy is in secret
[11:08.200 --> 11:16.320]  meetings with the top brass the top brass he's in secret meetings with him and then we fast forward
[11:16.320 --> 11:25.480]  nine years later every year since 9-11 he is out there running moron groups Muslim extremist
[11:25.480 --> 11:32.280]  morons that they can find and set up and you know you take the underwear bomber we have the
[11:32.280 --> 11:37.600]  witnesses on the plane the FBI now admits it a quote unnamed U.S. intelligence agency the deputy
[11:37.600 --> 11:43.160]  head the deputy secretary of the state department admitted two months after we broke it here with
[11:43.160 --> 11:49.760]  eyewitnesses and the FBI tried to deny it went to the lawyers you know law firm and tried to
[11:49.760 --> 11:55.120]  tell him to you know that he saw incorrectly and they tried to intimidate other witnesses that
[11:55.120 --> 12:01.000]  here's the underwear bomber looking drugged looking out of his mind disheveled he has no
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.640]  passport he has no visa he can hardly talk and a sharp-dressed man argues with the people at the
[12:09.640 --> 12:16.320]  gate because he doesn't even have you know any of the stuff to board and then orders them you're
[12:16.320 --> 12:22.800]  gonna let him on the plane this guy had so much power he could order the airport in Amsterdam
[12:22.800 --> 12:29.120]  to put him on the aircraft and then it comes out this is a hundred percent admitted that the
[12:29.120 --> 12:34.600]  State Department was ordered to quote help him get on the plane so you've got the U.S. State
[12:34.600 --> 12:39.000]  Department clearly at the gate getting him through security by the way they had naked body
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.320]  scanners in beforehand at that airport he gets to bypass those he doesn't have a visa he doesn't
[12:44.320 --> 12:50.600]  have a passport he is obviously drugged out of his gourd there are operatives all over the plane
[12:50.600 --> 12:58.040]  videotaping him the entire flight they pull everybody off the plane afterwards in Detroit
[12:58.040 --> 13:02.280]  say that there's bombs pull everybody out then they try to cover that up it turns out that's a
[13:02.280 --> 13:08.520]  lie this was a drill and they had some doped up idiot and then they put on on television a fake
[13:08.520 --> 13:14.720]  al-qaeda video of the underwear bomber with a machine gun at a north african al-qaeda training
[13:14.720 --> 13:25.960]  base and they show him and it looks like Obi-Wan Kenobi you know in Empire Strikes Back when
[13:25.960 --> 13:31.920]  he's a ghost I mean it's shimmering it's so fake I mean a 10-year-old with with video editing
[13:31.920 --> 13:37.840]  software could do this it's clearly a face they project into somebody else's hood and the CIA
[13:37.840 --> 13:43.760]  admits they put out fake videos so it's a hundred percent staged okay you've got even if you can
[13:43.760 --> 13:50.720]  believe the official story it just makes me sick even if you believe the official Fort Hood story
[13:50.720 --> 13:56.720]  for two years they knew he was planning this and protecting it now we're gonna go over all of this
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.120]  in this hour and we've got huge breaking news with Lindsey Williams who's very shaken up joining
[14:02.120 --> 14:07.240]  us his source is dying of terminal cancer so spilt his guts in completely so that's coming up and
[14:07.240 --> 14:13.240]  huge revelations if this is accurate and I have no reason to believe it isn't but I briefly wanted
[14:13.240 --> 14:19.000]  to bring Paul Watson up just for a couple minutes Paul I know in your articles about this al-qaeda
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.200]  is a front group for the US military industrial complex and in your first article of the day al-qaeda
[14:24.200 --> 14:30.760]  mastermind invited to Pentagon at for 9-11 and this is down in a leaked report Fox News the
[14:30.760 --> 14:34.920]  documents exclusively obtained by Fox News including an FBI interview conducted after the
[14:34.920 --> 14:41.800]  Fort Hood shooting in November of 09 state that a Wallachy was taken to the Pentagon as part of a
[14:41.800 --> 14:46.440]  military outreach of the Muslim community in the immediate aftermath of the attacks and met with
[14:46.440 --> 14:55.120]  the senior leadership of the Pentagon and the CIA I mean it's the same story with the MI6 al-qaeda
[14:55.120 --> 15:00.400]  mastermind of 7-7 mainstream British news and you've got links to all of this the underwear
[15:00.400 --> 15:07.240]  bomber the Times Square bomber I mean it's just always they find mentally ill people they set
[15:07.240 --> 15:11.760]  them up to carry out these these attacks that are always ridiculously weak because they're such
[15:11.760 --> 15:21.720]  morons and it's in it mirrors 1993 where they found two men both on welfare one had a 75 IQ
[15:21.720 --> 15:28.440]  one a 79 IQ according to their welfare reports and the FBI cooks the bomb trains the driver tells
[15:28.440 --> 15:34.600]  them to go forward the the the former Egyptian intelligence agent Ahmad Salam says well you
[15:34.600 --> 15:38.160]  were supposed to bust them first it wasn't gonna be a real bomb then it was a real bomb for court
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.600]  you know to make it the conviction stick he thought they were setting him up which they
[15:42.600 --> 15:46.920]  were he recorded the FBI telling him go ahead with the bombing and that's now been released in
[15:46.920 --> 15:55.240]  public so this is what they do they go to some nutcase clerics outfit who's blind who literally
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.440]  wears a Santa Claus hat I mean literally a blind guy wearing a Santa Claus hat screaming
[16:00.440 --> 16:05.920]  death to America kill kill kill they don't bust him for that even though he's calling for violence
[16:05.920 --> 16:11.920]  he's got literal mentally retarded people working there at his mosque and the FBI sets
[16:11.920 --> 16:17.800]  all this up I mean it's the same story over and over again Paul Watson we're bringing up here in
[16:17.800 --> 16:23.360]  just a moment Wayne Madsen to break down the history of this but I think it's important in
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.160]  your article you linked to all our old stories about it but I think it's important to point out
[16:27.160 --> 16:32.600]  that we've been on top of this from day one just so people understand this is a public secret Paul
[16:32.600 --> 16:42.320]  Watson yeah Alex all the stories linked in the article the back story is this a wacky guy was the
[16:42.320 --> 16:52.320]  preacher not only for Hassan the four or two to also the very 9-11 hijackers that are charged with
[16:52.320 --> 16:58.920]  hijacking flight 77 and flying into the Pentagon that's right I forgot the big one and here he is a
[16:58.920 --> 17:04.600]  couple months later at the Pentagon meeting with the heads of the military branches and the CIA I
[17:04.600 --> 17:10.520]  mean how sick does this have to get Watson so you know it's a song and either with the 9-11
[17:10.520 --> 17:16.480]  perhaps these before 9-11 months later he's meeting at the Pentagon and then immediately before the
[17:16.480 --> 17:22.800]  four-hud shooting he's communicating and directing a song so every step of the way I mean the time
[17:22.800 --> 17:30.120]  square bombing the Christmas Day attempted bombing every single one of them was directed by this guy
[17:30.120 --> 17:37.120]  who was meeting with Pentagon officials and then we've got five years ago the 7-7 we've got this
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.800]  other individual mainstream news MI6 being protected running the whole thing exactly and
[17:42.800 --> 17:50.360]  that's just as what individual Haroon Rashid as well not only was he fingered as the mastermind
[17:50.360 --> 17:59.640]  of 7-7 having worked for MI6 in Kosovo like Bin Laden and Al Qaeda did but after after the 7-7
[17:59.640 --> 18:06.760]  bombing the terror expert John Loftus went on Fox News and said that British MI6 colluded to hide
[18:06.760 --> 18:13.240]  as well after the bombings so it's not as if he's some double agent gone rogue after the bombings
[18:13.240 --> 18:18.600]  that he masterminded they were still protecting well I mean who set up Al Qaeda in the 80s British
[18:18.600 --> 18:26.400]  US and Israeli intelligence that's not denied and your article is so powerful Al Qaeda is a front
[18:26.400 --> 18:33.160]  group for the US military industrial complex this article you get out to everybody but Paul your
[18:33.160 --> 18:40.200]  headline is excellent Al Qaeda mastermind invited to Pentagon after 9-11 but I mean I think it's
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.720]  important because you mentioned it but we should maybe even on the M4's version of this have
[18:44.720 --> 18:54.320]  Nemo changed the headline to say 9-11 mastermind in you know invited to Pentagon after 9-11 but I
[18:54.320 --> 19:01.640]  mean this is so brazen how they hide it right out in the open Paul well I mean take Prince
[19:01.640 --> 19:08.520]  Bandar Bush for example I mean this is a guy who George W. Bush consulted before he invaded
[19:08.520 --> 19:17.160]  Iraq in 2003 he's also big buddies with HW Bush and then later on he's the quote de facto leader
[19:17.160 --> 19:23.880]  of Al Qaeda in Iraq he's responsible for terrorists killing US troops which of course gives them the
[19:23.880 --> 19:28.960]  perfect justification to remain as an occupying force in the country and not only that he later
[19:28.960 --> 19:36.480]  threatened Britain with another 7-7 bombing unless Tony Blair squashed an investigation into
[19:36.480 --> 19:42.560]  corrupt Saudi arms deal which you know that's exactly what happened after all these people just

[24:33.760 --> 24:38.880]  great digger we are back live now remember on the morning of 9 11
[24:38.880 --> 24:45.280]  one and guardian reported that they were having a carlile group meeting in dc and george bush
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.320]  senior was at the table with the bin laden family remember they flew the bin laden's out to safety
[24:50.320 --> 24:56.320]  then said it was a conspiracy theory and then later had to admit it because florida television
[24:56.320 --> 25:00.560]  aimed cameras when all of the air traffic was grounded for two days they were allowed to take off
[25:00.560 --> 25:09.040]  and now we know anwar al alaki one of the masterminds of 9 11 on record they say
[25:10.240 --> 25:15.920]  and the guy who ran the seven involved in the 7 7 the guy involved in the ford hood the guy
[25:16.480 --> 25:23.280]  supposedly running the underwear bombing he is always involved in everything and then
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.200]  fox news gets a document that a couple months after 9 11 he was at a high powered meeting
[25:29.200 --> 25:36.480]  and anwar al alaki maybe the first american on ci's kill or capture list but he was also a
[25:36.480 --> 25:42.080]  lunch guest of military brass at the pentagon within months of september 11 2001 terror attacks
[25:42.080 --> 25:45.920]  fox news has learned documents exclusively obtained by fox news including an fbi
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.280]  interview conducted after the ford hood shooting in november 09 state that alaki was taken to the
[25:51.280 --> 25:55.600]  pentagon as part of the military's outreach to the muslim community and the immediate aftermath
[25:55.600 --> 26:00.000]  of the attacks and then they have a link to the documents and later we'll go to this article
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.160]  and then link on the documents i want to show those on screen for prism planet dot tv viewers
[26:05.280 --> 26:12.400]  and it just goes on to how he met with the secretary of the army and others at this meeting
[26:13.200 --> 26:21.360]  wane madson of course worked for the nsa he worked for the navy he worked at every level
[26:21.360 --> 26:30.000]  he's written for you name it uh bbc uh washington post uh i mean the list goes on and on and he's
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.520]  one of the leading experts on this this is a short segment we'll have him in the long segment
[26:33.520 --> 26:38.640]  coming up but now they're gonna have trouble spinning this wane and i wonder why they're
[26:38.640 --> 26:44.080]  releasing this now because if you and i know he's one of the main terror handlers uh then the
[26:44.080 --> 26:50.400]  government knows this uh why is this coming out now well i'm always uh intrigued when fox news
[26:50.400 --> 26:57.200]  releases something that uh is interesting remember it was also fox news that broadcast the series on
[26:57.200 --> 27:04.880]  the uh role of the uh israeli art students and they and the movers on nine eleven in new york
[27:04.880 --> 27:12.480]  and and new jersey and uh now they've come out with this other bombshell uh i'm not sure whether
[27:12.480 --> 27:20.160]  they're trying to you know cover cover the other side uh but uh what i make of it is uh we saw them
[27:20.160 --> 27:27.200]  uh it when they do this usually there's a reason murdoch would have probably had some saying uh
[27:27.200 --> 27:34.880]  story of this magnitude uh unless he's just interested in selling airtime on fox news um
[27:34.880 --> 27:39.840]  i think a lot of this stuff was out there might i think what's interesting about a locky being
[27:39.840 --> 27:46.960]  at the pentagon does this have something to do with um the pentagon a pulping um tony shafer's
[27:46.960 --> 27:53.280]  book uh because we know that he was involved in able danger and uh and another subset of that
[27:53.280 --> 28:00.560]  oh good point a good point i wonder who may have leaked this hmm yes yes um and and i you know we
[28:00.560 --> 28:06.160]  don't know everything about able danger but we what we do know is that the military uh defense
[28:06.160 --> 28:12.000]  intelligence agency had some of these so-called uh people involved with the hijacking surrounded
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.800]  then they had a you know another group called door hall galley which was monitoring the monitors
[28:16.800 --> 28:23.520]  apparently and uh i would not be surprised if it turns out that a locky uh was somehow involved
[28:23.520 --> 28:30.320]  in uh the group that uh able danger was uh monitoring in the months before and possibly i
[28:30.320 --> 28:38.640]  guess after well from my analysis he is clearly a cia master handler of organic lunatics and this
[28:38.640 --> 28:44.480]  is the variety of terror where they just basically provocateur it and open the door and encourage
[28:44.480 --> 28:49.280]  and and and you notice these lunatics always attack at a politically opportune time uh for
[28:49.280 --> 28:54.560]  the control grid do you agree that that's basically his ammo oh yeah and i don't think it's any
[28:54.560 --> 29:01.360]  different than the recent revelation about david headley uh who was the guy uh accused of being
[29:01.360 --> 29:07.680]  involved in the mumbai attacks uh where they said his wife said hey look uh uh you know if
[29:07.680 --> 29:13.200]  he working for you guys and you know uh we know that he was an informant for the dea i've written
[29:13.200 --> 29:18.960]  that he also worked for the cia and he he had been casing places all over indian pakistan
[29:18.960 --> 29:25.040]  uh for terrorist attacks but and i think this is just another example all right stay there let's
[29:25.040 --> 29:32.320]  break down anwar al alaki on the other side and a swat and some of these other characters because
[29:32.880 --> 29:39.680]  i mean there is no doubt ladies and gentlemen that saudi arabia works for british israeli
[29:39.680 --> 29:45.840]  and us intelligence and they are providing at least the decoy patsies for the stage terror attacks
[29:45.840 --> 29:51.760]  then the stage terror attacks are used to take the liberties of westerners we're on the march
[29:51.760 --> 29:57.120]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:15.920 --> 33:20.960]  job but the entire official story has been proven to be a lie six of the 10 commissioners have come
[33:20.960 --> 33:29.120]  out and said there's a criminal cover up in a fraud we've got panetta the head of the transportation
[33:30.160 --> 33:34.800]  agency in the bunker with shaney watching him order the stand down at the pentagon
[33:36.720 --> 33:42.800]  we've got it all we've got it all i mean it's just how the buildings fell the police saying get back
[33:42.800 --> 33:49.360]  are going to blow seven up the firefighter tapes the whole thing's a lie and wade madson and wade
[33:49.360 --> 33:54.640]  madson report is our guest i i want to get into all of this uh with you when the bring up wiki
[33:54.640 --> 34:00.640]  leaks and a few other issues with you uh and some of the new developments uh on on that front but
[34:01.520 --> 34:10.960]  why would the cia come out three months ago in spy talk that weekly column uh in the washington
[34:10.960 --> 34:16.640]  post admittedly written by a former operative and admit that they put out fake bin laden videos
[34:17.200 --> 34:22.400]  why do they go on fox and say yes the the the army and the marines are helping grow the opium
[34:23.680 --> 34:30.240]  why are they is again why is fox coming out and going yeah the the 9-11 mastermind was
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.480]  meeting at the pentagon two months later and then he runs everything else uh why do they come out
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.000]  and admit that they ordered the cell phone videos not just one but now it's the reporting
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.560]  multiple videos of the forhood shooting uh why can't congress get the emails where major hasan
[34:44.560 --> 34:51.280]  was communicating with a locky uh for two years before i mean it's just it's out i guess they
[34:52.400 --> 34:55.040]  let me try to answer my own question and have you answer it from your perspective
[34:55.600 --> 34:59.680]  they know this is all out in the open and so for those of us that are awake and for good people
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.000]  inside government who are awake and people in industry who are awake they the system saying
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.520]  yeah we're terrorist as just a way to brazenly terrorize everybody psychologically and to further
[35:09.520 --> 35:16.480]  inoculate uh the the the brain dead public so as this stuff comes out it's really not news anymore
[35:16.480 --> 35:20.720]  because they've already admitted it and hid it in plain view what's your view in madsen well that's
[35:20.720 --> 35:26.960]  what i that's what i believe i believe that the people who watch fox news um basically uh won't
[35:26.960 --> 35:32.880]  even understand the impact of of this revelation because they don't know the other part they obviously
[35:32.880 --> 35:39.040]  don't know about able danger they don't know about the the bin laden meeting with uh bush and carlucci
[35:39.040 --> 35:44.720]  and the other carlile group people at the rich carlton hotel in the morning and 9 11 before the
[35:44.720 --> 35:51.360]  first plane even hit the uh the the tower in new york uh so i think uh this is some sort of a
[35:51.360 --> 35:58.400]  conditioning process uh but you know this this follow is just a day after two days maybe after
[35:58.400 --> 36:05.120]  fox and cnn both reported that bin laden was hiding in a house somewhere in northern pakistan
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.920]  i noticed they put that they did but you can't even hardly find it now on the web but i mean
[36:09.920 --> 36:14.560]  what a ludicrous i mean the pakistan he said it's ludicrous but you know here we have bin laden
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.440]  still alive the only the only footage we have of bin laden uh that's legitimate it's the one with
[36:19.440 --> 36:26.880]  them coming out of a cave in afghanistan and that's circa 1999 i suppose uh uh it's a it's a dated
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.320]  stock uh stock footage uh but we haven't really seen anything we've seen a fake bin laden after
[36:32.320 --> 36:37.760]  9 11 you know the guy that doesn't look like him and put on several pounds that were told was bin
[36:37.760 --> 36:43.360]  laden well remember three years ago uh it came out in british news that when they released you
[36:43.360 --> 36:48.800]  know the surfaced video of three of the hijackers at an al-qaeda training base and then there was
[36:48.800 --> 36:54.640]  a footnote a week later oh that was computer animated with video of them uh put into old
[36:54.640 --> 37:00.960]  videos of bin laden for a made for tv movie in england i mean they think we're so dumb
[37:02.240 --> 37:08.560]  right and i i i also recall the one where bin laden was giving a giving a speech and i'd only
[37:08.560 --> 37:13.280]  moved on and wears lips that look like one of the old clutch cargo cartoons where they only
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.200]  were moving well they put another one out that is that standard program anybody can buy
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.520]  that they use in a lot of video games uh it's it's especially the same template they use in
[37:23.520 --> 37:28.080]  the movie final fantasy where everybody basically looks the same they just change a few features
[37:28.080 --> 37:36.800]  it will one of the videos was clearly a video game uh you know 1997 quality graphic oh and i
[37:36.800 --> 37:43.280]  think this is all part of the scyops uh operation we know we want once again we find out that the
[37:43.280 --> 37:50.080]  uh the army scyops is placed uh their people and and newspapers and savannah georgia and
[37:50.080 --> 37:57.040]  and rolly north carolina uh and the pentagon that basically is dictating uh this kind of news
[37:57.040 --> 38:03.520]  content today and and uh well fox comes out with something that clearly is embarrassing the pentagon
[38:03.520 --> 38:08.560]  so uh you know i'll give credit where credit is due and say good on fox for this and good on him for
[38:08.560 --> 38:14.800]  exposing the uh the role of the israelis um the art students and uh and the people in the telecom
[38:14.800 --> 38:21.520]  business and uh the movers uh before and during and after the urban moving systems but you notice
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.160]  they did three reports on that that never touched it again in my gut i think this is some type of
[38:26.160 --> 38:32.000]  high level black male brinksmanship going on i guess with fox licenses or something i'm not
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.720]  sure but i mean i think this is really high level brinksmanship it very well could be um but uh
[38:38.720 --> 38:44.320]  you know i this whole thing is again it doesn't come as any great shock to me because remember
[38:44.320 --> 38:49.200]  remember it's a lucky is in the pentagon in those months who who is running the pentagon
[38:49.200 --> 38:54.560]  at donald rum spelled in the neil con the neil con unit that they placed in their tug-of-a-tank
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.760]  and and uh the rest of these the office of special plans and admitted israeli operation
[38:59.760 --> 39:05.680]  absolutely so um so that that's you know how how did this they can't say it was an oversight
[39:05.680 --> 39:12.320]  because no i i remember covering um uh the the iraq uh the invasion of iraq at the pentagon it
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.640]  was not an easy place to get into and now they're trying to tell this guy affiliate with al-qaeda
[39:16.640 --> 39:23.600]  got in and then had to have you know dine dined with the general well he dined with the secretary
[39:23.600 --> 39:33.920]  of the army well maybe he maybe also got a um uh congratulatory uh handshake and a nice bonus
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.400]  for for his previous work because at the time they're saying he was involved at the highest
[39:38.400 --> 39:43.520]  levels of the 911 attack and then he struts in hey secretary i'm ready to have dinner and they're
[39:43.520 --> 39:51.040]  like ha ha ha five baby whoo yeah yeah i mean it and then now we know he was also linked to the
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.120]  the underwear bomber and the uh uh the fizzle the time square fizzle bomber i mean i you know and
[39:57.120 --> 40:03.120]  remember the reaction of these two guys uh on the airplanes when they arrested them they you know
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.360]  they were very lackadaisical about the whole well the witnesses described when they got the underwear
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.160]  bomber on the plane in amsterdam that he was disheveled looked drugged and had no papers just
[40:12.160 --> 40:16.960]  like literally a homeless mental patient and then they and whoever this sharp dressed guy was like
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.680]  look you're putting him on the plane and whoever it was had such authority and then it comes out
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.440]  state department was ordered by an unnamed us intelligence agency to get him on the plane
[40:26.000 --> 40:33.440]  well there we go so it it as you have said this is all hiding in plain sight um obviously now we
[40:33.440 --> 40:38.080]  know why the 911 commission people like zealot cal and the other clown they had working on that
[40:38.080 --> 40:44.080]  commission uh worked did not give full access to everything to the uh people who were demanding
[40:44.080 --> 40:49.520]  it including the two the two chairman of the of the commission and the other members uh this these
[40:49.520 --> 40:55.440]  were the tidbits obviously that they didn't want to have come out then because it would have ruined
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.400]  the whole precept about 911 that they had sold them you know not only the american people but
[41:00.400 --> 41:04.080]  so tried to sell the world well and let me ask you this and then we'll get to a few other questions
[41:04.080 --> 41:10.560]  to let you go because i know you're busy um just in two minutes from i mean we know the official
[41:10.560 --> 41:15.680]  stories a lie we know that the peanut called for big terror attacks to be blamed on foreign enemies
[41:16.320 --> 41:22.240]  just a retread of northwoods but when you look at this my best analysis is and we know the
[41:22.240 --> 41:27.120]  hijackers were trained at us bases we know they ordered the embassies in saudi arabia this is
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.040]  on record to let them into the country even though they were on terror list they were told don't worry
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.160]  their terror designation as a cover uh we know all that that's even in time in newsweek hidden in
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.400]  plain view that oh yeah they they were trained at us bases we know they were drilling and that
[41:40.400 --> 41:45.200]  james wood saw this on one of the planes warned the fbi was basically told to shut up a few weeks
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.000]  before we know all of that's going on and best i can tell whatever went on with those aircraft
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.600]  these guys thought they were taking part in airport security drills which we know they do
[41:53.600 --> 41:58.240]  always try to sneak bombs in and the rest of that comes out all the time the navy seals do it the
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.480]  air marshals do it the fbi does it the pentagon does it and that's also a nice cover in their
[42:02.480 --> 42:09.280]  drill to run a real attack and that uh i mean what's your best breakdown i know you don't
[42:09.280 --> 42:15.760]  like to speculate about what really went on on 9 11 well i i believe uh these guys were probably
[42:16.320 --> 42:22.640]  thought that they were participating in some sort of official activity look mom and otta was on
[42:22.640 --> 42:28.560]  uh jack abramoff the casino boat a few days before 9 11 down at midair beach Florida it also
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.960]  been seen quite frequently as the officer's club at maxwell air force base in alabama so here we
[42:34.960 --> 42:40.960]  have somebody who's who's not just uh the the the wild terrace which he's using drugs he's drinking
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.880]  he's got hookers every night he's got tons of cash all these guys have got you know fbi paying for
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.240]  their houses and informants living with them and and oh yeah this is a muslim extremist sorry go
[42:52.240 --> 42:58.640]  ahead my my my gut feeling is able danger and what we know about it and how they try to you know
[42:58.640 --> 43:04.160]  they basically went after kurt welden when he brought this all up i think able danger was
[43:04.160 --> 43:11.520]  the control at least monitoring the people who were controlling these guys uh before uh and uh
[43:11.520 --> 43:17.440]  up to leading up to 9 11 and that's what to interrupt and add more proof uh that's what
[43:17.440 --> 43:23.200]  uh of course civil edmunds has now broken her gag order last year and said look i was monitoring them
[43:23.200 --> 43:30.720]  for the fbi as an interpreter and quote al qaeda was under cia command on the day of 9 11 and then
[43:30.720 --> 43:36.640]  and then what has uh colonel shaffer said here as much as he can he said basically look there were
[43:36.640 --> 43:42.160]  private contractors protecting al qaeda and the army wasn't allowed to move in the the you know the
[43:42.160 --> 43:49.440]  light side of the army and uh that that that that that's what was going on well i i believe and i
[43:49.440 --> 43:56.960]  i think this is a yet another clear indication that this was the 9 11 was an operation northwood
[43:56.960 --> 44:03.120]  that was actually carried out uh successfully because no one was ever brought to trial for this
[44:03.120 --> 44:08.480]  act of treason and we just had a poor ambassador joe wilson say the other day that he accused
[44:08.480 --> 44:13.440]  big cheney of committing treason by halving his wife valerie playing well big cheney commits
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.320]  treason doing that how do we know he didn't commit to uh treason to uh being involved in 9 11
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.840]  well this is a big deal that the al qaeda 9 11 mastermind the mastermind of the
[44:23.840 --> 44:30.880]  underwear bombing the ford hood shooting the time square dud uh this anwar al alaki uh is
[44:30.880 --> 44:35.920]  meeting at the pentagon with the top brass and the secretary of the army two months after 9 11
[44:35.920 --> 44:42.080]  i mean this is this is huge wane well that's not to forget that sergeant ali mohammed from
[44:42.080 --> 44:47.920]  fort bragg who was uh bin london's uh uh basically one of his chief aide i mean here he's he's
[44:47.920 --> 44:55.520]  trained by the u.s special forces and uh uh and his name is all over that uh this whole al qaeda
[44:55.520 --> 45:00.800]  operation it seemed like al qaeda when you look at him have more people and let's not also let's
[45:00.800 --> 45:06.400]  not forget adam get done it was born adam perlman who's like i believe his grandfather was the head
[45:06.400 --> 45:12.080]  of the eighty yes in los angeles he's been it's been a lot instead of solid he would be that would
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.520]  make him an al-amriki number two guy in charge of the so-called al qaeda but it's supposedly
[45:17.520 --> 45:22.320]  patriotic to ignore all this wrap yourself in the flag give up all your liberties the name
[45:22.320 --> 45:28.720]  of fighting terror and then we learn israeli british uh you name it are part of n l e o nine
[45:28.720 --> 45:34.560]  n l e o ten quote training to take on american terrorist and we learn the entire apparatus
[45:34.560 --> 45:40.640]  of homeland security is not aimed at their muslim cutouts it's aimed at liberals conservatives
[45:40.640 --> 45:46.640]  anti-war activists gun owners returning veterans uh and the threat fusion centers are pointed at the
[45:46.640 --> 45:53.200]  locals uh then this this is a criminal takeover and they stage nine eleven to get it done by
[45:53.200 --> 45:59.600]  that's what i believe i believe it was a coup d'etat um uh a creeping coup d'etat because
[45:59.600 --> 46:05.280]  we know that they had the patriarch uh patriarch already written it was ready to go and they just
[46:05.280 --> 46:11.920]  needed a vehicle to um push it through congress and of course that was the anthrax attacks uh
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.800]  just a few weeks after nine eleven and we know according to the rand corporation when they
[46:16.800 --> 46:24.240]  passed the derivatives uh uh act uh got rid of glass stegelin in 99 they began this accelerated
[46:24.240 --> 46:29.120]  move to a police state and they knew this bubble and all their crimes were going to be coming out
[46:29.120 --> 46:35.040]  they needed this control grid in place to be able to suppress the american people here we are nine
[46:35.040 --> 46:40.080]  years later and they're saying homeland security is for you the army is going to take you on
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.400]  you don't like having your pension funds taken the army and threat fusion centers have federalized
[46:44.400 --> 46:49.360]  your local police guess what the cia is operating in every town in city doesn't matter if it's illegal
[46:50.320 --> 46:56.080]  and i mean you can really see the premeditated blueprint of this right and i always remember
[46:56.080 --> 47:01.600]  what long time wayhouse correspondent sarah mcquendon who was from texas once said when she
[47:01.600 --> 47:07.920]  she got bush aside old man bush george hw bush and and and and asked him a question and he turned
[47:07.920 --> 47:13.440]  to her and said sarah if the american people knew what we have done they would chase us down the
[47:13.440 --> 47:21.040]  street and hang up and i think that for once bush would probably tell him the truth and people always
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.240]  say something as big as 9 11 you couldn't hide it they haven't hidden it it's like taking a coffee
[47:26.240 --> 47:30.960]  can and shooting it with a 12 gauge shotgun with number seven bird shot there's hundreds of holes
[47:30.960 --> 47:36.880]  in it i mean it's just a sieve uh a total proof we know exactly what they did and there it is
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.480]  i that's right and i you know i was talking to a guy worked in the pentagon on 9 11 he
[47:42.480 --> 47:48.880]  he was a senior air force uh department official and he said when he came out he looked in that
[47:48.880 --> 47:55.520]  he looked in that hole that original hole and he saw a small uh a jet fan engine the kind that you
[47:55.520 --> 48:04.000]  find on a on a drone he saw nothing that indicated that a a passenger plane is at the pentagon amazing
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.040]  in closing what do you see happening with the cyber security takeover i mean how obvious is it
[48:09.040 --> 48:12.800]  i'm gonna have to hold you into the final segment of this hour because i want to get into wiki leaks
[48:12.800 --> 48:19.600]  too but to have the israelis tacitly admit they launched the super worm clearly with microsoft
[48:19.600 --> 48:22.880]  working with them according to the computer experts i've read in the press but this is your
[48:22.880 --> 48:28.560]  main expertise as computers formerly with the nsa uh it's industrial it has to be loaded directly in
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.880]  so israel and our media basically admit they did it but now they're on the news saying we need to
[48:32.880 --> 48:39.440]  use this stuxnet worm to pass cyber security takeover so there's another false flag they admittedly
[48:39.440 --> 48:43.760]  launch it and then we have to lose our internet freedom because the government launched an attack
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.960]  right and when and when look even though rama manual what the white house we still have good
[48:48.960 --> 48:55.120]  old cash funds being in his cognitive infiltration team up there and i think you know as long as
[48:55.120 --> 49:02.800]  he's in that job uh we have to be very fearful of what the the agenda is and and obviously yes
[49:02.800 --> 49:09.280]  we had this launch of this uh this internet worm that was said to have disrupted iran but it spread
[49:09.280 --> 49:15.200]  quickly to other countries in asia and then it bounced back here into this country uh and uh
[49:15.200 --> 49:20.560]  you know unfortunately when you look at the the people in the on the homeland security committee
[49:20.560 --> 49:26.480]  people like joe Lieberman from connecticut uh he his agenda of course is to increase the
[49:26.480 --> 49:35.200]  surveillance state and expand it beyond its present confine but how brazen is that where the government
[49:35.200 --> 49:39.040]  basically admits they launched the worm and then don't worry they'll take over the web
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.920]  and surveil you to save you from the worm they admittedly launched well i think one of the
[49:43.920 --> 49:48.560]  one of the other agenda they have as they want to uh in controlling the internet they also want
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.600]  to be able to have the access to all the encrypted communications that go across the internet
[49:53.600 --> 50:00.000]  uh from financial transactions to people even doing e-commerce uh doing uh shopping on the
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  internet oh they were on local news i do do five more minutes was on the sideways i want to get
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.840]  into wiki leaks but they were on the news this morning knowing the threat fusion center run by

[55:11.840 --> 55:16.800]  bracelets and pins and little pocket knives that have info wars dot com on it don't try it on me
[55:16.800 --> 55:22.080]  with a little light very inexpensive great way to spread the word info wars dot com check it out
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.640]  today and you make all this possible when we got about four minutes left wiki leaks you know they're
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.960]  supposedly now saying they're going to list them as a group aiding terror so they can't get financial
[55:30.960 --> 55:36.320]  donations something cast sunsteen's called for against the general public they've they've tried
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.880]  to claim he's raping people and they've dropped it you know sexual assault i mean do you still
[55:40.880 --> 55:46.960]  think you smell a big rat with wiki leaks well with any limited hangout buy-off operation you've
[55:46.960 --> 55:52.480]  got a sweet in the pie you've got to give the group some sort of street cred so when they release
[55:52.480 --> 55:58.160]  the information you really want them to release the people will swallow that hook line and thinker
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.760]  so the first big revelation of course was the video footage in iraq of the of the guy shooting
[56:03.760 --> 56:09.760]  up these the the alleged journalist on the street okay that gave him a street cred but then we saw
[56:09.760 --> 56:17.600]  with the late of the land the last big dump of information uh... they uh... insinuated that
[56:17.600 --> 56:24.800]  uh... uh... the Taliban was being supported by pakistan and also by iran which fits very nicely
[56:24.800 --> 56:31.040]  into david patrice's uh... uh... spread this conflict of outside of it that kind of stand
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.000]  to pakistan to destabilize that country with a view of breaking up the
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.560]  these are nuclear weapons eventually and also to prevent it turn up the heat on iran
[56:41.360 --> 56:45.520]  very advantageous for these uh... these war planners to have those
[56:45.520 --> 56:50.320]  certain those particular rebel and wiki leaks may not even know this but clearly ninety something
[56:50.320 --> 56:56.000]  thousand pages of cooked intelligence that we know is false that's what gets leaked that's right
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.800]  that's right and and we know they've even within wiki leaks they've had a big uh... you know some
[57:00.800 --> 57:08.000]  people have left uh... accusing uh... julie nissange of uh... acting like a dictator and i would
[57:08.000 --> 57:14.640]  note that sweden recently denied him residency uh... residency permit and in the country so
[57:14.640 --> 57:19.760]  um... maybe the swedes are catching on as well i don't know but i've never been comfortable in
[57:19.760 --> 57:25.920]  accepting uh... especially with the involvement of the new york times the guardian and and spiegel
[57:25.920 --> 57:31.680]  in germany that always seems to get these documents first
[57:31.680 --> 57:35.760]  where do you see the whole wiki leaks are going on do you have any intel on what these
[57:35.760 --> 57:38.880]  new revelations the pentagon says they're bracing for
[57:38.880 --> 57:43.120]  oh yeah when the pentagon says they're bracing for it what are they doing they're adding to the
[57:43.120 --> 57:47.520]  anticipation aren't they i mean they're they're building up to this crescendo so everybody all
[57:47.520 --> 57:53.680]  the media is waiting patiently uh... you know with uh... the drool dripping from their tongues
[57:53.680 --> 57:58.240]  uh... waiting for these these revelations i think that's all part of the show what is the
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.560]  uh... why does the pentagon even pay attention to it uh... it would make sense if they had
[58:03.360 --> 58:08.640]  actual important documents that could hurt you know war fighters abroad is what they say
[58:09.200 --> 58:12.800]  uh... they would kind of ignore it yeah briefly what do you think of schaefer
[58:13.760 --> 58:18.880]  i think he's onto something i think uh... schaefer uh... that whole thing he wasn't the only person
[58:18.880 --> 58:24.320]  who tried to talk about able to enter through a hot galley but i think if we uh... could have read his
[58:24.320 --> 58:29.040]  book and and the notes and everything else we would have had even more revelations but that
[58:29.040 --> 58:34.160]  got blocked wane madson wane madson report dot com thanks for popping in with us okay anytime
[58:34.640 --> 58:37.600]  well they write back ladies and gentlemen with lindsay williams you don't want to
[58:37.600 --> 58:50.080]  miss these developments
[58:50.080 --> 58:54.640]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:54.640 --> 58:58.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:58.960 --> 59:04.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.600]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[59:09.600 --> 59:14.720]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:14.720 --> 59:20.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.640]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[59:24.640 --> 59:30.000]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.480]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[59:34.480 --> 59:40.080]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com
[59:40.080 --> 59:45.120]  that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:08.080]  lindsay williams this information uh and the bigger issue here is uh you know are the circles he's
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:14.480]  still moving in you know is he being fed any disinfo but now all these revelations later
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.720]  almost everything this guy's talked about has happened you know oils at $50 a barrel he says
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:25.120]  it's going to 150 it goes to 150 just as lindsay said it would well now he's dying of cancer

[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:24.640]  program you need to hear everything do you realize that only seconds ago only moments ago janet
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:32.560]  apolitano came on over national news the homeland security director and she said we are very now this
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.800]  is a special bulletin only moments ago i happened to catch it just before coming on the program
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:45.440]  right now and she said we are very concerned about a cyber war attack i knew about this a week ago
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.600]  folks you cannot imagine how important you were telling us this last night well i mean we wrote
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.480]  notes on what you told us in that lengthy pre interview to find out what's happening you were
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.280]  saying and now notice the israelis admittedly launched this worm now we've got to give up
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:09.520]  control of our internet because of a worm our own system launched yes we we are on the verge i
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.920]  i knew a week ago that we were on the verge of something catastrophic that the elite were going
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.400]  to do and here this morning just moments ago janet apolitano says a cyber war folks when i
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.760]  lived with the elite of the world for three years i was that chaplain i lived with them and one of
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.040]  the first things i learned was listen to their buzzwords they tell you everything they're going
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.080]  to do before they do it it is part of their uh what should we say their code of ethics i believe
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.200]  that we have a definite warning and in the course of the program today alex i'm going to tell you
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:50.800]  a listening audience everything that they can expect through 2012 amazing let's briefly talk
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.880]  about this your source and the fact that he already spilled his guts a few years ago because he
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.280]  thought he was going to die now he says he's terminally ill with cancer well for the past
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:05.200]  35 years there have been two individuals that i knew when i lived with the elite of the world
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.800]  that have given me information every time they have said something i dared to risk my credibility
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.760]  and go on every radio talk show i could get on such as i'm doing right now with you and tell
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:23.600]  what these people say this individual i found out about three four months ago had cancer he
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:30.560]  went to the law 48 uh out of alaska where he lives to have cancer therapy i could not contact him
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.880]  for about two months i have been completely out of the talk show circuit for three months time
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.720]  because without information from him i could i couldn't guarantee that i was what i was saying
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:47.040]  was true i was finally able to contact him through his relatives he is terminal with cancer this man
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:53.040]  has told me everything that the elite are going to do you can imagine that so this is the biggest
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:59.200]  situation such as this so this is the biggest data dump ever we're about to get and this is probably

[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:18.480]  americans at home i've turned in this influence on our president in congress and they really
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.880]  are calling the sharks i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:30.720]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:35.760]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner

[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.320]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen

[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:10.960]  2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps the recession ended for
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.360]  the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.480]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.120]  in addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food

[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.440]  dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource you and your family
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:41.040]  need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper stocks or metals alex has been urging you
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.480]  to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term this will freeze the cost

[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:08.080]  probably presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:14.480]  so the world is waking up to the globalist banking takeover the majority of mortgages
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.920]  in foreclosure has been halted it's coming out in mainstream news that one of the masterminds
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.920]  of 9-11 was meeting secretly at the pentagon with the brass two months after the attacks
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.840]  anwar al alaki headlines at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:38.640]  the u.s. government allied with israel clearly put out the superworm a month ago now they say
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.960]  it's blowing back the pentagon needs to take the web over with cyber security and surveil
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.560]  everything you're doing and censor people and have a kill switch which they already put in
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.560]  they're just announcing it to save you from it and here it is pentagon will help homeland
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.960]  security department fight domestic cyber attacks and on local news they're announcing the southern
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.840]  probably law center adl or spying on citizens they're working with the threat fusion center
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:06.320]  run by the cia it's just totally illegal total takeover of society this is it the soft coup
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.120]  is accelerating and lindsay williams has spent months trying to get a hold of his former big
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:17.200]  three oil company ceo who's we've always gotten great intel from because they love to
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.760]  tell people what they're going to do and it mirrors the bill berg group davos switzerland
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.880]  info we get months after williams talks about it and he is dying of cancer he's been under
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.280]  cancer treatment he is terminal and this may be one of the last times lindsay's been able to talk
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:36.720]  with him and we got cut off by the break but i was saying lindsay it sounds like what you're saying
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.760]  he was actually out of breath yesterday and we talked to you that that that this is the biggest
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:47.520]  most important information he's ever given you and that he basically completely spilt his guts is
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.240]  that accurate yes i would say that'd be a good way to put it and if ever anyone has doubted
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:59.440]  the existence of a group of people on the face of the earth control the world let me emphatically
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:06.000]  say to you as strongly as i possibly can there is a group of people on the face of the earth who
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.640]  control the world and they have definite plans right now for you and for your household and folks
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.600]  what you're going to hear today is just an extension of what alex jones is saying day after
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:25.360]  day except i was able to get it from one of them himself who now is at a point where he would
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.680]  probably tell everything in the condition he's analog now you've been able to talk to him several
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:35.200]  times the last two weeks do we know how long he thinks he has well it's not going to be very long
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:42.640]  he has terminal cancer and i am very concerned for him i'm also very concerned for him spiritually
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.560]  in fact in our last conversation i've tried every way i possibly could to present him the truth
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.920]  of salvation through jesus christ and alex i really think and you probably hear my voice
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.440]  break because i'm so concerned i i i really think we're going to see this man in heaven
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.720]  well let's hope that's the case and we'll talk about that before you leave us come up
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:13.840]  about an hour and a half lindsay run through these are the notes i wrote uh from from talking to you uh
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.440]  yesterday um russia china recent agreement with russia to supply china with oil and natural gas
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.960]  what that means i ran elites want trouble within three to four months mortgages feds will own every
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:30.160]  mortgage in america that's why they engineered this crude oil back to 150 to 200 a barrel in direct
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.960]  proportion to deflation of the dollar will result in result in five dollars a gallon
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.160]  in six to eight months gold silver won't slow down will skyrocket from this point and then you've
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.240]  got uh dealing with what he talks about this global leader that your source says they're
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.000]  going to have rise and then your other source who we won't name who had dinner with janet napolitano
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.160]  we'll we'll get to that as well and some other issues uh let's let's run through these bullet
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.760]  points and other ones that we didn't write down and then let's start with what you think's most
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:04.960]  important and go through it in detail everything that alex has just said uh it will take place
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:11.360]  the elite are on track they own time they have a timeline they are going to do these things
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.280]  exactly as they're saying and nothing but divine intervention could possibly stop it i have found
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.120]  out the following folks keep your eyes on china and russia never mind the middle east never mind
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.800]  northern south korea don't worry about these older skirmishes around the world the the very
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:34.960]  thing they want to get your mind off off is that which is most important right now watch china and
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.320]  russia china russia and china just signed an agreement china china just announced they're
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.840]  going to freeze rare earth minerals shipments to the united states and they run the biggest
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:51.120]  mining operations in africa and other areas like australia to get those rare earth minerals used
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:57.200]  and everything uh that's that's electronic yes and as of this year russia has become the
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.840]  number one supplier of crude oil on the face of the earth because of their super deep wells
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.880]  which bp attempted to duplicate in the Gulf of mexico and as you know they couldn't do it
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.480]  and finally it blew out now russia is the number one supplier surpassing jordy sardya
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:18.720]  arabia as of this year china and russia have just signed an agreement whereby moscow said
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:25.440]  that they are ready to supply all of the energy needs that china has that is both crude oil
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:32.480]  and natural gas and let me tell you why this is so important because natural gas russia
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.160]  is the supplier of natural gas to europe and whenever china comes in and takes everything
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:45.520]  they've got what's going to happen to roof to europe what a perfect tool of bribery and espionage
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:50.880]  for well we know putin already uses the fact that what is it 80 or more of the gas to europe
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.440]  comes from russia he's already used that before and uh has has actually turned it off before
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.960]  yes and can you imagine well but without a single product made said that it says on it made in china
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.880]  i mean folks we are on the verge of something to catastrophic and they say to me watch china and
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.520]  russia folks i am telling you in advance okay what did he specifically say is going to happen on
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:20.480]  that front well first of all when russia and china signed this agreement for the supply of all petroleum
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:27.920]  products natural gas and so on now and alex this is so important there was no dollar value given to
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:35.360]  the deal no no dollar value why they're not going to use the dollar i mean this is going to devastate
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.360]  our currency because now the whole world will follow suit and say we're going to use something else
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.200]  well we'll get back to that and that moves already that moves already happening yes it is happening
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:52.800]  right now while you're listening to this program this is taking place and you are facing something
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.320]  with russia and china that is so important you want to focus all of your attention on what's
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.600]  happening with russia and china you remember i said this on your program two years ago
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.120]  whenever this gentleman gave me everything they were going to do through 2012 before he became
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:16.160]  terminally ill and he said to me he said china is the big one you remember those exact words it's in
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:22.800]  my notes from two years ago on your program and that's exactly what he's saying to me again china
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.840]  is the big one watch russia and china that's where the big issues are going to take place in the
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.080]  near future alex and that's why the globalist of all been moving there and moving their main
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:37.440]  operations this isn't like our elite are failing our elite aren't our elite they're the global
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.480]  corporate crime syndicate that's organized this whole thing yes our elite know exactly what they're
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:49.040]  doing for instance for it is investing five hundred million dollars uh with the new chinese
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:57.520]  partner chung yang ford mozda automobile limited right now in china five hundred million dollar
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:04.960]  engine plant in china four hundred thousand engines annually ford is the 11th listen to this
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:12.320]  that our washington has deceived us ford is the 11th ranking auto producer in china ford sold
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:21.760]  368 thousand vehicles in china since uh and we know we know gm on record used bailout money
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.600]  to move to china and brazil and we also i saw in the statesman in austin last week
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:35.280]  uh the communist chinese government just leased 600 000 acres of prime oil and gas fields in
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:41.600]  southeast texas so they are just taking everything over they they have become fabulously wealthy
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.600]  are the globalist gave the panama canal to them they have positioned this takeover this destruction
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:53.040]  of the us from the highest levels of the government and every bit of this is being done by the elite
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:58.080]  it's the very people that i rub shoulders with for three years on the transatlantic oil pipeline
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:04.000]  let's continue of which still give me information folks believe everything you just heard alex saying
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.280]  everything he's saying on his programs every day this is not fantasy this is far real what did he say
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:15.280]  so so the dollar is going to start dying even faster uh with all this oil and gas coming online
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:22.720]  out of russia uh other facets to that well i do believe that they have accelerated and please
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:29.120]  notice the word i believe that they have accelerated that program the main thing is they do not want
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:36.320]  the american people to rise up they are scared to death off rebellion and folks don't you depend
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.040]  on this election uh it may turn out to be what you want it to be on the other hand they may rig
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.400]  these voting booths because they're electronic you you've got to understand that the elite are on
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:52.480]  track with what they're doing and they know exactly what's going to take place and i do believe
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.400]  that they have accelerated their program because he's giving me some things now
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.720]  that i thought was going to take another year too before they would take place and we're going to
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:08.000]  talk about our ran today and a lot of these others so uh alex um yeah the elite are right on target

[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:28.240]  spilt his guts to him and remember back uh you know two and a half years ago uh oil was $50
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:34.480]  sometimes even lower $45 a barrel crude oil he said it's going to over 140 in the next couple
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.720]  months it did it went to a hundred and forty nine hundred and fifty uh and then he announced okay now
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:45.680]  it's gonna go down and it went down uh and and you know so many other predictions that have come
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.640]  true but again this is this guy the this top globalist they might be feeding him real info
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.600]  the whole time to later give us this info i'm i'm not saying it is it's just that you know it's not
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.920]  like you know god's appearing before us and telling us this but it is very important because the
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:06.720]  track record and i also trust lindsay williams uh but lindsay continuing so what's the time frame
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:12.480]  on crude oil break it down for us the track record of my elitist friends who's been giving me this
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:19.520]  information over the past 35 years has been impeccable everything he has ever said has happened
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:26.160]  exactly like you said it now you can take this i'm trying my best to warn you what they're going to
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.120]  do i don't want to frighten you i want to let you know the facts so that you can do something about
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.800]  it a little under two years ago this individual said to me i'm still sitting here stunned that he
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:43.680]  has been able to fulfill this exactly like they said he said to me chaplain within two years you
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:49.040]  will be so cool you will not be able to do anything about it now i'm quoting him verbatim
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:55.600]  just under two years ago here we are two years later and he is and they're indicating that they're
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:01.840]  going to take crude oil now and turn it around in the opposite direction to where it went folks get
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:06.880]  ready you will be paying at the gas pump and i'm going to give you the amount that is going up to
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:12.880]  and i'll give you an approximate as to what the time frame for all of this is again let me repeat
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:20.960]  his sign he gave me a sign one year ago and he's this is so important write it down watch crude
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:26.960]  oil prices and you will know the progression of the elite now that they have started back up with
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:33.840]  their crude oil prices this means that their program is on schedule they're doing exactly what
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:39.920]  they've been telling me over these years they were going to here it is here's the price crude oil
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:48.560]  is going back to a hundred and fifty two two hundred dollars a barrel gasoline at the gas pump

[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:37.920]  program of what they're going to do now what janet apolitano said only moments ago on national news
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:44.720]  on a special bulletin that they are very concerned about a cyber attack do you realize what this would
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.320]  do to crude oil prices when you went to for instance you go to the service station and you

[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:33.280]  prominent hispanic political activist in phoenix arizona a very devout person this person is
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:39.440]  uh as you remember janet apolitano who is now the director of homeland security was the governor
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:46.800]  of arizona prior to going to washington under the president administration uh when janet apolitano
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:53.200]  went to washington she asked this very prominent activist whose name i have in front of me right
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.400]  here i could call on the phone if i wanted to and she asked her to come to washington and be the
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:05.680]  and be the liaison between the hispanic community of america and homeland security uh at the time
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:11.760]  they offered her a job of they offered her a salary of $170,000 if she would take this position
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:18.160]  when she finally was approved and went to washington to take a position janet said now uh and called
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.160]  of my name said you you cannot talk about certain things if you're going to come here i know you
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:30.880]  are a christian but she said you cannot talk about abortion you cannot talk about homosexuality
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:37.520]  you cannot talk about uh and you cannot disagree with the president administration in any manner
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:43.520]  uh but she said we'd like you to take the job well this individual very strong christian said
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:49.920]  i'm sorry janet i can't give up my christian convictions for the sake of $170,000 a year
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:57.360]  she said i can't take the job as a result didn't last week this individual was back in washington
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.960]  again trying to raise money of trying to get some grants for some of her hispanic organizations
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.680]  and janet apolitano heard that she was in washington janet called her on the phone and said would
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:14.640]  you please let's have lunch together they did i think it was thursday of last week this was
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.520]  recent i'm not talking about two three four five weeks ago i'm talking about last week
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:25.600]  this individual just got back to phoenix and she said in the close of the conversation janet said
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:31.920]  now i am only saying this to some very close friends of mine and she said i want you to go back
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:38.560]  to phoenix and the first thing i want you to do is store in your house six months supply of food
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:45.040]  and water immediately and this individual said janet why she said i can't tell you she said
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:51.040]  something is about to happen she said go back and take care of this right now uh this was very
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:57.600]  urgent and this was thursday of last week if i remember correctly folks you've got to understand
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:03.520]  that what alex is saying on his show what you're hearing on info was this is not fantasy out there
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:10.960]  someplace this is for real these people are ready to do some very drastic things and fortunately
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:17.200]  because of the elitist whom i know and if not over these 35 years one of them now is terminal and
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:24.320]  just about to die they're giving me this information and i am passing it on to you i hope that you
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:30.480]  will take action and do something about it janet said to this lady go home get six months supply
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:35.120]  of food and water let me stop you there let me stop you there let me stop you there because this
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.440]  is important and i'm not saying that she didn't say this i believe it this person contacted you
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.200]  and and and it'll be pretty easy for folks to figure out who she is but
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:51.040]  i remember in january and february of last year 1999 year and a half ago or more
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:57.360]  we had emergency managers we talked to newspaper people that talked to emergency managers indiana
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:03.920]  vermont texas uh new york state we even got documents this is before the flu broke out
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.040]  they were saying oh this is only for your sheriff this is only for your police chief this is only
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:14.080]  for your threat fusion center this is only for your mayor there will be a flu pandemic it will
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:19.040]  kill millions martial laws coming and prepare for war with the american people harden all your
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.720]  facilities we wrote stories we did the interviews it all okay then a few months later in april
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.360]  in the wrong hemisphere wrong time of year a novel flu the top scientist that was engineered
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:35.200]  popped up but it was a hoax it so again they use fear to get everybody to do what they want
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:40.320]  it or they test the fear and then it's about really giving you a shot that's had other deadly
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:46.720]  things added to it that is a binary weapon so i'm not all i'm saying is i believe she told
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.800]  her this i believe she called you and told you this and i know this is what the elitist
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.000]  you know that i read about the paper and also have chance to talk to
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:59.920]  say that you know they've been told for whatever reason war depression you know get ready
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.600]  and we know the government's always building bunkers and wait this with something that is
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:12.000]  happening and you follow this for yourself on the national news insider trading now let me try to
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.080]  explain it if i may on the stock market there's the average ordinary everyday jondo that trades

[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:50.960]  and one what is it that these the elitists many of them and these corporate heads what is it that
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:44:00.720]  they know that you and i don't know why they bailing out continuum well i was told by my elitist
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:09.360]  friend and i recorded it on dvd uh that by 2012 the dollar will be dead what is it that these people
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:15.280]  know they know what's about to happen they know that we're going to a world currency they know
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.480]  that the dollar is on its way out russia knows it china knows it that's a reason they didn't
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:26.480]  sign their agreement for crude oil and natural gas using dollars instead they said we're going
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:31.280]  to use another currency they're looking to the future because they know what's going to happen
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:39.360]  the elitist have it already already have stated to me that by 2012 the dollar will be dead folks
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:45.120]  you better prepare anything that you're going to do with your dollars you need to do them now
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:51.280]  because you may not have the opportunity the dollar is crashing very rapidly this this is very
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.240]  obvious that something is in the wind that the elitist are doing now they don't want to wait
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:02.480]  until the american people get so angry and upset that they start a revolution they want to bring
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.920]  it about in such amount that you will be so cool you won't be able to do anything let me read you
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:13.920]  the three statements that he gave to me just under two years ago he said within two years you will
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:21.440]  not recognize america i'm reading him verbatim again and i recorded this on dvd i'm so glad i did
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:27.040]  so nobody can ever doubt it he said again by 2012 the dollar will be dead again in the same
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:33.680]  conversation he said within two years nearly everyone will be working for the government
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:38.720]  this is before the takeover of general motors and price for an aig and and the bank problems
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:44.400]  that we had told the end of the bush administration that before health care do you realize that all
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:48.960]  of these things are coming to pass exactly as this individual told me they would happen
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:56.800]  so amazing continuing let's look at the iran situation what do you tell you when i ran that's
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:03.360]  the big one i am so glad you asked about this alex because i ran right now is critical you
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:10.080]  remember that two years ago and again i recorded this on my dvd series and i said everybody thought
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:16.080]  we wanted one without ran two years ago we had all of our our air force our navy uh marines
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:22.080]  everybody a battle ready right out there in the persian gulf and nearly every talk show host and i
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:27.120]  as a talk show guest was saying we're about to go to war with our rent and i was on the phone
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:32.160]  with this elitist friend of mine one day and he said no it's not going to happen for a couple years
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:37.440]  but that was a couple years ago yeah and then one year ago nearly everybody was getting ready for
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:43.200]  it again and he said the same thing he said chaplain it is not time for war with our ran yet
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:50.400]  well i'm changing my tune all together it's now but it's it's time they are within three
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:57.840]  folks please jot this down you are within three to four months of and i'm putting this it just
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:05.840]  as as positively as i can in a manner that they would say the elite world a middle east crisis
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.360]  within four to five months time it is now before i said you have nothing to worry about
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:16.480]  i'm telling you now you're within four or five months at the time that they want this it is time
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.720]  well i don't even know what to say to that because so much almost everything that this
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:30.480]  individuals told you has been dead on uh very few things have not been dead on and uh you know he
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:37.440]  said no war with iran now now he's saying they are going to do it he says they want a conflict in
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:43.600]  the middle east now this could be with israel this could be concerning that the west bank
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.880]  this could be many different things they want a conflict but don't focus your attention on that
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:54.160]  folks i go back to what i said at the beginning of the program today please don't allow these
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.440]  little conflicts and yeah but an attack on iran every major analyst talks about two hundred
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.440]  dollar a barrel four hundred dollar a barrel i mean it runs the gamut of two hundred and above
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:10.160]  i mean that would do your oil the situation right there but watch china and russia don't get so
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:15.440]  involved in watching what takes place in the middle east that you know i understand that they've
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.440]  made these oil deals and and china's shifting away from dollars and so is russia that's all
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.600]  mainstream news my issue is what else did he say was going to happen with china and russia
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.360]  well naturally china is not going to be our best friend from this point on
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.600]  they're cashing out they they don't want our t-bills anymore they're not coming to the federal
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:39.120]  reserve auctions and many of you will remember that i warned you about this a year and a half ago
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:44.080]  when this individual was on the phone with me and he said whenever other countries stop buying our
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:49.760]  t-bills and our federal reserve auctions that the dollar is going to collapse because it nobody
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:55.440]  to back it up now the federal reserve is buying their own t-bills back again and monetizing the
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:01.280]  debt in a different manner we are in everything this man told me in the past two years has
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:06.640]  happened to us like that now watch china because china is not going to continue buying our currencies
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:12.400]  instead they're going to gold and silver okay you ready there's the next one gold and silver all
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:19.040]  of my goodness people i want you i beg to be you two years ago to buy gold and silver now folks i
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.320]  don't sell gold and silver i don't represent any gold and silver dealer or company you couldn't buy

[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:36.640]  i am telling you what i have been told gold and silver when i warned you two years ago it was
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:45.360]  600 to 650 dollars an ounce today is 1350 dollars an ounce and it's still cheap where is gold and
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:52.720]  silver going here is the prediction the currency of the elite is gold and silver they are not going
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:50:00.320]  to allow anything to control it nor to disturb it i warned you years ago gold and silver and i've
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:07.840]  just been told it's going up up up up up up can i say it any planer you have seen nothing yet the
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:14.080]  price of gold and silver is going so catastrophic about what it is today you have never seen the
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:20.560]  like it is the i was told by this elite is that the only place that you could protect your assets
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:27.760]  is in gold and silver and even at 1350 dollars an ounce it still is cheap compared to what you're
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:34.480]  going to be paying for it a year from now and that's what he told you yes it's going to continue to
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:39.760]  go up and up and up there is no end to this it is the only thing you can't depend on real estate

[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:37.280]  mortgage scandals that are going on right now go ahead Lindsey Williams it's by the providence of
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.400]  god that i know what i know let me stress to every person out there in the listening audience
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:48.240]  i was invited to be the chaplain on the trans-elastic oil pipeline and got to know these people back
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:54.720]  35 years ago they're now old most of them retired and they have been willing to tell me these things
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:01.440]  i pass on to you only what i feel by the providence of god i've been given so that you can be properly
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.400]  warned and know the issues you won't get information like this from the national media
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.360]  you won't hear it any other place i don't know of any other person on the face of the earth
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:17.040]  that one of these elitists talks to as he has been willing to talk to me over the past two years
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:22.960]  time one of the issues that has been so prominent lately is a mortgage crisis and let me tell you
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:29.280]  what they the elitists have planned they planned it way back into eighties and you exactly what
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:36.640]  they were doing this is not happening by chance every bit of this is by design it is mbs you'll
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:43.280]  be hearing this word more and more mortgaged backed securities they started these teaser loans
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:50.480]  these interest only all the modern-day method of mortgaging now that's both for residential
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.720]  and commercial real estate they knew when they started issuing these loans that it was going
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:04.400]  to wind up exactly where it is today and it is estimated that the mortgage backed securities
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:12.000]  issue is is as high as 45 trillion dollars a professor and the university from the northeast
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.240]  i gave the statistic this past week it's mind boggling what they've done is they have taken
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:22.800]  your house mortgage they've taken the residential and the commercial mortgages and they've sliced
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:28.400]  them and they've diced them and without having paperwork they only had oftentimes computer
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:35.440]  interest to prove that they had the right to be able to do this they have sold these things to
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:42.240]  everything from from kitchen funds to mutual funds to banks to insurance companies to branch
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:47.760]  to england they've sold them all over the world and they've used them for bartering and trading
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:56.400]  and it's oftentimes what what you hear about as the the secret instrument so to speak is going
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:05.520]  on today now what is the end result of this going to be folks this this is so when i heard this i
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:12.320]  literally was mind boggled uh eventually the government will have to stay out to step in and
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:19.040]  bail this industry out uh there is no way that and they want it this is what this the end goal
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:25.360]  of this is for this crisis to become so critical now you remember only about two weeks ago bank
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:32.080]  of america chase uh a number of other lending institutions uh said we're not going to any
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:39.360]  longer do make any foreclosures we're not going to sell any foreclosed mortgages on houses and then
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.760]  just the beginning of this week they came back and changed it all together and said we're starting
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:51.360]  all over again they are scared to death the lending institutions have they have repossessed
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:57.600]  property they've turned around and resold that property illegally now please listen to this if

[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:16.400]  property i don't want to frighten you but if you bought anything repossessed from one of the

[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:27.440]  proper title they don't have the warranted deeds they did not get the paperwork from the counties

[01:58:54.960 --> 01:59:00.080]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:04.960]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:10.640]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:15.040]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:20.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:24.960]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:30.320]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:34.800]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[01:59:46.800 --> 02:00:05.840]  1-877-327-0365 waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network big brother
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:14.960]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:24.800]  on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones this is so important that we're
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:29.760]  just going to keep lindsay for the rest of this third hour we may even have to do a part two
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:36.320]  coming up tomorrow or next week but everything lindsay's covering from his top global of source
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:42.000]  has either come true or partially true and everything he's saying i can analyze from
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:49.680]  the outside we've been predicting for forever and now it's here but from the analyst i've talked to
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:55.920]  from my own view we know the top globalist above even the banks engineered this bubble
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:00.640]  to then hold the world hostage to bankrupt all the pension funds to steal all the retirees money
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:05.920]  and then hold you hostage and say give us even more power let us raise taxes to prop all this up
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:11.280]  or it's all going down but you notice as you prop it up it just continues to cascade into more
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:17.680]  crises and in my notes here feds will own every mortgage in america that's the plan the global
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:22.000]  expect the money on the way up then they get the mortgages bailed out two years ago again and again
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:28.960]  and again and then it clouds all property rights law not just here but all over the world and they'll
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:33.360]  say okay we'll fix your mortgages but they already passed a law two weeks ago that obama hadn't signed
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:39.040]  yet epoch ove he pocket vetoed it meaning he can bring it up after the election in a few weeks
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:43.680]  and they're saying he's going to do that to allow banks to take houses without proper titles so
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.640]  that's the that's the pitch oh we'll fix all this we'll fix the banking system where it's all going
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:58.800]  down but let us take property without any real deed without chain of title and then the precedent
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.960]  set for even more looting and stealing then we have the executive orders of bush and obama
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:08.800]  saying for any crisis including economic and pd51 the presidential decision director says the same
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.120]  thing the congress can be suspended for six months the president could do anything he wants
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:17.040]  europe has passed similar laws we're about to go to break lindsay and then take calls but
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.480]  finishing up with the mortgage issue and what he told you the elitist have engineered this they
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:28.720]  know exactly what they're doing they want a crisis to grow so big that they're basically just waiting
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:33.520]  until it can grow so large that they can say to the federal reserve you've got to bail us out
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:36.800]  of course they'll do it through the treasury of the united states of america like they've
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.720]  done the other bailout programs of gn in christland and aig and they'll say there's no way the world
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:49.200]  is going to collapse uh the sky is going to fall in and so as a result you can expect in the future
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:55.600]  and this is what the elite want they want the government to step in and bail out these mortgage
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:02.000]  backed securities and it's going to take an original bailout somewhere between the tune of two and
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:09.120]  seven trillion dollars that's the original bailout it could go as far as forty high five trillion
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:12.880]  if they bail out everything that's out there now what's this going to bring about oh this is a
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:20.160]  scary part whenever this happens now this man told me two years ago and i couldn't comprehend what he
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:26.720]  was saying he said after two years you will be so poor and he said again after two years nearly
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:32.400]  everyone will be working for the government folks when they bail out this mortgage backed securities
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:38.880]  issue that we've got right now the elite will own the folks are you getting this the elite will
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:45.040]  own every piece of mortgage real estate in the united states of america both commercial and
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:50.800]  residential and you will make your house payment to the elite because they will own it through the
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.960]  federal reserve which they are and that's how they're taking houses that are even they're even
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:59.360]  taking houses that are paid for because the note was sold to so many people they're all coming to
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.800]  get it and that's right if you have bought a house within the past three years that was repossessed
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:11.440]  you probably do not own clear title to it and they can come in and take it you you will be their
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:17.440]  slave oh alex i don't know how to say to these no no that's how it works the government is real
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:23.920]  in the u.s releases the worm and says we got to take the web over they create the mortgage crisis
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:27.760]  and then say we got to take over to save it and then it only gets worse i mean this is what they do

[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:38.720]  30 minutes of calls or so uh we're going to get into some of the other things he told you that
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.400]  we haven't gotten to yet and some more details on the other big six or seven items one two three
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.800]  four five six seven items we haven't gotten into the religious world takeover and the fact that
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:54.160]  you may be bringing him to christ and waking him up as he dies of cancer but to be specific this
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:58.320]  may be the last info we get from this guy it's so important and it's really proven to be very
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:04.800]  accurate and then we'll recap it as well but why do you think he's telling you all this and he
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.320]  called you up two years ago to threaten you and say stop doing this to the oil company but then
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:13.920]  he gave you all this other data and said go ahead and tell folks that if you want i mean i gave three
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.880]  years of my life uh to be the chaplain to the elite of the world on the transit let's go all
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:23.440]  pipeline and there were two of these individuals that were very friendly with me when i was there
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:27.200]  some of them could have cared less it wouldn't have wiped their foot on me there were others two
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:33.600]  of them that did i think it's totally out of respect for who i i probably am the only person
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:39.200]  of my kind that these two individuals have ever come in contact with in their life you don't get
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:44.320]  to these people you you never get to know them you never get to talk to them on the phone and
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:49.600]  i think alex out of respect for what i did in being that chaplain and keeping in touch with
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.560]  them these 35 years they're giving me this information but you've also got to consider
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:59.680]  deathbed repentance now please you remember what happened to the thief on the cross christ
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:03.840]  was hanging there and two thieves were hanging there and one of the thieves looked at him and
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:09.680]  said remember me when you come into your kingdom it was deathbed repentance and i think that this
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:15.600]  individual has for the past two years knowing that he was sick now knowing that he's terminally ill
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:21.520]  i think that he has given me things that otherwise i would never know basically as you have put it
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:27.840]  it spilled it all and i this is why i think they give me this information you you're getting the
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:32.960]  latest you're getting the update you're getting what the elite are doing right now but they're
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:37.360]  this second plans are and everything that they're going to do from this point on absolutely let's
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:41.840]  go let's go right back we just produced absolutely let's go to these calls now let's talk to
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:48.640]  timon virginia tim you're on the air with lindsay williams go ahead lindsay i heard a lot of different
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:55.040]  topics you talked about and you touched base about the trade agreement between china and russia
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:15:01.680]  concerning oil well in my opinion that's one way of the chinese are hedging their bet against the
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:08.240]  middle east during conflict but the same standpoint russia is not part of the world economy they'll
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:16.000]  export oil and platinum but as far as russia's selling oil to china china is going to have to
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.960]  pay for it in gold or silver they won't accept the ruble because the rubles a joke as far as this
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:29.840]  nap to trade agreement with a common currency in the u.s that would be totally ludicrous for
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:35.120]  the u.s due to the fact that all the drug dealers across the border in mexico would just love it
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:39.760]  why they'd have a common currency and it would be hard for our federal government and our fbi
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:46.640]  to trace the funds that these hold on a minute hold on a minute tim uh this is in the news that
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:53.200]  china and russia have signed this deal uh but hold on let me i want to finish tim uh it's on
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:59.200]  record that china is exploring oil and gas even in texas i mean they're in africa they're in the
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:04.960]  middle east that they're everywhere they're in canada uh they're everywhere and that they're
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:09.280]  looking for oil and minerals they're now the biggest extractor of minerals in the world that
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:14.960]  they're they're building all the big facilities they're putting in the mines what last time i saw
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:20.160]  more than half of the mining going on australia is the chinese and and and almost all the new
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:28.080]  startups are chinese uh so all of that is going on uh and and then we have the north american union
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:34.320]  plan we have robert pasture at the cfr's plan we have the baler agreement with bush and fox and
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:39.840]  paul martin at the time five years ago so everything lindsey was saying on that front i mean that's
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:46.640]  all public so so i mean china is trading raw materials and and they've also got dollars euros
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:53.040]  yons i mean they've got their flush with cash to buy whatever they want and and these deals with china
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.920]  and russia are on record i mean you say i mean what are you saying tim well i'm just saying that
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:03.040]  you don't hear about a proliferation of chinese imports going to russia you don't hear about all
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:08.640]  these chinese goods that we have here in the u.s we don't hear about them in china or in russia
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:14.640]  you know you don't hear about those goods the cheap goods that we import from china that are on
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:20.720]  our stores and our various retail establishes across the country you don't hear about them inside of
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:26.000]  russia i mean russia is now the biggest oil and gas producer in the world that's i mean just search
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.600]  the term russia now the biggest oil and gas producer in the world it's abc news i mean you
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:36.160]  name it i mean i i'm really having trouble getting at what you're saying here tim well i'm doing all
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:40.640]  that value we don't give them to the deal that was made between china and russia and the reason
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:45.520]  no dollar value was given is because the dollar is not going to be used uh they'll find their own
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:51.600]  method of bartering trade or currency whatever they wish but the main thing is well no one can
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:56.400]  deny hold on no one can deny russia and not other things no one can deny there's a move away from
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:00.720]  the dollar i mean tim sum it up i've got to cut you off here in a second but sum up what you're
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:06.640]  saying what i'm saying is that the russia could manipulate the u.s economy any way they can they
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:12.240]  can sell gold below market price and make a profit they can sell it at six hundred bucks an ounce
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:16.080]  now i understand they would still make a profit okay tim i appreciate your call jack in tennessee

[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:36.960]  they have downplayed this bp has hired every scientist that went down there to investigate it
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.680]  and to put them on that payroll for years to come in order to keep them quiet this is a disaster

[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:33.840]  leaves kirk in illinois anything else any other questions uh yeah i'm glad you held me over uh
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:40.240]  yeah lindsay uh back uh one year and two days ago you were on this program and you mentioned that
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:47.440]  oil within the next two years was going to be the same roughly about the same price uh also
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:54.160]  you mentioned that war was planned after two years and i understand that they're gonna pump that up
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:00.880]  um well if i remember correctly lindsay it's all on record on his on his dvds and on this from this
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:08.720]  radio show uh he said enjoy oil prices they're not going to go up for at least a year and go on
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:13.200]  trips and enjoy yourself because my source told me after that it's going up and here we are a year
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:18.000]  later it's starting to go up that's what lindsay said lindsay yes that's exactly right alex that's
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:24.320]  what i said i said on your program i recorded it on my dvds and now of course i am told by
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:30.080]  this individual that they're ready to bring the price back up to 150 to 200 dollars a barrel
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:34.720]  and it'll take place in the near future you'll see it go back to four and five dollars a gallon
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:40.240]  to gas pump kirk does that answer your question all right yeah but the last one i had was nearly
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:43.920]  everyone will be a government employee could you flush that out a little more well he means
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:47.600]  that they're going to control the whole system so even if you're private sector you'll be beholden
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:52.160]  to them and be paying paying checks one way or another to them uh correct lindsay well let's
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:57.360]  just take an example your health care bill every doctor every dentist every nurse every hospital
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:02.000]  every person that works in the medical profession of any kind will be an employee of the federal
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.440]  government after the health care bill has taken place that means that every bank is going to
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:12.800]  likewise once they bail out this mortgage back security problem every bank every person that
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:18.400]  works for a bank everybody that has a pension fund you will basically get it from the elite
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  this is that goal is to totally control everything the name of the game is control
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:28.960]  okay kirk we'll now talk to howard in connecticut howard you're on the air thanks for holding
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:37.360]  this is howard yes um basically um having been just recently awoken to uh to all this
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:41.360]  tyranny that's around me having been blind for so many years this is like obviously a
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:47.920]  a big overwhelming thing um considering the the direction that we're we're going in this country
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:53.120]  you know with all of this tyranny and it's coming down very quickly how does somebody that's
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:58.720]  recently awakened such as myself hedge himself whose house he purchased for cash here in connecticut
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:07.760]  in 2005 that went down lost work had to mortgage the house had to lose money in the stock market how
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:14.160]  do i know that i realize all those traps how can i better prepare myself for this upcoming tyranny
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:18.480]  with my for my family well you know it's hard enough to analyze the enemy operations and and
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:23.120]  then it's even harder to analyze an individual who you don't know calling from connecticut about
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:29.120]  what your financial situation is what your local economy is like uh i mean i don't really give
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:33.040]  people individual financial advice had to i tell people what i think is coming what's going on
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:37.040]  what's happening we have a pretty good track record uh but lindsay what's your take on that
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:42.400]  my suggestion is and i'm not being prestigious at all listen to the alex you don't show every
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:47.440]  single day talk you dare miss a single program everything he's saying is bringing you up to
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:52.320]  date as of that minute as to what is happening and the best way you can prepare yourself and
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:56.560]  believe what you're hearing because you're not going to hear the truth from the national media
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.840]  you listen to info whereas an alex jones every day and over a period of time you'll be able to
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:07.600]  prepare yourself i mean i mean howard it's very complex i i don't know all your financial issues
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:12.800]  and you know i know my financial issues uh that are you know not going in the right direction and
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:17.840]  you know i'm so busy working that i don't really even carry out the decisions that i've made that
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:24.080]  are most important uh so i mean i don't i don't know everything and i'm not omnipresent so
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:28.800]  i don't really know what i could say for you to do howard just you know we need to cut taxes if
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:34.480]  the globalist cut taxes instead of raising them that would be the best thing to install the economy
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:40.880]  and they know that okay if you'd like to make decisions properly if you want to know what they
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:47.840]  going to do so that you can know what to do next i plead with you please get my six dvd set you
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:53.440]  probably haven't seen it and the cd that we're producing today of all this material plus more
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:58.480]  that i can't give in an hour and a half if you'll get these it'll help you to know what next decision
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:02.960]  to make well i mean knowledge is power i appreciate your call howard uh we're going to go to break

[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:53.600]  on this individual I wanted to see if any of your intel happens to correspond with some of the info
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:36:02.640]  that that I've gathered on this on this person um Jane Dixon the the American um chair or prophetess
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:10.080]  and she was asked what her most uh significant prediction was she didn't say it was the JFK
[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:18.320]  assassination where she called the White House and and more or RFK assassination uh where she saw the
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:22.320]  you know she she knew what what hotel was going to happen as and the time of day and everything
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:31.840]  she said it was the man born on February 6th 1962 now she was also she also said that that
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:37.040]  the third day an individual who came before him um who she characterized as kind of a
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:42.880]  a false prophet of the antichrist she said that that individual just like the regular the true
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:49.120]  prophet John the Baptist was born six months before Christ that the false prophet would also
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:56.560]  be born six months before and if you just do the math it goes back to august around august
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:05.120]  august 4th 1962 if if you take uh an account the location that this individual was born
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:11.760]  um and uh she said that that individual become president etc etc okay we gotta move we gotta
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:16.960]  move we gotta hold on uh like I want to hear all this but we gotta go quick so so go ahead

[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:08.960]  and then it's like they just keep rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling and then I just
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:13.680]  say who are you talking about or what are you getting at and he just laughs and hangs up the
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:18.800]  phone it's it's bizarre and then I'll be bad I'll be the Illuminati or something you know because

[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:30.000]  marvelous job I don't think anybody's a question what you're doing well I mean specifically uh the
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.880]  elite is into the occult you say you're trying to get your source of former big three oil CEO
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:40.480]  to you know come to Christ uh that's the one issue we haven't talked about this devil messiah
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:46.960]  let's talk about that now it is so important I uh the devil's messiah I you've heard me give it on
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:51.600]  your program before in depth I wanted to give you one illustration of how they actually joined
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:58.320]  this training right now uh last weekend my family and I were up in Yabba Park County which is just
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:03.920]  north of where we live here in Arizona and I was with the pastor called pastor placidly they're
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:09.520]  just built a new church building and the they made me pastor said they made pretty good friends
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:14.160]  with one of some of the individuals at the building and zoning board well he went back in to take care
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:19.200]  of all of his final paperwork and details the other day now this is days ago this didn't have
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:24.080]  months ago this happened days ago and pastor placidly said Lindsay you've got to know what
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:28.800]  this individual said to he said in confidence pastor said I want to tell you something he said
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:35.600]  Yabba Park County has just put in an ordinance stating that if anybody makes a single complaint
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:39.200]  about your church they don't like the way your women dress they don't like the way you sing
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  you're singing we don't care what it is if any complaint is made about your church to Yabba Park
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:50.400]  County we have an ordinance now that states that we can come in padlock the church door
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:55.040]  you even though you built that building even though your church owns it even though it's yours
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:00.560]  we have an ordinance stating one complaint we can padlock the door you can never hold another
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:05.280]  worship service there we have a right to do that we just want you to be careful so this doesn't
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:11.120]  happen to you the elite i believe and by the way they've already put this also into maricopa county
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:16.880]  it was in the newspaper about mason arizona just a few days ago in the arizona republic
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.400]  i believe that they're putting in this ordinance probably all across america and hold on hold on
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:26.480]  hold on about earlier excuse me be able to close these churches down
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:33.040]  lindsay specifically because i didn't know about this and i want to be able to search it
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:38.880]  so we can pull it up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers lindsay specifically you're saying
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:44.960]  they're passing ordinances where counties can shut down churches just outside of any process of law
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:51.280]  that sounds like you know communist china or something 20 years ago uh uh where is this
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:56.480]  happening is this confirmed give me a search term so i can look this up uh i will talk with
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:00.560]  your producer after the show today i'll be more than happy to give him the name of the pastor
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:05.520]  he can verify names and you have a part county and every bit of it you'll have how do you spell
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:16.160]  that if you want it how do you spell that county uh i think it's y a v a p a i y a v a v a i but let
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:19.760]  me get this correct and then i'll give it to you okay where is that
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:29.040]  and Arizona in arizona okay guys search the term for county search the term uh for the county uh
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:34.800]  uh ordinance uh for churches and i'm sure it'll be in the news or it may just be being announced
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:38.720]  there locally and we'll find out about it soon but i mean lindsay specifically what did he tell you
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:42.400]  about this religious world leader you've talked about this before what's the latest on what he
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:48.240]  calls the devil's messiah well they are it's a religious control basically that's what we're
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:56.080]  talking about not only is their program uh government and political and monetary such as
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:01.520]  we've talked about in the mortgage crisis and so on they definitely have what was referred to me
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:07.920]  back about two years ago devil's messiah and as a result i did an entire section on it on one
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:13.840]  of your programs one day how they're working through 501c 3 organizational status with churches
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:20.320]  how that it also is in our schools what they're doing with introducing evolution years ago
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:25.760]  every bit of this is a part of that total pretty okay basically here's the way he put it
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:32.480]  he said we had to remove the god that america was founded on from society in order to bring
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:41.120]  about our new world order that was their statement and that's how the devil would do it we see the
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:46.560]  world council of churches the national council of churches openly funded by carnegie ford and
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:52.720]  rockefeller foundations they go in and now all the big church is catholic a lot of baptist
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:58.960]  methodus you know bill gates is good eugenics is good open borders is good uh you know the
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:05.600]  family's bad they are turning these into devilish propaganda arms and folks the devil isn't going
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:12.240]  to show up in a red pajamas like anton levé with a little black goatee the devil comes as an angel
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:17.040]  of light and whether you believe in god or not the un and everybody else at the global level
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:20.800]  has announced they want a one world religion the pope has announced they want a one world
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:27.840]  religion the last one and this is the system that is being pushed where they come at you
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:32.720]  with this world religion and they've had a democratic house members talking about this
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:38.240]  just in the last week conures and others and so there's no doubt with the clergy response teams
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:41.840]  they've covertly taken over with the faith-based initiative most the churches in this country
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:48.480]  and they use the expression to me devil's messiah now whether you you will hear it from another
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:53.600]  or not you may not because naturally this is really getting down to the hard core of it
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:58.400]  you have to keep in mind i've been a minister of the gospel for 50 years i'm in my seventies
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:04.080]  but i'm still very active and this man uses expressions to me that you might not hear although
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:10.960]  devil's messiah and it includes an entire program or a whole facet of their perversion
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:17.280]  which they have to do in order to bring in the new world order they cannot bring the devil's
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:22.000]  messiah to a righteous people well of course they've got a perverted religion of course they've
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:25.040]  got to go through the back door and take over the churches to do this that happens in every
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.520]  authoritarian system i wonder if that caller was laughing because he's implying barack obama is the
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:34.400]  antichrist but barack obama wasn't born in 62 like that guy was saying if that's who was talking
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:41.520]  about he was born august 4th 1961 and you know if he is the devil he's certainly getting destroyed
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:46.160]  politically uh but it's just you know i'm just sticking to the new world order and what i can
[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:50.000]  prove ladies and gentlemen uh let's go back to the calls very interesting information from
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.960]  lindsay williams uh let's go ahead now and talk to sue in texas sue you're on the air
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:02.240]  hi alex and lindsay thank you for your time and i'll try to be quick uh while while i wonder if
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:07.280]  if a good election results would be able to put a stop to all of this madness that's the children
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:14.640]  speaking of my question is is uh two quick ones will we be able to pay our property taxes with
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:22.640]  gold if we already own our home and number two uh can you give an estimated date when the martial
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:26.480]  law will go into effect all right let me break that down because i want to get lindsay's take on it
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:30.320]  it's not that you pay your mortgage in gold whatever the new currency is or whatever the
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:36.480]  devaluation of the dollar is you when you cash the gold or silver in you will get what the money
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:42.080]  is worth at that time but if you just save money it will then be devalued under hyperinflation
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:46.960]  so you'll still be paying for your mortgage in dollars it's just now the dollars are sub-denominated
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:52.480]  in the imf world bank s dr on the subject of martial law they're turning on the fusion centers
[02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:58.560]  nationwide the cia runs them there they got the national guard regular army in them they federalize
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:02.960]  your police they use the cameras and license plate readers and face scanners going in the
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:08.160]  town where i live to track everything you're doing and it's total tyranny so we're already under
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:12.160]  martial law when they're taser and old ladies for no reason when they're training cops to break
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:17.200]  people's heads if they talk back to them this is martial law but but when will a total collapse
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:21.360]  and troops rolling out on the streets happen happened at katrina they're beta testing and
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:27.280]  conditioning this is all a creeping death lindsay williams yes you're correct and i was told by the
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:33.280]  elitist that by 2012 the dollar will be dead now you say what will i do about my taxes well
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:37.520]  they won't have to have something in order to trade with you've got to go to the grocery store and buy
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:42.800]  with something whether it's a new world currency whatever it may be a NAFTA currency well you
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:47.760]  merely take your gold that is already going to three and four thousand dollars an ounce and turn
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:54.320]  around and and buy and and purchase or get the inflated currency and pay your taxes with it what
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:59.040]  we're trying to say is the only thing that is going to remain stable that you can despair you
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:05.360]  ask that's in according to what the leaders have told me is gold and silver sue does unanswer your
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:12.400]  question see in order to pay my taxes pardon me in order to pay my taxes then i'll have to convert
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:19.200]  then convert my gold to the new world currency correct okay that's what i was wanting to figure
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:24.320]  out all right so you can pay them at least you have something tangible that you can use where if
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:28.800]  you have the federal reserve note you won't have anything because it's going to be dead by 2012
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:34.160]  you've lost it if you have a pension fund whatever it may be it's gone but you'll still have that
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.640]  and notice all this is happening this is all happening right as the federal reserve charter
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:43.120]  ends so they can start the new system sue great question david arizona you're on the air with
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:51.520]  lindsay williams okay maybe david doesn't want to talk let's talk to mark and texas mark you're on
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:58.800]  the air right can you hear me yes i can hi mark okay um i have two quick questions um first of all
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:04.560]  on the world leader you saying um these new world globalists that they have a plan so i'm guessing
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:07.920]  that they probably have a plan when they're going to bring them in i'm guessing this is probably
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:13.920]  after 2012 my other question is i heard i'm not sure if any of you can confirm this i heard that
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:21.920]  flight 93 is actually still active have any of you heard about that lindsay i at 593 i don't know
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:28.160]  about uh the world leader the bible does say that he will appear on the scene i don't know who he is
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:34.720]  i don't know when he will appear i know that uh it appears that we arrived until the end of all
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:39.280]  because the elite is so they're telling me already to draw the string and put things now i didn't
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:44.480]  say this two years ago two years ago i said you've got two more years you don't right now they are
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:49.520]  ready to draw the string they are ready to put into force all of their activities but god can
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.840]  change that and people repenting and getting active can change that so it's not it's not a foregone
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:49:01.760]  conclusion but if we don't take action it is uh let's go ahead and talk to um jack in wisconsin
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:07.840]  you're on the air hi um in my local area they've been spraying chemtrails a lot recently or some
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:13.040]  kind of aerosol clouds in kanosha we're seeing in caledonia and uh i just wanted to ask him if
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:18.160]  he has any kind of insider info on that and if there's any kind of solution we can take because
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:23.200]  most problems we've normally uh talked to our representatives but it seems like that may not
[02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:28.960]  be the solution here this elitist friend of mine has never been willing to get on such subjects as
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:34.160]  that he always sticks with me with a subject of oil something's happening in the worldwide
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:39.520]  financial market was taking place along those lines i have never been able to get them all the subject
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:48.640]  of chemtrails or containment centers even though i think they exist but they have never been willing
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:53.440]  to talk all right thank you thank you jay cannot jack uh william in michigan you're on the air

[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:41.760]  employ more than 500 people and we're talking about nafta in gap every bit of this is done by
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:46.880]  the elitists they have talked with me about how they have intentionally moved things out of the
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:51.920]  united states of america in order to bring about what they yet have to do which i haven't even talked
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:57:00.560]  about today for instance in 2008 1.2 billion cell phones were sold worldwide with american names on
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:05.680]  them not one of them was manufactured in the united states of america is this telling you anything
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:12.080]  about what these elitists are doing del has announced plans to dramatically expand its plant in china
[02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:19.200]  with an investment of over 100 billion dollars over the next decade del is closing its last
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:25.920]  manufacture so it's total deindustrialization total deindustrialization by design yes the last

[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:54.880]  folks we are facing some things in america that you need to prepare for and alex is helping you
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:58.560]  do that through his program every day well if you were going to bring down the united states to
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:03.600]  fold it into a one-world tyrannical government you would have to do it by stealth and over time
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:08.000]  and deindustrialize and break up the family and build up a huge paramilitary force against the
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:12.720]  people make them so poor they're dependent and bankrupt their financial system they they've done
