[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  It's Sunday. July 8th, the year is 2021.
[00:29.000 --> 00:38.000]  More top scientists have come forward confirming that the mRNA injections are designed to attack women's ovaries, rendering them sterile.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  We're going to be laying it all out here for you today.
[00:43.000 --> 00:54.000]  But first, let's look at a few flashbacks of the last decade where we predicted from the Rockefeller Foundation documents and other insider reports what they've now carried out.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  The Alex Jones Show. There is a war on for your mind.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful.
[01:03.000 --> 01:12.000]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute, because I've had chills since last night.
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[01:17.000 --> 01:26.000]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  Everything that's in the other documents.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  But this dovetails of all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  And the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers.
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.000]  So many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this fire.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  And to give me the strength to carry on.
[02:16.000 --> 02:25.000]  Because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and on the line.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  I know why. Because it's scary.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[02:44.000 --> 02:55.000]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  Mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[02:58.000 --> 03:09.000]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  It should take over your life.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  I mean, what else?
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  What else could it do?
[03:21.000 --> 03:33.000]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[03:37.000 --> 03:45.000]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  If you lose or draw, you need to choose a sign.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  Infowars, Tomorrow's News Today.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  Welcome, my friends.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  Welcome again on this live Sunday broadcast.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  We're going to be here for the next two hours.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  Then we're going to have Sunday live with the great Owen Schreuer, 6 to 8 p.m. central time.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  Well, to say that the plot has thickened would be an understatement.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  Everything the globalists said they do in their own internal reports, they're now carrying out.
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.000]  They're now preparing lockdown to worldwide and the further collapse of the third world and the further destruction of the economy here in the West.
[04:25.000 --> 04:35.000]  China has been completely open for business the entire time and has publicly bragged that they did this with the deep state to destroy all their competition worldwide and take over.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  This is absolute complete economic warfare.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  It's also coming out even mainstream news, though, buried in the financial reports and the medical reports.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  But insurance companies are very interested in this.
[04:45.000 --> 04:55.000]  So it's in their financial statements that the majority of people dying of COVID now have had the vaccine and almost half of those getting COVID are getting an after they've had the shot.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  Yes, the vaccine's causing.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[05:21.000 --> 05:33.000]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[05:40.000 --> 05:50.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity.
[05:57.000 --> 06:04.000]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  It's live Sunday, July 18th, worldwide broadcast.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:35.000 --> 06:45.000]  And you have to understand that when I cover all this news and information here, 95% of it is out of the Davos Group's own mouth.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  It's out of the Rockefeller Foundation's own organization.
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  It's out of the Carnegie Endowment.
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.000]  And I'm going to show you today who's running the forced inoculation push, who's covering up all the deaths from the so-called vaccines,
[06:57.000 --> 07:04.000]  who's covering up all the known treatments for COVID-19, other viral infections, who's really bringing in a medical tyranny.
[07:04.000 --> 07:12.000]  And it's the Rockefeller Foundation that wrote Operation Lockstep back in 2010,
[07:12.000 --> 07:20.000]  breaking down how a worldwide dictatorship would be brought in of the corporations in the UN using the fear of a virus.
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  They talk about face masks would be a symbol of submission and authoritarianism and how they would sweep aside the old republics.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  I'm actually going to show you the document coming up.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  Why is that important?
[07:31.000 --> 07:38.000]  Well, they rolled out the Surgeon General and his big military outfit to say,
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  we're working with the Rockefeller Foundation to shut down people's speech.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  And we want medical groups and scientists that are criticizing us to be silenced.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  In fact, Biden's got a document out.
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  He wants them arrested because if you're going to carry out the orderly sterilization and killing of billions of people,
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  which this so-called injection is now confirmed to be triggering,
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  well, you better be able to suppress people from raising the alarm that they're being maimed, being sterilized, and yes, being killed.
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  That's all coming up.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  But, you know, just don't listen to me today in the year 2021.
[08:13.000 --> 08:22.000]  Listen, Alex Jones, in 2018, from, again, the Rockefeller Foundation who's running all of this with Bill O'Ball in the Gates.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  And I've explained that over and over again.
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.000]  And it did funny.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  I told you the Rockefeller Endowment, the Carnegie Endowment, they're the robber barons.
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  They run it all.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  And notice the Carnegie Endowment now runs the CIA publicly.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  And the Rockefeller Foundation runs the medical response and says we better silence Americans.
[08:37.000 --> 08:44.000]  They've been planning this war on the free market, on America, on our values to replace it with global government.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  Because America's got the fall of that to happen for over 100 years.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  And now we're in its crosshairs.
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.000]  So here I am, just a short little clip from 2018.
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  The globalists have shed in their white papers, in their own UN documents,
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  that they want to create race-specific bio weapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  A lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release bio weapons, claim that they're naturally occurring,
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  and then use that as the cover for civil emergency, societal control, crackdowns on free speech.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  Obama put the Internet kill switch in five years ago.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  And he got confronted by Congress.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  He said, well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  Just type that in.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  CDC says Internet kill switch is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out,
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  and they have to control panic and direct every website in the U.S. to one government announcement.
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bio weapon release could be the thing they'd release
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  to bring in a world government to counter a global problem.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  And the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Override big tech censors.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  Click the link below and share this important report.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  Oh, no, no, no. I don't even know what this is. How'd you get here?
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  I just caught you, American. You visit a Band-Aid video.
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you. Do what CNN says and do not visit Band-Aid video,
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  or I have to hurt your eyes.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  It comes from China.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  So, yeah, that's a clip from 2018 with a little promo point there about Band-Aid video
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  and getting around the censors, because here it is.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  Told you about this plan years ago. It was in the Obama kill switch plan.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  It was in congressional hearings and debates.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  And they passed a law, but they never implemented it to take over during a medical emergency or other emergency.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  The entire Internet, they either turned it off.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  The Russians have put this in. The Chinese already have it as well.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  Or they can direct you to quote only authoritative websites.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  Or they can take over the front page of all their websites and put their message there and or redirect.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  Well, then they announced this last week. Democrats want to monitor your text
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  and use aggressive fact checkers to dispel vaccine misinformation.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  And they now admit that congressional hearings.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  We told you about this last week, and then Tucker Carlson covered it.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  This last week, and that was a week and a half ago, this last week.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  Just a few days ago, you saw Saki and Biden and all the rest of them say,
[11:29.000 --> 11:38.000]  oh, it's the disinformation doesn't like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and all these scientists and all these, you know, former top academics
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  and others, chief scientist advisor, saying how dangerous this all is.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  They call them a hate group and white supremacist, the center for countering digital hate.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  That's why the big Biden report of a month ago, such a big deal,
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  national strategy for countering domestic terrorism.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  And what does it say right here? It says questioning lockdowns or forced inoculation
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  or the election or gun control or open borders is white supremacism.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  It's their definition.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  They're like, what's that have to do with it? Nothing.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  And then by extension, you are now a terrorist is the Pentagon.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  The CIA will frustrate you and quote, take out your networks.
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  And now you see Saki and Biden all over TV saying do exactly that.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  We're going to be laying all of that out for you.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  And here's some very, very important information.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  This is from zero hedge. It's on info wars.com.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  Now they are saying a Republican Party is the number one national security threat to United States of America.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  Biden administration officials and Homeland Security deputy directors have gone on TV, go read the link, the article.
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  It's got dozens of examples just this weekend and said the enemy is all Republicans.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  They're terrorists and we're going to have to round them up.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  You see, they're not going to carry out forced inoculation with the deadly poison and the destruction of the borders,
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  the bankruptcy of the country and let you speak and let you talk.
[13:08.000 --> 13:18.000]  They're preparing and have purged the military and are purging the FBI and control the Justice Department to have a head on war
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  if you expose their election fraud or don't want to take your deadly shot.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  That's why they're on the news going, oh, you don't take your vaccine, you're killing people.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  Oh, I thought you were protected when you took the vaccine.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  How is my not taking it?
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  You see, they now admit, oh, the Delta variant and others came out of mutations from the inoculated.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  Remember the New York Times, even NPR had the headlines six or seven months ago.
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  Experts worry that this type of vaccine could cause mutations and more deadly viruses.
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.000]  But who knows if any of it's even true, they lie about the PCR test, 94% are false positive.
[13:52.000 --> 14:01.000]  As soon as Biden got into office on January 20th, they turned the National Directive of the CDC for all the clinics and hospitals
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  to go from 40 cycles on the PCR test to 30.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  Well, at 40 cycles, you get about 94% false positive.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  At 30, you get no one positive.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  See how that works?
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  Oh, the cases are all gone because they turned the PCR test down.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  Then they turned the PCR test back up.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  All of its smoke and mirrors, all of its garbage, all of it is lie based on lie based on top of another lie.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  But here it is.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  Now they're saying Republican Party is the number one national security threat the United States of America.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  And that the CIA and FBI must take it out.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  Remember when I played the clips of FBI spokesperson on MSNBC saying,
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  I know this makes some of you get scared, but we need to take out members of Congress.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  They're the ones that are illegitimate.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  They're the ones that have hijacked the country.
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.000]  They're the ones declaring war and only American people are saying we're going to control your text messages, everything you do.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Oh, and it goes on.
[15:00.000 --> 15:07.000]  Look, just in the news of today, Tracy Stone Manning, President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management,
[15:07.000 --> 15:15.000]  helped edit a radical environmental newsletter that called for killing the heads of federal agencies and taking over the government by force.
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  But no need to kill them now.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  They've already taken control by fraud.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  Big article.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  Might want to check that out for yourself.
[15:21.000 --> 15:31.000]  Virginia PTA leader who declared let them die said kill any parents that don't like critical race theory teaching them that their white children are bad should die.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  They've had to resign.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  So there is some good news.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  And even Marco Rubio is waking up.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  He tells all the leftist in the squad that love communist fascism and the BOM move to Cuba.
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  If it's so great, we're going to break it all down today.
[15:46.000 --> 15:57.000]  And the incredible scientific prestigious stop reports for the most prestigious institutions in the world being suppressed that the so-called COVID vaccine is killing people and sterilizing them.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  Stay with us.
[15:59.000 --> 16:06.000]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years, deep earth crystal iodine, the good halogen.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  You must have it to live.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have it of iodine.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  We have X2 at two different bottles.
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  Same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[16:20.000 --> 16:27.000]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  I want to thank all of the supporters that have gotten these over the years.
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  They're amazing.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[16:38.000 --> 16:46.000]  So X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  But we're going to keep this cell going until it sells out.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.000]  Don't procrastinate.
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  Take advantage of this special right now at infowarstore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[16:59.000 --> 17:08.000]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[17:08.000 --> 17:17.000]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire has a lot of power.
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.000]  And I'm not using it. I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[17:26.000 --> 17:32.000]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[17:35.000 --> 17:42.000]  We've got a private label with info wars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them.
[17:42.000 --> 17:49.000]  And I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family.
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  And it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[17:57.000 --> 18:03.000]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead.
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  Good, bro.
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  The X2 does wonders.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  Honored talk to you.
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.000]  Awesome.
[18:41.000 --> 18:47.000]  So, firstly, I wanted to do was say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  So, just number one for a few years.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  I like that one. It works. It's not a joke.
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  Absolutely.
[18:56.000 --> 19:11.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[19:16.000 --> 19:27.000]  Super male vitality specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[19:27.000 --> 19:38.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  Yes.
[19:39.000 --> 19:51.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  So, what are you waiting for?
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  Go to the InFore Store.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  Super male vitality at InForeStore.com.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  Welcome back to this live Sunday transmission.
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  I really appreciate you all tuning in.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  There's been a process over the years.
[20:32.000 --> 20:41.000]  I've been on air 27 years where people over time have figured out that the longer they listen, the more they understand that I'm not just making this stuff up.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  I do so much research.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  I interview so many people.
[20:44.000 --> 20:52.000]  I immerse myself in studying history so much that we're right about 97% of the time.
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  And the majority of the time that we're wrong, things are worse than we thought.
[20:59.000 --> 21:06.000]  And then the other part of the time, I just randomly will scramble something in my brain from memory and just get it wrong or make a mistake.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  We all do that.
[21:07.000 --> 21:08.000]  We're all human.
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  The difference is I'm not up here trying to make mistakes.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  I'm not up here trying to lie to you, the globalist are.
[21:14.000 --> 21:24.000]  Now, I can tell you as a father and as a human being, I have empathy because having a conscience is the real mark of being human.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  And my most precious possession is that I have a very strong conscience.
[21:29.000 --> 21:42.000]  It is mind blowing to me how diabolical, how preplanned this entire takeover is in their own words and their own admissions.
[21:42.000 --> 21:49.000]  They've got every angle of this figured out except for you waking up and you saying no.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  If there's a free press, they all go to prison.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  They get indeed trouble.
[21:53.000 --> 22:09.000]  But they believe that the earth is overpopulated and that they've got to cause a controlled collapse ahead of humans overproducing, over-consuming and causing our own organic collapse.
[22:09.000 --> 22:17.000]  Now, you can debate whether that's true or not all day, but the globalist should not be able to sit there and play God.
[22:17.000 --> 22:27.000]  And I noticed they never cut back on their lifestyles and most of them, it turns out, are involved in pedophilia and the occult and generationally have done a lot of evil stuff.
[22:27.000 --> 22:36.000]  And they've been suppressing the development of really clean, good advanced technologies and have been actually suppressing people by claiming they control the environmental movement.
[22:36.000 --> 22:49.000]  They ignore all the serious environmental crises, like all the genetic engineering and all the cross species of manipulation that's going on that threatens the entire biosphere of the planet.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  At the end of the day, they're mad scientists.
[22:51.000 --> 22:57.000]  So I understand it's hard for you to hear all this news.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  I understand it's upsetting and it's depressing.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  It is for me as well.
[23:00.000 --> 23:12.000]  But the good news is we know what's going on and the good news is there's a God that created us that gave us free will and we know how this thing ends and that prophecy is being fulfilled.
[23:12.000 --> 23:22.000]  And so as negative as things are, we cannot feel the weight of the world on our shoulders and feel like that we've got to fix this and really drive ourselves to the ground.
[23:22.000 --> 23:36.000]  We've got to speak up, do the right thing, warn everybody, have courage, but then not feel guilty when we continue to see the evil expand because it's got to go through that process first.
[23:36.000 --> 23:47.000]  And then we're simply building up the countermeasures and the response and triggering the chain reaction that will end up bringing them down, but it's not going to happen overnight.
[23:47.000 --> 24:02.000]  And the reason I raise that point is I personally get very upset watching this unfold, very upset watching people be killed and maimed and attacked and lied to and then bankrupted and told they're non-essential.
[24:02.000 --> 24:17.000]  While the very group of murderers divide and conquer us along the lines of race and religion when they are the ones that absolutely want division and have a total predatory attitude towards us.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  And so it really gets to me.
[24:19.000 --> 24:31.000]  It makes me very, very angry, makes me very, very upset, and it makes me go into rages on air and off of air that are not healthy, that are not good.
[24:31.000 --> 24:40.000]  You know, ever since I was a teenager, when I'd go into a red rage, I would break a blood vessel in my right eye and it would always turn red.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  That's kind of like the warning light, and then that happened Friday.
[24:43.000 --> 24:53.000]  I got so mad just at all the things going on and so physically pissed off all day long that a blood vessel, the same one right here in my right eye, burst.
[24:53.000 --> 25:11.000]  And then that's always when I know that it's time to really take a break and pull back and just trust in God because, you know, these are real studies about 84% of women that take the vaccine having a miscarriage in the first or second trimester.
[25:11.000 --> 25:28.000]  These are real prestigious studies about the protein in the mRNA vaccines, the protein that it triggers attacking and migrating to the ovaries and then basically killing the ovaries.
[25:28.000 --> 25:46.000]  And then you can even pull up UN studies from 20 years ago where they talked about vaccines to attack the ovaries, sterile vaccines. Don't believe me, just type in different terms dealing with vaccines and birth control,
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  and you'll see a massive amount of UN and big pharma studies, and that's what's going on.
[25:53.000 --> 26:05.000]  And again, there's a baseline argument there that there are a lot of poor people and a lot of dumb people having a bunch of kids and they're aimless, they don't have any focus, and what are they going to do?
[26:05.000 --> 26:19.000]  But the globalists have set up a society to accentuate that ignorance and to accentuate that squalor, and then they use all that squalor as a weapon against what's left of the West because the globalists don't want any intellectual competition.
[26:19.000 --> 26:38.000]  They are so selfish in what full control of all human activity that they're actually pulling down all of the lighthouses that can guide in the ships of culture and of nations into a safe harbor.
[26:38.000 --> 26:55.000]  It is an attack on the Christian idea of building people up. It is a repudiation of that and a message of total social Darwinism, absolute complete ruthlessness.
[26:55.000 --> 27:12.000]  And so any listener tuned in does not have to just believe me or disagree with me or say, I think this is too much. You can go check every thing I've said.
[27:12.000 --> 27:30.000]  Thank God that suddenly a lot of people in Congress and a lot of other publications are figuring out, and Tucker Carlson has done shows on it, who's really the main populist leader right now when it comes to mainstream.
[27:30.000 --> 27:49.000]  He's leading the mainstream into reality, whereas I'm kind of like the mad prophet off in the wilderness, that they're understanding and discovering the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment and all these plans to carry out this operation.
[27:49.000 --> 28:01.000]  And that it really is a sterilization depopulation operation. It's an incredible weapon. It hurts the young, but it really targets the old. It causes heart attack, strokes, lungs to fail.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  It also basically destroys the ovaries.
[28:05.000 --> 28:21.000]  And it's so strong that they've had now over 100 times the deaths of all previous years combined on the VAERS reporting system. And remember, it's only a fraction of what's actually been reported.
[28:21.000 --> 28:34.000]  So we are witnessing, you always ask, like, why does Hitler engage in a holocaust or why did Mao kill, you know, 80 million of his own people? Because that's part of the plan. They wanted full control.
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  I mean, they were little farmers and people out on their own land that didn't want to be under the system's control, so they had to be killed.
[28:41.000 --> 28:51.000]  And so I'm really sorry this is happening. I'm sorry this is here, and I'm sorry to tell you the vaccine wasn't going to protect you from COVID. Now they admit that.
[28:51.000 --> 29:01.000]  You're going to take these shots if you want to go outside or have a job, because the shots are going to sterilize you and then finally kill you.
[29:01.000 --> 29:24.000]  The globalists are having their revolution, but for humanity has to have its revolution. We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[29:24.000 --> 29:36.000]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[29:36.000 --> 29:46.000]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of the dystopia.
[29:46.000 --> 29:59.000]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, good or evil. It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[30:16.000 --> 30:28.000]  There are two different bottles, the same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top. 60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[30:28.000 --> 30:39.000]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years, they're amazing, so that's a great deal for you to stock up on it, but this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[30:39.000 --> 30:47.000]  So, X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com.
[30:47.000 --> 31:10.000]  Hit the sell going until it sells out, it'll probably take about two weeks. Don't procrastinate, take advantage of this special right now at infowarstore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[31:17.000 --> 31:29.000]  Let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[31:29.000 --> 31:36.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where info wars comes in.
[31:36.000 --> 31:50.000]  You fund us, you support infowarstore.com, you get great products at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[31:50.000 --> 32:00.000]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the bar wire, so we can be the shock groups in the information war. Fund us at infowarstore.com.
[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the Info Wars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to infowarstore.com.
[32:09.000 --> 32:19.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to infowarstore.com.
[32:19.000 --> 32:33.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[32:33.000 --> 32:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health. Just one of these ingredients can be a life changing supplement for your health, and we packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com.
[32:45.000 --> 33:02.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day. I suggest that you do the same thing, and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95. That's 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[33:02.000 --> 33:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:21.000 --> 33:39.000]  Here's why I'm so upset and why I spend all my energy now just not getting angry. I knew the globalists were ruthless. I knew they were evil. I knew they were going to do some really bad things, and I'd seen them beta test depopulation in wars and evil all over the world.
[33:39.000 --> 33:51.000]  So I was really concerned. This is a big, powerful, evil mafia a thousand times more powerful than any other group other than Christians opposing them for every race, color, and creed.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  And then I saw them launch their attack a year and a half ago, and I knew what it was. We were right day one, and we told you new lockdowns were coming. The vaccine's not going to work.
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  It's going to attack all your organs. It's going to actually create new viruses in the body because we have all the top scientists that are actually on our side.
[34:07.000 --> 34:17.000]  That's the good news is we have like all the top scientists, all of them basically, except a few hacks like Fauci and others, and they all told us what would happen.
[34:17.000 --> 34:33.000]  And then it happened. And then now they're all saying, if you compare rat studies to human studies, if it killed the mice in a few months, they estimate two to three years where it's going to start killing all the humans.
[34:33.000 --> 34:40.000]  And Wolfgang Wudarg and Dr. Yenon, I've got all the reports right here.
[34:40.000 --> 34:53.000]  They said all this before one person was injected with it because they they've developed vaccines. These are the top guys.
[34:53.000 --> 35:13.000]  You know, I used to think about, because I covered at the time and I covered the trials and all about it, the deep water horizon, when BP ordered the engineers to not put concrete in the hole, and the engineers said 100% chance it blows up.
[35:13.000 --> 35:19.000]  And they still ordered them to do it. They followed the order and it blew up. And I used to think they were just arrogant and dumb.
[35:19.000 --> 35:27.000]  No, they knew what they were doing and had some reason to want to discredit oil companies or whatever, because, you know, BP's pushing the whole grain movement and carbon taxes.
[35:27.000 --> 35:41.000]  They did that on purpose. And that's what's hard for me to finally get to the level of is just how damn evil these people are.
[35:41.000 --> 35:49.000]  And you try to figure out why they're doing it. You'll never figure it out because they're following the devil's logic.
[35:49.000 --> 35:59.000]  So let me just get into the news, but it's just unbelievable because you turn on the TV and there's Biden stumbling around going, oh, you're going to get people killed if you don't take this.
[35:59.000 --> 36:05.000]  And then every study shows it's not a vaccine. It's super dangerous. It programs your body.
[36:05.000 --> 36:13.000]  Whether it's the J&J or the AstraZeneca or the mRNA with Moderna, they all do the same thing.
[36:13.000 --> 36:22.000]  Fauci did all these studies around the world decades ago and 10 years ago and eight years ago of every step of the way what this would do.
[36:22.000 --> 36:36.000]  And they told the vaccine makers in December before the story even broke, get ready to roll out your coronavirus COVID vaccines. And here is the blueprint we want you to make.
[36:36.000 --> 36:45.000]  You can make it any way you want, but you've got to have it have the body have an autoimmune response to this protein sequence.
[36:45.000 --> 36:54.000]  That is the shell of the virus, but also is in your ovaries, is in your brain, is in your lungs, is in your heart, is in your testicles.
[36:54.000 --> 37:04.000]  And then top scientists go, holy, the discoverer of HIV, the Nobel Prize winner goes, holy hell, 14 months ago.
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.000]  This is going to sterilize people and cause heart attacks and strokes.
[37:10.000 --> 37:17.000]  They all said that. But don't listen to Nobel Prize winners. Then we watched it happen.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  And what have they done to the Nobel Prize winner from France? What have they done to Wolfgang Wudhardt, the head EU advisor?
[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  What have they done to the former chief scientist at Pfizer? I've got all the articles right here.
[37:29.000 --> 37:42.000]  They block their videos and take down channels where even mainline news interviews them. When they have legislative hearings on it at the EU or in Florida or in Congress,
[37:42.000 --> 37:53.000]  Big Tech blocks Senate hearings with scientists saying this because there's no way they're going to launch this attack and get away with it if we're able to warn people.
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  They're jamming our communications. This is war.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  And for TV viewers, I put them all on screen for radio listeners. Go watch the stream at infowars.com.
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  It's shared. It'll be archived later. But yeah, there it is. Nobel Prize winner reveals COVID vaccine is creating variance.
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  Yeah, how many months ago was that? Scroll up.
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  And now it's all admitted. Even the New York Times all have admit that.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  That's from May.
[38:23.000 --> 38:32.000]  So I could sit here and go over all this news and I'm going to go over all the new stuff for you, but it's more of the same.
[38:32.000 --> 38:44.000]  Oh, sorry. Your COVID shots didn't work. You got to get more. There's a new variant. They were always going to have a new variant, a new variant, a new variant, a new variant, a new variant.
[38:44.000 --> 38:53.000]  To test God knows what on you, turning you into a guinea pig. I remember Bill Gates funded a study like five years ago on curing the common cold.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  And in the study, it said it'll take 10 shots a year to do it.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  You're not supposed to cure the common cold. It's how we exchange information with other humans and the earth.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  And then our body learns how to fight something, learns how to beat something and get stronger.
[39:07.000 --> 39:16.000]  It seems to make your immune system overall get weaker. It'll teach you how to defeat something, but it makes it weaker in the long term.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  That's what all the study shows. So what's happening is they're getting rid of our immune system.
[39:20.000 --> 39:26.000]  They're turning us into these kept corporate creatures that have to go back to them monthly. Yeah, there's the article.
[39:26.000 --> 39:33.000]  Now they want 10 shots a year. I told you that a year ago that they're going to want five to 10 shots a year. How did I know?
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  They came out of Bill Gates' own organization and that sucker runs the whole show.
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  But then they claim that, oh, we just don't have the science when we've got all the science here. They've lied to you.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  And if you have a memory, you'll remember all the lies they told you every step of the way.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  But let's just finish up this segment before I get into all the new COVID news and the new lockdowns are starting to announce around the world.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Now the Democrats admit it's coming here next. Told you.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  But let's look at this. National strategy for countering domestic terrorism. That's in June.
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  That's been out over a month now. I've been harping on that every day.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  So if you question lockdowns, you're a terrorist.
[40:11.000 --> 40:21.000]  And now here's the big zero-hedge article full of videos and links to all these Homeland Security officials saying Republicans are terrorists.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  The party should be outlawed. We should arrest Congress.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  I mean, they're going for a one-party dictatorship.
[40:29.000 --> 40:36.000]  And even saying the Democratic Party is working with Big Tech to read all your text messages and emails and decide what you can send and what you can't.
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.000]  I mean, that's what you do under total martial law. And that's mainline news now.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  God help us.
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.000]  And then again, report, Biden nominee edited radical eco-terrorist newsletter advocating violence against government officials.
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  But now she runs the BLM or she's about to.
[40:56.000 --> 41:01.000]  So now it's okay. What's she know about land management? Nothing but kicking you off of it.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Because China is the only place you can do business.
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.000]  Cancel Keystone Pipeline Company suing US for $15 billion.
[41:09.000 --> 41:16.000]  They paid $15 billion over a decade to build that pipeline to supply oil and gas to the United States.
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.000]  And now it's all shut off because they're not just waging war against Republicans or Christians or conservatives.
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  They're waging war against America. We're being shut down.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  This is 21st century war.
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  That's why the Virginia PTA leader said kill all the white people.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  Let them die for not wanting to be told they're evil and bad.
[41:35.000 --> 41:46.000]  That's why the Democratic Party came out defended the globalist backed Chinese backed Cuban government BLM backed them.
[41:46.000 --> 41:53.000]  And Marco Rubio is right. He said why don't you move to Cuba if it's so good BLM.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  The globalists are declaring war on America.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  They're declaring those of us that don't buy their bulls the enemy.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  And they're saying if you don't take the shot, you're killing other people.
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  And I thought the shot was protecting everybody who took it.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  So why am I killing them?
[42:08.000 --> 42:21.000]  And then the real science shows it's causing variants in viruses really the shedding that makes your body be attacked by a virus that mimics your own protein.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  What a genius weapon giving us autoimmune disease.
[42:24.000 --> 42:36.000]  Fauci was instrumental in the HIV pandemic. Of course, evidence has come out that the CDC at the time he was heading it up with the NIH was adding HIV into hepatitis shots in the gay men's.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  They'd be a good vector and share it.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  And then of course, launching a whole depopulation program against Africa.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  And now he's giving you a new form of HIV.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  That's what COVID-19 is as the delivery system of HIV.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  And it is a spike protein that's toxic.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  Yes, they released HIV on all of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  And now they're killing us.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  The world is awakening.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[43:05.000 --> 43:16.000]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.000]  the truth is they've had to come out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  Realize humanity is winning.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  That is invincible.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[43:45.000 --> 43:51.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  I never had a marketing plan for Impal Wars.
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to fund our operation.
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  It's simple, it's instinctive, it's spiritual, it's what I do.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[44:19.000 --> 44:26.000]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  But we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  I got to sell them at discount.
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.000]  And so it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  It won't be available for months.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  So get it.
[44:48.000 --> 44:55.000]  X2 is selling out at InfalWarsTour.com for 40% and 60% off with double page reappoints and free shipping.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  Because why?
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  That's when you buy it.
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  We need your funds or it'll be off air.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  It's an amazing product.
[45:00.000 --> 45:08.000]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[45:08.000 --> 45:17.000]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[45:17.000 --> 45:24.000]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at InfalWarsTour.com.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[45:32.000 --> 45:49.000]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long. We've got a private label for InfalWars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smart phones really are.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  They're 50% off right now at InfalWarsTour.com.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[46:04.000 --> 46:11.000]  First off, green fiber capsules, highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  This is an incredible formula. Everybody should be taking it.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter. It's an amazing product. It's our newest product.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  It's 50% off out of the gates, InfalWarsTour.com.
[46:23.000 --> 46:31.000]  Then we have both types of X2s, the exact same X2 with a bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap for 60 and 40% off depending on which one.
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  They're both excellent at InfalWarsTour.com.
[46:34.000 --> 46:41.000]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  It's all available at InfalWarsTour.com.
[46:44.000 --> 46:52.000]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[46:52.000 --> 46:59.000]  And it funds the InfalWars. Experience Deep Earth Crystal iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfalWarsTour.com.
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.000]  We are now at InfalWarsTour.com.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, a fun little song for us.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  I was back like three years ago and I was having a big fight with Joe Rogan.
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  We played the Stinky Snake song and now it's still on the computer.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  Joe's not a snake. He's a good guy.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  He's being the guy I knew he was now. Hardcore, anti-globalist, anti-vax, gets it all.
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  He got his freedom and it's beautiful and it's very exciting to see happen.
[48:17.000 --> 48:24.000]  Okay, look, I'm going to open the phones up during the weekday show every day this week.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  And I really want to open the phones up and ask, how are you taking the force inoculations, the death, the destruction, the lies,
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  and where do you see this going and what do you think we should do to oppose it and fight back against it?
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  Oh, and Shroyer was out yesterday, driving around town with a bullhorn,
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  educating people about the fact that lockdown twos are coming. That's great.
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  What are we all collectively going to do while all these big corporations line up with the media
[48:49.000 --> 48:54.000]  and try to gaslight us that you better take all these inoculations and you're murderers if you don't
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  and you're bad if you don't do what we say and we're going to make you have a medical ID
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  and, oh, sorry, the vaccine didn't work. You've still got to take more.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  I mean, this is crazy. It's a total assault.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  It's a war against humanity, hidden as a medical emergency.
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  So let's do this. Let's run through a bunch of headlines.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  And each one of these headlines, they can do a whole hour on.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  So it's up to you to go look at these for yourself and find this out for yourself.
[49:22.000 --> 49:31.000]  New study in the U.K., people who have been vaccinated make up 47% of new COVID cases
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  and in other studies, the majority of death in the U.S. as well.
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  And that's the government's own Orwellian tracking app
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  that they put on everybody's phone, whether you like it or not,
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  shows who it's happening to, but they're not publicizing this data.
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  The experimental jab has been getting worse results as time progresses.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  It's just a few months ago.
[49:55.000 --> 50:01.000]  Only 25% of people who received the shot caught the Wu hand flu after.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  Gosh, Omani, it's supposed to be 100%.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  I mean, I never took any of it. I've shot millions, not millions.
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  I've been around millions of people. I've shot thousands of hands. I've never got sick.
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  And that number has now risen to 47% according to study.
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  And you can go to this gatewaypundit.com article,
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.000]  and it links into the study on the English U.K. website.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  I mean, it's not like we're just telling you this like, you know, Fauci,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  oh, everybody's dying because they didn't take the shot.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  Oh, it's 100% effective. Oh, just all lies.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  This is the actual studies with the links.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  Let's continue. This is another article, Zero Edge.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  This is worrying me quite a bit.
[50:42.000 --> 50:51.000]  mRNA vaccine inventor shares viral thread showing COVID surge in most vax countries.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  So just like Gateway Pundit did a big article linking through the U.K.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  government's database showing that the majority of folks dying took the COVID shot
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  and 47% of the new cases got the COVID shot.
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  This goes into links all over the world on their own reporting that none of it hits the news.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  And the U.S. Surgeon General is desperate.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  Don't look at this. Don't talk about this. Forget this.
[51:14.000 --> 51:21.000]  Dr. Robert Malone, the discoverer of mRNA, the main owner of the technology.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  The man's worth a billion bucks, they say.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  He's the one saying this is a total lie and it's a misuse.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  And it's going to discredit this technology.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  Dr. Robert Malone, a pioneer in the field of mRNA vaccine,
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  shared a viral Twitter thread on Friday which lays out a disturbing trend.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  The most vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  while the least vaccinated countries are not.
[51:44.000 --> 51:51.000]  And that's where viral shedding and the shots killing people with the spike protein
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  and then they call that COVID-19.
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  And by the way, I just go off anecdotal stuff.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  Sure, I go off all these studies fine.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  I've never seen so much of my family sick that ever gets sick.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  I've never seen so many children sick.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  I've got a four-year-old daughter who's basically never been sick.
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  She had a fever for two weeks, coughed her lungs out.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  We went and had her tested. Oh, you're not positive.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  And I said, let me guess.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  What's that test cut to?
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  And they looked and said, how do you know this?
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  30%, 30% is what we're told to do.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  I said, turn it up. Oh, we're not allowed to turn it up.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  See, I'm starting to say a little bit behind the scenes stuff.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  I'm living this, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  Think I care about my four-year-old?
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  If they got a shot, makes her healthy, I'll give it to her like that.
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  I believe in technology. This is fraudulent technology.
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.000]  Can you imagine all the bad-ass stuff they've got that actually helped people?
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  They discovered penicillin in World War II.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  We've never gotten past that.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  They're suppressing all the good stuff.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Oh, that's a whole other subject.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  It's come out in China and Germany,
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  even the London Guard has reported on it years ago,
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  that the elites get special medicines and special treatments
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  and special vaccines that actually work.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  We don't get them.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  I'm not against vaccines. I'm not against technology.
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  They're not giving us the good stuff.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  They said they want to kill us.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  This is me off.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  So, yeah, my four-year-old daughter got tested.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  And let me tell you something.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  She had some kind of pneumonia crap,
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  but, oh, see, they're not supposed to announce the cases are up yet.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  When she got tested a week ago, I'm sure we took her in a week.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  She's fine now.
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.000]  I think God got plenty of vitamin D
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  and a little salt with the rest of it.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  And plenty of sunshine.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  I hauled her ass outside in the backyard,
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  made her, you know, play around out in the yard and stuff.
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  And when she was sick with the sun, that got her better.
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  But this is what I'm talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  Imagine if she had gone to a real doctor that had just tested her
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  and they'd given her aerosolized steroids
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  that had given her Abermectin,
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  that had given her hydroxychloroquine,
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  they won't give it to you.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  Because they're told through their computers what they can do.
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  It's all controlled.
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  I'm pissed.
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.000]  This is worrying me quite a bit, says the discoverer of mRNA,
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  that they're discovering the surge in countries
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  where they're vaccinated.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  Well, they knew what they were doing.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  And we told you over a year ago that would happen.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  Here's another one.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  Pfizer COVID vaccine is definitely less effective against Delta variant.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  Jerusalem Post goes on to say that it's the vaccinated
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  or the ones that are getting sick.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  Look at this.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  The effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Delta variant
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  is weaker than health officials had hoped.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Oh, I thought it was 90% effective.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  Turns out you're more likely to get sick if you had it,
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  which is all the scientists said.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  If you take something that makes you have an autoimmune response
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  to the protein jacketing of thousands of known viruses,
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  what's going to happen when you run into one?
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  You're going to have an autoimmune response.
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  And they're going to call it COVID.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  They're destroying your immune system, folks.
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  They're basically giving you a spike protein form of HIV.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  That's why if you take these vaccines,
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  a lot of folks come up testing positive for HIV.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  They're telling them, don't worry.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  It says you've got HIV, but it's OK.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  And all these liberals are out giving their babies and toddlers
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  a shot to test on them because they're such heroes.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  They're the left that didn't abort their kid,
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  but they're aborting them later.
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  Doctors and health officials say their latest COVID-19 hospital patients
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  are unvaccinated and increasingly younger.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  See it in.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  They give no proof, no evidence, nothing,
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  but Fauci's lying ass.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Fauci's lying ass.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  Fauci lies, Fauci lies.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  Fauci is the enemy.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  Meanwhile, remember last week,
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  Macron caused riots all over the country.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  They came out and announced,
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  you can't buy food or leave your house if you don't take the shot.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  Then they gaslit and said, oh, no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  He never said it.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  He sent them a national address.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  Well, now he's found an executive order.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  It's up on infowars.com with the executive order.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.000]  Fritz faced six months in jail for entering a bar or restaurant
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  without a COVID pass,
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  putting you in prison cells of your own home
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  because you don't take that shot.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  Gee, wonder what's in the shot?
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  A sterilant.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Does Macron or any other EU leader have a child?
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  No, they're in the cult.
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  Is that man a predator?
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  Damn right.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  Here's CNN.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  Say goodbye to your COVID care freeze summer.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  Oh, because the people won't take the shot.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  Now we're going to have to do new lockdowns.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  We always knew that was coming.
[56:32.000 --> 56:33.000]  Take the shot.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.000]  Oh, the lockdown's over.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  Oh, enough.
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  Didn't take it.
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  Lockdown's back.
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  Oh, sorry.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Your COVID vaccine didn't work.
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  Take more.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  Wear a mask.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  I mean, it's a trap.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  They want martial law.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  They want post-industrial world.
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.000]  They live on their big giant plantations and estates
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  while you live in a compact apartment dying.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  Top Democrat demands national face mask mandate from Biden
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  after three of his colleagues test positive for COVID.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  All of which have been given the vaccine.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  That's the top Texas Democrat who also flew maskless up on the
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  private jet with all the alcohol up to DC while they fill a
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  bus or what's happening down here.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  And then Kamala Harris will not quarantine after meeting
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  Texas Democrats infected with coronavirus.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  Only you quarantine.
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  Not her.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  Because it's all a fraud and they know it.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  Meanwhile, the DHS training program prepares for rural
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  lockdowns, mass public quarantines against the vaccinated
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve on Thursday in a written
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  statement said they're preparing for new lockdowns this fall
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  and winter.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  And if you put this lockdown, it will be permanent forever.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  Martial law, the end of America, China and the globalist
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  win.
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  Go ahead.
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  Hey, Alex.
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  Welcome.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  First off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  this stupidity wanted to warn people.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  Okay.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  that'll never go away.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  Living defense saved my life.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  Living defense brought me back.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible.
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.000]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  and shall hate one another.
[58:40.000 --> 58:41.000]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  no matter what they say.
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.000]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  Deep earth crystal iodine, the good halogen.
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  You must have it to live.
[59:01.000 --> 59:04.000]  The UN estimates two billion plus people have cognitive disabilities
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.000]  because they don't have enough iodine.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  We have X2 at two different bottles.
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  The same amount in each bottle.
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  But one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.000]  for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  I want to thank all of the supporters that have gotten me some of the years.
[59:21.000 --> 59:22.000]  They're amazing.
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.000]  So X2 and the dropper bottle and the spray bottle,
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now
[59:36.000 --> 59:37.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  But we're going to keep this cell going until it sells out.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  Don't procrastinate.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  Take advantage of this special right now at infowarstore.com
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  Four years ago, we got secret documents that are now mainstream news
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  that confirm to be real where they're training now over 50,000 creatures
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  for gun confiscation to tell their flocks to go to the relocation centers
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  to take a force inoculations to do whatever the government tells them.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  They're called clergy response team.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  The infregard hiring private citizens to spy on their neighbors
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  with shoot to kill orders.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act,
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  the different executive orders, all for martial law.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  The gun confiscation drills, you've seen all of it.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  During the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act,
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  number 2002, they wanted to have forced inoculation nationwide
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  for smallpox.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  And it came out in news articles that, oh yeah,
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  the feds are going to use sports stadiums and postal offices
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  as the centers where if you refuse to be inoculated,
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  you'll be taken and beheld, but will also forcibly inoculate
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  if we're given the orders at these injection facilities.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  You have to be able to track people.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  So they have to have a tracking technology in place.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Now, whether that's an RFID chip, which they're calling now electronic tattoos
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  or whether that is a vaccine bracelet
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  or some kind of paperwork that you have to carry around,
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  I'm not sure yet, but that's step one.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  So they got to have a vaccine tracking technology.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  I think that's where some of the military defense contractors are coming into play.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  But then secondly, you got to look at the quarantines.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  If they mandate vaccines, those who refuse to be vaccinated
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  are very likely to be quarantined,
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  which means perhaps the CDC would be leasing camps
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  or facilities like FEMA camps from FEMA, just as an example.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  And then making those quarantine camps
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  where they throw you in with all the other people who have refused the vaccines.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Well, I mean, they're preparing mass graves,
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  they're preparing forced inoculations,
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  they're preparing under infra-guard lockdowns,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  under clergy response teams.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  The church is saying, take your inoculations,
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  go to the campus of the Lord,
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  show the coronavirus that's been patented
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  by the Bella Melinda Gates Foundation sub-directive
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  and the Real Life Umbrella Corporation.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Had a drill three months ago where 16 plus million people die
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  when a corona-like virus gets out
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  and spreads destruction around the world.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  But don't worry, in the drill,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  out of it comes the understanding of planetary government
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  and world forced inoculation programs.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Because the PSI-OPS, the PSI-OPS has been launched.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  It's now official.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  The United Nations has released guidelines
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  written by the Bella Melinda Gates Foundation
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  that no one will be allowed to leave their homes
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  or go back to work under the new worldwide martial law
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  until you've been forcibly inoculated.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  We warned you it was coming.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  And of course, all these major forced vaccines
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  have been linked directly to sterilization.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Eight, nine weeks ago, nine weeks ago now,
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  we told you that they'll go off the China model.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  They'll be drones watching you.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  They'll say you have to have apps on your phones.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  They'll force inoculation to go back to work and have jobs.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  They'll say it's a two-week spring break you're going to have.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  It'll really be months and months and months.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  It's designed to destroy the economy, consolidate power,
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  bring in a medical tyranny.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  And it's the World Health Organization, you notice,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  that when Trump says something, they go,
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  oh, we're fact-checking the president. We're blocking him on Google.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  We're blocking the president of Brazil.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  The World Health Organization says that's not true.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  The UN is the authority.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And the UN came out and said a week and a half ago,
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  we want forced inoculations or the antibodies for COVID-19
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  before you can travel or have a job.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  And then they're going to roll out the apps and the blood test
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  for you to prove you can leave your house
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  that you have the COVID-19 antibody.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  Martial law forever, medical tyranny,
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  and fellow multigates have officially announced.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Forced inoculations, breaking, breaking.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Forced inoculations to buy and sell and to leave your home.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  We'll be back.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  We'll be back.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  We'll be back.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  We'll be back.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  I'm going to give David Rockefeller and Savicky Brzezinski
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  and their protégé Bill Gates a bone right now.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  I don't say this in a way to compliment them for what they've done,
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  but I do want to compliment the elegance of it
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  because I can see how it worked on the establishment
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  because I'm going to go along with it.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Welcome back to the Alan Jones Show.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Old wars would kill our best and brightest men.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  And so the Carnegie Endowment set up a plan for world government
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  after World War I, the League of Nations of the UN,
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  to quote, end war by ending humans and the family as we know it
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  and quote, ending men.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Blaming the process of mammalian ritual battle to prove the fittest
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  and instead create a system more sophisticated
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  where it wasn't about whether you could physically kill somebody
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  but whether you could outsmart them.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  And that's how this whole system is.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  If you buy into the system, if you're lazy,
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  if you want something free, you're going to die.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  If you're not scientific, if you're irrational,
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  if you believe the vaccine is going to save you
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  when it's not even the vaccine, you're going to die.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  Now, it doesn't mean because I have knowledge
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  of how their thought processes work that I agree with it
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  because I have a conscience which I know is ingrained in me
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  and I know these people are playing God
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  and I know that they've already damaged the planet
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  and I know they've done people down on purpose
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  so they're more easily manageable.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  It's not their job to play God, but I see what they're doing.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  We just played a clip if you just joined us earlier
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  from 10 years ago and 11 years ago respectively
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  with myself and Mike Adams in this very building
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  talking about the plan to release a virus, create fear,
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  have global lockdowns and then push force inoculations
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  starting with corporations demanding employees
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  where arm bands, whether they've been inoculated or not,
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  to then stigmatize and isolate people
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  to then push for persecution and internment of those
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  that do not allow the government to put things in our bodies.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And now today, you notice what that's happened.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  The NFL is saying they're going to make players wear
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  while they're on the field.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  Everyone sees it on TV, Pavlovian.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  Monkey see, monkey do.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  They're training us what we see we do
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  so that when you're wearing that band,
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  oh, you're vaccinated or you're not vaccinated.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  NFL recommends teams use color-coded wrist points
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  to identify vaccinated players and employees.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  What does that even mean?
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  It's persecution.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  And they admit the vaccine doesn't even work.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  We had scientists on a year and a half ago.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  You cannot create a vaccine for the cold virus.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  There's thousands of them.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  But you can make somebody allergic to their own body.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  So here's what's frustrating about this.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  This is a no-brainer that it was cooked up at the lab,
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  released, it's synthetic.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  They will want why it didn't more deadly then.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  They want to own it.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  They want to have new variants.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  In fact, have the archivist that found all these clips
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  we just played that are blowing people away.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  We're predicting all this.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  And have us a year and a half ago,
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  16 months ago, 18 months ago, 14 months ago, 10 months ago.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  How about all the clips you all saw me say it?
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  Where we explained that they're going to say
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  new variants are out, so you've got to have new shots.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  When all the real literature said it would cause new variants
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  with these inoculations.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  Because this doesn't program your body how to know,
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  how to defeat a virus.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  This makes your body attack a protein that's already in itself.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  And I've already said that probably 25 times
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  in the last hour and a half or the last hour and 10 minutes.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  But the reason I've done that is this is all very scientific.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  And they know the public isn't scientific on average.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  So when they say trust the science,
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  well, I have trusted the science.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  And almost all the mainline scientists that have looked at this say
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  this is a sterilization, depopulation, weapon system in mass.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  And now we've got all the new literature on that confirming.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  So as I said at the beginning of the broadcast,
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  now there it is, MPR, February of this year.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Vaccines could drive the evolution of more COVID-19 mutants.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  You've got, again, the most respected scientists in the world
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  coming out and saying that and they're being banned in their
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Senate hearings, congressional hearings, house hearings,
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  gubernatorial hearings, legislative hearings.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Think about that.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  They're out there trying to warn you.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  In fact, I feel good about the scientific community.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Almost everybody says this is BS.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Almost every doctor, every nurse, every epidemiologist,
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  every scientist, but instead we've got the surgeon general
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  who's got this little space commander outfit.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  And you've got Fauci who's the eugenicist, Bill Gates frontman,
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  and the chai comms out there telling us the opposite.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  And they're saying they want all these people banned.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  And they put out this big report.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  But you know what's incredible about their report?
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Saki, I did a whole Saturday show on this.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  It's the Saturday emergency broadcast.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  It's a banned out video.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  You should go watch it.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  I did a whole 30-minute report just on this yesterday.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  She gets up and she goes, oh, it's not like there's a list
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  of people who are persecuting them.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  Meanwhile, the Rockefeller Foundation came up with
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  the disinformation dozen, a group they want shut down.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Who are they?
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Robert Kennedy, Jr., always other people who told you
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  a year and a half ago what was going to happen,
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  and now it's happened, and they want them silenced
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  because they're exposing the criminal activities
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  that she's involved with.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  And to have the government working with big foundations
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  to silence Americans and read our text messages
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  and persecute people is so dangerous,
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  she then lies in the press conference and says,
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  we're not putting reports out on anybody.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  This woman could be selling snow cones in the Sahara Desert.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  If she was a liar, I knew she was a liar,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  but I wouldn't take one because I think it was poison.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  These are known liars that have been caught lying
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  over and over and over and over again,
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  and they're murdering us and they're killing us,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  but see, they've committed a crime so big,
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  and they've gotten so many billions of people
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  to sign onto it, they think it's a crime too big to fail.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  But we come back, I'm going to get into this
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  because you've got the new Surgeon General up there
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  announcing the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  is going to run everything, and I thought
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  I'd actually show you the Rockefeller Foundation document
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  from 10 years ago, 11 years ago,
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  that lays all of this out,
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Operation Lockstep.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  That's but an authoritarian, their words.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  World government, permanent lockdowns,
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  masks, forced inoculations,
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  off of a novel virus released from China.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  They have the whole thing scripted out.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  And then he announces,
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  we're working with the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  who wrote the whole battle plan for Bill Gates
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  to stop the American people and all these scientists
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  and all these doctors that are exposing him.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  How incredible is that?
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  And I'm going to show you some of the reports.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Here's one again by Wolfgang Wudarg,
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  head advisor to the EU Commission,
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  and Dr. Yidon, the former head scientist at Pfizer,
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  laying out all the infertility, all the cancer,
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  all the heart attacks, all the deaths in December
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  of last year before one person was inoculated.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  And then what happened?
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Infertility, heart attacks, cancer, death, strokes.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  And you read the report,
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  I actually read the whole report and I spent days
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  trying to read all the studies that's linked to it.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  I couldn't do it.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  I spent days.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  I read hundreds and hundreds of pages
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  of scientific reports and studies and all that right here.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  I mean, it's all right here.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Oh, but see, Saki thinks you're stupid.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  She thinks you're going to go watch Netflix tonight
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  and not read what they've done to you and your family.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  She thinks, oh, as long as we soft tell them,
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  as long as we do it quietly,
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  as long as they die in a couple of years,
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  they'll never know what we did to them.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Oh, no, we know what you did, Bill Gates.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  We know what you did, Saki.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  And you're never going to get away with it.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  And record numbers of people know what you've done.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  They're going to make sure you pay.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  So we have free shipping, double patriot points
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  through this weekend.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  And our big loss leader is X2 in the dropper
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  and in the spray bottle for 40% and 60% off
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  and your purchase funds the M4.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  Seriously, the UN admits two plus billion people
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  You need to experience it for yourself.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  It takes two weeks to a month to kick in.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  Try it and tell me what you think.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  You can't lose your fund in the M4.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  And again, I can harp on this all day,
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  but just like our information is dead on from research,
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  without deep-growth crystal iodine and X2.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  What it did for libido is incredible.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  When I don't take it, I feel the difference.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  Get your X2 today, discounted the spray bottle
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  and in the eyedropper bottle to take it under your tongue
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  The globalist hope you don't explore
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  how incredibly powerful deep-growth crystal iodine is.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  The globalists are having their revolution,
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers,
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  that realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  that is the opposite of the dystopia.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  It's that choice, it's that realization
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  that's going to change the world.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  And it's the only choice we've got,
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  Good, bro.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Great last caller.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  It's basically the only way I can sleep anymore
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  for one of the product.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  The X2 group does wonders.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info wars.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Thanks for rolling, go ahead.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  It's an honor.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Honored talk to you.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  Awesome.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  So, firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  It definitely works, it's not a joke.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Absolutely.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  or the beauty of the waves in the ocean
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  or the beauty of your life or your husband
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge,
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  the beauty of music,
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  the fact that you can commune with that
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  and resonate with that is energetic
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  So, don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL,
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  don't worship all the things in the system,
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  and appreciate your consciousness
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it,
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  while you still have it.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  So, it's very simple.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  If you're going to launch a war,
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  you want it to be covert.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  The ultimate war would be to pose as a savior.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  The medical system, big pharma.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  And then, within big pharma, you have a cult that thinks,
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  oh, we're saving the earth, there's too many humans.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  We're an environmental movement.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  We're a birth control movement.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  We want to depopulate the planet.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  That's why we want to get health departments
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  that are in control of humanity that organize and run our lives.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  That was all the Rockefellers, the early 1900s,
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Margaret Sanger, historical fact, IBM,
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Hitler, Cold Springs, Harbor, New York.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  That's all came out of that.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Then, after World War II, they go underground.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  And now, they've expanded their system.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  They claim it's to save the earth.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  We're trying to give you a shot that's not a vaccine
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  that's been untested publicly, massively tested secretly,
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  that will sterilize male and females,
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  and you want to get rid of old folks too
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  and not pay for them, give them heart attacks and strokes.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  But it grows prion crystals, protein crystals in the body
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  that normally take a few years to grow and kill you.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  But some people are dying right away.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  They need to suppress that.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  They need to practice getting everybody used to that
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  and censor everybody.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  That's why, on the inserts of these vaccines,
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  there is no information,
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  because you're not supposed to know what hit you.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  And you look, there's no information with the vaccine inserts.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  Big Tech's job is censoring everything you do down to your text messages
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  as they prepare the next lockdown,
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  as they prepare the force inoculations.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  It's all being announced.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  I'm sorry, this is also real.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  But when I was reading Rockefeller documents 25 years ago,
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  I knew they were in charge then.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  I read The New York Times from 1976 praising Mao Zedong
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  as saying America should be under a leader like Mao Zedong.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  He'd already killed 80 million of his own people.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  I thought, wow, David Rockefeller is a bad person.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  Then I learned I was father, set up a U.N., ran the whole show.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  But that was back then.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Now you got Charlie Munger, a Rockefeller operative,
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  head lawyer for Bill Gates,
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  and Warren Buffett saying, I want to live like communist China.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  I want to arrest anybody I don't like.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  See how it works?
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  And now the Rockefeller Foundation is in charge
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  of the entire federal government's medical response.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  Bill Gates had to step down.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  His foundation got removed from command.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  And what did I tell you hundreds of times last year and a half?
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Who was in command of Bill Gates?
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Who was in command?
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  Who was in command?
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  Who was in command?
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Who was in command?
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  Who was in command?
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Have the archivist pull it up.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  His only problem is you'll have too many examples.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  I only want five examples.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  The general response sterilizing the family,
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  breaking down the borders, running the government is Carnegie.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  They run the CIA today.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Former Carnegie head runs it.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  But the group running the medical takeover is the Rockefellers.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  They set up the UN and the whole damn thing to carry it out with IBM.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  Look it up.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  And now we're in their world.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  And the public's so confused and so leaderless they might just succeed.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And all you elitists that think you're going to hide out and not be part of this,
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  they're going to get you first.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  They're the ones they really want.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Let's play Clippers.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  This is Biden on Facebook not censoring vaccine was info and killing people
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  when it's their vaccines and aren't vaccines killing people.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  And it's their open borders and all their lies that are killing people.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Here he is.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  What's your message to platforms like Facebook?
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  They're killing people.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  I mean, it really looks the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  And they're showing people.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Here is the surgeon general in his little clown suit.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Dr. Vivek Murphy agreeing on CNN that people not taking their experimental
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  unauthorized shot that we're the ones killing people.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  I mean, I thought taking the shot I'd be safe.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Now we're going to have a booster shot.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  Of course, I told you a year and a half ago that was the case.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  We're going to have the Rockefeller's minion Bill Gates ran a stinking mouth.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  People are going to learn like how does Jones keep predicting everything?
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  I'm not predicting anything.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  It's a fricking battle plan.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  I'm going to demand.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  This is not an attainment.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  It's not my opinion.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  You understand my life's at risk doing this right now.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  We're all screwed up.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  I don't know.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Anyways, but you understand?
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Here is the so called surgeon general saying he's run by the Rockefeller foundation.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  I wonder if that person has ever flown in an airplane or a car or taken an Advil.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  But besides that, President Biden did accuse social media platforms of killing people.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  Do you think conservative media like Fox News are doing the same?
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  Are they killing people too with rhetoric like you just heard?
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Well, then I think all of us, including the media, including individuals, health professionals,
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  have a responsibility to share the truth about health as science dictates, as science informs us.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  And unless we do that, unless we are honest about the consequences of our communication with people,
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  unless we are rigorous about ensuring that what we communicate is actually sourced from science
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  and not from opinion and critical issues like the vaccine,
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  then we are going to ultimately put people at risk.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  And that is my great worry, Dana.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  There are people all across our country, and I hear from folks all the time,
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  who are struggling to make decisions about their health.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  After this very difficult year we've been through, people deserve to have access to accurate information.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  They deserve to hear that from their leaders.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  They deserve to hear that from the media.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  They deserve to see that on platforms online.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  And they need that information to be able to make decisions to protect themselves and their families.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  That's the least we can do.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  All right, that's enough.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  So he's the science.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  He's the science.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Science means do what they say.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  And then here's the clip I mentioned.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  Here he is saying that the Rockefeller Foundation is really helping those.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  So thank God they're here.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  They're the ones that wrote Operation Walk Step.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Here it is.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  The Rockefeller Foundation is announcing a $13.5 million commitment to counter health misinformation.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  The Digital Public Library of America is announcing that they will convene a set of librarians,
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  scholars, journalists, and civic leaders to confront health misinformation together.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  Fourth, we are saying we expect more from our technology companies.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  We're asking them to operate with greater transparency and accountability.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  We're asking them to monitor misinformation more closely.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  We're asking them to consistently take action.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Yeah, that's enough.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  So they want to censor everybody.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  They want to quietly kill us.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  This is a mopping up, kill the old people, sterilize everybody.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  It's a public health thing.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  Come on, it's the right thing to do.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  And they're sterilizing everybody in India right now.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  And Modi's all signed on to that.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  And I get it.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  You can argue there's a lot of people, but you're going to shoot little kids up and give them blood clots in their brains.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  I mean, it's bad enough to kill old people.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  And it's bad enough to kill mentally retarded people.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  But I mean, my God, they're pushing to give it to newborn babies who are going to have horribly painful like 5, 10 year lives.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  I mean, it's just mass murder.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  Oh, and you don't see this guy killing himself on TV.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  There's too many people.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  No, no, no.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  He goes into the future.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  And now they got new lockdowns for you.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  This is a diabolical group of maniacs and selfish people that have gotten together and said,
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  we want the resources.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  I don't have resources.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  Let's start killing everybody.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  Hey, I'm not going to kill anybody.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  But I think you should all show by example the Canadian health minister that says,
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  we're having lockdowns to stop people talking in the streets.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Hey, how about you pour gasoline on yourself and light yourself on fire to show us how bad we are?
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  Then we'll follow your example.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Granny do right.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Granny do right.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  Go ahead.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well,
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  This is working.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  This is wonderful.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  Deep earth crystal iodine, the good halogen, it is essential for all actions in the body.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  You must have it to live.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have it of iodine.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  We have X2 at two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  I want to thank all of the supporters that have got me over the years.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  They're amazing.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  So X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  But we're going to keep the spell going until it spells out.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  Don't procrastinate.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  Take advantage of this special right now at infowarstore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  A privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.

[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  And I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smart phones really are.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to infowarstore.com.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to infowarstore.com.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  And one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health and we packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  That's 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  All right, I know I showed your host.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  Very blessed and honored to be here with you on this live Sunday, July 18th, global transmission in defiance of tyranny.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  So it's very simple.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  The whole future is about covert war.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  And you have the ruling globalist class that's your Genesis base that's been studying warfare, but studying how to take control, how to scare the public.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  How do you dominate them? How do you imprison them? How do you enslave them? How do you kill them?
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  How do you inject them and change their bodies?
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Like Klaus Schwab talks about the head of the Davos group, the head of the World Economic Forum.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Well, you pose as their savior against a deadly virus.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  And you also then divide and conquer the public saying everybody's racist, everybody's bad, but the central government, the media.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  And so that's what they've done.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  And they have rolled out a depopulation, sterilant, a crystal growing, a prion growing, spongiform encephalopathy, producing system that is just going to devastate and weigh down society.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  And what's that going to do?
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  The tyranny is posing as a medical system.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  So the average doctor, the average nurse isn't going to know.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  Even the average hospital manager won't know. They're just given the directors by the owners what to do.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  And now as people die of all these neurological and cardiovascular diseases, and now as people are sterile and go in and spend incredible amounts of money to try to have fertility,
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  they will absorb more and more of your energy, more and more of your paycheck, more and more of your money while they make you obsolete, while they shut down small businesses.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  This is all scientifically prepared.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  That's why under 16 months of lockdown, on average, they doubled their profits. Some groups tripled their profits.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  Big tech, big pharma, they took over. They were essential. You weren't.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  But they know you're going to form opposition. You're going to elect governors. You're going to elect legislatures. You're going to say no.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  America's going to lead us out of the tyranny again. You're going to organize. You're going to protest.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  So as soon as that reached a crescendo, oh, they pulled back in the U.S. where we had more freedom for a few months.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  In Europe, I predicted one month pullback before they even did one month in Germany, Spain and England, the U.K.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  They said sorry and kept the controls in permanently. They call it freedom day now.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  You get your inoculation, you go to the store. Oh, you'd wear your mask if you haven't had your shot.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  You're going to track you. We're going to ask for proof. And so are the football games.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  So are the movie theaters. So are the airlines. All outside of law, all organized, all unified, having nothing to do
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  whether you have a virus or known. But everything to do about if you don't have this digital pass on your phone,
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  you don't have access to the marketplace. Game over. Global social credit score that Info Wars was first to write about.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Hold on to your hat in 2006. Paul, Joseph Watson and Alex Jones wrote an article the first to tell you about the Chinese
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  social credit score tied to everything on your phone in the future.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  And it's not about the credit. It's about this dog will hunt.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  I'm not a slave of these people. I don't feel safe with them running things. I've already had them try to hire me.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  But the empty feeling of even thinking of getting on an airplane and flying to New York City and meeting with them
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  and then getting my position with them where they would be in control of my life and cut me out of whatever they wanted to
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  and then have me commit evil against humanity. That made me feel lonely. That made me feel weak.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  But staring into their attacks, staring into them wanting to put me in prison or even kill me right now.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  It's not a bravada. It's not macho. It's nothing. I just feel so close to God right now that I just could not imagine
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  anybody that serves these statements. But I just want listeners to know that you can't get depressed and you can't get upset about this.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  Lord knows I do sometimes. You've got to understand that this was all written.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  And so you see the headlines everywhere. Christians are terrorists. Gunners are terrorists. White people are terrorists.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  People that don't want to take shots are terrorists. People that question elections are terrorists. The Republican Party are terrorists.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  And that's only because those are the few avenues that the devil knew would end up having some chance at an avenue for us to come together and say no.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  And so at the end of the day realize it's all in God's hands. It's all God's plan.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  And even though you feel the quicksand sucking you down, even though you feel those evil hands getting around your neck,
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  and even though you know they're killing so many innocent people, you just got to know, do as much as you can, love God, trust in God,
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  and don't make them trick you into violence or committing suicide or getting so angry you have a heart attack.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  And I'm not in danger of suicide. I would never do that. And I'm not in danger of even attacking anybody.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  But I get so angry when I sat here and looked at hundreds of stories and reports and gone back and pulled up and seen all their plans that it could consume you.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  And I don't want them to win. I want them to know their losers that serve Satan, they join the loser. I'm sad they did.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  I don't even rejoice at knowing that Fauci will be destroyed. Bill Gates will be destroyed. Dave Rockefeller is burning in his own excrement right now.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  I don't sit there and take any pleasure in any of this.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  I just think God Almighty that I have another connection to God to know that this communist evil is wrong.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And I'm not going to hate somebody because they're a Christian or because they're a Muslim or because they're a Jew or because they're agnostic or whatever they are.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  I'm going to judge them by the fruits of what they do under this stress test.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  Because this is a stress test. Bill Gates and Bill Gates Sr. and Ted Turner and Fauci and Judy Woodruff and Barbara Walters and all of them go to these globalist meetings with George Soros and the disgusting population.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  That's the meeting we're showing on screen. And you got right there in the blue. That was at Anderson Cooper's mommy.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  And that's all they can do is sit around and get mad at poor people and want to kill them instead of empowering them.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  If you were so powerful, you would have empowered these poor people.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  I'd tell you everything you could to dumb them down so they'd be easily managed.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  And I can tell you when you stand before the Creator, you think you're so big and powerful, you're such a big satanic architect.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  Your little satanic God is going to fail and you are going to be sucked into a black hole with people like you forever.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  For eternity, you are going to be with people just like you.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  You know, I've already prayed about six months ago to be given peace.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  And I need to pray more because it was a very earnest prayer that I had a dream that night where I was taken to what you could do.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  You could describe as the pearly gates and the streets of gold and all of it was beyond that.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  It was unbelievable. And it was feeling, I've never experienced a total completion and timelessness and beyond completion, absolute satisfaction, total, complete peace.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  And the angel that was there with me, he didn't see it.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  He was giving me this tour.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  He said, can you imagine what it's like with them?
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  It's the opposite of this. It's all of them together forever.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  I said, show me that.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  And I was shown it.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  And it was like old men.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  You think of hell is like those old men crouched over in the dark with bags of dirt, like staring at the dirt.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  You know, it made me think of the song by Trent Reznor that was then done by Johnny Cash Hurt.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  What have I become my sweetest friend?
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  It talks about my empire of dirt.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  And I mean, that's really it. These people in this whole universe, this whole system, they're going against God, playing God.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  They're going to be gods. I mean, you know it's a joke.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  You know it's a fraud.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  You know they're not going to get what they want. You know they're going to fail.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  So we just better do our best job, reach out to other people as well as free will to help leave God and direct him to the light of God.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  So they're not destroyed by these people.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  And you're not going to find your mainline church doing that. They're all just glitter bugs that want to be famous and, you know, want to get up there and be left alone by the system.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  But they're going to find God getting on your knees at 2 a.m. ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  I will come back with the final segment ahead of Sunday Live with Troyer. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, free world news, freeworldnews.tv.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes. If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  If you don't have food a month or so. But what's in that food? Iodine.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate and the food itself is lacking.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine and governments are lowering the allowance you supposedly need to have because they want control.
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful. Our products are just as powerful.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  Experience clean iodine today. It's discounted 40% off in the dropper bottle, 60% off in the spray bottle.

[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  Don't wait any longer. Just like our information is powerful, our products are just as powerful.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  They don't want you to experience this. Get it today at infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Take action. Find out what you're missing. Get the missing link. Get X2.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  X2 has been our number one best seller over the years. Deep earth crystal iodine, the good halogen, it is essential for all actions in the body.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  You must have it to live. The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  We have X2 in two different bottles, the same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  60% off on the spray top, 40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  I want to thank all of the supporters that have gotten these over the years. They're amazing.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  X2, the dropper bottle and the spray bottle, 60% and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  But we're going to keep this sale going until it sells out. It'll probably take about two weeks.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  Don't procrastinate. Take advantage of this special right now at infowarsstore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil and subsurface material.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  By accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSepticPro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  BioSepticPro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  BioSepticPro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system. That's thebiopros.com.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  Thebiopros.com
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  What are champions made of?
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  Thebiopros.com
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  What are champions made of?
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  Thebiopros.com
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  What are champions made of?
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  Thebiopros.com
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  All right, folks. Final segment here on the Alex Jones Show Sunday edition. I'll be back. Lord willing, 11 a.m. tomorrow before me.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Harrison Smith is a spectacular job, 80 and Central American Journal.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  At threeworldnews.tv, infowars.com, and all the great radio and TV stations that are picking us up.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  I want to hit this final story before Owen Schroeder takes over with Sunday live for two hours live and takes your phone calls.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  Here is the Surgeon General, Vivek, and he says the Rockefeller Foundation is helping come in to coordinate the office of the Surgeon General's operations.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  Remember six months ago, they said, oh, or seven months ago now, oh, when the G8 takes control for the new year and that the UK had the chairmanship,
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  Bill Gates would be in charge of the G8.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  It's the same thing here. Oh, the Rockefeller Foundation is now in charge of the Surgeon General's office and the Department of Health and Human Services and all the rest of it.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Just like we're told at every other level that, oh, the Carnegie Endowment is now in charge of the CIA.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  What you have is all the foundations are making their in-game move, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Endowment, Ford Foundation, IBM Foundation, the Omelina Gates Foundation.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  They're all eugenicists. Go look them up. They all admit this. They're all stepping up for the final move.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  They were in the shadows. Now they're making their move and they're in charge of federal agencies and the Democratic Party says we're going to outlaw the Republican Party.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  We're going to outlaw protesting lockdowns. We're going to read all your text messages and tell you what you can do.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  The final move.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  And they've got all the telecom switches to take us off here.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  And they just want to normalize it and see you go along with it.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  And then the contact tracers and the force inoculations and taking your bank accounts and the shooting war.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  And they're crazy enough to start it, folks, because almost none of these people ever actually been in combat.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  But they sure as hell, like Tedris of the U.N., starved it as over a million of its people under Chinese orders.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  I mean, these are some psychos who've used the technocracy and the fact that we follow the technocracy as an excuse to rule us.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  So here it is. Here's the Surgeon General, Vivek, announces that his department is now under the control of the
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  And how many times have I told you that the Rockefeller Foundation is the top of the pyramid?
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  And I'm just pointing out that, I mean, we're not making this stuff up.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  U.S. Surgeon General, Rockefeller Foundation announces big initiatives to address urgent threat of vaccine misinformation.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  It's not even a vaccine.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Every word was a lie.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  And here it is. Scenarios for the future technology and international development.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Rockefeller Foundation operation lockstep from 10 years ago, 11 years ago, May 2010.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  I suggest you go read this, baby, for yourself.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  The authoritarian world government takes over, forced inoculations, lockdowns.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  Take the lockdowns off so people submit, bring them right back.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  I mean, people keep saying, how does Jones know?
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  How does he, he's like Nostradamus. Oh my God, he's a holy man.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  I've got like, I can't even tell you. I mean, I'm not trying to, it's ridiculous.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  I've got like top organizations like calling up like, we want to talk to you.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  You're a prophet. How are you in all this knowledge?
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  And it's all because I have the enemy battle plan.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  I have the blue plan out of their playbook.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  It's like actually in Belichick, he would steal the other teams playbook, how he knew what they were going to do next.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  Belichick wasn't psychic. He stole the damn playbooks.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  He paid people for them.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  We've got the playbook right here.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  And we sit here and take this crap.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  Whoa, crazy. Absolutely crazy.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  There was one other thing I was going to play. I don't remember what it was now, but look at some of these headlines, man.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  These are all just bombshell and they're linked to like New England medical journal and British medical journal and, you know, chief advisor to the EU.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  I mean, you'd think like the whole EU is bad, like their chief advisor was saying, this will cause blood clots and brain damage and infertility.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  Don't take it.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  And they still block them.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  Doctors raise the alarm of a COVID vaccine linked to infertility, an incredible article on infowars.com.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  Antibodies created from the vaccine may target protein responsible for successful pregnancy.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  Top scientists warn.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  And it links to the damn report.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  Here's another one. mRNA vaccine inventor.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  Iris being assassinated for speaking out against experimental COVID shots. He's been told they're now death-threatening.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  Yeah, if killed thousands of microbiologists, they are making their move right now.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  So I'm going to explain something to everybody.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  Submission is death.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  Resistance is life.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Compliance is enslavement and death.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Noncompliance is life.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  The social compact, the social agreement is broken.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  It's gone.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  The criminal corporations have gotten all their people in line.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  They've gotten yes men from the top to bottom.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  They're making their move.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  And a lot of people are scared.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  They go, let's just keep our head down.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  You don't keep your head down from something like this and live.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  I mean, they are already introducing deadly shots that grow protein crystals in your brain, in your lungs, in your heart that's already killed millions of people worldwide.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  And the word is within two years, they're going to grow to terminal levels and massive numbers of people.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  And if the crystals don't take, they're going to demand a booster shot to make sure they do.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  This is so incredible what I'm saying.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  But it's true.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  I just beg you all to keep us on air.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  And I beg you all to pray for justice and peace and a global awakening and to turn back from this report. It's too late.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  And I beg you all to remember that without your support, we're not going to be on air.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  So in closing, I want to show TV viewers a few cool cartoons.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  The Great Men Garrison.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  I love so much.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  We should get him back in studio sometime.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  He said, first they came for Alex Jones.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  They did not speak out because I did not like Alex Jones.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  Then they came for Make America Great Again Nation because I did not speak out because I was not Make America Great Again.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Then they came for the Legos.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  I did not speak out because I don't have a Lego set.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  They're resting folks for Lego sets now.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  Then they came for me.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  And it says it all right there.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  I mean, it's all out in the open now.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  And this great statement, you cannot comply your way out of tyranny.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  All right, we're out of time.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  I appreciate Randy Quaid saying all the nice stuff he said.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  I appreciate all the nice things that a lot of other folks have been saying.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  They're all welcome on the show.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  All those crazy people got to stick together.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Speaking of awesome folks, we have Dave Lindell, Mike Lindell.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Mike Lindell joining us tomorrow here on the broadcast.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  Mike Lindell of MyPillow.com and he came on a few times with us and said, hey, I want to support you, Alex.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  And I want to support our recount effort and what you're doing.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  That's really bearing a lot of fruit.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  You're doing a great job with risk of his life.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  Mike Lindell of MyPillow.com.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  And so he created a promo code at MyPillow.com of Alex with the biggest discounts he's given anybody of 60 to 50% off across the board for beds and pillows and sheets and clothes and towels and everything.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  MyPillow.com forward slash Alex or MyPillow.com promo code Alex and you will get 60 to 50% off.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  And man, he really came through.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  You came through.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  We've been basically right on the edge of being in the red and this latest plug for Mike Lindell, you guys coming through, got us a lot of funding.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  We needed to stay on air.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  So that's great. He has great products.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  Everybody should check them out at MyPillow.com and then just put in the promo code A-L-E-X Alex and you will get 50 to 60% off depending on what the item is.

[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  But we're selling out of all other products because of supply chain breakdowns.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.

[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  So get it.
