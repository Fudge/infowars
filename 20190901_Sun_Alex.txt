[01:43.560 --> 01:49.400]  let me tell you we're having some fun tonight we are kicking September off
[01:49.400 --> 01:56.640]  just right it's September 1st 2019 I'm your host Alex Jones and normally we
[01:56.640 --> 02:01.040]  kick the show off live on Sundays or on Mondays or Wednesdays or Thursdays or
[02:01.040 --> 02:08.840]  Fridays today I chalk it up to Gremlins his last week the big fancy expensive
[02:08.840 --> 02:13.240]  audio board just broke right before the show just burned out and died and then
[02:13.240 --> 02:17.560]  today it was the big video switcher died in the other studio and then folks had
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.520]  been playing tiddlywinks in this studio on Friday and didn't put any of it back
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.920]  so it took us 30 minutes to get up and running but that's okay because guess
[02:25.920 --> 02:31.760]  what happened I'm coming in tomorrow now in fact I'm doing all four juicy
[02:31.760 --> 02:40.840]  hours live and then I'm doing the war room that's right I'm gonna do seven
[02:40.840 --> 02:46.080]  hours of live shows tomorrow because we're hit we're hitting the quickening
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.800]  right now and it's got to be done and I got to lead by example so I'm gonna be
[02:49.800 --> 02:55.840]  here in fact I'm gonna broadcast next Sunday for ten hours probably because
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.320]  that's what's gonna happen we're gonna intensify our attacks on the globalist
[03:00.320 --> 03:06.640]  and we're not gonna stop we're not gonna back down ever well I did about oh five
[03:06.640 --> 03:11.560]  hours of preparation yesterday and I did about five hours of preparation today
[03:11.560 --> 03:17.320]  at home and I've got this whole incredibly important transmission lined up
[03:17.320 --> 03:22.000]  for you and I respect the listeners and I respect the viewers very very deeply
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.440]  for jumping through all the hoops over the years to keep us on air and to tune
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.240]  in and I really appreciate all of our AM and FM affiliates our TV affiliates and
[03:30.240 --> 03:34.240]  WWCR the global shortwave and the satellite folks that put us out and
[03:34.240 --> 03:37.840]  everybody in this crew and we've been going through growing pains as we've
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.760]  we've used my show for training and so we are training on my show to launch
[03:43.760 --> 03:46.800]  some new shows it'll be announced in just the next week and a half or so so a
[03:46.800 --> 03:52.520]  lot of exciting things going on here and there's no teleprompters here I'm not a
[03:52.520 --> 03:56.880]  robot you know being told what to say and do this is a real system this is a
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.440]  real organic resistance out of Texas we're not in fancy Los Angeles or fancy
[04:01.440 --> 04:05.920]  pants New York City we're we're just right here in Texas and you know I was
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.840]  down here in Austin before it became the fancy pants headquarters of this area
[04:09.840 --> 04:14.600]  and you know if I had my druthers I would leave it but then full investments
[04:14.600 --> 04:19.000]  here the crew is here and we've been invaded by by the dregs of the people
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.320]  that made California fall apart they're not really Californians they're the the
[04:22.320 --> 04:26.000]  offspring of the carpetbaggers and people that move to California and suck
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.760]  that state dry and now have moved on to conquer Texas and we're only four to
[04:30.760 --> 04:34.840]  eight years away from being a blue state so most folks I know are already
[04:34.840 --> 04:39.640]  evacuating Montana and Utah and Idaho but that's not gonna work the left once
[04:39.640 --> 04:44.000]  we build something there will just come there and feed on us but you know our
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.280]  biggest enemy is not the satanic left our biggest enemy is ourselves and the
[04:48.280 --> 04:54.320]  fact that the average person all the studies show is in a dream state and the
[04:54.320 --> 05:00.640]  average person has an IQ less than a goldfish and a goldfish is a IQ attention
[05:00.640 --> 05:06.880]  span maybe lower than IQ as well in some cases and so the average person has a
[05:06.880 --> 05:13.480]  shorter attention span than a goldfish and this is the giant curse everywhere
[05:13.480 --> 05:19.520]  programmed by the television programmed by 70 years of TV and and and so the
[05:19.520 --> 05:23.960]  average person may be intelligent but they do not have an attention span
[05:23.960 --> 05:28.400]  unless it's a video game they're playing or you know maybe a football game
[05:28.400 --> 05:32.000]  they're watching they're trained to give their attention span to something that
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.920]  manipulates their dopamine and gives them continually changing inputs and so the
[05:39.920 --> 05:44.080]  globalists sit back well the general public has been put into this this this
[05:44.080 --> 05:50.280]  mind control trance and they rule over us and it's it's truly truly disgusting
[05:50.280 --> 05:54.280]  ladies and gentlemen but we're going to break out of it and we're going to
[05:54.280 --> 05:57.480]  conquer it and we're going to deal with it but as I said I will be live tomorrow
[05:57.480 --> 06:02.200]  11 a.m. Central Standard Time Lord willing unless my car blows up or
[06:02.200 --> 06:07.480]  something I mean you know who knows but I will be here hook or crook covering it
[06:07.480 --> 06:11.720]  all and doing it all because that's that's what has to happen because while
[06:11.720 --> 06:15.880]  the average American is just seeking after pleasure and seeking after
[06:15.880 --> 06:20.360]  diversions the globalists are working around the clock to take everything
[06:20.360 --> 06:25.160]  you've got and create a post-human post-industrial world and I for one I'm
[06:25.160 --> 06:29.960]  not going to sit back and watch that happen so here let's just let's just
[06:29.960 --> 06:35.640]  begin to tell you about what's coming up next segment obviously we're starting
[06:35.640 --> 06:40.160]  to show a little late today but we're going to get into the gunman in West
[06:40.160 --> 06:46.040]  Texas shooting identified as chef a tour and this individual got pulled over by
[06:46.040 --> 06:52.640]  the police and then went crazy and began just indiscriminately shooting that's
[06:52.640 --> 06:56.400]  normally what you see with a Mexican drug cartel that's what they do when the
[06:56.400 --> 06:58.840]  cops pull them over they start shooting at the cops shooting everybody else
[06:58.840 --> 07:03.600]  so everybody runs for cover I don't know this is connected to that who knows but
[07:03.600 --> 07:07.400]  what I do know is is that you have 12,000 people a year that die from guns in
[07:07.400 --> 07:15.200]  the United States and what I do know is that around 9,000 of those are
[07:15.200 --> 07:22.280]  suicides so we've got quite a few people that are being killed and
[07:22.280 --> 07:27.640]  drive by shootings are being killed by murders but still statistically ladies
[07:27.640 --> 07:32.040]  and gentlemen tens of thousands drowned tens of thousands fallen hit their
[07:32.040 --> 07:35.120]  head in the bathroom and died and I pulled up the numbers here they're
[07:35.120 --> 07:41.240]  always four or five years behind on statistics but in 2016 50 plus thousand
[07:41.240 --> 07:47.720]  people died from prescription opioids now they've been reporting that it's ten
[07:47.720 --> 07:51.680]  times worse now than it was a decade ago but but we don't have the exact
[07:51.680 --> 07:56.440]  numbers so let's just say hundreds of thousands of people are dying a year from
[07:56.440 --> 08:00.920]  drug overdoses that famous baseball player just died from fentanyl but you
[08:00.920 --> 08:04.080]  see Trump's trying to make that a big front and center issue I try to make it
[08:04.080 --> 08:09.560]  a big issue to most people have friends or family that are crippled by opiates
[08:09.560 --> 08:12.440]  they've been causing problems for thousands of years there's an old
[08:12.440 --> 08:18.240]  number 2017 says 47,600 I actually have the federal government's own numbers
[08:18.240 --> 08:23.200]  here I had to move my articles over from the other side and they got mixed
[08:23.200 --> 08:27.720]  together so I'm gonna get to this later in the next hour but will someone go in
[08:27.720 --> 08:32.600]  and reprint because I'm not gonna dig through these stacks no can't do it now
[08:32.600 --> 08:36.480]  I'm all stacked up it's okay they got moved over and mixed or it's my fault I
[08:36.480 --> 08:40.320]  mixed them wrong the point is is that is that I had the federal number that's
[08:40.320 --> 08:50.320]  53,000 that graph we showed just 47,000 2016 2000 no no so we're going to show
[08:50.320 --> 08:56.160]  you that as well okay and we're gonna just basically look at the facts here
[08:56.160 --> 09:03.040]  that automobiles kill hundreds of thousands of people a year but again
[09:03.040 --> 09:07.440]  they hype up mass shootings because it is scary to think you can go to the movie
[09:07.440 --> 09:11.200]  theater or go to the shopping mall and then some crazy person comes in and
[09:11.200 --> 09:15.920]  kills you but out of 300 and probably 60 million people if you count all the
[09:15.920 --> 09:21.880]  illegal aliens but 330 million people in the census it's very rare to get shot
[09:21.880 --> 09:26.440]  in a mass shooting just like it's rare to have somebody breaking your house and
[09:26.440 --> 09:29.560]  shoot you but it's still terrible that happens to you but the point is the
[09:29.560 --> 09:36.600]  media is hyping this to launch red flag laws and try to take all of our guns so
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.280]  that then they can really have some fun with us we'll be back with all the
[09:40.280 --> 09:43.840]  latest and that to a rork saying confiscate all the guns straight ahead
[09:43.840 --> 09:46.320]  please stay with us
[09:48.840 --> 09:54.000]  it's been a year since info wars and our other channels were completely banned
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.440]  off of YouTube we had over five billion views when we got banned and we're
[09:57.440 --> 10:00.760]  credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch
[10:00.760 --> 10:05.200]  through and reach the grassroots now as we enter the 2020 election cycle it's
[10:05.200 --> 10:09.640]  more important than ever that there'd be a place where the censors are unable to

[14:34.440 --> 14:38.440]  live on the Sunday edition I will be live tomorrow on the Monday edition for
[14:38.440 --> 14:47.080]  September 2nd 2019 you can bet your boots now we're obviously at a major
[14:47.080 --> 14:53.080]  historical crossroads right now we are in the middle of a global quickening and
[14:53.080 --> 14:59.120]  the Democratic Party represents the powerful global corporate interests that
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.680]  want to disarm dumb down population want to post human world to have a post
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.520]  human world you've got to disarm the people you want to get rid of and by the
[15:08.520 --> 15:10.920]  way if you're a new viewer or a listener you you're saying what do you mean a
[15:10.920 --> 15:19.000]  post human world well NBC last week and the big cover story that humans will
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.720]  soon be obsolete humans will be extinct that's a good thing because we're bad
[15:24.720 --> 15:30.160]  and it'll be good for the environment when the cyborgs rise that's humans that
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.920]  merge the machines really those will just be humans that are slaves of big
[15:34.920 --> 15:40.320]  tech but they sell it like it's the ultimate status and how all the
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.240]  followers really become cool kids there's the headline cyborgs will replace
[15:45.240 --> 15:49.080]  humans and remake the world James Lovelock says and you tuned in to
[15:49.080 --> 15:53.000]  Discovery Channel or any of these shows it's like there's too many humans need
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  to get rid of them we're gonna merge the machines I don't believe in God but I'm
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.160]  gonna become one Ray Kurzweil so they say this and they do this and they push
[16:02.160 --> 16:08.080]  this everywhere in every way and then they tell us oh but we care about human
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.360]  life and we care about the children we care about people they get shot by guns
[16:12.360 --> 16:17.280]  and we cry and Beto cries and then he kind of looks up and smiles and laughs
[16:17.280 --> 16:28.040]  then we can pull in Beto laughing in El Paso a month ago he does that weird
[16:28.040 --> 16:34.120]  demonic it's terrible they're dying oh they don't care about the hundred to
[16:34.120 --> 16:36.880]  15 million killed by the Communist Chinese in their own country they don't
[16:36.880 --> 16:42.280]  care about 50 million killed by Lenin and Stalin they don't care about any of
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.120]  that they don't care about the hundreds of thousands dead and torture death in
[16:46.120 --> 16:53.800]  Cuba probably millions same thing of Venezuela no but they know you've got
[16:53.800 --> 16:58.000]  a conscience and they know you care and they know when you hear about seven
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.600]  people dead including the shooter you know desha at a outside of mall in a
[17:02.600 --> 17:07.360]  movie theater because the cops pull this guy over and he just starts randomly
[17:07.360 --> 17:15.400]  shooting people including a 17-month-old child amongst those that are injured
[17:15.400 --> 17:18.080]  well we have the special report that really needs to be shared it's really
[17:18.080 --> 17:26.280]  powerful that I aired earlier pieces of the headline is the zombie apocalypse is
[17:26.280 --> 17:32.320]  real and it's here it's not undead walking around killing people but it's
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.640]  just this week a woman in Georgia walking by a mother and a father with
[17:36.640 --> 17:39.960]  their daughter and their son stabbing the three-year-old boy almost cutting his
[17:39.960 --> 17:44.640]  nose off going for his eyes but stabbing big giant holes in his face with a
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.160]  10-inch butcher knife then trying to kill the little girl the mother and the
[17:48.160 --> 17:57.520]  father one female officer put her in cuffs and just led her away that stories
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.440]  on info wars.com with the video and then another woman just attacked him an
[18:01.440 --> 18:04.480]  uber driver for no reason tried to ram through his windshield try to go
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.360]  through the windshield then began biting him like something out of a zombie
[18:08.360 --> 18:15.080]  movie that we should roll some b-roll of that just you know from a special report
[18:15.080 --> 18:20.080]  that we've got on the zombie apocalypse yeah here it is perfect and and there's
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.520]  so many of these I can't even play them all for you or then there's the guy
[18:24.520 --> 18:31.200]  running around in Tampa who just killed his sister and her daughter his niece for
[18:31.200 --> 18:36.560]  no reason and then going and humping the groundskeeper and screaming satanic
[18:36.560 --> 18:42.680]  things and trying to bite him trying to rape him and biting and then there's
[18:42.680 --> 18:47.240]  more videos I've got probably I don't know five articles and a bunch of video
[18:47.240 --> 19:00.320]  of people in Sweden France Germany England and Italy of Muslims from
[19:00.320 --> 19:07.720]  Afghanistan and from Morocco and from Iraq walking up to people at bus
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.240]  stations and of course they're all white and targeting men women and
[19:12.240 --> 19:22.480]  children and one guy stabbed ten people wounded nine killed one and there's
[19:22.480 --> 19:30.880]  incredible haunting video up on info wars.com about it in in France where a
[19:30.880 --> 19:35.560]  Frenchman walks up yeah this has got the video and doesn't even attack the guy
[19:35.560 --> 19:41.800]  pleads with him and then the Muslim drops the knife so this big French guy
[19:41.800 --> 19:45.760]  comes up can grab the butcher knife away it's right in his striking distance you
[19:45.760 --> 19:53.640]  know the guy's got a butcher knife risk his life not to punch that guy on the
[19:53.640 --> 19:58.680]  throat that's domestication right there folks you take the knife away from him
[19:58.680 --> 20:03.920]  and you jam it up through his throat but see you go to Afghanistan they just
[20:03.920 --> 20:07.840]  randomly kill each other for no reason you go to Pakistan they just randomly
[20:07.840 --> 20:13.080]  kill each other for no reason it's very very sad a lot of it is the extreme
[20:13.080 --> 20:18.040]  inbreeding. Pakistanis are 2% of the population in the UK they're 37% of
[20:18.040 --> 20:22.720]  deformities very sad but marrying your sister ain't good whether you're British
[20:22.720 --> 20:28.720]  royalty or whether you're Pakistani it's very dangerous very dangerous causes a
[20:28.720 --> 20:33.200]  lot of psychotic activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan the level of mental illness
[20:33.200 --> 20:38.520]  let me just watch the videos for yourself but see doesn't stab to death all
[20:38.520 --> 20:44.280]  over Europe almost all by Muslims who do not allow white people in their
[20:44.280 --> 20:50.560]  areas and no-go zones and now they're expanding outside the no-go zones and
[20:50.560 --> 20:55.200]  they look and act like zombies just like the white dude in Tampa the monster
[20:55.200 --> 21:00.080]  killing his sister and her daughter his nephew his niece and you look at their
[21:00.080 --> 21:06.000]  faces they have the same and then he's just humping the Greenskeeper after he's
[21:06.000 --> 21:15.480]  killed his sister and trying to choke him while he tries to rape him so we'll
[21:15.480 --> 21:20.840]  play Beto O'Rourke who says oh he's so sad it's f'd up notice how CNN cusses
[21:20.840 --> 21:23.600]  everybody else can cuss but not a conservative show you know the FCC would
[21:23.600 --> 21:29.160]  come after us but he cusses because it's so woke and so real now we got all these
[21:29.160 --> 21:38.520]  stacks of articles and all these videos of the Islamics raping and killing and
[21:38.520 --> 21:43.280]  attacking and bombing and running people over the cars it's never on our nose
[21:43.280 --> 21:47.760]  and they want info wars calm and news wars calm shut down so you don't see it
[21:47.760 --> 21:50.960]  and look I'm not saying all the Muslims are bad people the most dangerous thing
[21:50.960 --> 21:56.920]  to a Muslim is other Muslims they're the biggest victims of Islam but Islam has
[21:56.920 --> 22:00.960]  been expanding for 1400 years taking the world over the UN admits hundreds of
[22:00.960 --> 22:04.840]  thousands of Christians are killed a year by Muslims worldwide from Indonesia
[22:04.840 --> 22:14.680]  to Nigeria to France and there's no coverage of it oh but you get killed in
[22:14.680 --> 22:18.080]  mass shootings used to be about a hundred a year in senseless mass shootings
[22:18.080 --> 22:25.360]  you don't count gang related now it's up to about 150 it's terrible my goodness
[22:25.360 --> 22:30.520]  it's a horrible thing but how many people died on Texas roads today I'm
[22:30.520 --> 22:34.840]  guarantee it's it's it's in the thousands they've got signs up I saw it on
[22:34.840 --> 22:39.200]  the sign last week that so far what's 3,000 something people died on Texas
[22:39.200 --> 22:43.320]  roads had big bit had a big flashing government billboard up usually has
[22:43.320 --> 22:48.120]  amber alerts to talk about 3,200 something Texans have died on Texas
[22:48.120 --> 22:53.680]  roads this year but you see that being hyped up everywhere else no the highway
[22:53.680 --> 22:57.560]  patrol the transportation part was like hey drive safe safe following this is
[22:57.560 --> 23:02.480]  this is a dangerous what you're doing so you get a hundred and fifty people are
[23:02.480 --> 23:05.480]  so killed in mass shootings it's the end of the world everybody else that has
[23:05.480 --> 23:09.600]  guns has to turn their guns in it's all our fault
[23:10.080 --> 23:16.320]  let's go out to break with Beto or or blaming God owners and saying he wants
[23:16.320 --> 23:21.520]  to confiscate all semi-autos here it is congressman welcome let's start on the
[23:21.520 --> 23:26.520]  shooting I want to play for our viewers your reaction at a campaign stop last
[23:26.520 --> 23:28.520]  night
[23:39.520 --> 23:44.080]  yeah the the rhetoric that we've used the thoughts and prayers that you just
[23:44.080 --> 23:49.360]  referred to it has done nothing to stop the epidemic of gun violence to protect
[23:49.360 --> 23:53.720]  our kids our families our fellow Americans in public places at a Walmart
[23:53.720 --> 23:59.600]  El Paso where 22 were killed in Sutherland Springs in a church one or
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.280]  two a day all over this country 100 killed daily in the United States of
[24:04.280 --> 24:10.840]  America we're averaging about 300 mass shootings a year no other country comes
[24:10.840 --> 24:15.160]  close so yes this is getting really and if we don't call it out for what it is if
[24:15.160 --> 24:19.880]  we're not able to speak clearly if we're not able to act decisively then we
[24:19.880 --> 24:23.920]  will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America and I cannot accept
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.720]  that and so we're going to speak as defiantly and as strongly as we can but
[24:28.720 --> 24:32.640]  we're also going to take action universal background checks red flag laws and
[24:32.640 --> 24:38.920]  into the sales of weapons of war and buying those ak-47s and ar-15s back

[26:47.160 --> 27:07.080]  you are listening to an infowars.com frontline report it's Alex Jones
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.480]  ladies and gentlemen we're back we're broadcasting worldwide I'm your host
[27:15.480 --> 27:21.160]  Alex Jones and some stations don't care this five minutes so come back start
[27:21.160 --> 27:26.080]  the next segment and get into the tragic shooting in Odessa which is getting
[27:26.080 --> 27:36.120]  more coverage than the giant magnitude 5.0 earthquake that hit Alaska or the type
[27:36.120 --> 27:41.840]  five hurricane at the same time Dorian that's also bearing down on the East
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.000]  Coast which could potentially kill thousands of people but again it was
[27:46.000 --> 27:53.920]  Stalin that said ten thousand men die it's a statistic one man dies it's a
[27:53.920 --> 27:59.600]  tragedy because it personalizes you see they don't personalize the millions of
[27:59.600 --> 28:02.640]  babies that get aborted every year before they're born or the tens of
[28:02.640 --> 28:08.480]  thousands that are kept alive now and harvest it they don't do that they don't
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.160]  humanize them but when they want to humanize somebody like John McCain boy
[28:13.160 --> 28:17.040]  do they make that corrupt Keating 5 gangster thug look greater George
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.480]  Herbert Walker Bush the New World Order anti-gun piece of crap so we've got
[28:22.480 --> 28:25.440]  quite an hour lined up for you because I'm going to go through all this and
[28:25.440 --> 28:28.520]  finish up on that and then I'm going to get to the geopolitical developments the
[28:28.520 --> 28:31.280]  huge developments with Joe Biden I told you he's not going to make it to the
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.120]  race I told you that first three months ago now it's mainstream news I'm not
[28:36.120 --> 28:39.920]  bragging folks you can assess somebody and tell you whether they could make it
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.920]  whether they can't make it but you did hear it here first because I'm not a
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.480]  follower you see and that's the answer is not being a bunch of damn followers
[28:48.480 --> 28:52.240]  they just regurgitate what the establishment puts out but your own
[28:52.240 --> 28:58.000]  research speaking of that we were amongst the first to expose in 2004 that
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.080]  Google was using microphones in your computer to listen to you now it's come
[29:02.080 --> 29:05.160]  out this week that they put spy tech on it to watch and listen to you even when
[29:05.160 --> 29:08.680]  you turn it off even when you say you don't want those cookies turned on even
[29:08.680 --> 29:14.160]  when you disable that and it's mainstream news why even the associated
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.960]  press and yahoo finance tells you Apple and Google are all listening to you and
[29:19.960 --> 29:23.640]  watching you even when you don't want them to and they're selling the data and
[29:23.640 --> 29:28.960]  the Chinese government's doing it too see all this stuff's mainstream news now
[29:28.960 --> 29:33.680]  it's all mainstream news speaking of dehumanization and not valuing humans
[29:33.680 --> 29:37.240]  here's a piece where we get into the fact that this is like six-year-old
[29:37.240 --> 29:41.840]  piece five-year-old piece where they're heating hospitals with the dead bodies of
[29:41.840 --> 29:44.960]  children here it is
[29:50.000 --> 29:55.560]  aborted babies incinerated to eat UK hospitals
[29:55.560 --> 30:01.320]  silent green ladies and gentlemen is made out of people but now children are
[30:01.320 --> 30:06.160]  literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in
[30:06.160 --> 30:16.480]  the UK they're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity the
[30:16.480 --> 30:20.920]  powdered flesh from dead babies some people believe they can cure disease
[30:20.920 --> 30:26.800]  because of its enormous popularity soil green is in short supply remember
[30:26.800 --> 30:33.120]  Tuesday is silent green day the supply of soil and green has been exhausted you
[30:33.120 --> 30:36.480]  must evacuate the area
[30:37.800 --> 30:43.480]  rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo Big Builder Bird Group company are not
[30:43.480 --> 30:48.600]  allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we
[30:48.600 --> 30:53.440]  already know so enjoy the flavor we're gonna get the real solution which is
[30:53.440 --> 30:57.160]  going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes I'm consistently
[30:57.160 --> 31:00.940]  pro-death I'm for assisted suicide I'm for regular
[31:00.940 --> 31:04.280]  suicide I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving is spending a million
[31:04.280 --> 31:08.400]  dollars on that last three months of life for that patient would it be better
[31:08.400 --> 31:14.680]  not to lay off the those 10 teachers and to make that trade-up in medical cost
[31:14.680 --> 31:18.280]  but that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that
[31:18.280 --> 31:24.280]  discussion they told me to to say that they were sorry but that you had become
[31:24.280 --> 31:27.400]  unreliable
[31:32.800 --> 31:37.320]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that
[31:37.320 --> 31:42.120]  would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to
[31:42.120 --> 31:44.840]  its dissidents
[31:44.840 --> 31:54.800]  band.video is the answer to censorship band.video is the answer for
[31:54.800 --> 31:59.320]  libertarians conservatives nationalist pro-gun pro-life pro-human
[31:59.320 --> 32:05.520]  individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube Facebook
[32:05.520 --> 32:09.200]  and Twitter are still available we've launched it ladies and gentlemen it's
[32:09.200 --> 32:16.480]  now live band.video band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or
[32:16.480 --> 32:20.600]  David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos we are building it to
[32:20.600 --> 32:25.520]  be a place where banned memes are able to be posted and we're a growing list of
[32:25.520 --> 32:30.160]  freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free for being shut down
[32:30.160 --> 32:35.040]  free from being censored free from being silenced by big tech the chai comms
[32:35.040 --> 32:40.200]  the Hollywood scum and the globalist freedom of speech has a home it's called
[32:40.200 --> 32:47.760]  banned.video America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at banned.video
[32:47.760 --> 33:15.680]  the global corporations that are setting up a planetary world government are
[33:15.680 --> 33:25.080]  basically to accompany the most psychopathic sociopathic cold-blooded
[33:25.080 --> 33:34.160]  robotic reptilian type autocrats you could really imagine and they are
[33:34.160 --> 33:39.840]  selling the post-human world they're saying everybody's obsolete and then
[33:39.840 --> 33:45.720]  they're greasing the skids to make us as a immoral and decadent and dumb and
[33:45.720 --> 33:55.120]  lazy and shallow as we can be to have a self-fulfilling prophecy because when
[33:55.120 --> 34:01.000]  you have an industrialized world and when people even the poorest people can
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.320]  live better than kings did a thousand years ago you're going to have a lot of
[34:06.320 --> 34:10.480]  people who are going to become lazy decadent slobs it was the French
[34:10.480 --> 34:20.240]  historian philosopher statesman Victor Hugo that said adversity makes men
[34:20.240 --> 34:27.680]  prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters and it
[34:27.680 --> 34:33.280]  really is true that anyone that's seen somebody set a company up say a
[34:33.280 --> 34:40.000]  grandfather who's did it by their bootstraps and then you see the children
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.520]  that take up with the company they're a little more lazy a little more decadent
[34:42.520 --> 34:46.400]  by the time you get to their grandchildren on average you're dealing
[34:46.400 --> 34:57.800]  with completely lazy disconnected stupid hedonist on average on average and
[34:57.800 --> 35:05.840]  then you take that evil corrupt people come in to those power structures who
[35:05.840 --> 35:09.040]  are first-generation but they're corrupt and then they manipulate those
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.520]  corrupt elites they actually built things and then the really evil people
[35:13.520 --> 35:19.680]  take over and then you get a vi Lenin then you get an at all fitler then you
[35:19.680 --> 35:24.760]  get a mouse at home and then you've got a big problem and then hundreds of
[35:24.760 --> 35:34.160]  millions of people die and so what I'm getting at here is that the mainstream
[35:34.160 --> 35:47.520]  media does not give a rats ass about the 17 people that got wounded and the six
[35:47.520 --> 35:53.480]  that died seven including a shooter in Odessa I mean it's a big number since
[35:53.480 --> 35:56.280]  he wanted all the guns taken from the American people his daughter wants a
[35:56.280 --> 36:01.560]  mole taken on MSNBC with her psycho Joe husband it's found the dead intern in
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.800]  his office but he it's okay because he's above the law
[36:09.520 --> 36:16.160]  so Brent ski wrote in a couple of his books bragging about how he helped put
[36:16.160 --> 36:23.760]  Pol Pot in and how Pol Pot exterminated everybody and how that was used to
[36:23.760 --> 36:30.240]  stabilize Vietnam via Cambodia and how he's a master tactician because he got
[36:30.240 --> 36:37.920]  them all to kill each other pretty evil huh he's the guy that tricked the
[36:37.920 --> 36:44.120]  Russians into invading Afghanistan by funding the Mujahideen in 1979 to attack
[36:44.120 --> 36:48.480]  the Russian underbelly first not lionizing the Soviet Russians but you
[36:48.480 --> 36:52.160]  don't do something more evil than they would do to then beat them and then
[36:52.160 --> 36:55.160]  say you're still the good guy so Brzezinski wanted your guns he died a
[36:55.160 --> 37:00.640]  couple years ago but he'd fund mass murder and and would set it up they
[37:00.640 --> 37:06.000]  killed 30% of the population in Cambodia these people don't care about you
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.960]  mainstream media would promote oxy cotton and fentanyl until Trump got in
[37:10.960 --> 37:14.560]  and we've seen a tenfold increase according to the Centers for Disease
[37:14.560 --> 37:20.840]  Control and the FDA and the DEA of the amount of opioid abuse you can't swing
[37:20.840 --> 37:25.120]  a stick and not hit somebody that's died from it or is dying from it or has been
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.760]  you know ruin their life on it it's just an epidemic it's all over the place it
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.960]  touches everybody touches me I don't I hate this stuff can't even take it but
[37:35.960 --> 37:41.760]  it it's touched me I don't people very close this has happened to so when they
[37:41.760 --> 37:46.240]  weigh the bloody shirt and say you as gun owners are guilty you need to
[37:46.240 --> 37:51.320]  understand that you're right to own guns cause this guy to go kill six people
[37:51.320 --> 37:57.360]  and cause the other antifa psychopath to go kill 20 people at the Walmart and he
[37:57.360 --> 38:02.120]  was antifa on his social media they took it down and said he was a Trump
[38:02.120 --> 38:09.000]  supporter the other guy they didn't take down in time he was antifa and a devil
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.800]  worshipper and in the pedophilia because they always are always some weird
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.000]  crazy-eyed guy in a black outfit who wants to go see the devil and he told
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.960]  everybody at the school I'm gonna kill everybody and the police were called and
[38:23.960 --> 38:31.440]  nothing was done just like the shooter last year on Valentine's Day who've been
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.160]  kicked out of school for six months Cruz who got to commit all these crimes
[38:36.160 --> 38:39.600]  because it was a liberal law passed that if you're a minority you get to commit
[38:39.600 --> 38:45.640]  all these crimes and not go to jail he wasn't even Hispanic he was adopted by
[38:45.640 --> 38:52.280]  people that were Hispanic but his name was Cruz he didn't go to jail for
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.480]  vandalism and robbery he threatened to kill people and had the police called on
[38:56.480 --> 39:02.400]  him 44 times he was known as school shooter he walked around going bang bang
[39:02.400 --> 39:08.200]  you're dead I'm gonna kill you to good-looking girls let's pull up the
[39:08.200 --> 39:14.120]  image of the Parkland Florida shooter please when he was arrested those
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.120]  crazy eyes just like the eyes of all the other shooters
[39:19.120 --> 39:22.840]  they're demon-possessed folks they're told by the media that hypes up mass
[39:22.840 --> 39:26.880]  shootings since 1999 with Harrison Clybold that go out and kill people and
[39:26.880 --> 39:30.880]  you'll be famous and there's big studies out just type it in studies show
[39:30.880 --> 39:38.080]  media intense coverage of mass shooters makes them do it people say well why are
[39:38.080 --> 39:41.560]  you doing it because we have to counter what they're doing and tell them to stop
[39:41.560 --> 39:47.880]  it oh you don't see any mainstream media telling you of all the studies
[39:47.880 --> 39:55.080]  about crazy eyes it's just just pull up him being arrested that that's his
[39:55.080 --> 40:00.720]  mugshot pull up Parkland shooters being arrested being apprehended you'll see
[40:00.720 --> 40:05.960]  him looking up like this desperate zombie just like all the others and so
[40:05.960 --> 40:14.800]  because there's all these crazy zombie people we're then supposed to give our
[40:14.800 --> 40:20.920]  guns over so we can live like Chicago that has 2,000 plus deaths a year or
[40:20.920 --> 40:27.120]  Baltimore that's got 1,500 deaths a year or all the other places that have five
[40:27.120 --> 40:31.800]  six seven eight nine ten twelve fourteen times the average last time I checked
[40:31.800 --> 40:40.480]  Chicago has 14 times the average homicide rate of the United States because
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.880]  they take the guns and then all the people that have more criminals and I
[40:44.880 --> 40:49.560]  know our audience does this but they put this idea out something must be done
[40:49.560 --> 40:56.960]  we must never have another mass shooting you heard Beto earlier he said
[40:56.960 --> 41:06.240]  there are 300 mass shootings a year they count if more than one person shot as a
[41:06.240 --> 41:14.240]  mass shooting on average we've had professor lot and other top statisticians
[41:14.240 --> 41:20.920]  I mean he's one of the top guys in the world and when I had him on like two
[41:20.920 --> 41:30.520]  years ago the average was 57 people killed in real school mass shootings and
[41:30.520 --> 41:33.920]  if you had all the other businesses and things it was a little over a hundred so
[41:33.920 --> 41:36.960]  and it's gone up some now I'm trying to put the numbers together I think it's
[41:36.960 --> 41:44.600]  like about 115 right now this year that's still terrible but again 3,000
[41:44.600 --> 41:48.280]  plus people died already this year in Texas on the highways if you believe
[41:48.280 --> 41:52.120]  the big highway signs that tell you the big flashing signs and I know it's
[41:52.120 --> 41:56.760]  probably above that again is that okay no but we're still gonna drive our cars
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.800]  just cuz somebody wrecks a car is drunk in a car runs over smite a car cuz
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.480]  they're ISIS I don't lose my car I don't lose my right to drive because
[42:06.480 --> 42:12.520]  somebody else is bad there are over 10,000 people a year that get beaten to
[42:12.520 --> 42:17.440]  death with things like baseball bats and clubs look at the numbers you don't
[42:17.440 --> 42:20.840]  say don't let baseball teams have baseball bats don't people have butcher
[42:20.840 --> 42:23.960]  knives this woman stabs a little kid in the face for no reason in Georgia last
[42:23.960 --> 42:27.600]  week the butcher knife do we take all our butcher knives away in England
[42:27.600 --> 42:32.280]  making you get a license for one so it's happening folks they're trying to
[42:32.280 --> 42:35.720]  blame the general public for something that's still incredibly rare but the
[42:35.720 --> 42:39.560]  media hypes up increase the perception of its epidemic we have to get the truth
[42:39.560 --> 42:42.960]  out about that the answer though to senseless violence that is increasing

[47:13.000 --> 47:27.040]  believe we're about to hit 2020 hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns
[47:27.040 --> 47:32.880]  Mal took the guns that El Castro took the guns you go show this took the guns

[47:40.200 --> 47:44.240]  rise again when you attempt to take our guns
[47:55.040 --> 48:06.240]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[48:06.240 --> 48:11.360]  well Beto O'Rourke when he's not giggling and laughing about the dead
[48:11.360 --> 48:18.000]  people in El Paso is out saying it's effing time to register your guns and
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.560]  then confiscate all the semi-autos that's that's what he's saying remember
[48:21.560 --> 48:27.400]  back when they should deny that but their own internal Brady campaign and the
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.360]  Soros funded groups in Bloomberg their internal documents would come out they'd
[48:32.360 --> 48:37.880]  say our plan is the civilian disarmament and they signed on to the UN treaty
[48:37.880 --> 48:45.000]  Bill Clinton did but never got ratified then Bush almost passed it in 2001 the
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.280]  Uniteer United Nations small arms convention and it said right there in
[48:50.280 --> 48:54.880]  the treaty that never got passed by Congress civilian firearms ownership
[48:54.880 --> 49:02.520]  threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state that's a totally true
[49:02.520 --> 49:05.800]  statement except for one word legitimate let's take the word legitimate
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.840]  out civilian ownership of firearms threatens the power monopoly of the
[49:11.840 --> 49:20.640]  state power monopoly tearing now sit down Hitler Stalin now pull pot it'll
[49:20.640 --> 49:27.640]  Castro Hugo Chavez Mexico only the government has the guts and the
[49:27.640 --> 49:31.800]  cartels and the lawless once you do that you have the lawless government the
[49:31.800 --> 49:37.960]  lawless criminals because slaves are disarmed and so you bet I'm harping on
[49:37.960 --> 49:41.240]  it this Sunday because there's gonna be more mass shootings this country there's
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.040]  gonna be more stabbings more bombings more people running over folks because
[49:46.040 --> 49:53.040]  it's true that we peaked crime lies in 1991 the FBI has these numbers the 80s
[49:53.040 --> 49:57.040]  was hell early 90s were bad I remember when I was growing up Dallas when it was
[49:57.040 --> 50:00.880]  the murder capital of the United States above Chicago where there'd be up to
[50:00.880 --> 50:08.760]  20 murders in one day sometimes in in South Dallas drug related no one thought
[50:08.760 --> 50:12.960]  hey let's turn our guns in because 10 miles away drug dealers are killing
[50:12.960 --> 50:18.520]  each other in a turf war it's like Mexico has hundreds of thousands dead the
[50:18.520 --> 50:22.520]  last decade in their drug war many of innocent people do we go oh let's turn
[50:22.520 --> 50:28.720]  our guns in because there's criminals in Mexico will be safe it's asinine you
[50:28.720 --> 50:36.880]  create an atmosphere for incredible crime when you take the guns unless you're
[50:36.880 --> 50:41.120]  domesticated Europe where they had almost no crime England was one of the
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.040]  same places in the world the British police the Bobby's didn't carry weapons
[50:46.040 --> 50:51.680]  they carry machine guns now because they brought in people from countries where
[50:51.680 --> 50:57.600]  everybody's killing each other the Middle East dangerous areas of Asia dangerous
[50:57.600 --> 51:03.040]  areas of Eastern Europe and now they have a higher crime rate in England than
[51:03.040 --> 51:07.520]  we have here on average oh people aren't getting shot to death mainly they're
[51:07.520 --> 51:13.240]  getting stabbed to death every few hours in London alone asset attacks all but
[51:13.240 --> 51:15.880]  again the establishment knows they're always gonna have bodyguards they're
[51:15.880 --> 51:20.760]  gonna live behind armored walls they want the general public disarmed for
[51:20.760 --> 51:25.240]  total control and I know as an audience you understand that I know as an
[51:25.240 --> 51:29.720]  audience you get all of that but that's where the Democrats say they're going
[51:29.720 --> 51:34.200]  I mean the New York Times this year they've all come out and said time to repeal
[51:34.200 --> 51:40.520]  the Second Amendment that's how 1776 started when the British came to take
[51:40.520 --> 51:46.600]  the guns at Lexington at Concord at Bunker Hill and again I know this audience
[51:46.600 --> 51:52.680]  knows that but coming up next segment I've got articles right here where they're
[51:52.680 --> 52:02.100]  all ready confiscating firearms under red flag laws in multiple states from
[52:02.100 --> 52:07.280]  people that say things like if Antifa starts killing us and coming to our
[52:07.280 --> 52:11.400]  houses to kill us like I've said we'll have to fight back well I said that
[52:11.400 --> 52:14.880]  last year I was banned from Twitter they were going people's houses so they're
[52:14.880 --> 52:18.320]  gonna kill people they already shot Scalise they were they already broke the
[52:18.320 --> 52:22.640]  ribs of Rand Paul Antifa said we're gonna go to went to Carlson's house so
[52:22.640 --> 52:25.800]  we're gonna kill you and I said hey if you're on Antifa's list you better have
[52:25.800 --> 52:30.000]  a gun to protect yourself and the news said Joan threatens to kill reporters
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.360]  where was the video where was the audio but the media said that under red flag
[52:36.360 --> 52:39.800]  laws I would be disarmed you read what these people having their guns taken
[52:39.800 --> 52:46.600]  said they said what I said they didn't go as far as Thomas Jefferson that said
[52:46.600 --> 52:49.160]  the trio Liberty needs to be watered from time to time with the blood of
[52:49.160 --> 52:54.200]  Patriots and Tyrants boy he'd have been red flag law no red flag we already have
[52:54.200 --> 53:00.000]  it on the books we already have you process people like Cruz said 44 police
[53:00.000 --> 53:07.240]  reports I'm gonna come kill her by the school well buddy boy you get put in a
[53:07.240 --> 53:11.600]  mental institution or prison for that and the next time you get out you say it
[53:11.600 --> 53:19.680]  we give you a lobotomy how's that sound see how that works see Antifa's the
[53:19.680 --> 53:23.000]  ones out saying kill people shoot people they're the ones with the John Brown
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.480]  gun club saying let's go kill cops there was another firebombing of another ice
[53:26.480 --> 53:31.040]  facility today you didn't hear about that because the media won't cover it
[53:31.040 --> 53:37.240]  there was a black young man that went and shot a whole bunch of people what
[53:37.240 --> 53:43.760]  he wanted to attend people at a football game you didn't even see that on the
[53:43.760 --> 53:47.160]  news did you because it's fitting the white supremacist narrative what we've
[53:47.160 --> 53:50.280]  got is the beginning of a zombie apocalypse in this country with the
[53:50.280 --> 53:56.960]  breakdown of morals and people hearing hey it's an option let me just go out
[53:56.960 --> 54:02.520]  to shoot a bunch of people at a football game mainly fellow black people
[54:02.520 --> 54:06.560]  because the truth is whether it's the white guy killing his sister and his
[54:06.560 --> 54:10.520]  nephew or his niece and chewing on the greenskeeper or it's the black lady
[54:10.520 --> 54:14.440]  biting the guy in Atlanta or it's the crazy white guy in Texas shooting people
[54:14.440 --> 54:17.880]  or the crazy black guy at the football game it's not what color they are and
[54:17.880 --> 54:25.320]  it's not the gun it's evil it's craziness and it's that the media has
[54:25.320 --> 54:31.760]  hyped all this up as if it's an option something you could do something you
[54:31.760 --> 54:38.640]  should do let's play beto auror here he is we're averaging about 300 mass
[54:38.640 --> 54:44.520]  shootings a year no other country comes close so yes this is not true and if we
[54:44.520 --> 54:48.880]  don't call it out for what it is if we're not able to speak clearly there's
[54:48.880 --> 54:51.800]  millions down all over the place decisively then we will continue to
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.600]  have this kind of bloodshed in America and I cannot accept that and so we're
[54:56.600 --> 55:00.760]  gonna speak as defiantly and as strongly as we can but we're also gonna take
[55:00.760 --> 55:05.280]  action universal background checks red flag laws and into the sales of weapons
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.160]  of war and buying those ak-47s and ar-15s back so that they cannot be used
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.960]  against our fellow Americans and oh just take the ak-47s ak-47s full auto you
[55:14.960 --> 55:18.000]  can't even get that without a special deal that's not even true the full auto
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.680]  is never even used in crimes he knows all that but he's manipulating people by
[55:21.680 --> 55:25.800]  the way there are lots of countries that have millions killed routinely it's just
[55:25.800 --> 55:28.560]  over the government has the guns they're doing the killing yeah we're one of the
[55:28.560 --> 55:32.720]  only countries that has guns jackass like Switzerland has a lowest crime rate
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.480]  in the world that's why you can't go take control of it you big fat dirty

[59:25.320 --> 59:29.000]  turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.360]  force with the CoQ 10 and bio PQQ and all the rest of it all of these are

[59:46.480 --> 59:54.600]  much God bless you you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:54.600 --> 01:00:13.120]  I like to see a little anadel right for you folks drink lime green stay up to dawn
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:22.200]  maybe the way it's a lot of really selfish people out there you know so
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:31.280]  besides always been a problem with humanity but it's also been known that
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:39.160]  a lot of evil people when they go they want to take people with them and the
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:45.680]  fact that we are seeing an uptick in stabbings and strangleings and people
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:52.520]  literally trying to chew the flesh off folks face shows that we've lost our
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:58.240]  soul to a certain extent shows that we're sliding towards the abyss we've
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:06.000]  lost our moral compass then you look at these chemicals the serotonin reuptake
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.040]  inhibitors the so-called antidepressants they say on the bottles and with the
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.520]  inserts that this tends to massively increase megalomania it tends to
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.680]  massively increase psychotic behavior it tends to massively increase going out
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:30.760]  and committing murder it actually says may cause mass murder but when you see
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:37.200]  the ads for antidepressants that something like 30 percent of the
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.000]  populations on 30 percent of women are on them something like 15 percent of men
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:54.800]  yeah they don't tell you all that I know a very well-known musician who I met
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.840]  through Mike judge he was an incredible musician in his own right not name
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.960]  dropping just give me an idea and he has that disease that Michael Jackson have
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:16.360]  your skin turns totally white from the antidepressant he takes he's got all
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.240]  these other health problems he doesn't have any of it till he took the pills
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.600]  and they admit within two years of him taking those pills he looks like a
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.720]  vampire and he's got all these other health problems and he can't go off of
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.640]  it or he wants to kill himself and he didn't go on it because he wanted to
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:43.400]  kill himself before he just went on it cuz they just recommended it to him and
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.960]  then you got enough fentanyl being captured at the border last week to
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:56.320]  kill 14 million people there's a story behind that and I'll get to that in a
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:04.600]  moment but just remember they are prescribing 10 times the opioids that
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:12.480]  they were putting out just five years ago that's a DEA number 10 times the
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:18.920]  number of scripts these doctors are right and I get some people are in real
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:24.720]  pain and and need the moderate opioids I know some of you out there you'll get
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.840]  them taken away from you but then other people are killing themselves with it
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:38.760]  but think about that fentanyl is a hundred times stronger than opium they
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.640]  debate the ten times stronger than heroin some say even stronger than that
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:55.640]  and the developing powers the European powers divided China into seven parts
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.800]  12 parts 14 parts at one point yet the American zone the French zone the
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.440]  British zone was obviously the coastline the most valuable and they took
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.760]  over from the Imperial Chinese because the Chinese said opium is illegal here
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.960]  we'll we'll we'll kill you if you have it but that created a black market so that
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.240]  the British would bring it in and first corrupt the coastlines that the police
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.000]  corrupt would ship it inland and then you had all the Chinese laid out
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.600]  smoking their opium when they would come over here to America they would just
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.480]  work all day on the railroad and lay down and take their head of opium and the
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:37.360]  opium dense and there's estimated over a million a half buried Chinese men that
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:43.200]  just came here for opium and work themselves to death like slaves one
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.200]  true thing about that show deadwood space in a real town the HBO had you know
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.640]  years ago I watched it was actually accurate that's a real town that really
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.320]  well most of that's historical some of it's not where they have the Chinese
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.880]  women having to service like 50 men a day and when I'm got pregnant or got sick
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:05.360]  they just feed them to pigs that's the kind of human rights you got in China
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:11.120]  and once it came over here that's the type of human rights you have and so
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.880]  that's what we're competing with ladies and gentlemen so the communists came
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:21.000]  along just took all that over so the Chinese now will execute you death
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.280]  penalty for any drugs marijuana death penalty opium death penalty same thing
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:34.800]  in Singapore but they're shipping in illegal fentanyl and killing hundreds
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:41.040]  of thousands of Americans the latest numbers are 2017 53,000 people die from
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.200]  opiates they think less than half never get properly reported so back then it
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.720]  was a hundred thousand let's say now they're saying it's 10 times the amount
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:55.040]  they don't know the numbers of death it's just epidemic how many movie stars
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.520]  how many how many baseball players how many every week you hear about somebody
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:03.280]  dying is famous does anybody care about that yeah President Trump does and I'm
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.760]  not just you're giving President Trump a brownie point he's actually going after
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:15.640]  something that's killing people he's actually doing something real not just
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:23.880]  lip service because okay a hundred and whatever plus people die a year in true
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:31.680]  mass shootings where somebody goes out to try to kill a bunch of people for no
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.560]  reason when Beto says there's over 300 mass shootings a year most of those are
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.520]  gang related where you get three or four gang members shot and that's still
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.480]  terrible too but that doesn't stand any comparison to all the other things we
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.480]  can do something about enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people will play that
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.080]  report in a moment but first here's Beto O'Rourke slowed down for radio and TV
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:57.680]  viewers a month ago couldn't contain his sickening demonic laughing when he
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:04.360]  talked about the psychotic Antifa that went into that Walmart at that mall in
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:09.520]  El Paso here it is I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:23.880]  about this I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this but
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:34.600]  I'll tell you El Paso is the strongest place in the world a lot of injury a lot
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:43.280]  of suffering in El Paso right now and incredibly saddened and it's very hard
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.720]  to think about this then he starts laughing I thought we'd slow that clip
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.560]  down but tomorrow slow it down I'm gonna be here live now I'm coming in
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.480]  tomorrow and I'm gonna do you know four hours here at least a lot I'm even do

[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:09.040]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:16.160]  listening to Alex Jones okay so there's so much fentanyl in this country that
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.440]  earlier today I just sent a link into the producers and said hey look at the 25
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:25.200]  tons of fentanyl seeds coming into Mexico bound for the US and somehow they
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.880]  just got a clip out of Virginia where they're calling it a record seizure you
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.760]  know a few pounds of it can kill 14 million people okay and I'm glad we had
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:42.240]  this hiccup today because it's really illustrative a couple pounds of it can
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:51.920]  kill 20 I can kill 14 million people 14 million people what does 25 tons of pure
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:59.880]  fentanyl grabbed by the Mexican Navy bound to the US do and we're rolling
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:05.000]  footage for TV viewers of where this barely got a mention of the US news a
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:13.360]  week ago that's CGTV the Mexican Navy seizes six tons at one spot and in all
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:23.520]  the raids it was 25 tons of ships boats offshore Chinese trawlers loading it on
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:31.800]  to motorboats and bringing it in to Mexico to then be loaded on 18 wheelers
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.520]  and taken to the United States so understand one of those little boxes
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:42.200]  is more than the DEA is making a big deal about in Virginia they could kill
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:47.560]  14 million people if it was overdosed there's enough overdoses for 14
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.480]  million people this stuff's so strong before it's been cut that a single spec
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:16:00.320]  of it will kill you meanwhile 25 tons got grabbed in different busts last week
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.520]  and then you just put just type in fentanyl DEA more than 1 million fentanyl
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:15.720]  pills sees in Arizona more than 23,000 kilograms of Chinese fentanyl sees at
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:24.600]  Mexico largest seaport and that's a whole nother one so you're beginning to
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:29.760]  get the idea here China has a very long memory and they remember the British
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.360]  particularly and that's how skull and bones made its money at Yale was the
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.920]  guy that founded it was the big opium distributor into the United States as
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.280]  well in hell they should sell a lot of them to women men children you ever go
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.520]  out in the countryside you'll find an old dump there'll be hundreds of bottles
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.880]  that say laudanum as your baby was crying you just gave them some laudanum
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.480]  they were happy for five six hours because it was opium but the Chinese you
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:01.320]  see they execute you if you get caught with one opium pill much less fentanyl
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:12.080]  if you get caught with one marijuana cigarette then you get executed but they
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:17.080]  ship it all here and they make most of our drugs in China and they're spiking
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.680]  everything and they're finding toxic waste in the over-the-counter pills you
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.240]  get and they're finding plastic in most of the food that shipped in from China
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:33.000]  probably they are just pissing in our Cheerios with poison and they're
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:40.760]  funding Netflix and Hollywood with all the anti-American race war movies and
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:51.000]  trying to demoralize us constantly it's incredible and they know what they're
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.800]  doing and again they've killed 115 million of their own people but they
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.600]  are really getting us back even though the United States really doesn't have
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.760]  any history of shipping opium in doesn't matter we're still seen as a
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:14.040]  competitor to them we're still seen as their enemy and so Japan bombed our
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:18.880]  ships in a sneak attack but they they bombed military men and women mainly
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.800]  men at that time they killed some women as well and it was seen as dastardly
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.960]  because it was a sneak attack that's in the age of war at that time was normal
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:37.960]  not a good thing I'm not defending it but the Chinese communists are shipping
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.520]  let's pull up what's the estimated amount of fentanyl type in estimated
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:49.720]  amount of fentanyl shipped in the US annually is it a hundred tons is it
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:19:04.240]  200 tons is it 300 tons is it 400 tons I mean they just caught 25 tons coming in
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.080]  last week and I could talk all day I've got so much other news but see I've been
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:14.840]  harping on this haven't I because let me show you the numbers I mentioned this
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:20.360]  earlier I've got the federal government's own numbers right here in my
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:33.000]  stack about the numbers here the latest numbers we have is 2017 and it says here
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.680]  it's 53,000 that graph we show said 47,000 let me show you this can I'm an
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:44.480]  overhead shot thanks a lot here opioid this is for the American Society of
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:51.960]  Addiction Medicine they say 52,404 so I said 53 I was going from memory and that
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:59.040]  was in 2017 I'm sorry that number is even older that's 2015 and they say it's up
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:07.040]  tenfold so so whether it's 47,000 or 53,000 whoever's right that's a lot of
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.680]  people and most people that died overdoses never gets reported right so if
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:16.400]  it's 10 times that amount coming in right now and they just seized 25 tons of
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.840]  it but a couple pounds of it can we cue that Virginia news piece up again
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:25.120]  thanks give a small amount of it I forget exactly how much they said we'll
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:32.520]  play it again would kill 14 million people because the numbers I've seen is
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.960]  a hundred times stronger than heroin and then I see a hundred times stronger than
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.320]  opium and heroin's a lot stronger than opium so I don't know let's just say
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:44.240]  this this stuff makes oxy cotton look like beer compared to everclear compared
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:48.920]  to white lightning and that there are people like zombies all over the place
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:55.040]  totally addicted to this stuff and the Chinese are doing it and Trump's trying
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.280]  to fight it and he's the bad guy just remember the Federal Reserve's private
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:04.120]  owned by Europe trying to crash our economy all these big media outlets are
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.200]  trying to bankrupt us trying to get us shut down all these big Democrat law
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.440]  firms are suing us because they want to continue hammering America because this
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.520]  is 21st century warfare and everybody's siding with the globalist is part of
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.280]  this so again here's that newscast out of Virginia making a big deal out of a
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:26.200]  small amount being found so if this small amount kills 14 million what's
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.560]  25 tons here it is investigators have busted a massive drug ring spanning three
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.240]  states all this over just the last three days law enforcement officers in
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.960]  Virginia sees enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people as part of what they're
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.800]  calling operation cookout there are 35 suspects that have been arrested for
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.000]  others still on the run chip readers in Washington Forest chip what else did
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.680]  investigators sees in this bus good morning well authorities say they
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:22:00.720]  seized about 66 pounds of fentanyl I'm so flustered today I heard pounds so I
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.040]  said that's why I'm so flustered today my normal trick memories gone out the
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.600]  window so I said play it again so let's we'll do the calculator thing tomorrow
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:16.520]  when I start the show 66 pounds or whatever divided into 25 tons how much
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:22.640]  smaller is that what fraction is it so that's gonna kill 14 million if it was
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.960]  taken an overdose amount what's 25 tons that enough to kill the whole country it
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:35.960]  was all taken 30 330 million people if if we all took it as an overdose is that
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.560]  enough to give us all an overdose and kill the whole country is that our
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.920]  headline
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.480]  China tried to ship enough fentanyl into the United States to kill
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:49.800]  everybody in the US I don't have a calculator in front of me I guess I could
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:57.760]  do it by hand but that's crazy yeah so 66 pounds 66 pounds is point zero zero
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:08.400]  one three according my producers of 25 tons so we have to find out how much
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:15.040]  more 25 tons is to that and then apply the number so if 14 million is point
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:20.720]  zero zero one three what with 25 tons I think you think that could kill the
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.360]  whole country will I'm not a mathematician I'll get that done tonight
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.480]  first thing tomorrow you'll you'll hear from us okay I didn't get to mainstream
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:34.160]  news telling you that Apple and Google and all the companies are watching and
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.880]  listening to you and selling your data and listening to you have sex and
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.060]  everything they're only telling you now because they want to normalize it to move
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:46.040]  forward as this is the new economy but that's the front page of yahoo it's up
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.200]  on info wars.com it's up on red report.com we'll explain why they're
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:56.040]  throwing at your face now when we told you we told you in 2004 with articles
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:00.560]  and covered it in detail with the actual documents so that's no mathematician
