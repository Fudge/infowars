[00:00.000 --> 00:25.700]  We're going to jam in a few more phone calls for George Norrie, but don't worry, everybody
[00:25.700 --> 00:29.460]  also gets to talk to Sheriff Mack and myself coming up. George Norrie, host of Coast to
[00:29.460 --> 00:34.280]  Coast AM.com, GeorgeNorrieLive.com to find out about his live events, not just the one
[00:34.280 --> 00:38.620]  in Canada this Saturday that I'll be part of. And then of course, everywhere I go, I
[00:38.620 --> 00:43.640]  see people talking about your show beyond belief, and I see the ads all over the place,
[00:43.640 --> 00:45.140]  George. That must be pretty successful.
[00:45.140 --> 00:51.340]  That's a great little show we're doing. It's something I tape once a month, four shows,
[00:51.340 --> 00:56.940]  Netflix. Love to get you up there as a guest. We tape in Denver. And they air it. It's an
[00:56.940 --> 01:04.820]  internet-based show. The company is called GuyMTV, and they just wanted to get into television
[01:04.820 --> 01:10.540]  in a big way, and it's like Netflix. They charge a nominal monthly fee, but they also
[01:10.540 --> 01:19.660]  have access to thousands of self-help videos they bought by Vendy from Universal, and they
[01:19.660 --> 01:25.260]  provide all that. I mean, so for a little fee every month, I mean, you can do everything.
[01:25.260 --> 01:30.140]  You tell me when, and I'll set it up with Tom, the great producer of that show, and
[01:30.140 --> 01:35.620]  Coast, of course, along with Lisa Lyon, and I would love to come anytime you'd like. I
[01:35.620 --> 01:36.620]  love Denver.
[01:36.620 --> 01:43.020]  If anybody wants info on the TV show, just go to our website, coast-to-coast-am.com.
[01:43.020 --> 01:48.940]  You click Hosts at the top, and then it just opens up the TV icon is there.
[01:48.940 --> 01:53.140]  You've got it on screen for viewers as well. Let's real quick. Paul, Ian, Flora, Ed, then
[01:53.140 --> 01:56.540]  we'll go to Joseph. Go ahead, Paul. Quick question for George.
[01:56.540 --> 02:02.060]  Yeah, hey, Alex. First time caller. I just wanted to thank you, sir, for waking me up.
[02:02.060 --> 02:07.140]  I know you don't like to hear it. And as far as George, I'd like to articulate on the first
[02:07.140 --> 02:12.580]  part of the segment when you talked about how the New World Order has kind of rushed
[02:12.580 --> 02:17.420]  things and put everything, the whole plan into perspective and kind of rushing it in
[02:17.420 --> 02:23.220]  now, because it's almost like they are sort of bleeding out. The more we wake up, the
[02:23.220 --> 02:29.780]  more people we wake up, it seems like they are rushing things with AI. And I'm trying
[02:29.780 --> 02:33.540]  to figure out, because I have kids and so forth, it's like I'm trying to figure out
[02:33.540 --> 02:38.980]  how fast it's going to be before they implement the AI robotics. Google's coming out with
[02:38.980 --> 02:39.980]  its own glasses.
[02:39.980 --> 02:44.900]  They're trying to get this takeover in as fast as they can, and it's so criminal. Now
[02:44.900 --> 02:51.420]  it's in the news like, is it good? Your smart TV is watching you? Not, oh my God, it's 1984.
[02:51.420 --> 02:56.980]  It's like, oh, all the crazies were right. But again, I guess we end the interview, George,
[02:56.980 --> 03:00.820]  as we started it. This is crazy. We're at the crossroads.
[03:00.820 --> 03:04.900]  They are panicking, Alex. And part of the problem with this, when we talk about the
[03:04.900 --> 03:11.460]  New World Order, you were in the United Kingdom at the Bilderberg just a few weeks ago. These
[03:11.460 --> 03:17.020]  are groups of people, and people say, who are these people? Well, it's obvious. They're
[03:17.020 --> 03:23.780]  people who have so much wealth. I mean, just today that just revealed a report that 70%
[03:23.780 --> 03:29.100]  of the Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. These people never got paychecks. This is
[03:29.100 --> 03:35.220]  family money handed down over the eons, and they've got so much wealth. I'm talking billions
[03:35.220 --> 03:36.220]  of dollars.
[03:36.220 --> 03:37.220]  They're playing God.
[03:37.220 --> 03:42.620]  They're bored. They're bored. So what they do is they do the next thing. Believe me, if
[03:42.620 --> 03:46.940]  you watch Eyes Wide Shut, the Stanley Kubrick movie, you'll see some of the things that
[03:46.940 --> 03:47.940]  they do.
[03:47.940 --> 03:48.940]  That's what they really do. That's what they do.
[03:48.940 --> 03:54.220]  They're bored. But this is a game for them. This is world domination, and they're having
[03:54.220 --> 03:59.140]  a great time doing it. I'm sure they've got offices to go to, and they sit back, and they
[03:59.140 --> 04:01.580]  go, how can we scheme to do this?
[04:01.580 --> 04:05.860]  Well, they came out of the Bill and Melinda Gates, met with all the world leaders secretly
[04:05.860 --> 04:10.260]  again in the U.S. two weeks before Bilderberg to reduce world population. And then he's
[04:10.260 --> 04:13.300]  the guy going, by the way, I have a shot for you. I want you to die, but I want to reduce
[04:13.300 --> 04:18.460]  population. I mean, it's so incredibly obvious, and we've just got to wake up to it, and that's
[04:18.460 --> 04:19.460]  happening.
[04:19.460 --> 04:21.460]  George, I will see you what, in the first two hours of coast tonight.
[04:21.460 --> 04:24.140]  I'll see you at midnight central time tonight on Coast to Coast.

[08:14.700 --> 08:28.540]  He rode a blazing saddle. He wore a shining star. His job to offer battle. To batman near
[08:28.540 --> 08:38.700]  and far. He conquered fear and he conquered hate. He turned dark night into day. He made
[08:38.700 --> 08:46.020]  his blazing saddle a torch to light the way. And he's here right now. Sheriff Richard Mac.
[08:46.020 --> 08:51.660]  Good friend of mine. Always good to see him in person like a Clark Kent type guy. And
[08:51.660 --> 08:56.500]  he's here with us. He of course took it all the way to the Supreme Court. The Brady Bill
[08:56.500 --> 09:00.660]  being unconstitutional and beat it. One of the biggest Second Amendment victories we've
[09:00.660 --> 09:06.780]  ever had. And he's in the NRA Hall of Fame. Sheriff Mac.com. He's the best selling author.
[09:06.780 --> 09:11.500]  He's making a film right now about getting the sheriffs and local police to wake up and
[09:11.500 --> 09:15.260]  take our counties and cities back. And that is the answer. We're going to get it into
[09:15.260 --> 09:21.740]  all of that at the bottom of the hour. And Paul in Florida and Joseph and David and empty
[09:21.740 --> 09:27.140]  Congress and Mike. We're going to get to all of your calls as well in any issue because
[09:27.140 --> 09:30.860]  he's also been a talk show host off and on his own right. He can speak to those issues.
[09:30.860 --> 09:36.660]  But I want to cover the waterfront with Sheriff Richard Mac because he's gone to Arizona to
[09:36.660 --> 09:40.540]  work with the cold case posse. There's no doubt we don't know who Obama really is. There's
[09:40.540 --> 09:46.140]  no doubt those are fake bar certificates. We just don't know what exactly it means.
[09:46.140 --> 09:50.300]  Very bizarre but he's been working on that. We're going to get his take on that. But first
[09:50.300 --> 09:54.740]  off we've gone from being called kooks talking about NSA spying because it had come out before
[09:54.740 --> 09:59.740]  and kooks about the IRS harassing conservatives libertarians to it all being admitted to it
[09:59.740 --> 10:04.340]  now coming out that indeed they are building FEMA camps. They are training to confiscate
[10:04.340 --> 10:09.620]  guns that they have army manuals on quote reeducation centers using the Soviet term.
[10:09.620 --> 10:14.860]  I mean it even blows me away that they're really this evil and corrupt and trying to
[10:14.860 --> 10:20.420]  just hide it in plain view and get the police and military to go along with all the dramas
[10:20.420 --> 10:25.260]  all the sitcoms all the movies where the gun owners are the terrorist and the patriots
[10:25.260 --> 10:29.660]  are going to kill everybody. I think it's I don't think I know it's back lashing but
[10:29.660 --> 10:34.060]  I want to get your take just in general where you think the state of the country is right
[10:34.060 --> 10:38.620]  now and why the globalist because we're talking about this last hour with George Norrie. Everybody
[10:38.620 --> 10:43.900]  agrees they are accelerating the whole program and I think we're in a danger that if it all
[10:43.900 --> 10:48.220]  comes out in the open and then nobody gets in trouble it just sets the precedent and
[10:48.220 --> 10:54.740]  now we okay we know we're slaves but we're slaves instead of it boomeranging and kind
[10:54.740 --> 10:58.500]  of swinging the pendulum back and then I'm concerned if we start swinging the pendulum
[10:58.500 --> 11:03.620]  back they're going to false flag so Sheriff Mack here to film and do interviews for Obama
[11:03.620 --> 11:07.780]  deception too great to have you here my friend you heard that general breakdown I just laid
[11:07.780 --> 11:12.100]  out what is your state of the union take on that for our viewers.
[11:12.100 --> 11:18.660]  Well it's amazing that a lot of this got put off until after the re-election of Mr. Obama
[11:18.660 --> 11:24.060]  and you're right we don't know who he is we don't know where he's from I'm not positive
[11:24.060 --> 11:31.660]  that he knows sometimes when we get into that there's so much going on and isn't it wonderful
[11:31.660 --> 11:36.580]  though to have the endorsement of the federal government that the things that you've been
[11:36.580 --> 11:41.340]  preaching and talking about for the last 10 to 15 years are now coming to fruition you
[11:41.340 --> 11:46.900]  know they can't call you Cooke anymore because everything you've been saying John Burke Society
[11:46.900 --> 11:53.380]  everything they've laid out 30 40 years ago is starting to fall apart in our own government
[11:53.380 --> 12:02.100]  and starting to happen you know it is absolutely astonishing Alex that that we have so many
[12:02.100 --> 12:09.460]  conspiracies of coming to fruition and be improved I mean especially the IRS like that's
[12:09.460 --> 12:15.740]  a big surprise to anybody I mean come on in 1990 haven't you been harassed by him I never
[12:15.740 --> 12:21.220]  my dad did that's right I remember you told my story my dad got it but this is this was
[12:21.220 --> 12:26.740]  just two or three years after he left the FBI and so what the what the IRS was doing and
[12:26.740 --> 12:31.820]  in fact it was exposed in 1997 by Jennifer Long and a few other whistleblowers of the
[12:31.820 --> 12:38.660]  IRS saying that IRS employees routinely fabricate evidence against citizens who they know cannot
[12:38.660 --> 12:44.740]  afford to defend themselves my father fit into that and so they just go after people
[12:44.740 --> 12:49.300]  who are middle class who they know can't defend themselves and so they thought my father would
[12:49.300 --> 12:53.900]  just pay the money my father cared too much about justice and truth to do that because
[12:53.900 --> 12:59.740]  he knew he was innocent and he didn't have the funds to defend himself but he had a friend
[12:59.740 --> 13:05.420]  a lawyer and a friend a CPA that went to bat for him and after a year and a half of trying
[13:05.420 --> 13:11.020]  to destroy my father my father proved that the IRS had lied then Jennifer Long came
[13:11.020 --> 13:17.500]  along with other IRS agents and there were two agents who refused to testify unless they
[13:17.500 --> 13:22.420]  were done so anonymously and so they were hidden behind a partition and their voices
[13:22.420 --> 13:26.980]  muffled and they were silhouetted behind a partition the only violates constitution
[13:26.980 --> 13:31.100]  sure but the only the only other time that that's ever happened at Congress was when
[13:31.100 --> 13:37.860]  the Casa Nostra whistleblower testified about the mafia so we have the mafia and the IRS
[13:37.860 --> 13:42.660]  kind of a parallel there isn't there plus our country was built without the IRS it wasn't
[13:42.660 --> 13:47.660]  set up till 1913 for the Federal Reserve it didn't become popularly in use till the 50s
[13:47.660 --> 13:52.060]  it has hurt our country and they can abuse whoever they want and people will tell you
[13:52.060 --> 13:56.980]  I'm not going to criticize the government the IRS will come after me every I know so
[13:56.980 --> 14:02.140]  many journalists and people who've been told and they've even taped it where the IRS says
[14:02.140 --> 14:06.940]  stop covering these stories they tell churches stop praying they tell pro-life groups go
[14:06.940 --> 14:12.220]  be pro-abortion and will stop an audit right that's in the news now yeah I mean that's
[14:12.220 --> 14:17.820]  even worse than I thought it was I mean what a criminal organization it is and and so I
[14:17.820 --> 14:22.220]  keep I'm writing right now I'm in the middle of writing the sequel to the county sheriff
[14:22.220 --> 14:27.660]  America's last hope as you said it is the solution and it is it is we can stop what's
[14:27.660 --> 14:33.140]  going on if we have sheriffs local officials and now we're even getting chiefs of police
[14:33.140 --> 14:37.940]  we had we have chiefs of police on our board of directors and we're getting peace officers
[14:37.940 --> 14:42.340]  and deputies we have deputies standing up now deputy Lenick who you know because you
[14:42.340 --> 14:48.620]  put him out there on info wars to Stan Lenick from the Albany airport when he refused to
[14:48.620 --> 14:53.060]  arrest the people handing out the flyers well he was our deputy sheriff of the year and
[14:53.060 --> 14:57.540]  so we had deputy Lenick at our convention these are the types of people oh she got to
[14:57.540 --> 15:02.380]  know him oh yeah he's a great guy good good man now his wife just had a premature baby
[15:02.380 --> 15:06.820]  so he came in and left he didn't stay for the whole thing but he had to get back to
[15:06.820 --> 15:10.980]  babysit and what a great guy I mean will you give us his contact we'd like to get him
[15:10.980 --> 15:17.780]  on absolutely you're talking about one of the most exemplary deputies in American history
[15:17.780 --> 15:23.940]  here with his deputy Stan Lenick and so who was our sheriff of the year ah David A. Clark
[15:23.940 --> 15:30.820]  Jr. from Milwaukee and so who was calling us racist and everything in fact even after
[15:30.820 --> 15:37.900]  we've named sheriff Clark our deputy our sheriff of the year our CSBO a sheriff of the year
[15:37.900 --> 15:41.500]  they tried to call local newspaper they're trying to call us racist well they do that
[15:41.500 --> 15:45.420]  show that people will Google it and then see that and not be part of it because they're
[15:45.420 --> 15:49.100]  desperate like oh you don't want government-run healthcare you're a racist you don't want world
[15:49.100 --> 15:52.300]  government you're a racist don't want to turn your guns in you're a racist they just use
[15:52.300 --> 15:57.420]  that on everything sheriff Clark responded he said I'm the only black sheriff in Wisconsin
[15:57.420 --> 16:01.620]  I'm the only one in Wisconsin in the entire country that was named sheriff of the year
[16:01.620 --> 16:06.780]  by the CSBO a he says it's a little bit ridiculous to go after them for being racist you know
[16:06.780 --> 16:10.740]  and I want to tell SPLC and I've told him before I've told Mark Botak he and I've talked
[16:10.740 --> 16:16.700]  a lot and and did you see his quote about me not not recently he said Alex Jones doesn't
[16:16.700 --> 16:24.500]  build bombs he builds bombers in Bloomberg oh wow so go ahead wow that's that's power
[16:24.500 --> 16:30.700]  things going with you in the SPLC right now well the lawsuit got thrown out and I guess
[16:30.700 --> 16:36.020]  you know it was a technicality and I didn't agree with it and after they threw it out
[16:36.020 --> 16:41.100]  I I bagged it so they still are going after me and they've lied about me a little bit
[16:41.100 --> 16:46.500]  but not nearly as much as why did you originally so because they had lied and put it out all
[16:46.500 --> 16:51.540]  over the country that I said let's kill federal agents and you know that my message has always
[16:51.540 --> 16:58.500]  been one of peace oh my mine is too and I mean they said that I influenced in Bloomberg
[16:58.500 --> 17:04.100]  with no evidence that I made the bombers do it basically oh brother yeah with no proof
[17:04.100 --> 17:08.500]  and then they have the SPLC going yeah he builds bombers and there's no doubt I could
[17:08.500 --> 17:12.980]  beat him on that I mean the ADL's lost lawsuits for stuff like that because I just don't have
[17:12.980 --> 17:17.580]  time to mess with it and I mean you know that was me too and I it's almost a full-time job
[17:17.580 --> 17:22.500]  to sue somebody like that it is it's a full-time job I and when I did the Clinton administration
[17:22.500 --> 17:28.260]  as you mentioned to you beat him I beat their butts and all the way back to Washington miraculous
[17:28.260 --> 17:32.540]  case just absolutely miraculous case but it was a David and Goliath story and I love being
[17:32.540 --> 17:37.980]  David and we're still creating David's all across the country to stop all these horrible
[17:37.980 --> 17:41.420]  things exactly I mean those of us that are working full-time just to wake people up folks
[17:41.420 --> 17:44.900]  we need you to be the ones that some and stuff yeah I mean we just had a lady in who started
[17:44.900 --> 17:50.180]  the lawsuit wanted at the Supreme Court over the gene patents Austinite listener yeah took
[17:50.180 --> 17:54.660]  her two years she did it yeah and so folks you need to when you're in the right go after
[17:54.660 --> 17:59.100]  these people and again but the SPLC they discredit themselves well of course everybody knows
[17:59.100 --> 18:04.140]  that I'm not influencing Muslim bombers and that I'm the opposite of that I mean that
[18:04.140 --> 18:09.460]  is insane well they are insane and what's really insane is our own government now why
[18:09.460 --> 18:15.980]  doesn't the SPLC come out and assail the IRS and assail the NSA and all these horrible
[18:15.980 --> 18:20.180]  other things they call themselves a civil rights group yeah so why don't they go after
[18:20.180 --> 18:25.380]  the government they never go after the government and the reason is is because that's where they
[18:25.380 --> 18:29.500]  get a lot of their funding they teach all these classes and get a lot of funding from
[18:29.500 --> 18:33.500]  the from the federal government so they're never going to go after them and and that
[18:33.500 --> 18:38.620]  discredits them on their own they are their own discredit and the Southern probably law
[18:38.620 --> 18:43.980]  center is a joke and probably not even worthy to be on your show quite honestly well they
[18:43.980 --> 18:48.700]  are becoming more and more of a joke but they're also very serious players you know they are
[18:48.700 --> 18:54.020]  they ran with their top informants ran the only him city compound that McVeigh was it
[18:54.020 --> 18:59.020]  and then and then how tried to expose that the ATF informant and got shut down and they're
[18:59.020 --> 19:05.160]  there they're there one of the informants came to the event in Valley Forge where we
[19:05.160 --> 19:10.660]  spoke about two years ago and a lot of us were there Larry Pratt and a lot of big speakers
[19:10.660 --> 19:16.100]  and that's when they supposedly got me and then they tried to call me a little bit after
[19:16.100 --> 19:20.780]  that and do an interview and I said you guys have been lying about me for 17 years and
[19:20.780 --> 19:25.300]  now you try to call me and ask me for my comment you've been lying about me for 17 years why
[19:25.300 --> 19:29.100]  would you come down and ask me for a comment you've never asked me for a comment before
[19:29.100 --> 19:32.940]  this is where we lied about you and I said well since the beginning since I first filed
[19:32.940 --> 19:37.780]  my lawsuit but most recently when you said I said we should kill IRS agents they checked
[19:37.780 --> 19:42.940]  their own tape and said no we we made a mistake we'll have to do a retraction so they did
[19:42.940 --> 19:47.580]  a retraction well at least you did that it's just unbelievable that's not a mistake of
[19:47.580 --> 19:51.820]  course not it wasn't even close I made the ADL change something one time it was just
[19:51.820 --> 19:56.660]  totally made up and I had had my lawyer get in touch with them to make them do it it's

[24:41.980 --> 24:47.460]  got the light side the dark side in the past talking to really top historians and researchers
[24:47.460 --> 24:52.220]  maybe ten percent of federal agencies were dark side. Joel Scalzano I respect estimates
[24:52.220 --> 24:59.420]  it's more like fifty percent now is dark side. What does your dad say to you about that?
[24:59.420 --> 25:03.460]  Why would the IRS come after him when he retired? I know they harass people they think are actually
[25:03.460 --> 25:09.980]  good people. What would your dad think today about what's happening with just all this
[25:09.980 --> 25:16.300]  open evil? Well my dad would be shocked with all of this but he would also say yeah that's
[25:16.300 --> 25:21.340]  what they did to me and my dad learned a lot about the subterfuge of government when they
[25:21.340 --> 25:27.140]  audited him. He thought that everything in government was pretty on the up and up. He
[25:27.140 --> 25:31.620]  served you know thirty years in the FBI served another five years in the Army Air Corps during
[25:31.620 --> 25:37.580]  World War II. He believed in government he believed in what they were doing he even believed
[25:37.580 --> 25:43.660]  at one point until he and I had some extensive conversations in the Warren Commission report.
[25:43.660 --> 25:48.100]  You know why did they go after your dad? But he made some enemies while he was in the Bureau
[25:48.100 --> 25:52.020]  and I guess that's why they went after him because this is very rare. Well we had the
[25:52.020 --> 25:56.140]  son of a state police officer who called in earlier and said he was told to go after
[25:56.140 --> 26:00.020]  conservatives libertarians and that's come out in Texas they've been told to act like
[26:00.020 --> 26:04.780]  we're doing something and it's really because we're the good guys and the bad guys know
[26:04.780 --> 26:10.620]  it. Yeah well my dad my dad wasn't a real constitutionist or anything like that he was
[26:10.620 --> 26:17.540]  a real solid honest man but I think also the other thing that might have been is they just
[26:17.540 --> 26:21.820]  started looking in the computer for people who fit the profile that the IRS wanted to
[26:21.820 --> 26:26.900]  go after and they didn't see that he was a former FBI agent and they just went after
[26:26.900 --> 26:31.220]  him because it's funny you say that my dad said please don't talk about this but I just
[26:31.220 --> 26:36.220]  don't care I will talk about it. He fit the profile and later he learned they went after
[26:36.220 --> 26:38.940]  middle class people that were known as being nice guys they thought they could push around
[26:38.940 --> 26:43.700]  exactly and they told him in Dallas in the mid eighties they said we are criminals Mr.
[26:43.700 --> 26:48.900]  Jones they said we are criminals we will take everything you've got unless you pay us this
[26:48.900 --> 26:54.860]  right and he was like you're they said we are criminals I mean imagine and my dad was
[26:54.860 --> 27:00.180]  like Mr. mom and apple pie is like you're criminals. I thought you worked for the federal
[27:00.180 --> 27:04.740]  government I thought you're here I thought you were a service organization IRS but they
[27:04.740 --> 27:09.420]  said we are criminals he brought in his receipts and everything and the CPA stuff and they
[27:09.420 --> 27:15.260]  said don't care they said hey pal we're criminals they were like hey you know well so they told
[27:15.260 --> 27:20.140]  my father is almost the same thing they didn't say criminal but they said we will ruin you
[27:20.140 --> 27:24.540]  unless you pay you know it's just no they said that they said we are criminals you will
[27:24.540 --> 27:30.020]  lose yeah yeah of course and it's an extortion racket and that's all this is and that's those
[27:30.020 --> 27:35.900]  of us who still pay the extortion to stay out of prison you know we're the cowards
[27:35.900 --> 27:41.100]  I admit but even when you pay them they come that was that retroactive tax act in the 80s
[27:41.100 --> 27:44.220]  yeah and they came to him and said pay he said that's more money than I have if I sold
[27:44.220 --> 27:48.740]  my house we went from we basically had to sell our cars everything and he even fought
[27:48.740 --> 27:52.860]  them for a couple years but it didn't matter then they just got interest and we basically
[27:52.860 --> 27:57.940]  took everything my dad had well I mean that this country is pathetic one my dad pulled
[27:57.940 --> 28:04.340]  one other car card out or he probably would have ended up like your dad and he had a congressman
[28:04.340 --> 28:11.580]  that he used to work in the FBI with Eldon Rudd from Arizona I think that the final straw
[28:11.580 --> 28:17.340]  to help my father was Eldon Rudd getting involved in it and if he hadn't I think my father would
[28:17.340 --> 28:21.700]  have ended up paying and we would have lost everything they because my dad didn't have
[28:21.700 --> 28:28.500]  the money my dad to get more money in the FBI you have to you have to move you to get
[28:28.500 --> 28:32.780]  promoted you have to move my dad never wanted to move he wanted us to be raised in southern
[28:32.780 --> 28:39.900]  Arizona and in the same community where he was the FBI for 25 years I became the sheriff
[28:39.900 --> 28:44.900]  and I'm really great did he live to see that yes oh yes but he liked that yeah he did and
[28:44.900 --> 28:50.260]  was he proud of your Supreme Court when he was he was very amazed by it as well he died
[28:50.260 --> 28:55.900]  six years ago so he he followed all of that very strictly he didn't know or understand
[28:55.900 --> 29:00.580]  all of my motives behind it but he knew and understood me and he knew that what I was
[29:00.580 --> 29:04.540]  doing was the right thing he didn't like Clinton of course you know anybody that was honest
[29:04.540 --> 29:09.540]  wouldn't but yeah but you know it was just a miraculous time my mother passed away just
[29:09.540 --> 29:13.860]  two years ago and you know she was kind of pro government too but every time I would
[29:13.860 --> 29:18.100]  talk to her about okay what are we really doing here why are we supporting government
[29:18.100 --> 29:22.020]  blindly I said do you remember what they did to my father remember what they did to dad
[29:22.020 --> 29:26.980]  and she goes oh yeah and I said mom but again that shows how old timers were so honest and
[29:26.980 --> 29:32.940]  so good exactly that even though they the government had wrongly come after you and tried to ruin
[29:32.940 --> 29:38.900]  your life she would still it's just unbelievable I mean and that's why they do the crimes they
[29:38.900 --> 29:44.180]  really are engaged in right the white slavery the drug dealing I mean if the naive people
[29:44.180 --> 29:48.860]  who are well-meaning knew the truth it's just it's unbelievable we'll be right back with

[37:29.940 --> 37:34.580]  that book absolutely america's last hope you need to know what he's supposed to know he
[37:34.580 --> 37:40.860]  works for you so everyone in america should get that book absolutely and learn about common
[37:40.860 --> 37:45.620]  law bill of rights constitution right they're breaking the law when they do this snowden
[37:45.620 --> 37:50.420]  shouldn't go to jail the people that ordered them to illegally spy should go to jail absolutely
[37:50.420 --> 37:55.540]  absolutely in fact of all the whistleblowers of they usually just fire them or send them
[37:55.540 --> 38:00.820]  to jail and that's what they're trying to do to snowden now worldwide publicly and
[38:00.820 --> 38:07.020]  so it's it's an amazing process but i i believe there's been too much light shed on what has
[38:07.020 --> 38:11.780]  happened that snowden is being protected a little bit just because of all the light that's
[38:11.780 --> 38:18.340]  been shine on him and so i i i think it's a just an amazing process again of showing
[38:18.340 --> 38:22.060]  the corruption of washington dc by the way to correct something i remember now when
[38:22.060 --> 38:26.700]  my dad said when he came home and i've heard the story 30 times after the head irs lady
[38:26.700 --> 38:31.460]  had a meeting with and dallas she looked at him and she said we are white collar criminals
[38:31.460 --> 38:35.420]  you will not beat us oh i mean that's like the mafia coming in your store going where
[38:35.420 --> 38:39.500]  the where the mafia you will pay us and we'll burn this down correct i mean that's that's
[38:39.500 --> 38:45.820]  what they are you know that comparisons been actually taking place in a lot of mainstream
[38:45.820 --> 38:52.300]  books there's a book called the sovereign individual written and actually printed published
[38:52.300 --> 38:59.060]  by simon and shuster back about 12 13 years ago the sovereign individual talks about the
[38:59.060 --> 39:05.140]  vents foster murder being the most the poorly disguised murder in american history and these
[39:05.140 --> 39:11.700]  guys go right after and they compare the irs to the mafia they use the same tactics they
[39:11.700 --> 39:18.460]  for the same results and this is just a mainstream book talking about finances and it was done
[39:18.460 --> 39:25.140]  by a couple of world renowned financiers and it was not it was not a book by chef mac
[39:25.140 --> 39:31.300]  or alex jones or any of these other radical extremists it was done by two world renowned
[39:31.300 --> 39:39.260]  of economists and again the sovereign individual and i read it and i was amazed by what they
[39:39.260 --> 39:44.380]  exposed in there especially about hillary clinton who's you know i remember my dad you
[39:44.380 --> 39:49.500]  know who was like mainline going around given anti-communist speeches in texas and go on
[39:49.500 --> 39:54.820]  the dallas radio when he was like 15 years old and man in america your dad did that
[39:54.820 --> 40:00.300]  oh yeah really yeah and and and the point is it and then he stopped doing it once he
[40:00.300 --> 40:03.860]  went to college and got married and had me and stuff and then my sister later the point
[40:03.860 --> 40:08.700]  was he got married had kids and kind of moved on but it was he bought into the whole thing
[40:08.700 --> 40:13.300]  that america is the good guys and the point is that was the perfect cover for criminals
[40:13.300 --> 40:18.140]  to come in and take over the government here's another person i want to interview mark majetti
[40:18.140 --> 40:24.060]  a Pulitzer prize winner the way of the knife the cia a secret army and the war at the ends
[40:24.060 --> 40:27.980]  of the earth admitting that they're just killing people all over the world with assassination
[40:27.980 --> 40:33.660]  teams illegally including here in america and then you have uh michael hastings saying
[40:33.660 --> 40:37.620]  i've got big breaking news i'm going off the radar into hiding they're they're coming and
[40:37.620 --> 40:40.820]  visiting my family and friends he said there are and then the fbi lied and said no we're
[40:40.820 --> 40:45.700]  not and then his car an hour and 45 minutes later blows up witnesses said it was driving
[40:45.700 --> 40:49.380]  on the road and blew up it's up against the tree didn't run into the tree and see it came
[40:49.380 --> 40:54.180]  to the rest against the tree the engine's blown almost 60 yards down the road and they
[40:54.180 --> 41:00.820]  say day one don't investigate alex jones is a coke it's natural causes what do you make
[41:00.820 --> 41:08.220]  of things like that when uh uh erin swartz is exposing the uh scams in the nsa and the
[41:08.220 --> 41:11.980]  spying and he's a leader and had a lot of money because he started reddit and then he
[41:11.980 --> 41:15.820]  says i'm going to fight the fbi and the feds coming after me i'm going to fight the justice
[41:15.820 --> 41:20.140]  department saying i've committed you know crimes releasing info and i'm getting married and
[41:20.140 --> 41:25.220]  then they come and he's hung and they immediately say we hung himself yeah i mean i think there's
[41:25.220 --> 41:29.620]  death squads another one of those accidental hangings you know but uh like the dc madam
[41:29.620 --> 41:33.140]  i mean what do you make of this because it's definitely they're killing a lot of people
[41:33.140 --> 41:37.260]  i mean this is gary web got shot twice in the head well that's why i'd like you know
[41:37.260 --> 41:43.860]  to take you back to the vince foster uh assassination you know um i i would really like you to have
[41:43.860 --> 41:47.980]  uh mike zulu on you haven't had him on right the detective cold case posse detective uh
[41:47.980 --> 41:51.740]  no i want to get him on yeah like let's ride all this down let's get i can help you line
[41:51.740 --> 41:57.220]  that up too um but he spoke at our uh csp away convention i want people to remember
[41:57.220 --> 42:04.540]  that csp away uh season charlie s is in sam p is in paul o is an oscar a is an adam csp
[42:04.540 --> 42:11.260]  away this constitutional sheriffs peace officers association how evil oh i know you swear to
[42:11.260 --> 42:17.620]  it now you're going to follow it oh my goodness that's a dirty idea yeah but uh mike zulu
[42:17.620 --> 42:24.540]  uh presented his evidence to us all there and uh we just said look uh this is not a required
[42:24.540 --> 42:29.140]  seminar to attend his class just go and see if you don't want to go if you're afraid of
[42:29.140 --> 42:33.940]  this don't go well it was the biggest attended class we had and that was saturday after the
[42:33.940 --> 42:40.660]  big day on friday so uh i am working on that we're trying to get this exposed back before
[42:40.660 --> 42:47.020]  the investigation started the truth is the same people who asked sheriff arpaio to investigate
[42:47.020 --> 42:51.540]  this came to me first and i was living in frederickburg as you'll recall at that time
[42:51.540 --> 42:55.580]  and this is just a year and a half ago and i told him i didn't have time to do it and
[42:55.580 --> 42:59.180]  i'd have to drop everything and i'd have to charge him and they go well well who would
[42:59.180 --> 43:02.740]  do this for free and we're thinking about asking arpaio and say he won't do it i said
[43:02.740 --> 43:06.420]  he won't get involved in this i've talked to him about this issue before he thinks it's
[43:06.420 --> 43:11.580]  a bogus issue but when he had 150 200 people from the tea party local tea party came and
[43:11.580 --> 43:16.060]  they showed him some evidence that they really distressed it about the uh and then notice
[43:16.060 --> 43:21.140]  how obama came after him oh i know because that is a fake birth certificate oh and totally
[43:21.140 --> 43:25.700]  first they said they released it when they hadn't they released a receipt of wine right
[43:25.700 --> 43:29.220]  that you go and print out as a computer like i gotta get them for my kids and you go and
[43:29.220 --> 43:33.460]  they print out a receipt the bureau of physics says here's your receipt from the health department
[43:33.460 --> 43:38.780]  well well you've been working on it tell people what we know well the the thing that is the
[43:38.780 --> 43:43.540]  one really working it is mike zulu and he's a former detective and he's uh working for
[43:43.540 --> 43:50.220]  free for sheriff arpaio on his cold case posse and so arpaio told his uh people and told
[43:50.220 --> 43:54.180]  me at the time he said look these people asked me i said i know i said i'm surprised you
[43:54.180 --> 43:58.060]  took it because i told him you wouldn't he said no he says well he says just to get him
[43:58.060 --> 44:02.460]  off my back i told him i'd investigate it but i'm sure i'm just going to clear the president
[44:02.460 --> 44:06.060]  and everything's going to be fine well the investigator did a thorough investigation
[44:06.060 --> 44:11.660]  in it turned out to be just the opposite that's when i bought onto it because i knew arpaio
[44:11.660 --> 44:17.340]  was an honest man and that he would do this thoroughly and professionally and uh zulu
[44:17.340 --> 44:23.140]  has done a marvelous investigation he's taken the uh birth certificate apart now he's why
[44:23.140 --> 44:28.020]  would they put out such a bad fake though well you know i think they used a computer
[44:28.020 --> 44:34.940]  specialist that is young okay and didn't know uh type setting off because here's how i knew
[44:34.940 --> 44:42.100]  it was fake day one they use the fake uh uh system that comes in the fonts in the right
[44:42.100 --> 44:46.180]  to typing font back in those yeah yeah it's meant to look at job exactly it's meant to
[44:46.180 --> 44:51.140]  look like typing but it's the computer font because the letters are identical and the
[44:51.140 --> 44:56.100]  splats from a real typewriter are like snowflakes or fingerprints right i mean it's horribly
[44:56.100 --> 45:02.260]  fake and zulu takes it he takes it nine layers he takes the whole thing and it was layered
[45:02.260 --> 45:08.100]  nine times and he takes it and shows you the mistake of all nine layers now but why did
[45:08.100 --> 45:12.900]  they do something so fake we found it day one well when when you look at it at his face
[45:12.900 --> 45:18.660]  if you just went in and showed it to obama he'll look at it and go oh my gosh this is great
[45:18.660 --> 45:23.780]  this looks good you just have to start peeling off the layers and then you get an entire different
[45:23.780 --> 45:30.580]  view so whoever it was it was a young computer tech and they thought you know no one went back
[45:30.580 --> 45:35.460]  to it and did peeled off the layers they said oh that'll work so they didn't do their homework
[45:35.460 --> 45:40.180]  and they just had to get something out and they would run and then even left it in layers yes
[45:40.180 --> 45:46.580]  yeah this crazy it was not a good job at all uh so you have to kind of wonder who proofread
[45:46.580 --> 45:51.620]  that forum but uh obama needed to release something and he did and they just rushed it
[45:51.620 --> 45:57.460]  and and so what what we don't say and what you need to remember on all of this investigation
[45:57.460 --> 46:03.060]  all of your listeners need to remember this we are not and this investigation is not saying
[46:03.060 --> 46:08.980]  where mr obama was born we're saying that the birth certificate the white house released
[46:08.980 --> 46:14.020]  is a fraud a fake and a lie have you seen dreams my real father we sell it oh i mean that's that's
[46:14.020 --> 46:18.420]  his mom and that's that house and that's the photos confirmed i don't think that's what it is yeah
[46:18.420 --> 46:22.820]  yeah so no wonder the kenya thing that's why his watch said it in speeches and why it was in
[46:22.820 --> 46:28.180]  the harvard deal that was the diversion yeah the truth was he had a different name different dad
[46:28.900 --> 46:33.060]  famous communist i mean oh man and and you know obama would spend the summers with him
[46:33.060 --> 46:39.460]  and he used a communist pornographer yeah now you know he used his dad's name Barry Sotero
[46:39.460 --> 46:45.140]  yeah i mean that's obama's name that he used to go to college and so it's amazing that that still
[46:45.140 --> 46:50.180]  even the mainstream press even people like chris matthews who give this guy a free ride
[46:50.180 --> 46:56.980]  and yet we know he used an alias the only president ever to use an aka well he had at least two other
[46:56.980 --> 47:02.980]  ones yeah i mean i mean this guy who do you think he really is because i mean this this guy looks
[47:02.980 --> 47:08.180]  like a manchurian candidate i think he was raised up for this you know i think he was groomed by
[47:08.180 --> 47:13.220]  somebody and uh you know when you look at uh well no kidding he was surrounded by top communist
[47:13.220 --> 47:18.820]  davis yeah wasn't it davis but then you got the weatherman as soon as he gets to i mean it's just
[47:18.820 --> 47:24.740]  i mean if you look at the people he was around then you have to know this was no accident
[47:24.740 --> 47:30.580]  this was all planned there's no coincidences in this government there's no accidents this was
[47:30.580 --> 47:36.740]  this was all devised and planned and here he is doing what he was told doing what he was raised
[47:36.740 --> 47:42.820]  to do destroy america and boy they are i mean this obama care written to rip everybody off and
[47:42.820 --> 47:47.540]  make everybody go to part time and it's meant to hammer the poor and then they say it's for the poor
[47:47.540 --> 47:51.540]  and then and this immigration thing all this free stuff for unlimited millions for the poor it's to
[47:51.540 --> 47:58.900]  make us all poor yeah it's it's to increase the poor and yeah uh you know right now we're having
[47:58.900 --> 48:04.820]  so much of this happen that so many sheriffs and local officials are waking up to the solution
[48:04.820 --> 48:10.340]  and i am so proud and that's nullification sheriff nullification state nullification
[48:10.340 --> 48:14.660]  because they can't go after all the sheriffs i mean if they can have 800 plus cities that are
[48:14.660 --> 48:19.060]  sanctuary where the illegals are above the law why couldn't we have 800 cities where we ignore
[48:19.060 --> 48:23.140]  unconstitutional federal stuff i mean they're ignoring the law with the illegals and breaking
[48:23.140 --> 48:28.500]  the law how about we ignore unconstitutional stuff absolutely it should be done that way
[48:30.180 --> 48:36.100]  my lawsuit was an amazing miracle but i do not recommend that sheriffs or local officials sue
[48:36.100 --> 48:42.180]  anymore we tell them no we wreck the barriers that's the name of our new dvd set from our convention
[48:42.180 --> 48:47.620]  erecting the barriers that actually is a warning that came to us from james madison we can safely
[48:47.620 --> 48:52.180]  rely on local officials to erect the barriers against the encroachments of the federal government
[48:52.180 --> 48:57.460]  that's what he uh espoused and that's what we espouse well that's why there's three branches
[48:57.460 --> 49:01.060]  federally and then you've got multiple branches locally because you don't want every one group
[49:01.060 --> 49:04.420]  there was saying get rid of gridlock let the government do whatever it wants that's called

[49:18.500 --> 49:23.940]  fact that now it's admitted the government runs the main al qaeda well you know i haven't uh seen
[49:23.940 --> 49:28.740]  the uh entire evidence on that i haven't seen the well it's on record that they're using al qaeda in
[49:28.740 --> 49:35.620]  syria well we do know that there's 35 uh terrorist al qaeda camps here in america at least 35 that the
[49:35.620 --> 49:39.780]  government has documented so there's probably more but they're there and why doesn't if the
[49:39.780 --> 49:43.380]  government's going after terrorists and why don't they go after these well it's the same thing in
[49:43.380 --> 49:48.100]  england they have radical guys on tv saying kill everybody take over they leave them on tv and it's
[49:48.100 --> 49:53.860]  the same thing here they've got those guys over here i'm telling you it's on record that now it's
[49:53.860 --> 50:01.220]  come out that they're running these guys 35 well how could 35 terrorist camps exist in america

[54:20.580 --> 54:28.740]  on tv here is from the 1980s a gi joe cobra this armored vehicle and if you notice that's how the
[54:28.740 --> 54:34.500]  police dress now is like a cobra trooper that's how terrorists dressed in the 80s and this is how
[54:34.500 --> 54:39.780]  the armored vehicles that were in boston that everybody saw that's exactly how they look so
[54:39.780 --> 54:45.540]  we'll we'll roll some of that footage over that and you see in all the movies this image of martial
[54:45.540 --> 54:50.580]  law sheriff mech they're really trying to pump us for that aren't they it's amazing how much is
[54:50.580 --> 54:57.620]  being exposed by hollywood in the movies that they're putting out lately it's really amazing stuff
[54:57.620 --> 55:04.100]  just like this and uh enemy of the state i mean i was done about 10 years ago but a lot of exposure
[55:04.100 --> 55:10.660]  from hollywood which i don't understand what did you make uh of the boston bombing and then taking
[55:10.660 --> 55:15.300]  half the city and locking it down and aiming guns at people that didn't even meet the description
[55:15.300 --> 55:20.260]  or dorner the black guy they're looking for and they shoot up white women and hispanic women and
[55:20.260 --> 55:24.500]  cars that don't even match it i mean what type of mentality is that well i think the whole thing is
[55:24.500 --> 55:30.260]  just that the conditioning of our own psyche for the american citizen to be expecting more of that
[55:30.260 --> 55:36.100]  be ready for more of that going in people's homes uh no knock you know no warrants no nothing just
[55:36.100 --> 55:41.460]  going in drying down on everybody checking their homes without the owner's permission and it's all
[55:41.460 --> 55:48.100]  about the officer's safety the the danger to the officers is going into a tyranny they're not giving
[55:48.100 --> 55:53.620]  you all this unconstitutional power for no reason they're going to gut the country and the police
[55:53.620 --> 55:58.820]  academies teach that i'm afraid you go home at night the most important thing is you go home
[55:58.820 --> 56:03.060]  at night there's a lot more important things than you go and home at night and that is one keeping

[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:21.380]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:29.620]  well edward snowton tells the press in an online press conference that the truth is coming out
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:35.300]  and the government can't stop by murdering me but he goes on to say they want to murder him
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:40.900]  the chinese government's come out and said he's not working for them and said it's ridiculous
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:45.380]  that dick cheney said that if anybody's working for the communist chinese is dick cheney and the
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:51.060]  bushes and all them opening up china and selling us out to him bill clinton all of them is ridiculous
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:55.540]  give up your rights to the military industrial complex the chinese communist will get us the
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:03.940]  globalists put them in power kicked out shane kaishik unbelievable that's just a sum of what is
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:10.420]  coming up on that front we're going to be joined as well by max keiser he's got a new article out
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:17.140]  that's just went up on info wars dot com the collapse of the current bankster regime is upon us
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:24.260]  is his headline and he wrote this article for info wars dot com so we've we've got that article
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:30.260]  up there right now he will be joining us he said you'd see a dollar plunge in a worldwide
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:35.540]  stock market plunge starting at the end of april early may and he'll tell you that he's a month
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.860]  and a half off that's what he was saying a week and a half ago i still wasn't convinced completely
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:46.420]  but more and more i hope he's wrong even though it's a fiat system we're riding on top of it
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:53.220]  and uh it's just that the the the the federal reserve hinting at at ending qe
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:04.100]  four or qe unlimited or qe infinity which is just free money to them that they loan out to us at
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:11.140]  10 20 30 percent just just hinting at that to show how kept we are how how controlled we are
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:16.260]  by these foreign offshore banks has sent the stock market the last few weeks as you know going
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:22.820]  downward so we're going to be looking at that with max keiser here in the next segment first
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:32.900]  i'll get into the latest nsa news as well and again i got into the fact just to illustrate who
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:38.740]  the globalist are they knew blowing up nerve gas caches would maim and kill many of our troops
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:43.300]  and debilitate them that's now admitted the new york times just shows you who these people are
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:49.140]  california allows them to a thousand times glyphosate that they know uh a thousand times lesser
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.660]  massively increases breast cancer venezuela considers banning baby bottle feeding and because
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.620]  it makes the brain smaller the IQ is lower and the children unhealthy yeah it's just it's all done
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:05.140]  by the eugenicist to have the working class basically brain damage the children i mean it's
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:10.740]  all and they've known this for 50 60 years of course they've known it how many controversies
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.060]  that they had where babies guys will you print me an article on this because it sounds insane
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:22.260]  just type in baby formula baby deaths you'll see stuff in china and india and africa where the
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:28.580]  globalists really sell the bad stuff where where the babies just die here they know that'd be a
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:33.940]  little too obvious so they just you know get ready to have um one of people getting you know
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:39.700]  diabetes when they're five well you're getting you know 75 high fructose corn syrup and sugar
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:45.300]  in the average baby formula me of course your pancreas is dead on arrival but what's wrong
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:50.420]  with having your arms and legs sawed off i mean i got a buddy right now has got diabetes might have
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:56.020]  to get his toe chopped off what's wrong with that that's loving and liberal it's trendy i mean what's
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:01.220]  wrong with bear putting hiv in the shots for hemophiliacs it's loving it's trendy of course i'm
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.340]  being sickeningly sarcastic this stuff gets to me and that's what i'm talking about that's what
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.980]  i'm exposing that's what i'm angry about so i'm recapping that for people that joined us but
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:15.540]  i've got about 15 stacks of news here i've not yet gotten to and we're going to go over it all
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:22.420]  with max keiser on the other side of this quick break but first uh is is this his prediction a
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:27.860]  month and a half uh late coming true another article by paul joseph watson that just went up
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.820]  did israel attack syria again strike on advanced weapons shipment threatens huge escalation of
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.860]  conflict the saudi arabians are announcing they're going to ship missiles to al qaeda
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:47.700]  unbelievable and when al qaeda blows up us airliners with these missiles will they invade
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:55.300]  uh a country not involved again like iraq probably probably because there's a war against reality

[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:41.700]  day of june 2013 we're going to be joined by market analysts and journalists max keiser here in a
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:49.380]  moment to talk about the world's economic condition he is at the beginning of a crash that max has
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:55.780]  been predicting for about a year that he thought would start in late april or early may was he late
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:02.660]  predicting it his article on info wars dot com the collapse of the current bankster regime is upon us
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:08.580]  well they've been collapsing it by design but too big to fail so i mean it's we're going to talk to
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:15.700]  max here in a moment first off snowden gave a two hour online press conference to the media
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:20.340]  business insider linked up on drudge report dot com we'll get it posted on info wars dot com as well
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:26.980]  the truth is coming and the government can't stop it by murdering me and he went on to say a lot more
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:33.620]  is coming out and that he thinks they're going to try to kill him well yeah it came out in the news
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:38.740]  the daily mail was at dullis airport and heard a bunch of government cia spooks talking about how
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.140]  they want to kill him and how they're going to kill him uh yeah it's a mafia folks of foreign
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:47.860]  banks that run the intelligence agencies and the big secret about the nsa is not a secret at all
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:54.820]  thousands of major companies have partial access the fortune 100 have total access and they make the
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:10:00.580]  money off of spying on everything and swapping the data and then they use it to corner the market
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:05.940]  and what did bloomberg report on friday what max keiser and i've told you for a long time
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:11.780]  the stock market is totally rigged these companies are rigged but only the big top insiders are
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:21.380]  allowed to have offshore bank accounts and uh deals offshore uh with corporations and trust
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:26.340]  and tax shelters where they pay no taxes general electric google berkshire hathaway
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:33.460]  only the insiders are allowed to use the inside info so it's a globally
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.100]  gamed system and it's not enough for the bankers to have unlimited fiat currency for themselves
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.980]  and to be able to create endless derivatives they've expanded derivatives market the last few years
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.900]  it's not enough to have us then tied to their debt
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:53.140]  then they have all the inside data on everything if a company's coming out with something that's
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:57.220]  going to block them not part of the insiders they try to buy it for pennies on the dollar if they
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:02.020]  won't sell boom the irs and regulators are turned loose on them if that doesn't work they just kill
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:12.820]  you industrial espionage they call it a disruptive technology warehouses of incredible energy devices
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:19.220]  warehouses of incredible medical treatments that are then only given to the establishment
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:26.340]  and that's what a major russian tycoon is in the news talking about today
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.420]  but they know you're going to want to have access to all this that's why they're putting
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:38.660]  the police state grid in place look at this gch cube intercepted foreign politicians
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.260]  communications at g20 summits oh really and again the idea is that america and england
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:50.340]  were spying for our countries we're run by big mega banks who own subsidiaries in all these countries
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:56.900]  they use it to make sure they get their outcome do you understand that they're deindustrializing us
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.900]  here's another one the next nsa spying shoot a drop pre-crime artificial intelligence that's
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:07.620]  up on info wars dot com yeah where they say you're guilty when you're not really guilty
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:13.700]  they can also then not just predict the future with these systems they can then program the future
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:20.020]  documents uncovered by snowed and show british eavesdropping by gchq
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:24.740]  again repeatedly hacking and diplomats phones emails report
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:32.260]  g20 summit nsa targeted russian president midyadyev in london folks when i was inside a
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:41.300]  bilterberg meeting after they'd already closed it down in 2008 every major room conference room
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:46.900]  was jammed full of spy equipment with people openly going i got a navy satellite i got an
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:52.900]  air force satellite it's a gm seven cube overlay i told you and there was like people talking in
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:13:00.260]  french and german and israeli and each room was allowed to spy on the other i mean it's an incredibly
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:09.140]  important summit continuing dick cheney suggestions snowed in the chinese spy is sheer nonsense say
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:15.380]  the chinese i mean anybody's a shiny spy it's cheney and the globalist edward snowden again
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:21.380]  is on a chinese spy says beijing cheney calls snowden the traitors has ran poll wrong about
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:30.500]  surveillance so it's all for our safety right cheney and it goes on and on and on and on and on
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:37.540]  and then you've got ci whistleblower in prison for reporting on waterboarding this is the type of
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:43.060]  garbage that's happening i'm going to go to our guest and get into the economic news and the
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:49.700]  latest on all the nsa spying but china is teetering on the brink have a stack of news
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:56.340]  uh fitz says china credit bubble unprecedented in modern world history all of these credit bubbles
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:05.220]  are are the same corporate interest accelerating money printing bubbles and fiat bubbles to take
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:10.500]  over the world and then sign us on to their debt and then poses the saviors during the global
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:16.980]  reorganization and so i agree with keiser that we're already in a world meltdown with them lying
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:22.260]  and saying the economy's gotten great with the globalist picking winners and losers but
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.420]  i believe from their own statements it is an engineered collapse now the question is will
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:31.860]  they ride this out but he said a year ago what happened in april and it didn't happen in april
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:37.300]  he said late april uh but it was a bold prediction now much of what he predicted is starting to happen
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:42.900]  i wouldn't say he's been proven correct yet uh but i was watching cnbc this morning and they were
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:48.100]  all the pundits that now they may zig when they zag so maybe the opposite they were saying yeah it
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:52.340]  looks like the feds going to start tapering yeah things are going to implode outlooks bad
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.180]  what does that mean it means they'll start a war as a political distraction which you now see
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:07.380]  happening so i see a lot of indicators there that uh the big collapse could could be beginning to
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:12.740]  arrive now i hope that's not the case but joining us is max keiser who of course invented the
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:17.220]  hollywood stock exchange which is the basis of a lot of the virtual trading used today
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.500]  and was a very successful stock broker before i guess retiring at like age 40
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:25.940]  and uh he joins us now he writes for a lot of major publications max keiser dot com and
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:31.300]  has a show on rt as well and has had shows on bbc max you heard me kind of set the table there
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:38.580]  thank you for joining us from london uh what do you make of my take on this and what is happening
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:46.580]  right now i think uh it was it all turns on interest rates and interest rates are starting
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:53.300]  to move up now this is pretty much going to put the kibosh on global bond market to the stock
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:16:00.820]  market and uh the rhetoric coming out of uh the mainstream financial press as of a couple of
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:06.180]  months ago was that rising interest rates were telegraphing increased growth that there was an
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:12.660]  increased growth in the economy but since then all the major economies that reported their gdp's
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:17.860]  are down employment is flat stagnating so the reason interest rates are going up is not because
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:26.180]  of growth but because of fear uh fear that this unwinding of this epic bubble is is happening
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:31.540]  and so this is this is what i said would happen and the rising interest rates are telling us
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:36.260]  that that is exactly what is happening so look for interest rates to continue to go higher this means
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:43.460]  that anyone with mortgages variable rate mortgages particularly in the uk what they call uh the
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:51.060]  mortgages that are set variable rate mortgages tracker mortgages will be under water very quickly
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:56.420]  at any houses that they bought and of course george osborne the chancellor of the x checker
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:02.980]  has been fueling a massive Ponzi scheme here in the uk by having the government guarantee mortgages
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:09.140]  up to 20 of a mortgage under a scheme called help to buy he he's actually mirror mirroring
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.940]  the catastrophe that was fanny main freddy mech that led to the collapse of housing in america so
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:19.940]  george osborne is doing that now he's just started that program here so this of course will also
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:29.700]  end in disaster now for layman out there describe the economic situation we're in why this is happening
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:36.420]  and any other tricks they may have up their sleeve uh to extend the incremental collapse
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:42.740]  out that they want to properly uh milk us and then draw and quarter us rather than a big accelerated
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:48.980]  collapse uh which they fear in their own words uh mike i mean i saw jim kramer this morning saying
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.300]  stop the derivatives you're coming out with synthetic derivatives the people aren't going to
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:58.740]  put up with it stop it uh you know you guys are going to get us all in trouble uh but it doesn't
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:03.380]  matter because the more aggressive criminals and kramer admits that he's an insider trading criminal
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:08.980]  in videos the more aggressive criminals the suicide traders as you call them they're in control
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:17.860]  yeah well to give the context of this over the past 30 to 40 years it's been a race between
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:24.100]  those who are creating debt and and the growth that we see in the economy and sometimes there is a
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:32.340]  positive gdp growth despite the increase in debt sometimes debt is growing faster than gdp and we
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:37.940]  call those periods recessions and when growth is outstripping debt we call those periods of growth
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:45.540]  but starting in 2008 the world and now is in five years of debt increasing without any growth
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:50.740]  really appreciable growth anywhere in the world and it was even just six months ago china was
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:55.060]  considered to be growing now is considered to be contracting or its growth rate be accelerating
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:01.460]  so there's no growth to get people out of this debt the derivatives pile the the synthetic
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:07.780]  derivatives pile a massive pile that kramer's talking about is growing now is there another
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:13.380]  trick up the sleeve of the global banksters there is another trick that they could do which is that
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:19.220]  they could take up to a hundred trillion dollars of the bad debt combine them in europe the u.s
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:29.460]  and asia into a new bond that they could create based on the imf uh monetizing this paper the uh
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:34.900]  their special drawing right for sdr with you know the imf is like a central bank in that respect
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:40.420]  like the ecb or the federal reserve it has its own currency the special drawing right for the sdr
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:46.980]  and uh two or three years ago at davos one of the people attending davos mentioned that they
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:54.500]  could flow a 100 trillion dollar loan facility to roll up all this bad sovereign debt into a super
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:20:00.900]  global uh and then back it with carbon taxes stay there we'll be right back with the 100 trillion
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.500]  have you ever felt like the united states government knows way too much about your
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:09.540]  financial affairs i continue to hear stories about property seizures frozen bank accounts
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:14.180]  confiscation of stocks and bonds it makes me wonder if the u.s citizen will ever again have

[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:28.020]  i want freedom and so i'm demonized by basically every publication in the united states every
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:34.260]  establishment publication from national review to msnbc from bill o'reilly to uh
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:44.820]  cnn and i just have a sick feeling uh that i've never had before about america and just about the
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:51.780]  world uh i'm very very very very very very upset because i don't get up here and talk about world
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:57.700]  economic collapses to have a shocking headline i know when they get up there on all the financial
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:02.100]  shows and say it's the best economy ever everything's wonderful i know what's happening in the real
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:06.820]  economy i know about municipalities going bankrupt all over the u.s and all over the world i know
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:11.940]  about europe being signed on to derivative debts that aren't their debts in any case
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:19.940]  trillions and trillions of dollars designed to bankrupt us i see governments gearing up for
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:28.020]  oppression i see just brazen criminal activity by the government corporations and it freaks me out
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:34.660]  and so i look for places to move places to run there is nowhere it's a global corporate government
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:44.580]  and i've seen them go from on msnbc and cnn from saying the economy is wonderful to oh my gosh we're
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:50.020]  in trouble uh which means that they may be getting ready to drop the hammer because they want to at
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:54.820]  least act like with short attention spans of the public that they knew what they were talking about
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:26:01.860]  they know the truth and they could have fixed this is what's sad about it but they cannot turn back
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:08.740]  back from this gulag casino model that max keiser talks about this is your short segment long
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:14.740]  segment coming up max but are you dreading this as much as i am i mean how are you handling this
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:21.620]  emotionally and at your gut level uh i mean how bad is it what do you really think is going to
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:29.700]  happen max uh well yay first of all we know we miss you here in uh the uk when you were here
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:35.780]  the media and the tv shows were interesting for a few days now it's back to the same old boring bbc
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:44.180]  and same nonsense when are you coming back well max i i don't know i don't know if i can run the
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:50.260]  gauntlet there and you know back to the here in the us the point i'm getting at here is how bad
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:27:00.180]  how bad is it currently right now well it's like it's a slow motion train wreck uh that is brought
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:06.260]  about by too much debt i mean i guess you could imagine that you've got this train and it's
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:12.020]  pulling debt the american economy is the engine and it's pulling debt and the government is adding
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:18.340]  more cars of debt to this train and it's slowing down and slowing down and it's it's coming to a
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:24.100]  complete stop and then people are panicking all over the world and look what's happening in chicago
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:30.420]  look with all the violence look what's happening in detroit the state is about to go bankrupt
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:36.660]  that's a direct result of this problem it's just happening in a regional basis but that's a direct
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:40.580]  result of what exactly we're talking about they say once it's gonna happen once the collapse
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:47.140]  gonna happen well it's in detroit it's happened already in chicago it's the more become more
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:51.300]  violent than than iraq i mean this is already happening so it's happening and right now it's
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:57.540]  just it hasn't happened from coast to coast as such but it's happening in these pockets that are
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:02.020]  exploding in the united states and in cities all over the world because it's all connected to the
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:09.700]  same problem and it'll happen here in the uk of course and more more obviously in the short term
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:16.020]  and that's what the martial law buildup is mainly for is just the clamp down and taking
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:23.780]  everybody's private bank accounts and the boy scouts serving in in in thema brigades i mean it's
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:29.300]  just an example of it here in the uk this week there's a bank called co-op bank it wasn't big
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.020]  enough to be too big to fail so instead they're going to do a bail in so the bondholders of the
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:38.260]  bank are going to have to put pony up some gas so this is another trend we've seen in the last
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:41.780]  couple of years if you're part of the too big to fail bank then the government bails out the
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:47.380]  bondholders and yours week if you're not part of that club then it could be in cyprus it could be
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:52.340]  part of co-op bank it could be part of some other bank or country and therefore you get your wealth
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:57.700]  confiscated so wealth confiscation is a trend that became very obvious with cyprus and now it's
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:02.980]  getting uh growing in in different regions uh they're talking about in japan remember ten
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:08.500]  months ago or eleven months ago when i said that there's this global bond apocalypse on the horizon
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:14.740]  i said the number one trigger for this would be japan and since that time we have had a huge
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:21.380]  economic volatility happening in japan as that market goes through a cut-wrenching bond
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:26.900]  collapsed as well as a stock market volatility so we're seeing it happen there because they've had
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:33.540]  two decades of what they call lost decades they can't stimulate using debt and they can't export
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:40.900]  their way into into growth uh so this could be the sinkhole around which all these other yeah you
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:44.980]  did say a year ago it would start in japan and and much of what you predicted is now starting to
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:49.860]  happen i'm gonna talk about short term midterm long term what you think's gonna happen next gold
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:57.140]  and we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:45.780]  revolutionaries that got control in 1913 of the issuance of our currency and have now gotten
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:51.380]  control of most of our society they've been dumbing us down for a long time what do you do when they
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:56.420]  publicly run al-qaeda and are giving them missiles and Saudi Arabia says give them more missiles
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:02.100]  which is just the cover to claim they gave them the missiles they really got from Benghazi
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:10.980]  and i see articles like this all the time here in the us now here's one out of wham television
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:17.780]  man charged after corralling suspected vandals in a closet he came in where they done 40 000

[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:26.580]  he grabbed the hammer away and said wait here for police and he's now been indicted
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:34.580]  he's now been charged so that's how
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:42.500]  away in county man is now facing charges for charges of endangering the welfare of a child
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:47.460]  after he interrupted an act of vandalism see he didn't even touch any of them
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:55.140]  but you don't have a right to citizens arrest now in england if again if you fight back with
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:35:00.580]  your fist with someone trying to stab you in your home they will even if you get stabbed and you
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:05.780]  beat them up they will indict you throw you in prison because there's nothing more evil than a
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:14.740]  citizen defending themselves that's the great crime to a criminal government to a nanny state
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:23.140]  i want to get this guy on the show and then i've got all this other nsa news about how they
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:27.860]  retina scan kids all over the country when they get on the school bus and don't tell the parents
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:34.020]  same thing was done in england a few years ago it's a global unified program of just the good
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:38.740]  fellows that are a bunch of corporate crooks taking over so max let me ask you this question
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:45.060]  break it down in layman terms what do you expect to see now in the economy how bad will it get and
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:50.820]  what other rabbits can they pull you mentioned some of those what will that do
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:56.580]  do uh and and how do you looking out in the future how do you expect this in your gut to
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:03.300]  end what does max keiser thinks really going to happen well the two important numbers are inflation
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:10.180]  and the rate at which wages are growing and we know wages are flat to contracting
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:17.220]  adjusted for inflation real wages haven't grown in 10 years but inflation is growing
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:21.060]  so the government says it's running at two and a half percent to three percent here in the u.s or
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:28.740]  the uk but if you look at the price of what stuff really buy gasoline food etc running at eight nine
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:37.060]  nine percent so that is that trend is where people have make direct contact with how these policies
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:43.700]  are hurting them they their dollars are losing purchasing power in their lives their standard
[01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:49.620]  living is decreasing and they don't have any wage growth to offset that and that trend will
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:57.380]  continue there's uh over the past 50 years or so there was a bit of a correlation between stock
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:03.060]  prices and wages a lot of times you would see stock prices go up and wages would go up but
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:10.100]  this past five years during the stock market rally that has made many billionaires many many times
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:16.900]  richer wages have stayed flat so the financial engineers have perfected a technique where they
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:24.820]  can increase asset values that is to say stocks and stuff like art fine art yachts etc things that
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:28.980]  the billionaires buy they they figured out a way to get those prices to keep going higher
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:35.060]  without increasing wages so that's been the this been the experiment that's been on for 30 years
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:41.060]  i finally had protected this so there's no reason to stop because the cost of labor is not going to
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:47.700]  go higher no matter how much money they print and they'll give to put in their own pocket wages are
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:55.140]  just not going to go higher exactly it's an inflation only in luxury goods everything else
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:38:01.380]  is imploding and then they'll just people only have jobs as cops or prison guards and so we go
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:06.020]  into the gulag economy it's all been well ran corporation as you know wrote about it 50 years
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:13.700]  ago they've really done a great job yeah there's no way that wages are ever going to match inflation
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:22.100]  in the foreseeable future so uh you know and of course the the unions which were in place to defend
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:27.940]  the worker they've been completely destroyed now of course you can say well unions are run by corrupt
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:33.300]  union officials that's true and they union officials have done a lot to destroy the unions
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:38.500]  but uh nevertheless now you have a situation where there's absolutely no one lobbying on
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:45.780]  behalf of workers at all there's nobody lobbying for workers for wages i've said and this is this
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:54.100]  is true economically that if you simply pay down wages to workers and he tripled or quadrupled the
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:59.540]  minimum wage and financed it with the same zero percent interest rates from the federal reserve
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:05.220]  that city bank can get or loyalties that london can get then you could you could have an economy
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:10.980]  that was growing both from workers and asset owners but they don't want to do that they don't
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:15.700]  want to share anything they just want to share what's the plan where they take all the profits
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:20.580]  and leave nothing what's the plan to bring in 30 million illegals i mean the globalists are all
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:26.340]  for it republicans and democrats i just look at it to say i can't go to mexico and have a baby for
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:31.940]  free i can't get on welfare there i'm all for workers of this country and i'm all for immigrants
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:37.380]  my issue is is that they are now basically corporate minions and are going to be used
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:44.100]  to drive down wages uh even further and that that's the goal right cheap labor that's of course
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:50.740]  that's the goal cheap labor is desirable and as long as these people have no rights as long as they
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:55.220]  are one step out of prison or you know the biggest working population in america right now we're
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:40:01.140]  actually prisoners yeah because it was an overturn of a law recently that made it legal once again
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:08.900]  to outsource labor to prison and not only are judges throwing kids into prison on uh spurious
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:15.460]  claims to feed the uh prison industrial complex but now they're putting people in prison because
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:19.860]  that's now become a cheap source of labor now this is a complete repudiation of laws against
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:26.180]  slave labor so slavery is a it's legal in america anyone who thinks that slavery was outlawed it is
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:32.900]  wrong slavery is completely legal in america again i totally agree in fact when you see them passing
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:37.700]  a law where even many wooden pipes it says some wooden pipes are okay but if you read the definition
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:44.740]  of hookas and things it's not we're a felony to have a pipe and then you see stuff where they tell
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:50.500]  the kid take your nra shirt off but the school didn't have a code against you know uh non-prophane
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:56.500]  lettering so they charge him with the gun on his shirt being a terroristic threat uh and then they
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:02.740]  tell kids at commencements that they can't uh thank god when that's their free speech whether
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:09.380]  you believe in god or not i mean i just see cases every day of how wildly authoritarian things are
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:16.100]  and how the law is designed to let violent offenders go but keep the nonviolent people
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:22.660]  actually in the prisons working for 25 cents an hour that's how they legalize slavery is they
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:29.700]  just pass a bunch of laws now we're 0.5 that's half a beer uh you know you're going to get a
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:35.940]  felony now and go to jail they want all of us in the system all right well the biggest
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:39.780]  the country with the biggest prison population in the world is the united states bigger than china
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:44.420]  bigger than any country in the world it's united states because it's such a hugely profitable
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:50.180]  profitable business and the thing about the second amendment or gun rights is that it's a hot
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:55.220]  button issue so a lot of people will be out there defending their second amendment rights but sacrifice
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:42:01.780]  their first third fourth fifth sixth amendment rights so that's very uh unbalanced uh a lot of
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:06.660]  in the gun the pro gun debate is unbalanced and that people are willing to defend their second
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:11.140]  amendment right but sacrifice their first amendment right or the third or fourth amendment right so
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:17.140]  that there's a there's a bit of a confusion i think in the overall pushback against this nsa
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:23.380]  prism style gulag state and remember the prison gulag state needs the prism to make it work and
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:28.820]  now we know thanks to edward snowden that there is a prism the prism them you know you should you
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.460]  should change the name of prison planet the prism planet because now we all live in this nsa prism
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:40.820]  a dome of perpetual uh surveillance and uh i thought the interview with edward snowden today
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:46.500]  was pretty interesting in that he touched on a lot of very interesting points and i am in the camp
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:53.620]  that gives him 100% credibility along with greenland greenwald so uh there is at least a few people
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:59.300]  out there who have managed to blow the whistle come forward and give the administration some hot flashes
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:09.060]  well i love how over and over again we see cheney and neocons come out and say arrest this guy
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:14.260]  he's a trader he must work for the chinese these are the guys that transferred our missile secrets
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:19.380]  our reactor secrets our technology our jobs bipartisan lean the democrats are involved
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:26.260]  as well to communist china because they could get fat cat state guaranteed deals with them now they're
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:31.380]  busy selling off i was watching this morning cnbc like i said and they were just even the hosts
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:36.820]  were like my god they're buying up the entire infrastructure because america sold out mit has
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:41.940]  come out and admitted that there's the jobs are never coming back because we sold out the infrastructure
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:47.940]  the elite here will no longer be the elite they were so greedy they even destroyed their own command
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:54.980]  base max keiser and so my point is it's so rich how this military industrial complex talks about
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:44:01.300]  how it's taking our rights to to protect us when everybody knows they run al-qaeda they run the chai
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:08.340]  comms everything bad they run it well you make a good point there that the the the change of the
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:15.780]  world are pointing to foreign powers and saying we need to protect ourselves against them invading
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:21.220]  well at the same time he's cutting deals with the exact same foreign powers to buy huge pieces of
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:29.220]  america's infrastructure china in particular is buying up big pieces of american industry as as our
[01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:34.660]  other countries around the world and the reason why they're cutting deals now is because of the huge
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:39.940]  debt that america has that they realize that the only way they can settle this debt is to sell off
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:45.380]  these big pieces of the infrastructure and you see the he saw this in in greece a greece was a
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:51.940]  country that before golden sacks and tank i'm sorry uh john paulson and popin drago the the prime
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:57.780]  minister got involved it was a 400 billion dollar economy it was determined that it wasn't that big
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:02.740]  of an economy it was after all maybe only two times the size of ibm or two times the size of
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:07.460]  berkshire half the way and you could effectively do a levered buyout of greece and that's exactly
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:11.940]  what they did they went in there they flooded it with lots of bad debt they transferred that
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:15.780]  debt to the government the government then transferred that debt to the people through
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:21.300]  austerity the economy has collapsed and now they're selling off the assets a few weeks ago for the
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:28.580]  first time one of the greek islands was sold to a cutter uh one of the top guys in in cutter
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:33.060]  at the amir of predator and that opened the floodgates for these cups of cracks and oligarchs
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:39.220]  to start buying these greek islands so now just like detroit created taxes that ran everybody out
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:45.220]  set up this corrupt bureaucracy and now they're fully collapsing that is the model but i think
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.300]  this is show out of control they may not get away with it let me show tv viewers and radio
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:55.300]  listeners a couple articles here uh the new york times police officers arrested a protester in
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:46:02.180]  istanbul on sunday the same day prime minister uh rallied supporters so he was allowed to have
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:07.460]  people come out and rally for him but people that just rallied to keep the only park in the city
[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:13.540]  the only green space open where they play soccer it shows the police but it looks like breaking
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:18.580]  the guy's arm you can see they've twisted it back so far no way that didn't didn't break
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:24.420]  and stomping him in the head and the new york times goes with police arrest see they just
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:30.580]  ignore everything is propaganda let's go to the next article for many no penalty for crimes drunk
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:38.260]  driving uh shoplifting breaking in homes the police it says they made the decision to not
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:44.340]  arrest for petty crimes meanwhile the code code is illegal aliens folks it's illegal aliens that
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:50.740]  don't arrest and again though citizens get pulled over with no seatbelt you go to jail in austin
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:58.180]  and they throw the book at you because we're seen as milk cows max geyser yeah well i think
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:02.260]  it's important for people to understand that when you talk about the new york times you're talking
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:10.740]  about a captured journalistic enterprise they are not giving you unbiased truth this is a
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:17.780]  an institution that's gone horribly wrong so has all of the big media outlets in the u.s i mean
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:24.740]  your show is delivering great information with the texas twister you know this is what the most
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:31.380]  people that under understand in the foreign press that in america now the media landscape is so
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:38.820]  horrid and so decrepit and so immoral that the only way you can get through the the prison of lies
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:45.300]  is through this you know grenade approach which if you get past the um the first couple of shock
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:49.700]  waves you you end up getting a lot and lots of really great information so we want to thank you
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:54.900]  for that and again i will repeat that wherever i go in the world people always say oh yeah i heard
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:59.460]  you on alex jones not that they heard me on the bbc or they heard me on this other outlet they say
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:04.260]  oh i heard you on alex jones so you've got this huge global audience with people waking up to this
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:08.500]  and it's sad though that the country that the most to lose is the united states the people in the
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:13.460]  united states they were holding all the cards and now they've given it all back to the people
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:18.820]  like dick chaney and dick chaney if there's a traitor in the in the mix it's not edwards noted
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:24.260]  it's dick chaney look at dick chaney's track record and selling america's freedom down down the
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:30.500]  the rattle for for what a few a few extra dollars what was his incentive is he that shallow is he
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:35.460]  that callous that he would just blow america well that's even what the big pentagon war planners
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:40.820]  say is they're getting late the military industrial complex and the banks they have one thing profit
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:45.460]  but it's even destroying america's empire in the future so they're even getting weight we're going
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:51.700]  to lose the golden goose because dick chaney and bill clinton and others slaughtered it it's incredible
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:56.020]  we're going to go to break and come back uh with with max keiser and i'm going to find out if we can
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:59.780]  hold max a little bit in the next hour to take your economic phone calls and then i'll open the
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.700]  phones up just for general calls after max leaves us but he he may have to leave in 10 minutes so
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:08.180]  we'll see if this is the final segment when we come back uh with max keiser i'll ask him during
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:13.860]  the break but i just want callers understand something we have a normalcy bias in this country
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:19.380]  to basically put up with anything we've gotten to where we're in a position where we'll put up
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:26.580]  with almost anything and it's time for just across the board to stop complying and to realize
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:32.740]  we're in deep trouble i mean i fundamentally think about my children every day and try to figure out
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:38.820]  ways to fix this country so they have a future and then get angry that it's a global government
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:45.060]  and then i can't leave i mean we're cornered that we've got to get out of here the only way to beat
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:50.100]  this is to bring down the new world order they're bringing down free societies to collapse it into
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:59.140]  their controlled paradigm because they're in control they can do that and it is madness we're

[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:19.060]  economies well there's a scandal of high frequency trading the traders who use this high frequency
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:24.500]  trading they're trading a billion times per second on the new york stock exchange and other
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:28.740]  exchanges they say that they're adding liquidity and they're making a market now it comes out

[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:41.780]  release to the public to give insiders insider information then that came out about the same
[01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:47.300]  time that the nsa prism story broke so that confirms now and also for congress congressional

[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:54.020]  i've seen you when you get back from mexico you look 10 years younger i feel 10 years younger too
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:12:00.580]  you know what i did down there this year there was life changing what was that i went to my wife
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:06.420]  and i we took a 500 mile trip to this lagoon and you got to go about 100 miles off the main road
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:13.220]  through this rough road to get there and the mexicans in a small boat took us out into this
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:20.020]  lagoon and the gray whales will come up to you and you can sit in the boat and actually physically
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:27.620]  touch them wow and mothers bring up their babies and they actually lift them up and i actually
[02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:35.540]  put my hands inside the whale's mouth and scratch their gums you told me you were going to break a
[02:12:35.540 --> 02:12:41.300]  life changing event here on air that is amazing uh i'll tell you alex i can't describe and when
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:47.060]  you look into their eyes you see nothing but intelligence and again they approach you you
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:52.020]  don't go to them you go out there and then they they will come up to you in this lagoon there
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:13:00.100]  must have been at least 30 of them that is just magic can you believe people ever hunted those
[02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:06.500]  well i'll tell you i was so moved i thought with my old frogman experience i was ready to join
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:11.620]  those guys that go disable the ships that kill them because i got trained by the best i know how
[02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:21.940]  to disable ships that ain't a problem tell us how you sub sabotage the propellers and runners
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:30.340]  no because i'm not be able to defend against me but uh no it was getting back to a more
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:37.300]  serious note uh it was really something i mean to uh they the debate we had one mother and her
[02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:44.020]  calf she was 40 feet long literally twice as long as our boat and they must have stayed with us for
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:52.820]  an hour and 15 minutes from what i've seen of the physiology uh they're basically the equivalent of
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:58.900]  like german shepherds i don't know they're certainly well what it showed me alex is this
[02:13:58.900 --> 02:14:05.220]  clearly they can communicate with each other because why would a mother any mother of any animal
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:10.420]  with the instinct is not going to bring their children up to something that endangers them
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:17.460]  so clearly they know in this particular lagoon with the mexicans they know they're in no danger
[02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:25.540]  and they're and it was unique for me because i never felt any danger or any fear there's just
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:33.380]  an aura about it that these big massive giant mammals that live in the water present no harm to
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:43.860]  you they're actually curious to see what we are in fact they say that dolphins have the biggest
[02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:49.780]  brain of any mammal cc size for their for their body weight and they think they may be even smarter
[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:56.180]  than humans well back when i was in the navy we were already using those a small program the underwater
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:01.780]  demolition teams had i wasn't part of it but i had a couple buddies that worked on it for a while
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:07.380]  they were actually using dolphins in underwater work where they have the dolphins would go to the
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:14.820]  surface and get the correct tool and bring it back down to them well look and they also use them to
[02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:20.100]  different mines and things like that in harbors well i've got to say that i don't blame those
[02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:26.260]  killer whales locked up in cages that are the equivalent of like a hundred square foot prison
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:33.060]  cell i don't blame them when they end up killing their other trainers that is incredibly uh in
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:38.980]  humane what's a great segue alex because i'll comment on that and say wait a minute that's what
[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:44.900]  our government wants to do to you and i they want to lock us in cells to keep us safe
[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:54.180]  absolutely the whole nanny state break it down no i mean it's like the choke the cartoon i saw
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:59.220]  we're a mother a father and the two children are sitting at the dinner table and they're all
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:05.460]  exclaiming gee i feel safe now the only thing is they're locked inside a cell well that's what
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:12.340]  eisenhower he said he said total safety is total tyranny exactly it's prison it's like ben franklin
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:16.660]  said for those who want to give up their liberty for security shall have them deserve neither
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:22.980]  well shifting gears into that it's now out that everybody's being listened to everything's being
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:28.580]  recorded and thousands of corporations get contracts to give all your data to the government and then
[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:34.020]  they get to share it and i've had telecom whistleblowers say that they can just dial in anybody's phone
[02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:40.180]  turn it on listen to you it's all confirmed everything we talked about now proven right al-qaeda
[02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:45.460]  run by the government now admitted do we get an apology governor oh absolutely not i don't think
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:51.860]  so alex we deserve one or we deserve the mainstream media to say to us jeez you guys were right
[02:16:53.780 --> 02:17:00.260]  you know it bugs me about it lindsay graham and feinstein and all these are telling the public
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:06.500]  that we need this to fight terrorism well what they're saying to me and to every american is that
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:12.580]  they they think you and i are terrorists because why do they need to listen in on my phone calls
[02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:20.100]  and my emails to fight terrorism i'm not a terrorist what do you make of congressman
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:27.620]  peter king saying arrest the washington post reporter that talked to snowden that's a and
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:35.220]  then b i think snowden's a hero what do you say i do too because the thing to remember is all people
[02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:40.740]  like that in the military you take an oath to protect the constitution and the bill of rights
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:47.060]  and there is if and if somebody's asking you to do something that you feel violates the bill of
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:52.420]  rights or you shouldn't do it and that's what these whistleblowers are doing they're simply
[02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:59.620]  telling us the government lied to you and yet who's going to get prosecuted bradley manning and him
[02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:07.300]  all the they prosecute the messenger now how can they prosecute them when it's the government
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:14.020]  and other entities that are committing crimes and you're reporting them that's right and when
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:19.300]  they reported it fast and furious within the atf they got in trouble so you can't report within the
[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:26.020]  chain because you've got criminals running the chain well clearly it goes that deep in this country
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:30.740]  people need to understand like when i made the statement i love my country but not my government
[02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:37.700]  bad people government is nothing but people and bad people can get in charge if you don't
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:44.900]  believe it read about germany in the thirties well that's another bad people getting in charge and
[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:50.500]  then of course we brought so many damn i read the books this last winter about all the nazis we
[02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:55.700]  brought into this country that shoot a stood trial at bernberg instead we brought a minion gave them
[02:18:55.700 --> 02:19:00.820]  positions of authority oh my grandfather worked all over the southwest and oil and gas and the
[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:05.300]  only places to go eat or stay were military bases a lot of the time into mexico arizona
[02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:10.100]  west texas and he told me when i was a child he almost got in fights all the time and got thrown
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:17.780]  out by mps because he'd go into the restaurant and there'd be full of nazis and ss and he he was
[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:21.540]  part german growing up in dalis so he could speak some german and he'd hear the obnoxious
[02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:25.780]  things they were saying about america and he just he just blew him away they were just
[02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:32.100]  crawling with nazis well you know what happened we can thank alan dalis and all those people that
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:37.380]  you know decided that they were better off here in this country and operating here than
[02:19:37.380 --> 02:19:42.580]  putting them on trial for nernberg look what we did look when i did conspiracy theory and
[02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:47.620]  we found out that eric trial was the godfather of plam island and this guy worked right underneath
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:54.820]  i believe it was himmler and mingala yeah and and his and his expertise was biological warfare
[02:19:54.820 --> 02:20:00.500]  infecting ticks and mosquitoes with agents to kill people and lo and behold we end up with
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:07.620]  lyme disease the first recorded case in lyme connecticut right across the water from plam island
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:11.940]  it's just unbelievable i think there's an article out today where they found a top
[02:20:11.940 --> 02:20:17.460]  nazi living in minnesota did you see that no i didn't i don't watch the news and i i'm i'm
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:22.020]  willfully ignorant i don't read the paper and i still haven't watched the news since i came home
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:26.900]  yeah top nazi commander living in minnesota since 1949 what do you think your dad would have thought
[02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:34.340]  of that well who knows i don't know like i said it doesn't nothing surprises me anymore here
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:41.220]  it's totally creepy i mean and and we know authoritarian regimes spy on people and they
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:46.820]  always say it's for your own good we're being sabotaged i'm getting a whole bunch of interference
[02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:53.620]  over the line i did just hear some of that i'm not hearing you clearly now okay uh governor we're
[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:58.980]  gonna we're gonna call you back and and and and to reconnect okay okay i'm gonna hang up call me back
[02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:04.660]  all right call me back actually i got a call by a very famous spy yesterday going alex we're
[02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:11.940]  monitoring you everything's fine alex because we were just talking about him the phone rings he goes
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:18.580]  yes we're monitoring you alex uh you're too high and i was like what and then his phone crackles
[02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:23.940]  and cuts out he calls back he goes and then monitoring me he can you imagine who it was i'm
[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:31.140]  talking about and he talks like that it's probably just a bad phone line that's probably all it is
[02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:36.500]  now they break on the line and say something to us then we'll uh then we'll know the difference
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:44.020]  but uh it is certainly a crazy world i just skipped this network break is when i get jessie on always

[02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:00.500]  need to make a big deal out of it it's probably just a bad line all right

[02:22:54.420 --> 02:23:00.020]  but still a little interference i'm getting it clear right now okay that's good uh what do you make
[02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:05.300]  of it being openly said okay al qaeda is the main force something we talked about last year
[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:10.580]  and they are killing the muslims uh the minority groups and the christians and the jews but that's
[02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:15.620]  okay because Assad's a bad guy why do you think they're getting so bold i mean the agenda's out
[02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:22.180]  in the open but they just move forward i know i it's all baffling to me alex i i'm still trying
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:28.020]  to figure out why we don't just get the hell out of the middle east i mean if you look at history
[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:34.980]  uh anglo-saxon european history christopher columbus came here and when he sailed here
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:42.420]  it was to find a way to india to avoid the middle east so centuries ago nobody wanted to go there
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:49.220]  they wanted to avoid it and columbus was willing to sail off the flat earth at that time to take
[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:57.860]  the chance to do it let's get the hell out of there i mean completely i don't get it i'll tell you
[02:23:57.860 --> 02:24:04.340]  what if i run for president i will follow the teachings of major general smithley darlington
[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:09.300]  butler who wrote the book war is a racket the two-time congressional medal of honor winner
[02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:14.580]  so anybody who wants to know my foreign policy read general butler's book and you'll know it
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:20.340]  talk about running for president i mean i've got a significant suspicion you're gonna do it
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:26.580]  are you 30 50 80 percent sure you're gonna run no i laid the gauntlet down here's what it'll take
[02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:33.300]  alex it'll take because i hate the bribery and raising the money it'll take a grassroots movement
[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:39.860]  to get me ballot access in all 50 states and they will have to guarantee me will rise up and rebel
[02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:46.260]  if i'm not allowed into debates because you got a debate to win and if those two criterias are met
[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:52.900]  i will give it serious consideration but here's what i will run on i will run on the simplest
[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:58.660]  thing you can imagine i will give the american people for the first time since george washington
[02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:04.100]  the father of our country the opportunity to vote for a president that doesn't belong to either
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:10.420]  political party and is not brought off by corporate money or special interest tax money and i will
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:16.740]  run on that issue alone and i truly believe in a three-person race where you only need about 36
[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:23.220]  percent to win i would stand a very good chance well i think you do stand a really good chance
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:31.220]  with congress with a 10 percent approval rating uh my issue is this why didn't the libertarians
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:35.620]  approach you in the last cycle nothing against their candidate but does anyone even remember
[02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:41.700]  their name yeah the last candidate was gerry johnson i i i campaign for him because i didn't
[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:49.060]  want to run alex the point is you got to pick your battle 2016 is the most opportune time because
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:54.660]  there'll be no incumbent no i agree with you and of course for the independent movement when obama
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:26:00.820]  won re-election because if romney were to run then you'd have an incumbent 2016 you have to
[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:06.340]  have an election with no incumbent sure absolutely sure i mean of course i've seen the reason i
[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:12.900]  didn't want 2012 alone because i don't do it to lose i do it to win and i don't do it just to
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:19.700]  make a statement now i remember i remember 2016 is the best opportune time and that's why late
[02:26:19.700 --> 02:26:24.980]  the gauntlet people got two years to get the ballot access but i i don't care i don't want the
[02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:31.380]  libertarian party i want to run with no political party now i remember you last year explaining all
[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:36.020]  that i was being sarcastic i like gerry johnson overall i just meant he didn't get hardly any
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:42.180]  attention we tried to give him attention but but but people would uh of of given attention to jesse
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:47.300]  minterra and i think it may have made more of a statement than you think it would but i agree with
[02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:55.620]  you the magic number is 2016 for to ever have somebody who's not part of the system run for
[02:26:55.620 --> 02:27:00.100]  president but we've talked about this do you think that they would come after you with more than just
[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:06.020]  smears oh of course i don't know what they do but you know it all depends what you're polling i mean
[02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:12.180]  if you're polling two percent they're not they're going to ignore you but if you all of a sudden
[02:27:12.180 --> 02:27:18.100]  are polling 20 percent or better well then yeah then mainstream media and the two parties they're
[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:22.660]  going to they're going to come at you with both guns loaded you'll see them team up on you you
[02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:28.100]  know all of a sudden democrats and republicans will become bosom buddies when it comes to a third
[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:35.140]  entity but my belief is what the hell more can they do to me alex nothing they've already tried
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:41.540]  to marginalize me and they tell the world i'm crazy and all that stuff but we know better than that
[02:27:41.540 --> 02:27:47.220]  and the point is i would go into the race pretty cavalier really because i mean i have nothing to
[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:55.380]  lose do i know there you go the only way you'd lose uh is by not taking action because you could
[02:27:55.380 --> 02:28:01.540]  win but regardless you'd inject real issues so either way you win by running the only way you
[02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:07.220]  lose is by not running well and again but i want some proof that the american people are going to
[02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:12.580]  stand with me and the only way i see that is they're going to have to do a grassroots effort in all
[02:28:12.580 --> 02:28:18.260]  50 states to get me on the ballot get me ballot access so it's now time for people to organize
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:23.380]  and then and then you will step into the arena when i see that i'm on when i see that i've got
[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:31.940]  ballot access if i get it all 50 states i will give it very serious consideration but that's
[02:28:31.940 --> 02:28:38.340]  what it'll take so i figure i'll still be living in mexico well you better be ready obviously for
[02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:43.380]  more ready but the point is it ain't gonna happen i don't believe it will i don't i think they've
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:50.740]  been drinking too much water they got too much prozac in their bodies to care well people ask why
[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:55.060]  americans put up with so much our accused have dropped about 20 points just from the hydrofluorosalic
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:29:00.180]  acid the roundups on record causing breast cancer to skyrocket and we're all just basically
[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:05.700]  narcotized dying uh we've been hit with a chemical attack so you can't get mad at the public governor
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:11.700]  they're victims they are victims but again uh you know like i said alex i still i'm not gonna do it
[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:16.740]  on my own i gotta have the people with me and i need some sign that they will be and that's the
[02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:22.260]  perfect way let me see ballot access about 50 states they got two years to do it
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:28.580]  let's talk about how people can organize that on the other side get into your lawsuit
[02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:34.180]  that continues against chris kyle to get your name back uh and so much more and some phone calls for

[02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:20.420]  and on the air with the governor but i don't want to hog him too much but he won't be back with us
[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:24.900]  till the book comes out uh in october and he's promised us to come on first when he does those
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:32.660]  interviews uh but expanding expanding what we were just talking about uh dealing with the nsa
[02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:37.460]  and dealing with both parties circling the wagons and and congress having a 10 percent approval
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:43.060]  rating i mean this just can't go on forever governor well what do you what scenarios you're
[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:51.060]  pretty politically savvy guy what scenarios do you see unfolding well um i you know again i i
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:57.220]  i don't see any change naturally coming out of the two parties they're gonna come forward i think
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:36:04.340]  we're gonna end up with probably hillary clinton and maybe jeb bush uh or you know or some maybe
[02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:10.180]  you know chris christie might sneak in there or whatever but nothing's gonna change as long as
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:15.380]  these as long as the two parties continue to control our government people that think you're
[02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:21.780]  going to have change are sadly mistaken i mean obama ran on complete opposite of george bush and
[02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:27.060]  yet when he got into office he's been raised rubber stamp george bush's policies and just
[02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:33.460]  carried on right forward that's all you're going to get no matter which side wins so the real
[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:39.860]  revolution of this country has to come by stop electing them you know and is that feasible
[02:36:39.860 --> 02:36:45.460]  probably not because the people just i don't know why like you talked about them having only a 10
[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:53.540]  percent approval rating yet over 90 percent of them get reelected i agree with what you're saying
[02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:58.820]  and uh there's a clip of playing a few minutes of ralph nader saying obama may be the greatest con
[02:36:58.820 --> 02:37:02.740]  artist in history because with bush he would pretty much say what he was going to do and it was
[02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:09.540]  it was atrocious to watch unfold but with obama it's like his bombs or love bombs uh his secret
[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:19.940]  arrest or loving uh everything he does is a democrat yeah it's disgusting they do the same thing
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:26.260]  but they they pat you on the back while they're doing it the republicans kind of kick you right
[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:31.700]  in the knee when they do it the democrats side lefty and put their arm around you but they do
[02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:38.900]  the same thing it's disgusting speaking of you running for president uh i mean the handout marching
[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:43.940]  order specifics of of what you'd like to see so you could run and then i want to make the point
[02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:48.100]  i mean i'll make it now and get your comment when i talk about dirty tricks and looking out people
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:53.540]  that ask you to run better be ready to support you whatever happens because they already said you
[02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:59.460]  were in a you know fight with police basically when you weren't even in california and it looks
[02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:04.180]  like it was hulk hogan you know an argument with police they already said that you were outside a bar
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:10.420]  you know saying you know down with the navy you know seals i'm glad they're dead and uh so so so
[02:38:10.420 --> 02:38:17.060]  that's what i wanted to ask you first off chris kyle how bizarre is it that he gets killed like
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:24.100]  that in very suspicious circumstances and where is the lawsuit going right now well it is bizarre
[02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:30.100]  i didn't learn about it over the internet when i was in mexico the lawsuit is that uh the way the
[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:37.220]  law works now is his wife becomes the executive of his estate so i'm forced to sue her which i have
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:43.220]  done now again i have no beef with her at all but that's the procedure you have to follow
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:50.020]  and nobody none of the attorneys on that side will offer an apology or will speak to truth so
[02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:56.420]  we're heading to court i guess and i'm fully prepared to go uh i and that would actually be
[02:38:56.420 --> 02:39:03.300]  the best for me because when a jury and a judge finds for me that everyone in the world it can do
[02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:08.900]  an attempt to restore my reputation that he's tried to destroy for i and i don't know what reason
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:15.140]  i've been cheated too because i certainly want him alive so we can put him on the stand and
[02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:20.340]  and i'd like to know why he tried to throw me under the bus well he was simply because
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:28.820]  i opposed the iraq war which any citizen has a right to do that well i know but uh you know so
[02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:33.380]  i've been cheated too but the procedure says that i have to move forward and bring the lawsuit
[02:39:33.380 --> 02:39:38.980]  against her and i know bill o'reilly got on tv or something last week and and looked into the
[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:44.260]  camera and told me to do the right thing and drop the lawsuit well of course he's going to say that
[02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:50.500]  because he's part of newest core and newest core is also part of this publishing company and believe
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:57.380]  me when if i win this lawsuit i'm coming after them next absolutely look i'll i told you day
[02:39:57.380 --> 02:40:01.220]  one they timed it right when you went over the border knowing you don't have a cell phone knowing
[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:05.460]  it took you days to get out there so you couldn't respond they were already putting out dirty tricks
[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:11.220]  i've been the victim of these as well and they were already engaged in that to try to destroy you
[02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:17.780]  he was put up to it to sell the books undoubtedly and then he's mysteriously killed when you start
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:21.780]  winning the court case i mean for those that don't know you were winning it's going forward
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:27.140]  you have witnesses he didn't you're going to win this now he's dead because when he was involved
[02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:33.300]  in very high-level national security shadowy operations uh and was and bragged in his book
[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:39.380]  that he told lies in the media and engaged in psyops and i my gut tells me he said look i'm not
[02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:44.660]  going down for this you guys need to admit you put me up to it and then they took him out well i
[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:51.140]  don't know i can't make any statements concerning that at all alex i don't know you know all i know
[02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:57.300]  is what what but my main objective has always been and i offered it to him a year ago the first
[02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:03.220]  time i ever met him at a preliminary conference all it would have taken then was an apology and to
[02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:08.580]  admit that the story didn't happen and he wouldn't do it and so now it's been a year later and
[02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:15.540]  thousands upon thousands of uh lawyer dollars spent so far into it now i have to see it to the
[02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:22.020]  conclusion so as far as i can tell you right now we will go to trial i feel confident uh
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:27.540]  that the evidence is what it is that it never happened that if you can lose a trial where
[02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:32.420]  something didn't happen well then i know that the united states of america truly indeed
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:37.940]  has lost its moral compass absolutely we all saw the good news with the supreme court ruling
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:43.300]  that they can't patent our genes and then not let us have our own genes as a treatment but
[02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:49.300]  getting back to this i just want to be a character witness here for you getting to fly around when
[02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:54.180]  you're getting to know you over the last now seven eight years time flies the only time and the
[02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:58.260]  truth is you're you know you're a big sentimental teddy bear the only time i've seen you tear up
[02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:03.380]  is when you see troops in the airport or veterans or people with their arms or legs blown off i've
[02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:09.140]  seen you repeatedly talk about that's why i oppose the war you know is because of what it does to my
[02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:13.540]  fellow people in uniform yeah i know you're sentimental your dad won a bunch of battle stars
[02:42:13.540 --> 02:42:17.700]  in the battle of bulge you know you come from a military family and i and i don't want to sit
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:23.700]  here and get sappy but i mean that's why it's such an evil lie to say you'd go to a navy seal
[02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:29.140]  commencement and then you'd say navy seals deserve to die well alex that would also be
[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:34.260]  suicidal that would be the equivalent of going to the hell's angels clubhouse and telling them they
[02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:42.740]  suck you know come on and and the point of the matter is is that i view our soldiers and sailors
[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:49.620]  and airmen as victims you know war happens because of failed politics politicians are the cause of war
[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:55.940]  but the poor service people are just the tool they use and their victims also and your mother
[02:42:55.940 --> 02:43:03.140]  was in north africa it's our job as the civilian population if you disagree with a war that it's
[02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:08.580]  your job to try to ensure that our young men and women don't go die in a war that you don't agree
[02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:15.300]  with it i'll throw this out there now that it's been nearly 10 years it has been 10 years i still
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:23.380]  haven't figured out why we invaded iraq absolutely it's just as a bottomless pit to make no bid
[02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:28.660]  contracts well and the point is what what's been successful about it what did we accomplish
[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:36.580]  is what's changed nothing but big big banks siphon trillions of dollars out of taxpayers
[02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:43.220]  well other than that yeah other than halibur to get rich that's why i'm i wrote the preface for a
[02:43:43.220 --> 02:43:48.340]  book they're bringing out they're bringing out general smithley butler's anti-war book from the
[02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:53.700]  two-time congressional medal of honor brian they're republishing it they're redoing his book sky
[02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:59.060]  horse called war is a racket and i did the preface for it and i think every kid in america
[02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:03.300]  should be required to read this book before they graduate from high school i've read it it's a
[02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:07.380]  short good book we should carry that as soon as it comes out we carry most of sky horse's great
[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:12.980]  material at infowarstore.com speaking of the book you were telling me off air why you're doing this
[02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:17.860]  jfk book and that you want to make a statement about that well i'm doing the jfk book because
[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:24.340]  for my own selfish reasons i i want for whatever you know whether anyone cares 100 years from now
[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:31.860]  or not i want them to know that the 38th governor of minnesota jesse ventura does not agree with the
[02:44:31.860 --> 02:44:36.820]  law and commission of the government's official story on the murder of john f kennedy and the
[02:44:36.820 --> 02:44:42.660]  only way i felt i could really truly do that is to write a book about it and then it'll be definitive
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:48.260]  anyone that reads it will know that jesse ventura certainly does not believe what he was told by
[02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:53.380]  our government or the results of the war and commission just briefly getting back to chris
[02:44:53.380 --> 02:45:01.540]  call before we go to calls uh anyway you slice it it was bad luck to lie about you i don't know
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:08.660]  about that at all all i know is that this story was not true it never happened and i will defend
[02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:15.380]  till the end uh and i will i will seek out the only way that i can clear myself and that's
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:20.980]  through our court system so i really hope people aren't angry at me because the media tries to
[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:27.860]  make it look like i'm going after it's never been about money it's been about the truth and the media
[02:45:27.860 --> 02:45:34.500]  makes it look like i'm going after this widow and her family now this war hero and uh that isn't
[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:39.780]  the case at all it's what i have to do to clear my name for the slanderous things of being called
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:45.220]  the traitor to my country well one of the worst ways to hurt somebody is to say your glad troops
[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:51.940]  are dying i mean i mean exactly and now they're telling you you need to shut up after news corps
[02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:57.940]  was with glee reporting that for months on air yeah exactly and now they want to know bill
[02:45:57.940 --> 02:46:05.460]  o'reilly wants me to drop the lawsuit after he reports on it multiple times and and uh poisons
[02:46:05.460 --> 02:46:11.460]  the public's mind over me now i'm supposed to do the right thing why won't he have me on to defend
[02:46:11.460 --> 02:46:17.860]  myself there's a question your your listeners call bill o'reilly and ask him how come everybody gets
[02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:22.660]  to talk about this but he won't let me on let me tell you what he did to me two weeks ago i never
[02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:28.900]  talk about sex stuff on the show i haven't settled stuff for sexual harassment with people like he
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:34.500]  has he plays a clip of me yelling about something completely different it was about war and says
[02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:39.780]  this is the type of hate speech against women and and then has my face turned red on screen
[02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:44.580]  and i'm telling you these people are going crazy i mean there's something wrong with them because
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:49.620]  i've i've talked to lawyers who contact me that i know and they said clearly that's actionable
[02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:54.820]  but i'm not gonna do anything just because they just credit themselves but it's just unbelievable
[02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:59.700]  it seems like the whole world's going crazy jesse not only that alex but it's extremely expensive
[02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:05.860]  when you bring litigation like i have it it costs a great because that's how see
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:12.100]  insurance companies are paying the other side so it's truthfully me against the big insurance
[02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:20.900]  company of the publisher not against the wife and and what they try to do is they try to run you
[02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:26.420]  out of money you know they wait until the 11th hour and hope that you'll go away and hope that
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:31.380]  public pressure will cause you to you know give up what you believe in and and they hope to run
[02:47:31.380 --> 02:47:37.060]  you out of money and unfortunately i have enough money that they can't run me out of it to get a
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:44.980]  case to court and so we will go to court next by August i guess unbelievable um i've got a few
[02:47:44.980 --> 02:47:50.180]  other points i want to get to but will we'll cover that after we take calls but but any other points
[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:54.340]  things in the news things that are happening governor ventura that that you want to impart to
[02:47:54.340 --> 02:48:00.420]  our audience oh no not really you know john i'm just enjoying being back i wish tiger was doing a
[02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:08.100]  little better in the u.s open so you're you're rooting for tiger yeah i want to see him come back
[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:13.300]  and win another major because it'll slap all the pundits and all the media right the nose yeah i don't
[02:48:13.300 --> 02:48:17.380]  get why he's choked so bad but i think it was probably a narcissist and it kind of collapsed
[02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:24.900]  his worldview it's golf nobody chokes it's a difficult game alex anything you could have
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:31.940]  the wheels come off on any hole if that clubface is off by one sixteenth of an inch well when you
[02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:37.780]  hit a 300 yard shot that's no no i know that but he won so many and now he's won none i'm saying he's
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:43.220]  collectively no no no he's won more this year than he ever has he just hasn't won a major
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:51.060]  he's won five tournaments this year i think now he's definitely a wild man let's talk to mike
[02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:57.460]  in oregon mike you're on the air go ahead uh hello gentlemen how's it going we're doing good you
[02:48:57.460 --> 02:49:04.260]  got a question we're good go ahead i do yes uh for for the governor uh sir uh i could have swore
[02:49:04.260 --> 02:49:10.020]  you had mentioned on this show or earlier uh perhaps maybe a year or so ago about if you were
[02:49:10.020 --> 02:49:18.420]  elected president you might actually consider legislation on forcing on congress and senators
[02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:23.380]  and so forth elected officials like that preventing them from actually retiring and i've been thinking
[02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:29.060]  about that and if there was such a thing that would that not certainly reduce a great amount
[02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:34.740]  of corruption right off the bat yeah absolutely there should never be a retirement for what they
[02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:40.980]  call public service right yeah exactly that would that would get that would bring you term limits
[02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:46.420]  without implementing them because nobody's going to sit there and get elected for 25 years and not
[02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:50.660]  get a retirement from it and then you bring in people to government that aren't just there to
[02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:56.580]  try to feather their nest exactly you bring people in like it was designed you go there to serve
[02:49:56.580 --> 02:50:01.780]  and when you're done serving you go back to what you used to do it's a classic way to eliminate
[02:50:01.780 --> 02:50:09.460]  career politicians that's why they won't do it hmm well governor i think that if you go ahead and
[02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:17.140]  and we make this happen for you i think honestly that would be some great great laws passed well
[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:22.580]  thank you mike remember mike i can't pass a law people need to understand that according to our
[02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:29.140]  constitution the president although you'd wonder about it today but the president can't pass a
[02:50:29.140 --> 02:50:32.660]  law only the congress that's right so say even if ron paul would have gotten elected they would have
[02:50:32.660 --> 02:50:37.220]  tried to block him so it's just it's one step ron paul we're going to break governor but ron paul
[02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:40.900]  would you try to have him on your cabinet as an advisor if you won the presidency
[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:47.220]  oh i certainly would love to have any participation congressman paul would give me absolutely how

[02:54:17.540 --> 02:54:22.980]  with calls we've got a guest on about the immigration reform stuff governor i was telling you you're
[02:54:22.980 --> 02:54:27.220]  saying you had an incredible experience with these gray whales and i was saying i didn't think stone
[02:54:27.220 --> 02:54:31.220]  hints were doing anything i was like oh it's boring why'd we go here i walked across what they said
[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:36.740]  was the lay line without them telling me and i was like electrified felt like i was 18 uh and
[02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:41.060]  everybody else i was with felt it my mother when she was there a decade ago said she felt that
[02:54:41.060 --> 02:54:47.460]  and and you told me a similar story well yeah when i went to the pyramids and when i was governor i
[02:54:47.460 --> 02:54:51.940]  did a trade mission to mexico and they took me to the pyramids and we walked to the top of the
[02:54:51.940 --> 02:54:57.780]  pyramids and right at the top there was a group of mexicans maybe three or four who had their hand
[02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:02.900]  placed right on the center and i inquired i said what are they doing and they said well they believe
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:09.540]  the pyramid has energy and the energy is transferring to them so i thought this is interesting so i went
[02:55:09.540 --> 02:55:14.020]  over and i put my hand down there and i left it there for about 10 minutes and it's true
[02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:21.860]  you know how i know it's true alex how because i had way more energy going down the pyramid than
[02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:29.300]  i had coming up i bet no let me tell you i got i'm not gonna go i got pretty excited i mean it was
[02:55:29.300 --> 02:55:34.660]  and i know i know that's a joy you know i did have fun with that because i told my security that
[02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:40.020]  do i said god this works i said i got way more energy going down this pyramid than i had going
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:45.380]  up exactly but i mean did you really feel the energy though no i can't say that i did yeah i'm
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:50.980]  not going to tell you that i sat there and you know all of a sudden you know my my ears perked up
[02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:57.220]  or i felt like prismy going through my body no i did not but it's not to say that it isn't true
[02:55:57.220 --> 02:56:01.060]  you know there's a lot of things we don't know about in this universe that we
[02:56:01.060 --> 02:56:05.940]  hey i i mean i mean it's just a magnetic field exactly you know i mean i think it's kind of it
[02:56:05.940 --> 02:56:13.060]  felt like when i was in a room with a big uh at the midwestern um american museum they turned
[02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:17.860]  on the biggest above ground tesla coil and you feel it i mean i i felt that and knew what it was
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:21.380]  and i felt something like that and i think it's electricity coming out of the earth come like
[02:56:21.380 --> 02:56:26.980]  the poles i always remember that you have a you have a flow of electricity that goes through your
[02:56:26.980 --> 02:56:33.780]  body that's what any acupuncturist taps into exactly uh so you know who you know there's a
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:39.700]  lot of things we don't know and understand and i think that you know in the old days anything
[02:56:39.700 --> 02:56:45.940]  we didn't know or understand we attributed to god well today we understand a lot more things so we
[02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:50.900]  don't necessarily attribute everything to him let's jam in a few more calls anthony in miami quick
[02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:57.540]  question for jesse hello mr governor how you doing uh well i'm a big fan of yours and i believe
[02:56:57.540 --> 02:57:04.420]  that you will be the greatest man to be president next and i wanted to know if elected president
[02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:12.340]  would you prosecute the true perpetrator of 9 11 well first of all you would need to get before
[02:57:12.340 --> 02:57:18.500]  you could prosecute anybody you need to have a real investigation of it that's where you have
[02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:24.980]  to start off this and an unbiased investigation to think people need to understand when when all of
[02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:31.940]  these the 9 11 commission the warrant commission and all that they're always there to prop up the
[02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:38.020]  official story and the reason that it's called the official story is generally it's to protect
[02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:42.980]  officials absolutely let's jam in one more jonathan in new york you're on the air with ventura
[02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:49.060]  ask your question hey jesse man how's it going good good i'll go question um i want to know your
[02:57:49.060 --> 02:57:54.500]  opinion do you think the american people will finally wake up with 9 11 if it was like an
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:58:00.500]  official whistleblower to blow that story apart uh civil evidence we're not because the mainstream
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:06.420]  media walked along the whistleblower the light of day i thought this past fall in chicago and
