[01:00.140 --> 01:04.620]  key events that are going to happen by the end of september is something really
[01:04.620 --> 01:10.300]  big about to happen well i've said it everybody else has basically said it
[01:10.300 --> 01:17.580]  everybody i talked to spidey sense is really kicking is it going to be massive
[01:17.580 --> 01:20.660]  war with russia is it going to be an economic collapse is it going to be a
[01:20.660 --> 01:25.660]  giant isis terror attack is it that we know the economy starting to really
[01:25.660 --> 01:29.780]  break down and the media is lying about it are we feeling the collective
[01:29.780 --> 01:35.500]  unconscious awaken and people that weren't awake or aware are now so upset
[01:35.500 --> 01:39.660]  and scared that those of us that were already awake are picking up on it i
[01:39.660 --> 01:45.660]  think in the mainstay really looking at this deeply that's the backdrop that's
[01:45.660 --> 01:53.460]  why i've got ten times the anxiety i've ever had because i don't really have a
[01:53.460 --> 02:01.860]  lot of anxiety i have concerns i take action i'm not a fearful person but to
[02:01.860 --> 02:12.060]  quote again cheesy star wars i feel a disturbance in the force and i felt
[02:12.060 --> 02:16.500]  similar things but much smaller right before nine eleven right before the big
[02:16.500 --> 02:26.300]  bank crash in 2008 i called in folks on the saturday before they found been
[02:26.300 --> 02:31.340]  laden with that fake raid called in rob do and some other key people and i said
[02:31.340 --> 02:36.380]  it's something really big is about to happen watch and then of course on may
[02:36.380 --> 02:43.940]  day they announced a few years ago that they killed him in the whole fake raid
[02:43.940 --> 02:48.260]  and i realized now the reason my spidey since was kicking was not in the
[02:48.260 --> 02:53.700]  general worldwide system that it was incredibly dangerous and a big deal but
[02:53.700 --> 02:58.300]  that i would be so closely tied to it with navy seals families and navy seals
[02:58.300 --> 03:03.740]  breaking the news here on this broadcast that the whole thing was fake i now know
[03:03.740 --> 03:07.500]  that it made the criminals in the government so mad they came with an
[03:07.500 --> 03:16.060]  inches of having me killed and that's why i was in my gut in my spirit even if
[03:16.060 --> 03:19.100]  you're not a christian or spiritual everybody knows you got a gut instinct it
[03:19.100 --> 03:24.860]  was off the chart then folks this is ten times that okay but it's not about me
[03:24.860 --> 03:30.500]  this time or my operation being in danger it's everything that because
[03:30.500 --> 03:41.180]  everybody's feeling it's big it's bad something wicked this way comes to

[09:27.700 --> 09:33.260]  Armstrong's going to be joining us from Armstrong economics to break down an
[09:33.260 --> 09:38.140]  article that he was interviewed in the secret meeting in London to end cash
[09:38.140 --> 09:44.060]  that ties into Bilderberg and you've seen the parallel push by bank heads
[09:44.060 --> 09:49.460]  government heads regulatory commissions in the last month calling for an end of
[09:49.460 --> 09:53.700]  cash so we're going to break down exactly what's behind that and the
[09:53.700 --> 10:00.180]  Bilderberg groups push and they're meeting right now in Austria to discuss
[10:00.180 --> 10:07.140]  capital controls on consumers while HSBC pays 40 million for money laundering
[10:07.140 --> 10:13.140]  as a fine and then John Rappaport will be joining us for 30 minutes Leanne

[10:25.540 --> 10:30.980]  bottom of the hour in about 23 minutes from now
[10:35.140 --> 10:42.980]  there is a big battle going on in the house they've already passed giving the
[10:42.980 --> 10:48.580]  president dictatorial authority over everything in the so-called TPP deal in
[10:48.580 --> 10:54.340]  the Senate it is now in the house it is incredibly unpopular in national polls
[10:54.340 --> 11:07.060]  upwards of 87% in Gallup and others the treaty is secret but the Senate has
[11:07.060 --> 11:12.540]  voted to give the president dictatorial power three sections of the 28 have been
[11:12.540 --> 11:19.180]  leaked the latest yesterday and it internationalizes Obamacare puts foreign
[11:19.180 --> 11:27.260]  insurance companies and hospital groups over the states it gives the president
[11:27.260 --> 11:34.700]  the power just basically across the board to do whatever he wants it puts a
[11:34.700 --> 11:42.260]  cherry on top the devolution of the president from the executive branch head
[11:42.260 --> 11:51.540]  who carries out the laws given to him by Congress and overseen by the courts it
[11:51.540 --> 11:59.900]  pretty much ends the long degeneration and completes the long degeneration to
[11:59.900 --> 12:06.220]  the presidency being dictatorial still in a ceremonial fashion to the public
[12:06.220 --> 12:12.020]  it's not officially dictatorial but the office itself is turning into that there's
[12:12.020 --> 12:18.380]  a huge battle going on on that front we're going to be breaking down Obama
[12:18.380 --> 12:24.580]  makes last-ditch plea to Dems ahead of showdown vote on trade and see it's
[12:24.580 --> 12:30.180]  Democrats that are holding this back working with the Tea Party and its
[12:30.180 --> 12:33.700]  establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats that are working
[12:33.700 --> 12:39.740]  together to try to ram this through Senator Sessions and the Alabama
[12:39.740 --> 12:44.580]  coalition are the final group to be holding up the passage right now the
[12:44.580 --> 12:50.060]  LA Times is reporting and they're pointing out that it is basically a
[12:50.060 --> 12:55.820]  crowning coronation event of the office of the presidency sure still will vote
[12:55.820 --> 13:01.100]  for whoever we make dictator for four to eight years but it is dictatorial while
[13:01.100 --> 13:07.060]  they're in power an elected dictator Hitler was elected but it won't take
[13:07.060 --> 13:12.900]  long for the elections to stop once you make the government dictatorial that's
[13:12.900 --> 13:19.180]  just a fact it's like if submarines had screen doors they wouldn't they wouldn't
[13:19.180 --> 13:24.620]  work too well while making a president a dictator is like having screen doors on
[13:24.620 --> 13:31.460]  a submarine for a free country you can even have stoic dictators sometimes
[13:31.460 --> 13:36.940]  philosopher kings that actually help societies for a short period of time and
[13:36.940 --> 13:42.620]  we've seen golden ages in different places like Greece and in Rome start
[13:42.620 --> 13:52.460]  out of that the problem is it always degenerates very quickly into hell on
[13:52.460 --> 13:57.820]  earth and we're not going to start with a philosopher king we're going directly
[13:57.820 --> 14:05.500]  to special interest that develop and deploy a compromised puppet who then
[14:05.500 --> 14:09.700]  acts as a dictator it's the most horrible political combination I could
[14:09.700 --> 14:16.060]  think of it's basically fascism with a bunch of domesticated idiots who are
[14:16.060 --> 14:23.620]  socialist with corporatists above the law offshore who can even escape
[14:23.620 --> 14:30.580]  retribution if the people overthrow the dictator because the system itself is so
[14:30.580 --> 14:37.180]  cancerous you can't remove it we're facing 21st century tyranny it's high
[14:37.180 --> 14:45.580]  tech it's slick and I don't know how you deal with it because it rots the soul
[14:45.580 --> 14:52.660]  itself it domesticates it dumps down it poisons it operates like a 500 IQ
[14:52.660 --> 15:00.020]  space alien I mean there's ineptitude within the system but that just works
[15:00.020 --> 15:05.580]  into the design at the top the social engineers know how we operate know how
[15:05.580 --> 15:10.060]  systems operate and and when they're at the apex of power they can just
[15:10.060 --> 15:14.220]  consolidate more and more power vertically integrating it through the
[15:14.220 --> 15:18.260]  crises they create or exacerbate
[15:19.460 --> 15:24.500]  Washington accuses Russia of outright lies on Ukraine with a in Russia's face
[15:24.500 --> 15:30.980]  speech by Samantha the war witch powers addressed to a crowd of hundreds in Kiev
[15:30.980 --> 15:39.980]  basically declaring war on Russia that's in AFP we've got seven key events that
[15:39.980 --> 15:44.980]  are going to happen by the end of September we've got EU prepares for
[15:44.980 --> 15:52.500]  worst as Greece drives finances to the brink Bloomberg we've got huge
[15:52.500 --> 15:55.900]  Builder Burke news we've got more people having their kids taken for playing the
[15:55.900 --> 15:59.500]  backyard we're talking about 11 year olds 10 year olds and yes even 12 year
[15:59.500 --> 16:07.380]  olds how's that for a free country the police are here you're playing in the
[16:07.380 --> 16:10.740]  backyard you're 11 with a basketball where your parents oh they got home from
[16:10.740 --> 16:14.460]  working an hour you're going to jail sonny you'll never see mommy and daddy
[16:14.460 --> 16:24.180]  again did I tell you you live in America I mean anyone who's over 30 here's
[16:24.180 --> 16:28.900]  this and goes excuse me I lived in the woods that's what Joe Big said this
[16:28.900 --> 16:38.020]  morning Darren grew up in Phoenix it just ran around the city that's what I
[16:38.020 --> 16:42.620]  did I could walk into the city but we lived on the edge in the country I had
[16:42.620 --> 16:55.900]  the country to my left late to my back city to my front and we are a prison
[16:55.900 --> 17:00.580]  planet we're basically domesticated I don't know how you even reach out to
[17:00.580 --> 17:03.460]  the young people that on average spent eight hours a day watching TV or playing
[17:03.460 --> 17:15.620]  video games and their little coffin rooms you know I said in the first little
[17:15.620 --> 17:24.260]  segment that I was going to come in and basically just make a statement here on
[17:24.260 --> 17:28.740]  air about the state of the world and I guess I'll try to do it in the next
[17:28.740 --> 17:37.620]  segment and then get back into all this news but it's so hard to have a thought
[17:37.620 --> 17:42.460]  that's deep and connected to so many factoids and so many experiences and
[17:42.460 --> 17:56.220]  then to try to enunciate pronunciate that idea in a way that's clear is
[17:56.220 --> 18:01.980]  something that speech writers you know take sometimes months to codify and
[18:01.980 --> 18:10.100]  then project I don't have the luxury of a big infrastructure like that to try to
[18:10.100 --> 18:19.420]  codify my ideas and then assemble them in a magnificent structure so that it
[18:19.420 --> 18:26.860]  might be a major warning sign or a major monument
[18:27.180 --> 18:36.860]  thwarting our headlong race over the edge into doom but I think in the final
[18:36.860 --> 18:43.020]  equation is that if you look at every social economic cultural military
[18:43.020 --> 18:56.100]  financial scientific trend we are going over the edge right now the event
[18:56.100 --> 19:08.540]  horizon no turning back the point of no return that's the ominous feeling that's
[19:08.540 --> 19:14.260]  why people are so concerned because yes the world is either on one side waking
[19:14.260 --> 19:20.540]  up or going deeper into a trance but captaining it are some very wicked
[19:20.540 --> 19:32.620]  selfish anti-human people who want to preside over destruction and collapse
[19:32.620 --> 19:42.020]  stay with us we'll be back this is an American president just add puppet then

[24:31.980 --> 24:37.860]  Alex Jones here back live at the kickoff the transmission I mentioned seven key
[24:37.860 --> 24:41.460]  events that are going to happen by the end of September an article on info
[24:41.460 --> 24:46.980]  wars.com by Michael Schneider seven key events that are going to happen by the
[24:46.980 --> 24:51.820]  end of September is something really big about to happen Michael Schneider is
[24:51.820 --> 24:55.140]  a smart guy I want to get him on as a guest but I think I've said that before
[24:55.140 --> 25:00.660]  it's falling through the cracks and that ties into EU prepares for worse as
[25:00.660 --> 25:06.020]  Greece drives finance to the brink they've had three different bail-ins taxes
[25:06.020 --> 25:12.020]  handing over hundreds of grecian islands worth billions of pieces some cases two
[25:12.020 --> 25:18.260]  globalist companies when Greece helped bail out the euro in 2008 its people
[25:18.260 --> 25:23.060]  did they were signed on to this debt that wasn't theirs predominantly and now
[25:23.060 --> 25:30.140]  they get to have their taxes raised and the reason I start this segment with
[25:30.140 --> 25:35.180]  that point is the more you do what the globalists say the worse it gets
[25:35.180 --> 25:41.620]  their solutions always make it worse always put you in more debt always end
[25:41.620 --> 25:45.820]  up making you poorer always giving them more power because that's what they do
[25:45.820 --> 25:51.740]  they make themselves rich while making you poor to control you it's called
[25:51.740 --> 25:55.580]  economic warfare in their own words
[25:55.580 --> 26:07.700]  and everyone I talked to feels the ominous dread that's coming is it
[26:07.700 --> 26:12.740]  potential expanded war with Russia the Middle East is stabilized the South
[26:12.740 --> 26:20.380]  China crisis economic collapse I think greater than that it is the group
[26:20.380 --> 26:24.460]  collective that's been proven to be a group consciousness of the seven and a
[26:24.460 --> 26:30.900]  half billion souls on this planet waking up not everybody but a large cadre
[26:30.900 --> 26:38.020]  across the globe waking up and getting concerned those of us a bit of awake a
[26:38.020 --> 26:43.580]  long time see someone who just wakes up and they're all freaking out and we
[26:43.580 --> 26:47.740]  basically are picking up on their concern and that's a good thing because if
[26:47.740 --> 26:50.820]  you're not concerned there's something wrong with you a few days ago there was
[26:50.820 --> 26:56.100]  a giant mushroom cloud style formation over England and folks thought Russia
[26:56.100 --> 27:02.580]  had nuked them well people should be concerned about being nuked and those
[27:02.580 --> 27:06.420]  type of clouds form all the time why were they concerned now why was there
[27:06.420 --> 27:09.960]  panicking now when even the media wasn't pushing it as something to be
[27:09.960 --> 27:13.900]  concerned about we're supposed to be scared of bogeymen under the table or
[27:13.900 --> 27:21.060]  Jaws is gonna eat us things that don't exist or super rare not about real things
[27:21.060 --> 27:30.900]  that could happen and so my message is just this I have nothing but good will
[27:30.900 --> 27:37.580]  towards everybody every race color creed every region of the globe I want
[27:37.580 --> 27:43.860]  people to do good I have good will most of you have good will the globalist
[27:43.860 --> 27:48.340]  social engineers have bad will and people that have bad will towards
[27:48.340 --> 27:52.980]  humanity are directing our development and our future and admitting they're
[27:52.980 --> 27:59.380]  doing it and I have a great frustration to see black turns it against white and
[27:59.380 --> 28:04.020]  vice versa to see the globalist playing populations off against each other
[28:04.020 --> 28:10.140]  removing borders to create crises and then exacerbating those
[28:10.140 --> 28:16.100]  centralizing dictatorial power but the most important thing I want to
[28:16.100 --> 28:21.180]  transmit is to people that work for the system and who believe that they've
[28:21.180 --> 28:26.300]  picked the winning side even if it's immoral even if it's corrupt they have
[28:26.300 --> 28:31.020]  Machiavellian lead chosen that the end justifies the means with quote real
[28:31.020 --> 28:39.940]  politic a laissez-faire attitude towards tyranny and it is you who has
[28:39.940 --> 28:45.060]  empowered the evil ones it is you who have passively gone along with it or
[28:45.060 --> 28:50.740]  even aggressively supported it to be promoted that are going to destroy our
[28:50.740 --> 28:57.060]  society and maybe even our world it's people like you that let governments
[28:57.060 --> 29:02.620]  kill 262 million innocent people in the 20th century it's people like you that
[29:02.620 --> 29:05.340]  if it kicks off again and a chain reaction are going to cause the death
[29:05.340 --> 29:09.240]  of billions including you and your family and if you don't feel it in your
[29:09.240 --> 29:13.620]  bones or even see it intellectually let me just slap you upside the head
[29:13.620 --> 29:19.220]  politically and tell you something you better stop serving evil and you better
[29:19.220 --> 29:22.900]  stop running over the Bill of Rights and Constitution and other systems
[29:22.900 --> 29:28.100]  around the world and you better start doing the right thing right now or we're
[29:28.100 --> 29:33.500]  gonna lose everything don't you have self-preservation in your body even of
[29:33.500 --> 29:38.860]  your sociopath you ought to understand that evil is growing out of control and
[29:38.860 --> 29:43.620]  is reaching critical mass and we got to put it back in the bottle now we don't

[33:12.420 --> 33:27.260]  cautious in Austria we have just massive amounts of huge breaking news
[33:27.260 --> 33:32.180]  concerning Bilderberg if you're a new listener Bilderberg is one of the most
[33:32.180 --> 33:38.260]  secretive probably the most secretive an elite secret summits that's been held
[33:38.260 --> 33:43.980]  every year since 1954 when officially was given the name Bilderberg of course
[33:43.980 --> 33:48.220]  similar meetings were being cared before that but at that meeting the old
[33:48.220 --> 33:52.500]  European robber Baron elite this has now been declassified and released by
[33:52.500 --> 33:58.300]  Bilderberg about 11 years ago to the BBC to establish the European Union the
[33:58.300 --> 34:03.340]  North American Union the Asian Union to bring in a planetary government at the
[34:03.340 --> 34:09.260]  core of it being an Atlantic alliance both sides of the Atlantic to bring in
[34:09.260 --> 34:14.980]  the planetary regime to bring in a global government based around guilt of
[34:14.980 --> 34:22.660]  hurting the earth based on regulating the seas the the lands the air they
[34:22.660 --> 34:28.500]  develop the plan they deployed the plan they're almost complete right now and
[34:28.500 --> 34:33.220]  if their plan is identified it will not be able to be forced through that's why
[34:33.220 --> 34:39.100]  TPP is so key it's why Obama has engaged in a first-ever he's gone and
[34:39.100 --> 34:43.060]  addressed Capitol Hill he's gone and given speeches obviously state of the
[34:43.060 --> 34:49.660]  unions I guess six of them or seven of them now but he's never gone to actually
[34:49.660 --> 34:56.980]  twist arms not even the Obama care he's doing that with TPP today because it
[34:56.980 --> 35:05.140]  makes the presidency a dictatorship we're gonna break all that down but if I
[35:05.140 --> 35:11.020]  have to codify or or or condense crystallize why I am so concerned and
[35:11.020 --> 35:14.820]  why so many others are concerned it's that things are all moving very quickly
[35:14.820 --> 35:30.140]  right now rights that have been fought for for so long are being dissolved
[35:30.140 --> 35:43.140]  tyranny is making leaps and bounds a forward movement right now and it is
[35:43.140 --> 35:49.060]  very painful to behold it because if you understand how oppression works and
[35:49.060 --> 35:54.220]  how centralization works and how command and control works it degradates the
[35:54.220 --> 35:59.940]  individual it destroys productivity it destroys security it destroys honor it
[35:59.940 --> 36:07.380]  destroys upward mobility it is the dark ages it is bondage it is humiliation it
[36:07.380 --> 36:17.220]  is poverty it is sadness it is disgrace it is dishonor not since
[36:17.220 --> 36:23.740]  Magna Carta have we seen something as big as is happening now and of course
[36:23.740 --> 36:30.020]  this is the opposite or the inverse the upside down of Magna Carta 1215 this is
[36:30.020 --> 36:38.540]  the upside down of the inverse of 1776 this is the upside down or inverse of
[36:38.540 --> 36:44.900]  say the voting rights act this is the president becoming the front man of a
[36:44.900 --> 36:49.860]  bunch of secretive private corporations that will have total control over
[36:49.860 --> 36:55.540]  everything in the US and they're meeting in secret in the Austrian Alps right
[36:55.540 --> 37:01.900]  now and have helicopter gunships flying around with their doors open with
[37:01.900 --> 37:10.140]  federal special forces aiming machine guns at demonstrators and Rob do and
[37:10.140 --> 37:14.460]  crew marship at the top of the mountain to the military radar station that's
[37:14.460 --> 37:19.460]  right on the edge of the exclusion zone and recorded
[37:19.460 --> 37:26.980]  paramilitary cobra that's what they're called admitting they know criminals
[37:26.980 --> 37:30.900]  are inside and quote their hands are tied and this is perfect compartmentalization
[37:30.900 --> 37:36.460]  I bet you money those special forces guys are nice hardworking honorable people
[37:36.460 --> 37:41.500]  who risk their lives and who don't engage in criminal activities and here
[37:41.500 --> 37:48.700]  they are the best guard dogs you could get the best sheep dogs you could find
[37:48.700 --> 37:58.140]  guarding a bunch of wolves a bunch of nasty red-eyed mangy curves inside who
[37:58.140 --> 38:06.740]  have a long history of chewing basically baby's guts out it's this upside down
[38:06.740 --> 38:14.260]  world I mean it the place is full of known gangsters full of mega banks that
[38:14.260 --> 38:19.180]  wander money with the bank regulators of Europe and the US and England the head
[38:19.180 --> 38:23.380]  of the X checker meeting with the criminal banks they regulate I mean you
[38:23.380 --> 38:28.620]  wonder why HSBC and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan can get caught money laundering
[38:28.620 --> 38:36.300]  running grug aircraft why will covia why Wells Fargo can you wonder why they can
[38:36.300 --> 38:41.260]  fix the interest rates and they can fix the currency rates and they can fix the
[38:41.260 --> 38:46.580]  stock markets all admitted now fix the gold and silver markets all admitted
[38:46.580 --> 38:53.100]  it's all come out and they are given less than 1% fines slaps on the rest
[38:53.100 --> 38:58.300]  when whistleblowers come out and expose them then those whistleblowers get
[38:58.300 --> 39:04.300]  killed or they get fired that the Congress is having hearings on the
[39:04.300 --> 39:08.100]  Washington Post is reporting right now and then they go okay you stole
[39:08.100 --> 39:12.140]  trillions we'll give you a four billion dollar fine
[39:13.500 --> 39:19.560]  oh you laundered 378 billion dollars Wells Fargo will give you a hundred and
[39:19.560 --> 39:29.580]  eleven million dollar fine on 378 billion I'm gonna go to our reporters but
[39:29.580 --> 39:36.580]  this is crazy and I've studied the criminology of these bankers they're
[39:36.580 --> 39:41.580]  like co-resigned the head of Goldman Sachs the governor in New Jersey before
[39:41.580 --> 39:48.060]  Chris Christie who made 40 to 1 bets with other people's brokerage firms bank
[39:48.060 --> 39:51.940]  accounts of a company he'd taken over and they didn't even tell the people they
[39:51.940 --> 39:56.180]  taken it over and then they used their money to make 40 to 1 bats and then it
[39:56.180 --> 40:01.380]  took him two years to pay the money back and they kept some of it
[40:01.380 --> 40:10.900]  these people are crazy they've got US special forces and mercenaries fighting
[40:10.900 --> 40:15.860]  Russian Spitznets in eastern Ukraine right now with Samantha Powers there
[40:15.860 --> 40:21.500]  today just six hours ago giving a threatening speech to Russia on their
[40:21.500 --> 40:29.500]  doorstep it'd be like if the head Russian envoy to the UN was in
[40:29.500 --> 40:37.940]  basically Brownsville across the border threatening Texas I mean it's crazy
[40:37.940 --> 40:41.980]  she's never been in the military she doesn't know anything about geopolitics
[40:41.980 --> 40:49.380]  you can look at her and see she sees a power crazed nobody with a bunch of
[40:49.380 --> 40:56.900]  lipstick on trying to start a war with the Russians crazy town crazy town these
[40:56.900 --> 40:59.660]  people are nuts
[41:03.420 --> 41:09.340]  I mean at least Hitler knew what he was doing and got his ass kicked
[41:12.900 --> 41:18.340]  excuse me I just can't handle it anymore I study politics I study geo
[41:18.340 --> 41:22.500]  politics I interview all the top experts Nobel Prize winners in economics you
[41:22.500 --> 41:26.340]  name it you say the same thing I'm saying all the top futures are saying
[41:26.340 --> 41:32.100]  we're in deep trouble all so many former generals you name it it's not just me
[41:32.100 --> 41:37.300]  we're in a crisis with crazy people running things Congress is trying to
[41:37.300 --> 41:43.740]  make the president a dictator today this isn't some trade deal it's a takeover
[41:43.740 --> 41:48.620]  that's why you can't see it we already got three subsections that are so bad I
[41:48.620 --> 41:54.060]  can't even believe through this bold these people are drunk on hutzpah and on
[41:54.060 --> 42:00.740]  bravada they're crazy I'm gonna stop right there go to Paul Joseph Watson
[42:00.740 --> 42:03.820]  there have been so many developments they can fall about police everywhere we've
[42:03.820 --> 42:07.380]  got a recording audio recording we're gonna play of them up on top the mountain
[42:07.380 --> 42:14.460]  talking to the Cobra people we've got there's helicopters flying around with
[42:14.460 --> 42:18.980]  with with gun pods and guys hanging out the doors for like 20 members of the
[42:18.980 --> 42:24.140]  press they're rousing it at 1 a.m. London Guardian reporters and interrogating
[42:24.140 --> 42:27.860]  them for 45 minutes and then taking them outside and shining spotlights in their
[42:27.860 --> 42:32.300]  eyes and the cops even look pathetic and embarrass while they're doing it but
[42:32.300 --> 42:38.940]  they're ordered to do it I mean it's crazy and then Bilderberg publishes for
[42:38.940 --> 42:45.740]  the first time in a US newspaper a letter we have it on info wars.com going
[42:45.740 --> 42:49.500]  we're open to the public and want you to know everything we're doing thank you
[42:49.500 --> 42:54.780]  press for coming a sick psych warfare event I mean everything with them is a
[42:54.780 --> 43:00.380]  sick joke in reverse they say demons speak in reverse I guess that must be
[43:00.380 --> 43:07.740]  true let's go to Paul Joseph Watson from Austria to give us the latest
[43:07.740 --> 43:13.780]  developments Paul please tell us what's happened there at Bilderberg 2015 in the
[43:13.780 --> 43:19.020]  last 21 hours well I think this day has got to be the worst in terms of
[43:19.020 --> 43:23.500]  harassment it just seems to be getting more intense first of all our mug shots
[43:23.500 --> 43:28.460]  mine Josh and Rob do you are up in the police cabin that's at the checkpoint of
[43:28.460 --> 43:32.220]  the bottom of the hill all they have taped up to the wall a pictures of the
[43:32.220 --> 43:37.100]  passports of myself Rob do and Josh Owens and a picture of our vehicle and
[43:37.100 --> 43:42.860]  then a map of the area and that's it so why do they need that there whether
[43:42.860 --> 43:46.260]  they're you know that's the instruction to treat as better or whether it's you
[43:46.260 --> 43:50.420]  know if you get filmed at the checkpoint again arrest these people it means it
[43:50.420 --> 43:57.540]  means leave you alone go ahead so yeah we noticed that last night and I saw it
[43:57.540 --> 44:01.500]  again driving down today but I was thinking earlier the last three
[44:01.500 --> 44:05.700]  Bilderbergs that I went to this is my fourth I never got asked for ID once
[44:05.700 --> 44:10.540]  either any of those last three Bilderbergs I've been asked for ID here
[44:10.540 --> 44:16.540]  more times in this three-day period than my entire life well that's the joke
[44:16.540 --> 44:21.300]  about German culture when you go to bars in England they don't normally ask for
[44:21.300 --> 44:25.820]  ID so literally they've asked for my ID and that's not even the start of it I
[44:25.820 --> 44:29.780]  mean we we start the day by driving back to the communications truck to get a
[44:29.780 --> 44:34.660]  shot of the hotel from long distance and within about 10 minutes these police
[44:34.660 --> 44:39.140]  again walk up with side arms they came from the golf course again show us your
[44:39.140 --> 44:43.820]  papers we were there for a good 15 20 minutes at first they weren't happy with
[44:43.820 --> 44:47.660]  the the insurance documents or whatever for the rented vehicle they wanted more
[44:47.660 --> 44:52.820]  documentation on that eventually let us go there were two other individuals who
[44:52.820 --> 44:57.020]  were obviously working in that communications radio van who were
[44:57.020 --> 45:00.820]  talking to the police so we know that that's part of the you know the fake
[45:00.820 --> 45:04.220]  cell phone tower system that they've got here to suck up all the communications
[45:04.220 --> 45:08.260]  so we got through that harassment you know 10 a.m. in the morning
[45:08.260 --> 45:12.460]  let's not forget the armored vehicle driving up with machine guns I mean
[45:12.460 --> 45:16.500]  they are really what about the new stuff with these attack helicopters flying
[45:16.500 --> 45:21.500]  around and then the Bilderbergs put out this statement saying we love you they
[45:21.500 --> 45:26.660]  put out a statement saying we welcome general interest in the conference so
[45:26.660 --> 45:31.780]  their idea of welcoming general interest is to have checkpoints six miles
[45:31.780 --> 45:37.820]  away police at the top of mountains miles away harassing us you know Rob
[45:37.820 --> 45:41.060]  do probably nearly got arrested earlier today I'll tell you about that in a
[45:41.060 --> 45:46.620]  minute that is their idea of welcoming interest again completely ridiculous
[45:46.620 --> 45:51.060]  completely tyrannical so after we got through that first harassment we went
[45:51.060 --> 45:55.340]  to pick up Rob to hike up the mountain we wanted to get long-range shots of the
[45:55.340 --> 45:59.100]  roof of the hotel which we actually got before that and we caught Cobra security
[45:59.100 --> 46:02.380]  forces on camera literally taking selfies of themselves on top of the
[46:02.380 --> 46:10.260]  Bilderberg hotel so then we got about halfway before that another incident of
[46:10.260 --> 46:13.860]  harassment they put up a new map which basically says if you're caught in this
[46:13.860 --> 46:17.060]  zone with a recording device you will be IDed and put in a database it was in
[46:17.060 --> 46:19.940]  German we wanted to know what it said we found out after from a German colleague
[46:19.940 --> 46:25.220]  so Rob goes up to the police outside the Bilderberg hotel to ask them what this
[46:25.220 --> 46:29.500]  map says to get directions to where we're hiking instantly he's swarmed and
[46:29.500 --> 46:35.340]  surrounded by seven cops for one person asking directions politely and in a
[46:35.340 --> 46:39.460]  friendly way and they do this thing where they all each stand in a certain
[46:39.460 --> 46:43.380]  position around you in a circle so they're all in position to tackle you
[46:43.380 --> 46:47.460]  they do that every time so after that harassment and this is all on Twitter and
[46:47.460 --> 46:51.500]  we'll get all the videos going up some of it's already gone up so we start
[46:51.500 --> 46:55.580]  hiking up the mountain to get another long-range shot of the hotel and to go
[46:55.580 --> 47:00.180]  up to where the helicopters are taking off and the military radar station for
[47:00.180 --> 47:05.060]  the no-fly zone so we get about halfway up the mountain we meet three
[47:05.060 --> 47:09.180]  individuals from prisonplanet.pl and they were very friendly very helpful and
[47:09.180 --> 47:13.700]  it turns out we were obviously being listened to by these mountain cops
[47:13.700 --> 47:18.300]  because within probably about five minutes of us saying goodbye to those
[47:18.300 --> 47:23.180]  people we were confronted by these police officers again the fall routine
[47:23.180 --> 47:26.420]  this time they searched our bags that's the first time our bags have been
[47:26.420 --> 47:32.380]  searched one of them was pretty friendly Rob started educating him about the
[47:32.380 --> 47:36.300]  Bill of Rights and the First Amendment and the right to a free press at first
[47:36.300 --> 47:39.860]  they seemed pretty friendly we said goodbye they checked our ID again we
[47:39.860 --> 47:43.140]  started walking up the mountain by this point we were about three quarters of
[47:43.140 --> 47:46.260]  the way up the mountain the whole thing took probably about two and a half hours
[47:46.260 --> 47:52.020]  to get up there so then we realized that again we're being followed on foot by
[47:52.020 --> 47:56.260]  these police officers on a mountain that's miles and miles away from the
[47:56.260 --> 48:01.500]  Bilderberg Hotel they're following us right behind us on foot so we get to the
[48:01.500 --> 48:06.540]  top of the mountain or that small amount in to a restaurant to have lunch and the
[48:06.540 --> 48:09.820]  police more police are there waiting for us the police that were following us are
[48:09.820 --> 48:16.020]  coming in from behind so again we talked to them they actually had a dog that
[48:16.020 --> 48:19.900]  looked like a German Shepherd and in fact they had to call it off as soon as we
[48:19.900 --> 48:24.460]  got there because it was growling I think it was definitely a police dog so you
[48:24.460 --> 48:29.220]  know we order food anytime we walk around the restaurant to get shots of
[48:29.220 --> 48:34.140]  the Bilderberg Hotel or the military radar they follow us and then you know
[48:34.140 --> 48:38.060]  we're being polite the whole time Rob goes up to talk to them again being
[48:38.060 --> 48:41.420]  polite talking about how there are war criminals meeting their kiss-in-jure
[48:41.420 --> 48:46.660]  Renny Benko the Austrian property developer who just got indicted and
[48:46.660 --> 48:50.140]  they start getting aggressive or at least one of them does and he literally
[48:50.140 --> 48:56.700]  grabs Rob by the arm we've got all this on audio and video we're gonna put it
[48:56.700 --> 49:00.620]  together and he says basically says you be quiet now you be quiet go back and
[49:00.620 --> 49:04.100]  he wanted us to go back and sit down shut up so he actually grabbed Rob and
[49:04.100 --> 49:08.020]  this guy's a piece of work we have video and photos of this for TV viewers I
[49:08.020 --> 49:12.420]  mean and Rob's a big guy this guy looks even bigger than Rob and looks like he
[49:12.420 --> 49:16.620]  wanted to have a fight I mean what's wrong with these people don't they want
[49:16.620 --> 49:20.500]  the press to cover secret political meetings don't they care about their
[49:20.500 --> 49:25.980]  families why do people love to serve evil I just don't get it and to be one
[49:25.980 --> 49:31.540]  thing if they just did their job why be so mean to us well that we're just doing
[49:31.540 --> 49:35.260]  our job and they said oh you're not international press well they're on any
[49:35.260 --> 49:39.660]  international press here you know you know we are international press we have
[49:39.660 --> 49:44.420]  more viewers and readers than most major newspapers yeah and we actually hike up
[49:44.420 --> 49:49.260]  frigging mountains to try and get footage for a real news story about 120
[49:49.260 --> 49:52.500]  the most powerful people in the world there's nobody from CNN here there's
[49:52.500 --> 49:57.100]  nobody from ABC Fox News any of those that's cuz they got the order not to be
[49:57.100 --> 50:00.740]  there they don't want you there because this is the real power structure I'm
[50:00.740 --> 50:04.620]  skipping this network break to have more time this is just too important Paul
[50:04.620 --> 50:09.500]  Watson it is just mind-blowing I want to get Rob do in front of the cameras
[50:09.500 --> 50:14.300]  so make any other important points you want to make any other political
[50:14.300 --> 50:17.140]  agendas we've learned about anything else that's important and then let's get
[50:17.140 --> 50:23.460]  Rob doing from the camera well the other thing is when we left the cops and
[50:23.460 --> 50:26.540]  hiked back down the mountain as soon as we got back to the entrance of the
[50:26.540 --> 50:31.060]  hotel where there was a small protest taking place at least two cops were
[50:31.060 --> 50:40.300]  watching us intently so obviously they got some again folks if you hear Paul's
[50:40.300 --> 50:44.180]  voice speeding up and slowing down fade down if you're speeding up and
[50:44.180 --> 50:47.460]  slowing down that's not how he talks that's Skype from Austria in the
[50:47.460 --> 50:51.380]  mountains Paul I've just got to say this I want to go there though I mean I've
[50:51.380 --> 50:56.540]  been to Europe and other I love Colorado but that mountain valley vista behind

[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.740]  guarding I was so mad and so I was just explaining who they were guarding what
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.340]  the problem was and they need to stop and they need to start making the change
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.700]  and the guy got up and goes no please sit down please sit down and then he
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.100]  grabbed me on the shoulder and it started walking me over back to my table
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.420]  please sit down and I said something like oh is this the soft arm of tyranny
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.820]  and and I sat down he pointed at me and I said look I don't have any weapons and
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.660]  he goes I don't have any weapons either and there's four other cops sitting there
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.060]  with sidearms trying to intimidate us it was ridiculous by the way your skype
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.740]  just came back up it looks epic there I want to go vacation there but I wonder
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:54.500]  if it's like this all the time I mean is Austria a safe country to go to should
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.980]  there be a travel advisory put out that's not a free country well you know
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.340]  we got back down to the mountain I questioned the PIO I asked straight up
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:06.780]  is journalism illegal in Austria I straight up into his face he goes oh no
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.140]  we have no problem I said well why are we being treated like criminals I said
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:13.820]  I'm trying I'm walking up a mountain away from the exclusion zone and we're
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.260]  being checked they're photographing our passports they're checking our bags and
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.820]  he goes they're looking for paragliders we had two backpack and a little hand
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:27.340]  held ice chest there's no paragliders bro it's not the way it works so I as if
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.500]  we get any information paragliding in I mean it would be a stock to bring
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.460]  attention to Bilderberg though it's actually an interesting idea they're
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.220]  ready for that I think they would shoot somebody down if they did that and and
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.700]  get them quickly but you know and the guy tried to change the subject go up
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:47.020]  in Boston Texas it's great now look you got a you got to stop harassing
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.860]  journalists why are journalists the only people being harassed in your
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.500]  country right now why aren't you going after the criminals he goes well that's
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:56.660]  a political question a political question no it's not a political question
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:01.780]  Henry Kissinger's a criminal okay they've been told to treat you guys like
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:05.940]  crud and to intimidate you exactly that they are in the wrong doing that it's
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.940]  one thing if they've been told to go guard these criminals they do it it's
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.620]  another thing to act like a bunch of punks yeah and you know we were fed up
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.980]  we fought back we thought they were standing down I guess the mountain guard
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.980]  didn't get the memo that we don't need to be messed with anymore and they were
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.740]  really giving us the third degree and I really got pissed after he started
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.460]  searching through our backs and start telling about the First Amendment because
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:30.420]  he didn't like our he didn't like Josh's press pass well three speech oh and I
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.180]  said you know what we don't need press passes in the United States because we
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.820]  had the First Amendment and I read told him what that was and I said and we had
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.820]  the Second Amendment and we had the Third Amendment and the Fourth Amendment I got
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.940]  the number five he goes that's okay that's okay they don't want to hear
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.580]  anymore because you don't want to hear about freedom he just wants to hear how
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.580]  he's right and they're being forced to do this and I think you've got that
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.260]  audio where we're being for he said it twice at least that they're being forced
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:54.640]  to do this they have no say in the matter and now we're we've got a guest

[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.940]  when we came down the mountain there was nobody there when we went up there
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:54.940]  earlier except police and you know we're just sick and tired of the tyrannical
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:59.660]  behavior of the cops acting like we're criminals and you know I just don't know
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.100]  what else to say at this point we you know we asked him is journalism illegal
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.180]  and they couldn't give us a straight answer and the PIO is like oh no of
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.420]  course everything's fine everything's fine it's not fine you're treating
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.180]  journalists on an individual basis with it without any kind of dignity or
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.340]  respect while you're letting criminals your you're chauffeuring them in you're
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.260]  providing protection for them and and implying that you're violent but but
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:23.980]  let's get the photos I know the head of Google's been photographed there Schmidt
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:27.660]  there's a lot of key intel getting out it's all on info wars.com and
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:32.100]  president planet.com so we'll talk to you and Josh and others probably an
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.660]  overdrive today but let's get down to that checkpoint get some more HD
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:41.460]  footage and photos up on Twitter and Facebook and at info wars.com forward
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:47.380]  slash B for Bilderberg Rob anything else I just want to say I did a report up on
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:52.140]  top of the mountain and it was really a report to educate the police that were
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:56.740]  sitting there right behind Josh all armed and I did speak in broken English so
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:00.220]  when people see this report it's not because I'm retarded or anything it's
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:04.060]  because I'm trying to communicate to other humans and make them understand
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.180]  what they're really doing and what it represents by them being there and doing
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.580]  that so I do this whole kind of broken English talking hand-manned home it's
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.540]  sort of and I did it all in one take I was pretty proud of myself I talked for
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:20.540]  about four minutes non-stop and Bilderberg bad Bilderberg criminal
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:26.220]  and that I kept pointing to where the criminals were so they knew who they you
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.260]  know so maybe when they look back on it up like yeah we really were jerks we
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:34.260]  really were on the wrong side of history and maybe maybe they'll change maybe
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.660]  somebody in that because this is the thing you never know who you're gonna
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.620]  educate with these videos it's gonna be one person that we reach at some point
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.900]  who's gonna pull the lever and it's gonna start changing it's gonna be the
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:47.300]  domino that's already happening I mean each of us are little rocks turn into
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.900]  the pool and the ripples go on forever thank you so much Rob do
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:56.100]  Rob you're doing a great job Rob is so funny though because I heard it in the
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.300]  audio and it's this phenomenon where folks think if you're talking to somebody
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:03.980]  from a different language that if you talk like baby talk to them or kind of
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.540]  put on their accent that they then understand it and people do it maybe
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:13.380]  they're right maybe I'm wrong I just talked to somebody like I talk but I got
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:17.540]  so many friends and family that will if they're talking to an Asian person who's
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.820]  lived in America their whole life probably third generation they'll go
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:25.580]  hello they almost go ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding and it just
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:29.420]  and so I guess with like Germans or Austrian should be like I know the
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:35.900]  funeral I invoke I'm right do you understand that but amazing HD
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:41.460]  footage that we're showing right now the Skype is just incredibly clear that is
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:45.940]  amazing that is so beautiful even prettier than places I've seen in
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:51.780]  Colorado wow okay shifting gears ladies and gentlemen from Bilderberg 2015 to
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.780]  what their agenda is they've got a private agenda that's draconian but
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:01.980]  their public agenda is draconian as well Martin Armstrong began his studies
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.740]  into market behavior and when he first became fascinated by events during the
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:11.340]  crash of 66 working through the period exposed him to the real world compared
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.780]  to the theories offered in school he became one of the very first to begin
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:19.460]  forecasting currencies he began creating a global model in the mid-70s and was
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.460]  published the results in 72 and 85 Armstrong was certainly one of the top
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:28.340]  premier foreign exchange animals in the world and 86 Armstrong published the
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:33.300]  greatest bull market in history this was the first study ever written that put
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:36.100]  the entire world events together demonstrating the Great Depression of
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.540]  the 30s was a global capital flow problem set in motion largely by sovereign
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:44.500]  debt issues that led to a massive capital flight into the dollar that created
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.900]  a total wave of deflation Armstrong's work has become world-renowned the model
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:54.700]  has successfully pinpointed not merely major specific days when events will be
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:58.540]  in advance but it has provided one of the most consistent guides for
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.380]  understanding the turning points in the global economy and thus the business
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:07.420]  cycle not merely within a domestic economy but within the global economy on
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:12.420]  the collective basis Armstrong economics dot com thank you so much for coming on
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:17.700]  the broadcast today and I'd like to launch in your overall view on the
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.180]  economy worldwide and then get into this amazing article the secret meeting in
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:27.260]  London to end cash you put this out on the 23rd and then now a few weeks later
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.540]  a week and a half later two weeks later we have intel from inside Bilderberg
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:36.180]  that that's that's exactly what they're pushing but also the heads of the major
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.780]  private banks all seem to be pushing this as well right now just want to
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.260]  discover what you think's behind that thanks for coming on
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:47.620]  oh thank you for inviting me you bet so so the big picture
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:55.780]  effectively after they they did the the big bailout with 700 billion writing
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:17:01.300]  checks to the government and to the banks they really have have comes to
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:07.660]  realization they cannot do that again so the problem really has stemmed from
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:15.020]  a structural design in Europe which is is absolutely fatal and when they were
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:22.500]  going to create the euro you know I can say publicly I mean they came to us they
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:27.820]  even took the entire back row of our our conference the Commission was there you
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:34.460]  know for two days met with them and this is back in 97 and I told them you know
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:40.180]  if you're going to try and create a you know a new currency there has to be a
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:46.100]  single debt now they understood that but what they told me then was that they
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.660]  didn't feel that they could get the European population to vote for that
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:53.900]  it would be perceived as a bailout so they just want to do the currency first
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:59.500]  and then when those people leave the next crew that comes in they never heard
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:06.180]  a face to and so the structural difference why it's so bad in Europe is
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:11.740]  that each bank for its reserves had to be politically correct so they had a
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:17.260]  piece of everybody's debt and that would be like our banking system if it was
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:23.660]  backed by debt of every individual state I mean if we at Louisiana goes down or
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.780]  California then everybody's gonna be rushing to say oh which bank has the
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:32.620]  most of that and that's what's going on in Europe now instead of correcting the
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:40.620]  problem you have too many jobs now in Brussels dependent upon the euro so
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:45.020]  they're going to defend it to the absolute last you know breath of the
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:52.420]  private sector and so that's where the real drive to move to electronic
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:57.580]  currency is all about and they see it as preventing you from running to the bank
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:04.780]  and taking your money out so they're it eliminates a bank run and that's their
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:11.460]  main purpose in Europe so secondly is they want to collect absolutely every
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:18.220]  you know penny they think you owe in taxes so it's getting to be really
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:23.740]  crazy I mean you're not gonna with these people they want to basically take it to
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.860]  the point where you cannot buy or sell anything without approval of the
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:33.100]  government and so bottom line in layman's terms and again a major
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.940]  documentary feature hit film was made about your predictions coming true that
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:43.940]  was released last year has a 7.9 ratings very high on IMDB the forecaster we can
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:50.380]  put the IMDB screen up there for TV viewers of the forecaster it's a
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:54.580]  documentary about you and so it's really scary here's the money of your
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:20:00.300]  prominence mr. Armstrong saying what so many of us have seen the signs of because
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:04.180]  you know a lot of these people you're on the inside we see them pushing it now
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:10.100]  openly and saying we want to get rid of cash so you have to keep your money in
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:14.420]  the bank so we can basically bail in and take whatever we want that is
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:21.140]  frightening and we see Greece as a microcosm no amount of money ever paid
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.140]  into this will prop it up I mean is that what you're saying nothing will keep
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:31.140]  empty dump together no I mean absolutely every government in the world is
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:38.980]  following the same exact system and they just borrow year after year and they
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:45.100]  never pay anything off and when I had met with them I met with US Treasury
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:50.180]  during the Reagan period and the national debt was a trillion and that's
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.820]  when Volcker raised interest rates you know up to you know they were going up
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:59.700]  to 17% and I'm looking at this and saying my god just put it into a calculator
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.780]  the national debt's gonna be at 6 trillion by the end of the decade and I
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:08.100]  met with them and I said you know I thought well maybe you don't see this or
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.740]  what's you know what's going on here you're crazy with this stuff and they
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:16.380]  said yeah but Marty will be paying back with you for dollars and says okay you
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:21.700]  know you guys know what you're doing and it everything is it's all can and
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:30.740]  pony show I guess what made me so famous was when I got called in for the
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:35.780]  formation of G5 and I you know I first thought I made it you know I was one of
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:41.140]  35 people in the world being consulted and and then you you get there and it's
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:45.020]  like okay how do we save the world economy oh sorry your 15 minutes is up
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:49.780]  next and then they stand up and they say this is what we're gonna do and we've
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:53.700]  consulted the top experts and they do nothing that anybody ever told them to
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:22:01.860]  do so it's really a dog and pony show and this whole thing is about really
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:07.300]  their power and retaining it that's it well we see this not just in economics
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.980]  and not just banking but in every major sector now with the EU and the US
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:17.580]  government and others they call in the experts the top people ignore everything
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:21.500]  they say but then say we've talked to the experts it's like the Delphi
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:26.100]  technique where they'll say agenda 21 which is global regulations at the local
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:31.620]  level they'll call everyone in say thank you we've heard what you want and then
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:35.900]  they'll do basically the opposite of what the people want but then claim they
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:41.340]  did what they said like you said it's a dog and pony show I guess to pacify
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:46.540]  economists or them and at all crashes say well we consulted them when the
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:54.020]  economists actually told them different well in 85 after I went through this you
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:58.140]  know I got you know I said the hell with this and I wrote a letter you know
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:02.140]  directly to the White House and I said you people are crazy you're going to
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:07.500]  cause a crash within two years and our biggest problem is those in government
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:15.500]  honestly are lawyers all right with no practical experience and they think that
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:20.500]  they just only have to do is write a law and then you have to do it it's not a
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:25.380]  question of how does things function it's well we'll just make it do with this
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:33.780]  and so in 85 flowing the g5 the dollar was up dramatically at that point did the
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:40.700]  Deutsch mark was like four to the dollar and they basically just stood up and said
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:44.340]  okay fine we're going to you know we want to see the dollar 40 percent lower
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:51.780]  and that was the 87 crash and because I went public and warned when they were
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:56.500]  going to create this crash if they do this I mean a common sense you sold the
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:01.340]  Japanese you know everything from Rockefeller Center on down and they
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:04.900]  owned like more than a third of the US national debt now you stand up you say
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:10.940]  you're going to devalue it by 40% don't you think they would sell there's no
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:15.380]  rational discussion with these people and so they just started selling and
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:22.460]  that was your 87 crash when I got called in for that I didn't want to go in at
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:27.340]  all and they started lobbying my friends and they said oh you know Marty you got
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:31.380]  to do this I said you haven't had to deal with these people I said I you know
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:36.340]  it's a waste of time so they called so many of my friends and they said look
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:40.300]  that there's blaming computers if you don't go in and do this they're going
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:45.260]  to come take our computers away so I went in and honestly the first thing
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:49.020]  they say well we're going to find the person that that you know shorted this
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:54.740]  market and made it go down and I just said look every investigation since 1907
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:59.180]  began that way you never found anybody I said that's not what makes markets there
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:03.540]  isn't a cow that kicked over the can and burned down st. Louis no I mean it's just
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:09.580]  what happens is is that you everybody's long and then for whatever reason
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:15.780]  something scares them and they tried it to basically sell and there's no bid
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:21.740]  that's a flash crash it market just immediately collapses and it's not that
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:27.100]  somebody comes in and short and sells overpowers the market and you know that's
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.300]  a nice theory but it's never happened it's just that the majority are long and
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.740]  they're trying to sell and there's no bid so let's expand on that then and then
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:39.060]  we can go back in time it's important obviously to do that but looking at
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:42.900]  current things how ominous is it let's talk about the secret meeting in London
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:47.620]  to end cash and along with that now is this huge push in the media to get rid
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:54.300]  of cash that's a bold move but but again let's talk about why they would want to
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:59.300]  do that a but then be about the secret meeting well that's how they they pulled
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:06.740]  this off the media is part of the tool and it was Larry Summers who first came
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:13.220]  out and said gee interest rates should go negative now he wasn't in the
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:18.500]  administration it was just a Harvard so what happens is they can if the market
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:24.780]  rejects it they can say oh that's just him talking if it accepts it all right
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:30.180]  they're right behind it so this is how politics really works so what you're
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:35.060]  seeing right now is the media coming out yeah yeah yeah we should get rid of cash
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:40.900]  you know and that is is the balloon they're floating to get that yes
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:46.420]  everybody they're trying to get everybody accustomed to it and largely so
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:51.740]  that they can just it's in the US they want taxes my sister just went to go
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:57.620]  buy a house all right to get a mortgage and my mother had written her a check
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:03.740]  for $400 reimbursing her for some medicine as she picked up and because
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:09.540]  that was in her account she had to explain what the $400 was why it was
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:16.100]  given to her right I mean $400 I mean it is you have to give details to every
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:21.780]  dime you have and where it came from they're training us to live in a 1984
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:27.740]  economic society and they admit so they have total control it's absolute total
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:35.140]  control and it is scary because I was just over in Europe in Spain they have
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:41.020]  basically shut down all the retail gold coin sellers you can sell your gold but
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:45.380]  you can't find bullion coins to buy not even the bank sell them any more you can
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:51.380]  in Italy and you can in Germany France they've been shutting it down and also
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:57.420]  over in Spain so it they're trying it to kill any potential underground economy
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:04.900]  as well and it's it's very interesting but that's the direction they want to go
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:09.540]  in they they never see themselves as the problem you're the problem and they
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:15.980]  believe that they can prop up the euro and all these big systems by bringing in
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:22.340]  economics of Talitarianism won't that just stall economies even more the
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:28.780]  economy what the reason I've been pretty much so vocal being coming from the
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:37.020]  professional side liquidity is is absolutely evaporating and it is scary
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:42.900]  because that means when this thing turns down after October and government
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:47.980]  bonds etc you're going to see a massive I mean collapse massive because there's
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:55.460]  no bid the gun and it's really capital is scared to death everywhere and they've
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:59.940]  been selling the longer term paper a 10 year bonds etc the buns of crash and
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:07.780]  they're moving everything into like 30 day to six month paper max and because
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:12.220]  nobody knows what's going on we've got to go to break I should have brought up
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:16.940]  your articles about coming crash first just always to do interviews this way
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.740]  where the bombshell stuff comes at the end I want to come back and try to give

[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:28.780]  Alex Jones I talked to Greg Palastin others who have interviewed some of the
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:31.980]  top people who admittedly were involved in the founding of the euro and they
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:36.660]  bragged it was meant to consolidate and economically implode and basically turn
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:40.500]  nation states into vassals the issue though is they allowed the countries to
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:45.220]  continue to create their own debt and so as this economist was telling us
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:49.660]  respected economists it's now infected the whole thing and the greed and the
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:54.300]  fractional reserve banking going to the next level of derivatives and credit
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:34:00.500]  default swaps it's now makes Bernie Madoff look like a saint in my opinion and
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:04.820]  then the guy was obviously a crook this is crazy and I've talked to so many
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.900]  economists top economists and they say it's impossible it's untenable even
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:13.540]  people like dr. Paul Greg Roberts who was in you know there as Reagan's chief
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:19.140]  economist so we're looking at an explosive situation coming up in about
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:23.100]  10 minutes I'm gonna play the trailer it came out last year was a big hit for the
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:28.500]  forecaster to get an idea of what Mr. Armstrong is basically breaking down
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:35.020]  Armstrong economics.com Martin Armstrong so so try to condense it all
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:38.820]  because I've been asking questions I've been interrupting all of it together the
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:44.420]  war on cash the consolidation looks like we're going to a feudal system where
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:48.940]  everything we do is categorized tracked and they believe through a command and
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:54.980]  control economy they can basically prop up anything which is clearly impossible I
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:59.980]  can figure that out with a calculator and then you talk about a crash coming
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:04.820]  after October can you try to boil down why when and what it's going to look
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:14.540]  like. Each one of these business cycles it's basically a mapping it out and
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:19.140]  it's roughly an 8.6 year cycle and you can go to our site even Paul Volcker
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:25.100]  wrote a book in 1978 and was called rediscovery the business cycle meaning
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:30.180]  that the the new era of new economics the government could absolutely flatline
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:37.820]  it and create perpetual growth failed and so what this is is that each one the
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:43.540]  timing remains the same but what is actually the focus shifts from one to
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:48.620]  the other so one time you're going to have it stock market then you're going
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:52.660]  to have a commodity market then you're going to have real estate that this
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:36:00.980]  particular one which turns in on October 1st is a concentration of capital in
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:07.620]  government debt so you can see it from the standpoint that interest rates are
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:14.580]  historically low you know at negative levels so just ask yourself traditionally
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:18.540]  you know when the capital is concentrated in the private sector like a
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:23.460]  stock market it crashes the bonds go up because that's where everybody rushes
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:29.540]  to for the we call it a flight to capital or quality so what happens when the
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:36.900]  problem is in government that's when the private sector takes off and so we're
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:42.460]  most likely going to see an initial you know false reaction and like the share
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:48.220]  markets down but they will be the buying opportunity because what's crashing at
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:53.100]  this stage in a game is government debt I mean just look at Illinois I mean
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:59.900]  Chicago is a basket case you have more than 50% of municipal governments in the
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:05.300]  United States bankrupt you have the same problem in Germany and Germans are
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:10.380]  looking at adding another 15% tax to bail out to municipal and so it's
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:15.580]  everybody's on a bailout mode it's just the system doesn't work it was never
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:24.060]  designed properly and so what we have is really a meltdown and it's on the
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:27.900]  governmental side so normally you say crash everybody thinks you're talking
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:33.620]  about the stock market this time it's bonds okay and the reason is much more
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:40.420]  serious is that you can take the stock market down 90% there isn't that much
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:45.580]  money that resides in the stock market to make that kind of a great depression
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:51.220]  and what it was and I can recommend to your readers go to Herbert Hoover's
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:57.020]  memoirs they're free when the internet is library read 1931 it's exactly what
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:05.380]  began in 2010 and all the historical books The Great Trash crashed by Galbraith
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:10.860]  they all of them were socialists so they omitted the fact that all
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:16.460]  governments defaulted it's been omitted from the history books all of 1931 you
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:20.940]  have Europe defaulted Britain went into a moratorium came out South America
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:25.180]  defaulted China defaulted you can go to eBay and buy some of these bonds if you
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:30.980]  like they may make very nice attractive things to hang on the wall but we are
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:34.980]  back at a sovereign debt crisis and that's what this is really about so the
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.340]  bond market is going to crash and you're going to see the stock markets and
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:45.860]  private assets rise so sure well I mean Zimbabwe $2 trillion notes are also
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:49.860]  good to hang on the wall ones hanging in my office are you saying defaults the
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:55.980]  only answer or it's the answer because it's coming either way it's basically I
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:39:02.060]  believe what you're going to end up with is some sort of a new summit probably
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:07.260]  after 2017 and they're going to have to do something with the world
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:11.820]  monetary system so another type of you know Brentwood's conference because
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:18.420]  everything is just falling apart and it's not going to be sustainable you
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:22.460]  cannot continue to borrow year after year and have no intention of paying back
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:31.260]  and what you have to understand is when the gold standard failed in 1971 it
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:37.740]  altered many things so all your economic numbers are kind of bogus if money was
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:42.220]  fixed you don't actually have the number of people standing at the docks
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:47.940]  counting how many Mercedes were coming in from Germany instead they just looked
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.340]  at them the amount of money if you get sent more to Germany than you must have
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:55.140]  bought more warmer cities but when you went to a floating exchange rate the
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:01.140]  currency can move 20% up down and whatever the cap you can't measure trade
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:04.860]  by flows of capital anymore obviously there's so much I mean things have been
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.620]  fixed in certain areas for a long time but this is a layperson studying it with
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:13.180]  LIBOR coming out and the fines being paid in the billions for fixing the
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:17.460]  currency exchanges and you know so much manipulation on the stock market
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:23.300]  is the manipulation getting worse or is it more sophisticated or in your view do
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:27.780]  we just know more about it today we just know more about it today I mean it's
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:36.060]  it's always been there manipulation that they do has been around throughout all
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:42.420]  my career I mean largely what they did to me was because as a journalist I was
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:47.900]  reporting of all the manipulations I didn't say who it was but I had reams of
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:53.780]  stacks of tapes of every conversation with trading desk who was behind what
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:41:00.020]  was going on the court demanded all that be turned over to Alan Cohen Alan
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:04.340]  Cohen was the court receiver all of them were suddenly destroyed in the World
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:08.740]  Trade Center and Alan Cohen becomes a board member of Goldman Sachs so you
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:12.880]  know what you want me to say and when he's working for Goldman Sachs he's
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.660]  still working for the courts simultaneously which is totally a
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:20.820]  conflict of interest but they do they do whatever they need to do and but this
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:25.580]  stuff has been going on for a long time they cannot manipulate the trend they
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:30.460]  can manipulate markets within the trend but they can actually take a bear market
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:33.460]  make it a bear market and they don't care if things are untenable because
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.780]  they're making so much money because they get to rig the system and make
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:43.340]  profits and then pass us on all the toxic problems that come along with that
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:47.220]  and then you see the war on lemonade stands the war on underground economies
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:53.220]  the war on Amish selling cheese the war on kids 11 year olds being in their own
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:57.100]  backyards we see this police state forming not just here but in Europe and
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:01.660]  even Forbes said no they're getting us ready for a casual society they don't
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:07.260]  want us to be able to basically survive during the the collapse they want to make
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:11.220]  us go under their social engineering I don't think they're gonna reform it I
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:15.820]  think they're going to use this crisis to bring themselves into an even greater
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:23.940]  level of power Martin Armstrong what do you think look absolutely this is you
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:28.980]  know politics I've worked with these people you know I you know for a long
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:35.540]  time and something has changed I was personal friends with Margaret Thatcher
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:40.260]  I mean these were back then they were people that actually cared but you know
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:43.820]  one thing about that Thatcher you can agree with her or disagree with her you
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.580]  least you knew where she stood and today you don't know who where anybody
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:53.380]  stands they just move back and forth they lie all the time but so nobody of
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:57.340]  substance is really willing to step up so we've lost a moral compass we're in
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:02.540]  La La land that sounds like it's just megalomaniac I'm sorry go ahead yeah it
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:07.420]  is it's I mean you look at what they're doing with it you know Obama once
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:12.900]  basically dictatorial powers over trade that's it Congress to surrender
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:18.060]  everything I mean we're living in more of a dictatorship than we are and it's
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:22.860]  not democracy democracy has a means that you should have the right to vote on
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:29.540]  everything okay but we live in a republic and a republic is basically an
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:36.500]  oligarchy so that's the you know that's the substantial difference and we're
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:42.260]  moving more towards a position between oligarchy and dictatorship practically
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:47.940]  it's not just Obama and if you look carefully and closely you'll see a lot
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:54.100]  of the people there there are the same people under Bush the underbelly doesn't
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:44:05.460]  change just the heads change and largely it's I mean I can tell you this I in the
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:10.420]  90s Republicans used to have me go meet people who were going to run for
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:16.420]  president or wanted to I met flew out met with the governor of Oklahoma etc and
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:22.100]  it was really me supposed to be vetting them out and when they would tell them I
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:26.900]  was there to explain the world economy but when I got back what do you think you
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:32.300]  think he can handle the job blah blah blah then I got a phone call about George
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:36.620]  Bush Jr. they said we want you to go down to Texas to take and to meet with Bush I
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:41.900]  said okay fine and they said but this time it's different I said which what do
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:46.900]  you mean it's different they said no he's really stupid and I said what I mean I
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:51.500]  couldn't believe they even use that word and I said why would you make somebody
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:56.940]  president who is stupid and they say well he's got the name and then I was
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:02.020]  actually offered if I would be the chief economist in the White House and I said
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:05.940]  you got to be kidding I'm uninterested I got a business I'm running here do what
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:13.340]  to give that up for to work for two years I mean no way and they said they
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:19.460]  needed people that were qualified to surround him now you look at Obama it's
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:24.900]  exact same pattern he doesn't attend more than 60% of his daily briefing he's
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:28.140]  on vacation five months out of the year he plays golf the rest of time and watch
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:34.340]  your sports center it's the same thing the people under in the underbelly once
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:39.700]  they got the taste of power as they did under Bush Jr. they wanted another
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:45.100]  figurehead and that's Obama so oh absolutely effect I'm glad you're
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:48.660]  bringing this up because you're kind of quantifying something I've noticed it's
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:54.860]  almost like a dictatorship of the power behind the throne and the political
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:46:01.380]  class is really now shopping for total puppets because it's true used to we had
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:05.340]  corruption and problems but overall folks wanted prosperity wanted basic
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:08.940]  freedom didn't want to wreck the country now it's a bunch of crazed
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:15.180]  political hacks who now give themselves TV shows on CNN MSNBC and
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:18.780]  everywhere it doesn't matter if they kill the ratings no one wants to look at
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:23.580]  them they don't have any good information but their ego maniacs they're now on
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:32.060]  air it's really scary it is it's a sad state of affairs and I mean even with my
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:40.740]  movie it's been you know a blockbuster everywhere outside the country it made
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:47.980]  the nightly news in Germany I was handed flowers in Dresden I mean it was just
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:52.260]  amazing yet it's not being shown in where United States where's the other
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:56.500]  country Switzerland but it's being considered to be shown in Moscow by the
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:02.300]  Kremlin and also in China but so we talk about oh North Korea was blocking a
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:06.100]  film while the United States does the same thing well they've always had
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:10.700]  political pundits on the news but now it's almost all that's there spewing
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:15.900]  doubles speak I mean Gibbs got on MSNBC admitted he was told to say there was no
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.380]  drone program when it was public for years and it's like denying that the
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:24.460]  Atlantic Ocean exists speaking of your film which is a blockbuster around the
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:29.260]  world has very very high ratings really breaks it all down here is the
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:33.140]  forecaster of the film about this gentleman which is now available on
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:41.900]  blu-ray and DVD here it is it starts in August of 1999 Yeltsin is going to run
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:48.380]  for election in 2000 to get Yeltsin to take seven billion dollars from the IMF
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:56.620]  loans now they threaten Yeltsin you're not going to run for election in 2000
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:00.140]  otherwise all this is going to come out the East old same billion dollars from
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:17.300]  the IMF this is how Putin gets in we all know something is wrong the reason we
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:22.180]  have this crisis is because since World War two they basically borrow year after
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:26.660]  year he didn't want to go to college he father said you gotta do something so he
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:31.900]  enrolled him at the RCA computer store I thought I could create a system that
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:36.220]  stores the knowledge of century to predict the future the entire trading
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:41.600]  community would scramble to see signals as soon as they were released he
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:47.420]  predicted the top in the Nikai index universal Bank of Lebanon listen could
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:51.500]  you make a model and computer says your country's is going to completely fall
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:57.100]  apart in a day obviously that prediction was correct they realized that the model
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:49:03.140]  should forecast the rise or fall of a nation they wanted that source code which
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:12.660]  is text we want the source code I said not getting it sorry the government came
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:16.940]  in they shut down everything seized all the accounts I had friends they said we
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:21.780]  put up the money in cash tonight he's held with the worst of the worst he
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:28.580]  wasn't backing down and didn't seem like they were either and he said to his mom
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:35.180]  they want what I've spent my entire life developing and I'm not giving it to them
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:46.260]  before caster and of course I tend to do things backwards on radio I won't plug
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:50.500]  something's coming up I'll just cover it right then at that point or I will
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:54.780]  introduce somebody and not get to the meat of how they've been persecuted and
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:58.580]  basically attack we should have Martin Armstrong back on in the future for a
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:02.620]  whole hour to talk about the film itself and the things he went through I've seen
[01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:07.460]  a replay of this over and over again and of course you mentioned 9-11 and then
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:14.220]  your research and evidence of fraud in the system being destroyed there clearly
[01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:19.020]  though we're moving into a more totalitarian system right now smart
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.980]  elites don't want a totalitarian system because they know it tends to destroy
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:26.420]  them I think we've got a bunch of reckless people in control now who aren't
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:29.500]  as smart as they think we're going to break with the final segment Martin we
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:33.140]  come back I want to ask you do you agree with that statement what do you say

[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:07.300]  try to break that down and see exactly what's unfolding there Bown says that's
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:12.860]  the numbers he's got I'm confused by that we're gonna assess that that's a big
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:18.900]  deal though we'll continue to track it going back to our guest Martin Armstrong
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:26.020]  Armstrong economics is the elite getting more corrupt have they chosen to
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:30.620]  talitarianism or what has changed
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:40.100]  well not so much the private elite as it is just those in government and there
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:47.620]  is a significant difference I think the the banks have gone simply too far and
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:57.340]  the real problem that has unfolded is when that when Robert Rubin of Goldman
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:03.460]  Sachs moved to get rid of Glass seagull the reason he wanted to do that was that
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:08.620]  they make more money trading than they do lending so whereas before it was more
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:15.020]  fractional banking you can see the Fed has created excess reserves there's over
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:18.380]  two and a half trillion dollars sitting there by the banks they're not lending
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:22.660]  what they are doing is why you know they're just trading and that's where
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:27.860]  this manipulation markets and stuff is coming from because why would you you
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:32.580]  know lend money for 15 years and and hope everything works out okay with the
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:36.580]  guy when you can just trade and manipulate you know I were back and
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:42.380]  forth and just make a fortune you don't have the the risk so what they did they
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:49.420]  sold that idea to to Congress that's how they repealed it they said if they
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:55.540]  would just lend money like the you know the CDOs etc but then they would resell
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:59.980]  it so therefore if the people failed hey it's not on the bank that would make
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:06.180]  the bank stronger the theory is it sounded good they repeal Glass seagull
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:13.740]  with that however they blew up with trading and that's the problem so you
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:18.660]  know if if it were just fractional banking it the economy wouldn't be as
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:25.740]  desperate as it is today because if you physically lend money to you know create
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:30.500]  a small business etc you're creating jobs when you're just taking the same
[01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:33.180]  amount of money and you're just manipulating live where you're not
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:37.380]  doing anything so you're putting money in your pocket but you're not helping the
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:44.660]  economy so at this point in in time that politicians are in a a mode just trying
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:51.060]  to to retain power and yes they're not interested really in bailing out the
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:56.500]  banks they they've just allowed the banks at this point to be bail in but they
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:02.260]  realize that they're going to lose power unless they shut down cash they
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:05.900]  this is their view sure mr. Armstrong I know you probably got to go we have a
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:09.980]  72nd break if you can hold over like to give you a few minutes to finish up and
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:14.460]  also talk a bit about the film can you do that sure all right great it is
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:18.460]  confirmed they were voting on another section another one of the trade authorities
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:22.980]  there's the TAA and the TPA the major Obama back trade bill has failed in the
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:29.340]  house this is super news this shows America is still has a pulse and is
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:35.180]  struggling for its life thank God we'll be right back stay with us
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:43.380]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today

[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:57.420]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[01:58:57.420 --> 01:59:02.100]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:06.820]  30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:12.500]  get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms.com own and run by a bunch of
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:16.380]  former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans their patriots their
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:20.180]  listeners of the radio show and they want to support the broadcast it's always

[01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:46.340]  firearm today the spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms HD firearms.com
[01:59:46.340 --> 02:00:04.820]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:08.660]  all right I'm cutting the intro out this news is so important Martin Armstrong's
[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:11.740]  our guest can't wait to have him back up for a full hour just talk about his
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:19.580]  amazing experiences and the film about him the forecaster but the TPA Obama back
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:23.700]  trade bill has failed in the house but they'll try to bring it back and there's
[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:26.620]  other trade bills that are connected to it they're trying to ram through right
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:30.940]  now they're voting on those right now but I actually started getting tears in my
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:38.140]  eyes of joy to to hear this and they may try to ram it through again if they
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:41.380]  try to ram it through we'll fight it if they do ram it through we'll fight to
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:45.780]  stop its implementation but house Democrats delivered a stinging defeat
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:51.180]  to Obama's trade agenda see that's where the Democrats are good when a vast
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:55.060]  majority voted to derail legislation designed to help him advance a sweeping
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:59.860]  deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations that's because it's not that it just gives him
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:03.820]  dictatorial power and a bunch of foreign corporations that is super news John
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:09.100]  Bown has been remote today watching the whole thing he's gonna call in the next
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:12.580]  segment then John Rappaport joins us we have video Skype with more on
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:17.540]  Bilderberg land macaroos coming in but Martin Armstrong how positive of the
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:23.940]  news is this that that the Democrats bucked Obama and even teaming up with a
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:28.420]  slimy Republican leadership I mean to see Democrats teamed up with the Tea
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:35.500]  Party that's the stuff that could save this country yes I mean our computer has
[02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:43.100]  actually does political forecasting and you can we've been forecasting honestly
[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:48.740]  for the last two decades the 2016 would be the first shot at a third party
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:55.420]  rising and I think that that you're gonna see you know that is kind of turning
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:01:59.780]  into like a civil war in the Republican Party you have the you know the Tea Party
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:04.900]  etc but typically that was split and what I would really like to see would be
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:10.780]  maybe Rand Paul at least head comes sort of a third party and get out of the
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:17.540]  Republicans you mean might not feel that way just yet but you can't become the
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:22.540]  the party candidate Democrat or Republican we're not kissing a lot of
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:32.700]  ass to get there I tell you it just makes me shake my head to see the
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:37.380]  situation we're in what what are some of the other predictions that you with
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:40.580]  your research but also with your algorithms that you think we're going
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:50.420]  to see unfolding basically what we've done is we have taken everything and the
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:54.980]  computer correlates the entire world and when you put it that way and you
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:03:00.260]  forget the politics and the bias and the personal views it's very interesting
[02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:07.460]  and what you come up with is that you see as I say that we don't go to war as
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:12.060]  long as everybody's fat and happy you turn the economy down that's when you
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:17.180]  get civil unrest and war and what the computers doing this time is that it we
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:23.460]  track both civil unrest which was you know will rise to a revolutionary level
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:29.620]  and we track international war and this particular cycle turned up and both of
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:35.940]  them in 2014 and it doesn't peak out on the international war side until about
[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:43.260]  2017 but you're starting to see separatist movements everywhere I mean in
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:48.100]  Europe it was amazing I was just over in Barcelona they want to you know leave
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:53.860]  Spain Scotland's trying to get away from English from England it's virtually
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:04:00.180]  everywhere and this is what is caused by the mismanagement of the economy by
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:08.180]  governments across the globe so honestly this is the peak in government and
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:14.100]  unfortunately over the next four years which you're going to see is government
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:18.860]  become even more aggressive they're not just going to simply lay down their
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:24.700]  guns and say oh okay fine sorry we were wrong they will fight and scream until
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:30.140]  you know the last dying breath it's gonna be like Hitler in the bunker it
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:37.740]  pretty much I mean even if you look at how did Hitler come to power it same
[02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:41.420]  type of economic crisis Martin Armstrong promise you'll come back very
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:46.380]  soon yes of course it was very good thank you so much Armstrong economics
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:49.620]  dot com folks you see your film the forecaster thank you so much for looking
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:55.780]  forward to speaking to you many times in the future amazing interview the secret
[02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:59.380]  Bilderberg meeting might not be worthy of news coverage from the corporate media
[02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:03.140]  but it's certainly getting attention from the police military and intelligence
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:07.260]  services you've seen our reporters being harassed at checkpoints all week well
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:11.540]  now an exclusion zone has been secured around the entire interalpine hotel
[02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:15.860]  grounds trespassers face two weeks imprisonment and a hefty fine a 30
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:20.740]  mile no-fly zone extends to drones planes paragliders even hang gliders the
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:25.540]  ban also extends to video and audio recordings made within and around the
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:29.700]  area apparently Bilderberg is so afraid of media coverage that police
[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:34.260]  checkpoints miles away from the hotel aren't enough now info wars reporters
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:38.740]  on the ground say that Bilderberg has deployed a high-tech jamming system to
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:43.060]  shut down communications around the site this will effectively strangle media
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:48.180]  coverage of the event ensuring that over 130 heads of finance government and the
[02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:52.980]  corporate world are able to meet in total secrecy visit info wars dot com for
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:56.980]  breaking Bilderberg coverage ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:06:00.940]  firearms manufacturers and sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly
[02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:05.020]  news or the news website info wars dot com because the companies I've been
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:09.500]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:14.580]  they should be so I refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years

[02:07:55.620 --> 02:08:03.020]  from his central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the information
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:11.100]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network now there's the TAA and
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:16.980]  the TPA trade promotion authority and other systems but the big chunk has been
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:20.340]  voted down in the house it was voted again a few weeks ago out of the Senate
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:24.300]  they killed debate on it they wouldn't release the subsections but mounting
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:29.380]  pressure a large portion of Democrats joining Tea Party Republicans led by
[02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:36.380]  Senator Sessions and others exposing it and Rand Paul exposing it Ted Cruz's
[02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:43.980]  detriment supported it he went way down to my view doing that but it has failed
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:48.340]  in the house that is just super news Obama back trade bill fails in the house
[02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:52.380]  we have the article from the Washington Post linked up on info wars dot com and
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:57.940]  prison planet calm and this is a victory for those of us that don't want to live
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:03.260]  in a dictatorship because it would pass dictatorial power to a great great
[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:08.580]  extent to the president and that's what the globalist one but we have all this
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:13.260]  Bilderberg news coming out as well respect to John Bown our reporter who's
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:18.180]  been monitoring the C-span vote shutting down debate all of it and then for about
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:23.260]  three minutes them are going to go to John Rappaport and get into Bilderberg
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:28.260]  because he's been focusing in on that intensely investigative journalist John
[02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:35.620]  Rappaport it is just such an amazing time to be alive in history right now so
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:38.780]  many good things are happening so many bad things are happening but you can see
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:43.900]  time is running out for the shadow government corporate system people are
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:49.620]  aware more and more sure you may have the mass of people watching ESPN all day
[02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:53.060]  and sucking their thumbs and you know tuning into the Kardashians the latest
[02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:57.860]  sex change but the people that work the people that have families the people
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:05.580]  that run businesses the people that are smart the vast majority of them aren't
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:09.820]  on the globalist payroll and they don't have a death wish they don't want to live
[02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:14.380]  in mind-control land they don't want to live in a version of 1984 meets Alice
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:22.500]  in Wonderland meets Brave New World and they are absolutely getting upset and
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:27.460]  realizing what's happening John Bown I tell you I just got a tear of joy when
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:31.820]  I saw the house shoot this down the problem is they're gonna probably try to
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:35.820]  implement it by fiat now like they've done so many other things but we'll fight
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:41.220]  that just like Obama has been blocked by courts on his open borders so so we're
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:46.500]  fighting back John Bown what did you witness well it's all going on live
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:51.660]  right now can you hear me okay yes I can John good alright so peak sessions
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:11:00.220]  Republican of Texas was arguing that Paul Ryan was being deceptive the Paul
[02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:04.900]  Ryan being the houseways and means committee chairman and what Jeff's what
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:11.860]  peak sessions wants is a new TPA where no power is granted to the executive
[02:11:11.860 --> 02:11:16.940]  branch which is what Obama is really pushing for basically to become and
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:25.220]  agreed upon within Congress to become basically a dictator and so the TAA which
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:32.660]  is the the trade adjustment assistance federal program was shot down and that
[02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:38.140]  was actually a three-to-one margin but the TPA actually passed but it's only
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:43.460]  ceremonial it really doesn't mean anything if if the other bills don't
[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:48.460]  pass it all it's all unraveling and going apart as I said as I said it would
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:54.580]  because people are becoming way too aware of it and it's largely because of
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:59.940]  you my friend well no it's it's it's it's all of us together I think info wars
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:05.460]  might have had 5% of the reason out of the 100% but it's everybody saying no
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:09.780]  and I think it's the fact there are some good Democrats who get you can't have a
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:17.420]  bunch of shadowy foreign corporations good getting total unbridled power so
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:21.140]  that's where the Democrats still have some sanity they're wrong there's so many
[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:26.420]  other fronts the policy at the very end right before the vote of the TAA actually
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:31.540]  turned and changed her vote oh really when she realized it was going to be
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:35.260]  shot down she went ahead jumped in on the winning side yeah I think she
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:40.540]  realized her party was gonna probably go to the wolves well I mean this is the
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:43.500]  problem of the Republican leadership they're a bunch of Rockefeller blue
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:48.020]  bloods globalist who are anti-free market but I'm glad to hear Pete Sessions
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:52.620]  told the truth you know some of his family was involved in state politics and
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:55.420]  my late grandfather was like best friends with him and actually knows that
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:59.020]  family well or knew them well it's just you know it's good to see Texans as
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:02.940]  usual at the you know at the end of the day not that Pete Sessions is perfect
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:07.740]  doing the right thing I mean we're talking about handing over what George
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:10.980]  Washington and the founders set up I mean we're talking it's not we're handing
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:15.460]  it over to some new great thing we're handing it over to globalist wolves it
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:22.700]  is it is so insane manor who actually isn't supposed to vote as speaker
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:28.500]  putting his vote in you know putting the knife in the back of the country I mean
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:33.180]  it takes a lot to I mean there this isn't a trade deal folks they're handing
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:39.420]  America over to a foreign shadowy power under a secret document I mean but it's
[02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:43.660]  men in suits and it's trade deals and it's paper and it's boring it was a
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:48.140]  foreign army people be out in the streets it's just incredible so what's this
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:53.780]  other vote that's going on then this one is let me trade enforcement and
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:59.740]  customs yeah I'll have it I have a report on all this get it all together but
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:07.460]  yeah trade enforcement and enforcing orders reducing customs evasion I think
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:11.500]  that one regards the border there's a separate bill so so the two sections on
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:16.500]  the TPP shot down praise God this is amazing news I'm just double-checking
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:20.180]  because I can't believe my own eyes and I don't believe the Washington Post but I
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:23.580]  guess occasionally they have to tell the truth so Obama back trade bill fails in
[02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:28.140]  the house that news just broke last 15 minutes folks praise God thank you so
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:33.380]  much John Bell thank you now we we ran his special report on Monday TPP
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:37.820]  unraveling John Rappaport of no more fake news calm will ride shotgun with us
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:41.140]  right through to the end of the hour Lee and Mac is coming in at the bottom of
[02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:44.700]  the hour to get into some other news with us and she'll be riding shotgun as
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:50.020]  well but John Rappaport's been really having some piercing analysis of
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:55.940]  Bilderberg like I'm looking for my folder here that has some of his articles
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:15:00.940]  in it so I wanted to get him to come on the broadcast to talk about his view of
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:06.020]  Bilderberg 2015 are we kind of reaching an equilibrium point and I don't mean
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:10.820]  that in a positive way where the forces of deception and mental illness and
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:16.300]  megalomania are rising but the forces of enlightenment and freedom are rising so
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:21.500]  it's the unstoppable force meets the unmovable object I mean I everybody
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:27.420]  senses it events are racing now towards one of those historic explosions people
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:31.460]  also have a feeling of dread but a feeling of exultation around the world
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:36.180]  something big is about to happen or is it already happening John Rappaport what
[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:41.280]  do you think's going on well it's already happening Alex with this last
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:48.180]  boat and you know they made a gigantic miscalculation which was we can ram
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:54.900]  through a completely secret treaty the negotiations themselves will be held in
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:16:00.220]  secret and the contents of the treaty will be secret you know so the whole
[02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:04.700]  thing was secret and then they classified the information what I
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:09.020]  discovered was it's you know top secret secret it's all that kind of
[02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:14.500]  classification stuff that supposedly presents legislators from telling the
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:19.820]  people what they have read that's in the TPP are we starting to see the fall of
[02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:24.500]  this secret cover garbage yeah I think that's what's happened and you know
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:28.500]  because it's so blatant now with the internet and with information everywhere
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:35.220]  for a very long time now the whole idea is so heinous that the Congress and the
[02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:39.180]  president and 11 other countries are going to sign on to this trans-Pacific
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:44.140]  partnership and nobody in those countries is even gonna know nobody I mean
[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:48.300]  not just Americans I mean this is our country we get to see it jackasses and
[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:52.340]  then we get three subsections of it and it's not just a trade deal it's a giant
[02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:57.900]  power grab of course and we still don't really know because even with what's been
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:03.740]  released leaked we're not totally sure that this is the final draft or it's an
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:09.900]  earlier draft I mean it's complete insanity and then as sessions pointed
[02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:15.860]  out about 10 days ago when he went into the sealed room you know to read
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:20.780]  sections of the TPP he came out and he started talking about this thing called
[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:25.980]  living agreements which means simply that once this treaty would be ratified
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:32.300]  then the powers that be in these 12 nations could change it at will to mean
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:35.700]  anything they want it to mean in the future so this is like a blank check
[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:39.220]  it's like saying to the globalist look you guys do whatever you want up the
[02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:43.820]  road here for as long as you want to do it you need more power take it you want
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:49.580]  to have no tariffs on anything anywhere at any time fine you want to sell
[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:53.820]  pharmaceuticals at skyrocket prices that's fine whatever you want to do you
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:58.940]  just do it you take over the government we surrender so all of this started to
[02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:03.420]  come out and then still Obama is lying lying lying and saying you people don't
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:07.620]  understand what's in the agreement and all this kind of stuff it becomes so
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:13.100]  obvious so transparent to people around the world that these liars are just
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:16.540]  trying for a power grab so is this jumping the shark I mean because we get
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:21.180]  down now to the final unveiling of world government and they go yeah it's
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:24.180]  secret you can't see anything and foreign corporations will run everything
[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:27.660]  and by the way your kids can't plan their backyard of their 11 will take you to
[02:18:27.660 --> 02:18:32.100]  jail I mean it's just yeah they're turning the country into a super max
[02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:35.980]  prison with a bunch of crooks running around in front of us I mean it's just
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:40.580]  bizarro world I I agree with you I think we're seeing something epic here and
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:44.940]  that word doesn't go far enough and I think the bad feelings we've all got is
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:48.540]  realizing the globalist aren't going to give up power easily and they're going
[02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:55.460]  to pull some major fiasco shenanigans you bet and plus this vote today that we
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:19:01.300]  were just listening to that's going to come back I mean you know this stuff
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:06.380]  doesn't quit it's not like okay well we voted it down that's the end of it no no
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:11.820]  no no no it can come back in other forms it can be readjusted Congress can be
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:15.180]  called back into session committee you can package horsemen are a thousand
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:19.660]  different ways exactly so we got to really watch out for that and then the
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:25.020]  thing that I pointed out in yet another article which is much more long term and
[02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:29.980]  deep is the fact that globalism itself is like a snake that's been eating its
[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:36.140]  own tail for a very long time because globalism puts global government in the
[02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:41.740]  hands of mega corporations at the same time these mega corporations are
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:46.820]  endowed with such powers that they essentially destroy the consumer base
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:51.700]  of the planet let's explain that this is key key what he's saying a piercing

[02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:41.020]  country I'm not saying I'm special but compared to zombies I am I mean I don't
[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:45.060]  get excited when the team I like wins the game I might go hey cool they won
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:48.420]  because I like sports a little bit I mean I'm not gonna lie about that I grew
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:53.420]  up playing them but man when we defeat an evil horrible takeover I know the
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:58.740]  enemy's coming back at us but still it's just it's exciting and the fact that
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:03.620]  it's weird that I start hyperventilating and stuttering and interrupting a guest
[02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:12.540]  on air that's normal folks this this is our country being conquered I mean this
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:18.180]  is real by really bad people and they've already got us in their grasp but
[02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:21.540]  we're trying to struggle out and the fact that we're struggling listen they
[02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:26.300]  brought the EU in 50 something years ago by stealth England didn't get a vote in
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:30.140]  the 80s late 80s was brought into it they're not getting ready to try to vote
[02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:33.740]  and get out of it the point is they didn't even know they'd gone under the
[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:39.380]  EU until it was announced almost all their laws are made by the unelected EU
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:44.940]  bureaucracy now they're trying to do the same thing here and it's failing you
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:49.420]  see we've gone so far in the fight folks that they admit Bilderberg exists they
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:53.980]  admit all this is happening their house of cards is coming down we have reached
[02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:58.620]  an ultra epic point and I'm not over using that word it's legendary the
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:05.060]  problem is they're gonna strike back and it's gonna be bad John Rapport this is
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:08.100]  short segment long segments coming up you'll have more time to elaborate but I
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:11.420]  don't think I'm overstating things and I think it's the fact that people have to
[02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:15.260]  get out of their trance literal trance that you write about and we have to
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:18.180]  break people out of it it's not going to be pretty like when I was on Pierce
[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:22.180]  Morgan but it was international sensation as you wrote because it was the
[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:26.900]  curtain getting pulled back I'm nothing special I'm like Toto we are all
[02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:31.260]  launching Operation Toto and we're seeing history right now I mean I mean
[02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:37.340]  are you getting chills right now yeah I am because the legislators are being
[02:26:37.340 --> 02:26:43.460]  forced into this by the people because you know they sense this giant wave
[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:47.540]  building we're not going to stand for secrecy we don't want some super
[02:26:47.540 --> 02:26:52.260]  natural or national government taking over the United States with secret
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:57.780]  details that we can't even know about they're afraid if they just you know
[02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:02.420]  rubber-stamp this whole thing that it's going to be an enduring nightmare for
[02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:06.900]  them and so they're backing away right now right now they're backing away they're
[02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:12.740]  saying no and that is tremendous that is a tremendous defeat for Obama because
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:18.260]  he's in a sweat and a panic believe me he's running around making deals doing
[02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:22.660]  everything under the sun possible to get the votes that he wants they burned
[02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:28.500]  Hastert to scare everybody because if Obama because Obama was put there to do
[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:33.780]  this that's why he's the president forget all the other stuff this was his
[02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:38.020]  mandate there's going to be big-time trade treaties coming up and you're
[02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:41.580]  going to make right he didn't go down to Capitol Hill to push Obamacare he went
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:46.500]  down here on this exactly he was mentored by Virginia you know the
[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:51.820]  intellectual flunky of David Rockefeller after he won the election in 2008
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:57.700]  and he was clued in on all of this this is why you're here mr. president to get
[02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:02.860]  these trade treaties done failure is not an option this is what we want you do
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:08.580]  whatever else you want but this this is why you're here if you mess this up
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:15.140]  that's a very very bad thing he knows that and he is sweating he's in a panic
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:18.980]  and he's trying to get arm twisted by the way the media has pointed out that
[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:23.220]  he's been stuttering more falling apart doesn't want to give speeches he looks
[02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:28.460]  freaked out he is freaked out he knows who you know he knows who the bosses are
[02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:32.420]  you know it's like when you work for a company and the boss comes down he says
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:37.380]  look this is the project that's going to pull us out or keep us in front and
[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:40.860]  you've got to make it happen I don't want any excuses I don't want to hear
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:45.940]  anything about failure whatever you have to do you make it work remember that
[02:28:45.940 --> 02:28:50.300]  this is the next eight or ten years of what we're doing here well the boss goes
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:53.980]  back upstairs and the guys in this well okay well I'll do this no question about
[02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:58.460]  it but then when push comes to show it turns out it's not easy it turns out
[02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:02.940]  it's a struggle it turns out that you know what is Obama trying to promote
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:06.780]  he's trying to promote utter secrecy just do what I tell you it turns out
[02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:09.780]  there's people that know the game plan it turns out there's a resistance that
[02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:14.940]  was waiting that knew this was coming exactly and now here we go now here we
[02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:19.540]  go that's right we've been patriots for 60 years have been building to fight you

[02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:32.580]  those people folks we're now where we're at in a fighting stance against the
[02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:35.860]  globalist and that's what we're trying to tell people as bad as the zombie

[02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:16.980]  culture war though the weaponization of the media this Bruce Jenner garbage
[02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:22.340]  trying to finance a race war using the globalist training of the police that is
[02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:27.500]  atrocious to then create a culture clash there how mr. Rappaport thinks we
[02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:32.420]  navigate out of that briefly because I didn't do any plugging last hour we
[02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:39.900]  finance our operation here selling super high quality products and I believe in
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:45.060]  one thing at my core and that's win-win I don't do something to someone unless

[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:12.260]  losers and they hate winners or their quasi winners but they're still haters
[02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:17.180]  and they don't like other winners and and the globalist are that so anything we

[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:57.940]  know they had when it comes to get very clear they're gonna say no because what's
[02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:01.820]  valuable is not being slaves what's valuable is having integrity but they're
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:06.420]  gonna use racism and infighting and trolls on all sides to try to get us at
[02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:11.380]  each other's throats it must fail you must be unified by a culture of liberty

[02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:53.300]  revolutionary ever America had tons of evil in it but the idea of private

[02:37:57.060 --> 02:38:03.500]  was like kryptonite to Superman but not a good Superman a bad Superman it is

[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:36.420]  dollars to reach tens of thousands of people wake up thousands of people or
[02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:41.460]  you got a local business go sponsor the show I mean it's time to put the money
[02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:46.060]  where the mouth is folks it's time to commit okay I'm not bragging but I've
[02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:49.340]  been through all sorts of hell okay and you know what it's only made me better
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:53.500]  it's made me stronger and now since so many people already went before us and
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:58.140]  trailblaze to the enemy's face you don't get the heat you used to get doing low
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:03.020]  level stuff the enemy is in trouble folks the enemy wanted to intimidate us
[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:08.020]  they took our laziness as weakness that is not what it was so let's take action
[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:12.620]  now thank you for your support and then we also support and magnify all the other
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:17.180]  amazing minds and patriots whether it's Ron Paul or John Rappaport or Paul
[02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:21.060]  Watson or Jacari Jackson or Leanne McAdoo and just all the rest are great
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:26.220]  writers all the people you the listeners it's legendary it's the fight it's the
[02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:30.740]  defense against the globalist even if we lose at least we didn't crawl around on
[02:39:30.740 --> 02:39:34.820]  the ground we stood up and it's that animating contest that Jefferson wrote
[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:39.900]  about that makes us who we are it's that struggle that builds our spiritual
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:45.140]  muscles our physical muscles are our intestinal fortitude it's addicting I
[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:50.940]  mean I've gone from being afraid 20 years ago to not being afraid to just
[02:39:50.940 --> 02:39:56.180]  being beyond that just just almost wanting them to come not even just ready
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:02.820]  for battle ready for it all ready for the test ready all right I want to give
[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:05.740]  John Rappaport five six minutes to have the floor on this subject without me
[02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:08.820]  interrupting them I'm not have Leanne McAdoo shagway in with the culture war
[02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:13.020]  and get John Rappaport to take on that John Rappaport okay a couple things
[02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:18.780]  Alex one is there's still some people out there who under the incredible
[02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:25.460]  delusion that the benevolent government is gonna be the one to rescue us from
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:29.780]  globalism when in fact it's the government collaboration with mega
[02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:35.460]  corporations and mega money and mega banksters that is what globalism is not
[02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:39.060]  just the US government but many go the snake eating itself get into that
[02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:46.860]  exactly the snake eating itself that is the fact that the globalism paradigm has
[02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:54.500]  mega corporations with such license to roam and destroy and plunder and kill
[02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:59.740]  markets and kill competitors and small businesses and so forth that the gap
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:04.220]  between the very rich and the very poor is growing it's getting wider and wider
[02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:08.980]  and therefore what does that mean that means that the global consumer base is
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:13.940]  shrinking for people who can buy the products that these mega corporations
[02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:19.300]  are making that's the crash up ahead in the road that's right there that's what
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:22.940]  some of the people at Bilderberg behind the scenes are actually talking about
[02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:28.460]  because they can see it coming wait a minute we made a miscalculation we
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:32.980]  figured that these mega corporations which are the best organizations in the
[02:41:32.980 --> 02:41:38.340]  world to plunder foreign lands slave labor mineral resources and so on and so
[02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:43.700]  forth this would be the way that we take over the world but who knew they're
[02:41:43.700 --> 02:41:48.460]  shrinking the consumer base of people who can buy the products these mega
[02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:52.700]  corporations are operating their assembly lines at half-hour they could
[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:58.220]  produce enough for two or three planets the size of earth and meanwhile the 10
[02:41:58.220 --> 02:42:04.060]  percent roughly of the world's population that actually can participate as
[02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:09.260]  consumers and buy the products that these mega corporations make that's even
[02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:15.020]  shrinking further and further and further that means crack up smash up the
[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:20.620]  whole thing is going into failure the lights are blinking the flags that red
[02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:26.460]  flags are rising this is not going to work that's the snake eating its own
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:31.180]  tail that's what's happening to globalism it doesn't work it could never
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:35.820]  work and now some of the people are facing who are the globalists are
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:41.820]  facing up to what's about to hit them which is why the decentralization of
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:46.820]  power along every possible front is what we have to stand for and do because
[02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:52.940]  this whole superstructure is going to fail what do you make of the record over
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:59.060]  the top beyond security that Hitler in Austria would have I mean seriously it
[02:42:59.060 --> 02:43:04.300]  just bizarro level security at Bilderberg does that reflect their panic
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:09.780]  mode I think it does absolutely because they're just you know casting about in
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:14.660]  a panic for solutions what are we going to do I mean we got another problem here
[02:43:14.660 --> 02:43:21.020]  which is robots machines the automation of industry is coming on like crazy the
[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:26.780]  technocrats are inventing new ways to structure assembly lines of any kind
[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:31.540]  that's going to put more people out of work who can't afford to buy the products
[02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:36.060]  of these mega corporations what are we going to do are we going to wire the
[02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:40.460]  brains of everybody in the world to put them into a deep hypnotic trance and
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:46.180]  virtual reality like DARPA is trying to do so they think they're seeing one thing
[02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:50.740]  in front of their nose when it's really something else I mean they're just going
[02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:55.860]  into panic mode because they see the handwriting on the wall and they don't
[02:43:55.860 --> 02:44:01.780]  want to see anybody watching them in that kind of panic so sure put an
[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:06.780]  electronic shield around their meeting to make sure that nobody can get it I
[02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:10.260]  want to bring Leigh Ann McAdoo in but let's accelerate past that you're right
[02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:15.140]  they told the corporations and the college PhDs and the the level above the
[02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:22.420]  capstone the the level right below the capstone we know that they told them
[02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:27.220]  globalism was for good and then now it's anti-human it's imploding things when
[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:30.500]  you get into higher level writings as you know they admit they want a zero
[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:36.740]  growth or negative growth human population global crash they control that
[02:44:36.740 --> 02:44:40.860]  they use then as the global authority to be the saviors to come in with peace
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:45.580]  keeping forces and succeed where Hitler who carried out their first eugenics
[02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:49.540]  program failed and again I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy folks I'm saying
[02:44:49.540 --> 02:44:54.780]  he was one model or a beta test and that's all declassified and so there is
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:45:00.460]  even a plan within this you can call it psychopaths rationalizing a system that's
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:05.580]  imploding but Club of Rome in the 60s envisioned and basically laid all of
[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:10.020]  this out and it's been adopted so what do you say to that method to the madness
[02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:14.940]  and the deception of the acolytes of globalism who believed that they were
[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:19.660]  going to usher in a utopia well this is a utopia for devilish minds for
[02:45:19.660 --> 02:45:23.860]  psychopaths it is a utopia for those that want to live in a bloody charnel
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:31.020]  house yeah it is but with all of that preparation and planning and zero growth
[02:45:31.020 --> 02:45:39.180]  and depopulation and what have you the problem remains because these mega
[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:45.620]  corporations the Monsanto's of the world and and so on have been told listen
[02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:50.540]  you are our boys you're carrying the freight for globalism around the world
[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:55.740]  that's why we're giving you this incredibly privileged treatment to do
[02:45:55.740 --> 02:46:00.380]  anything you want to anybody at any time this is why we put armies at your
[02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:06.060]  beck and call and intelligence agencies to go into foreign lands and prepare the
[02:46:06.060 --> 02:46:10.300]  way for you to take over the resources and the people and so on and you're our
[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:14.660]  boys and wait a minute though wait a minute how are how are the mega
[02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:22.420]  corporations going to profit and flourish with zero growth depopulation
[02:46:22.420 --> 02:46:27.540]  shrinking radically the consumer exactly the minions are getting the fact that
[02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:33.460]  they were set up they were set up exactly they were set up we got to have
[02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:36.700]  you back for like a two three hour break down the whole state of the world
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:40.020]  with you rap or because you really really can crystallize it just in an
[02:46:40.020 --> 02:46:44.860]  amazing way Leanne McAdoo's here and she's got a really just microcosm story
[02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:49.260]  that illustrates the insanity of all this where they make it all about race all
[02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:52.980]  about identity which is the opposite of what Martin Luther King taught and I
[02:46:52.980 --> 02:46:58.300]  want to get your take on this after the break or right before the break Leanne
[02:46:58.300 --> 02:47:03.340]  well there's a new trans debate going on right now so for the last month pretty
[02:47:03.340 --> 02:47:08.740]  hardcore it's kind of been shoved down our throat that we need to accept people
[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:12.940]  and the way that they self-identify right with this whole transgender movement
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:16.660]  well and just even questioning it means you hate them no we don't anybody why
[02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:21.580]  is this the number one issue in the world right well now it's kind of thrown
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:26.460]  back in their face a little bit because it turns out there was a the leader of
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:33.540]  an NAACP chapter in Spokane Washington is a white woman who was masquerading as
[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:38.260]  a black woman for at least the last 10 years and her parents aren't black they've
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:41.620]  gone public tell us about this but but but she's now they're saying she'd have
[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:48.380]  the right to say she's black right and so Biggs had a really crude analogy that
[02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:53.540]  he wanted to be a body part of Brad Pitt I mean I guess I could say I'm a
[02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:59.140]  toad then or I'm gonna say I'm an eagle or I self-identify as a billionaire so I
[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:05.180]  need you to try to give you that credit of a billionaire yes absolutely well so
[02:48:05.180 --> 02:48:10.020]  I mean this lady took it to the next level she she's the president of the
[02:48:10.020 --> 02:48:17.060]  NAACP she got her master's degree from Howard University is that am I saying
[02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:22.100]  black university so she's a con she's a con she's a con but it's okay because
[02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:26.060]  she has an identity I don't you I don't think she is even a con and she is
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:31.460]  delusional she assimilated herself into this black culture her family they were
[02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:36.380]  missionaries in South Africa before she was born but they adopted some some
[02:48:36.380 --> 02:48:41.060]  black children and another one child from Haiti another you know three African
[02:48:41.060 --> 02:48:44.780]  American children we need to accept her as black right and if you don't then you
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:49.380]  are trans racist and we probably should go get you some counseling because you
[02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:52.340]  have if you don't believe that she's a black woman because that's how she's
[02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:56.220]  so John Robford they take our real rights all of our rights collectively to
[02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:59.780]  not be spot-on and I have our money devalued and I have poison put in our
[02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:02.740]  food but then they give us all these fellow rights because the globalists
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:06.860]  don't care if we say where dresses or you know I mean isn't it really just a
[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:11.780]  political football yeah exactly I mean it's a sensational story that keeps
[02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:16.460]  people glued because you know it's appealing to lowest common denominator
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:22.100]  it's like yet another celebrity story I mean it's on that level so oh wow we now
[02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:28.260]  have a new whole thing here I can say that I'm a table and you know what
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:31.820]  rights does the table have well let's get together and form a group and you
[02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:35.940]  know the table people and get some legislation passed and whatever and what
[02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:40.380]  have you you know so what's gonna happen if a hundred black people decide they
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:44.420]  want to be white you know and there's something we can argue about for the
[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:49.180]  next like a Dave Chappelle skit when he goes and joins the clan people on
[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:54.100]  Twitter saying well I self-identify as white I'm gonna go get a home loan yeah
[02:49:54.100 --> 02:49:57.940]  that by the way that by the way is why they had to get rid of Dave Chappelle
[02:49:57.940 --> 02:50:02.460]  because he was cutting too close to the bone I mean he was showing all of these
[02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:07.540]  insanities that you know we're talking about now these cultural insanity sure
[02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:11.380]  I liked him before thought he was really smart I went saw him live in Austin and
[02:50:11.380 --> 02:50:16.060]  he just seemed to know he'd like gained like 80 pounds he wasn't fatty look like
[02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:20.980]  he was like a NFL you know linebacker and but he just seemed totally it wasn't
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:25.380]  the same Dave Chappelle no definitely not something happened to him what do you
[02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:29.020]  think I mean people say some weird stuff went on I don't know exactly what
[02:50:29.020 --> 02:50:32.900]  happened to him but I do know that there was a tremendous amount of pushback
[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:36.980]  against the show on Comedy Central and some of it was coming from the black
[02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:41.380]  community because you know you start looking at his stuff long enough and you
[02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:45.500]  see this is what he's talking about he's talking about the total insanity of
[02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:52.460]  black versus white race versus race people saying that basically they are
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:59.940]  their skin color they are Katie armor comm is your one-stop shop for the most

[02:52:01.620 --> 02:52:06.740]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[02:52:06.740 --> 02:52:11.380]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:16.020]  30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we
[02:52:16.020 --> 02:52:21.700]  get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms.com own and run by a bunch of

[02:53:02.300 --> 02:53:06.260]  company called ID stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic
[02:53:06.260 --> 02:53:09.560]  pickpocketing oh I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pick
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:13.700]  pocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards
[02:53:13.700 --> 02:53:18.460]  being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID the transmitter banking
[02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:22.740]  information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy could also get
[02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:26.060]  one of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their
[02:53:26.060 --> 02:53:29.300]  credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it
[02:53:29.300 --> 02:53:33.500]  wow that sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should
[02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:37.700]  definitely get an ID stronghold shielded wallet are they more expensive no in
[02:53:37.700 --> 02:53:41.540]  fact I can get a shielded leather wallet from ID stronghold.com for the
[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:45.700]  same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores sounds
[02:53:45.700 --> 02:53:49.740]  great my wallet isn't falling apart yet but let me pick one out too I want to be
[02:53:49.740 --> 02:53:54.820]  protected and these wallets at ID stronghold.com look fantastic
[02:53:54.820 --> 02:54:04.740]  Big John. Big John. Every morning at the mine you can see him arrive he stood six
[02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:10.020]  foot six and waited 245 kind of broad at the shoulder and there at the hip and
[02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:22.820]  everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John. Big John. Big John. Big bad John.
[02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:28.620]  Big John. John Rubberport is our guest nobody's seen no we're gonna do five
[02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:32.620]  minutes overdrive to cover this new ABC news show becoming us about dad's all
[02:54:32.620 --> 02:54:37.340]  the coming trannies and it's a biological attack it's happening to fish
[02:54:37.340 --> 02:54:41.660]  amphibians because of the chemicals as this becomes more widespread they're
[02:54:41.660 --> 02:54:46.100]  not gonna say why is it happening they're going to say oh it's just a
[02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:50.340]  cultural thing and part of it is cultural but most of its chemical I'll get
[02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:53.420]  John Rubberport's take on that in a moment because we can say we're having
[02:54:53.420 --> 02:54:59.660]  victories and we are but they're hitting us with a scientific attack now by the
[02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:03.660]  way most patriots aren't into getting credit but people are trying to give us
[02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:09.820]  credit for stopping TPP no this broadcast is a small part of that you the
[02:55:09.820 --> 02:55:14.780]  listeners are a big part of that most neocontact radio was pushing it some
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:20.020]  were kind of on the fence but drudge report dot com has us triple linked today
[02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:24.900]  covering Bilderberg drudge is the only mega site that will cover this and has
[02:55:24.900 --> 02:55:27.900]  the courage and has the Pentagon talking trash about him for it not the
[02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:33.140]  military the people that run the Pentagon we have three links on drudge today
[02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:38.340]  breaking down what's happening at Bilderberg that's exciting that the
[02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:43.640]  Democrats get credit the grassroots Democrats are sane enough to go no we
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:47.260]  shouldn't have secret bills being passed and we and it shouldn't be foreign
[02:55:47.260 --> 02:55:54.060]  corporations and governments and that's a big deal so we have two parties the
[02:55:54.060 --> 02:56:00.180]  tea party leading the charge deserves credit and it shows how we only to come
[02:56:00.180 --> 02:56:04.700]  together on sanity and not all call each other racist and homophobes because
[02:56:04.700 --> 02:56:08.180]  we don't want five-year-olds taught how to be trannies or whatever I mean that
[02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:12.340]  shouldn't be taught period okay I mean you shouldn't be doing that it's a
[02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:16.820]  distraction this whole gay marriage thing it's a state issue read the
[02:56:16.820 --> 02:56:20.780]  Constitution I mean if gay people want to have the lawyers ruin their lives and
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:26.180]  and you know get thrown in the divorce mill you're idiots but but whatever it's
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:29.500]  not I don't say that because I hate you because you're gay I say it because it's
[02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:33.100]  all a political football John Rappaport how do we beat these people and then
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:38.500]  Leigh Ann jump in any time well we start to beat them by and you mentioned this
[02:56:38.500 --> 02:56:44.180]  earlier what are your principles as an individual what do you stand for you
[02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:49.500]  don't know you better find out right now what is freedom really what is it all
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:53.100]  about freedom from what his freedom means I can wear a dress I don't have
[02:56:53.100 --> 02:56:57.140]  any other freedoms but I can wear a dress exactly and if that is the limit
[02:56:57.140 --> 02:57:02.340]  that the person can conceive you know well I'm white but I can say I'm black
[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:06.860]  well I'm a human but I can say I'm a fish that's it you know that's the limit
[02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:11.180]  of my freedom well we're in trouble then we have to go back to basics what does
[02:57:11.180 --> 02:57:15.860]  freedom really mean and individuals have to do that many more than already are
[02:57:15.860 --> 02:57:20.500]  doing and there are a lot that are doing and then those individuals look at the
[02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:24.580]  world and they say hey wait a minute we're giving away the government in this
[02:57:24.580 --> 02:57:30.220]  country to some superstructure of globalist bankers and mega corporations
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:34.100]  that doesn't sound like freedom to me and I can't even know the details of
[02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:39.540]  that forget it I'm going up against that that's what and then you recognize the
[02:57:39.540 --> 02:57:44.100]  Bruce Jenner thing is a sickening carnival distraction like the bearded
[02:57:44.100 --> 02:57:49.100]  lady which is just a reverse of that folks it's freak show stuff and I'm not
[02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:52.060]  saying people hit their women are freaks I'm saying they're using Carnival
[02:57:52.060 --> 02:57:55.780]  Barker tactics on us Leigh Ann taking us out to break your take on this
[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:59.180]  situation well that's just it because you have a lot of these young people who
[02:57:59.180 --> 02:58:02.220]  are in this black lives matter movement who are actually you know wanting to
[02:58:02.220 --> 02:58:05.580]  fight back against police brutality all that well now you've got them all sort
[02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:09.660]  of in fighting against what's white what's black you know is this white
[02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:14.780]  privilege and going away from the real issues and Jerry Seinfeld's 13 year old

[03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:09.060]  I mean dad and these men get off on being emasculated well because we've
[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:12.460]  been conquered by men the globalist so they taught us how cool it was not to
[03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:15.660]  have men that's the first thing a conquering group does is just kill your
[03:01:15.660 --> 03:01:20.980]  men well now they just put stuff in your water and turn you into a pat or
[03:01:20.980 --> 03:01:26.500]  whatever that was on Saturday Night Live let's play this clip hey I'm Ben I'm

[03:02:12.420 --> 03:02:16.180]  confuse the civilization this is a scientific takedown which is the snake
[03:02:16.180 --> 03:02:20.660]  eating itself the globalists use the West to run their empire but they hate
[03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:25.340]  anything independent so they're trying to destroy it as well John Rappaport final

[03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:49.940]  what you do there's no way out now this is really great that you want to be a
[03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:55.220]  fireman let's call slavery you know and these kids are not being left alone to

[03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:50.020]  earlier when you said that this is this is distracting people to let them decide
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:55.060]  what is freedom and what is not freedom hey I'm I live in America I'm free I
[03:03:55.060 --> 03:03:58.620]  want to be a woman this is a free country and so that's where this new
[03:03:58.620 --> 03:04:02.620]  debate is of this is what is freedom don't you know don't look at the fact
[03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:07.260]  that our government is now being turned into a global governance structure you
[03:04:07.260 --> 03:04:10.860]  know that's what they're deciding on right now there in D.C. don't even think

[03:06:03.180 --> 03:06:07.820]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality
[03:06:07.820 --> 03:06:12.500]  and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30 40

[03:08:05.420 --> 03:08:12.260]  and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers maybe you can call the A-team.
[03:08:12.260 --> 03:08:20.180]  How many did I insult? I killed my kids. I killed my kids.
[03:08:20.180 --> 03:08:26.180]  What the f**k is this? It's a crazy f**king male that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[03:08:26.180 --> 03:08:30.300]  Hey we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle that's pretty
[03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:37.220]  cool man. Is that you on the Facebook? Is there a Facebook page of you with a
[03:08:37.220 --> 03:08:41.300]  hammer and sickle? I don't think so.
[03:08:47.300 --> 03:08:53.300]  How do you get your abortions paid for? I pay for them.
[03:08:53.300 --> 03:09:05.300]  Upwards of 50. Really? Oh yeah. F**k you you piece of f**king s**t. Bunch of misogynist mother f**king s**t. Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:11.300]  What's up are you being aggressive? I'm being aggressive. Come on in Oz! Get in Oz!
[03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:24.300]  Wow! These are the guys that attack Alex Jones.
[03:09:24.300 --> 03:09:32.300]  From the front lines of the Information War it's Alex Jones. Alright final segment in overdrive.
[03:09:32.300 --> 03:09:37.300]  So now I've been informed by the crew that it's usually more up on trends than I am.
[03:09:37.300 --> 03:09:43.300]  Oh that yuckies are well known. Zuckerberg's promoting them. We showed an article out of New York about how wondrous it is.
[03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:54.300]  They don't have jobs, they're deep in debt, but they're cool and like little baby birds, they're just basically fed poisonous vomit from their government mommy
[03:09:54.300 --> 03:10:02.300]  and then they just repeat over and over again whatever they're told and then think they're like the intellectual elite.
[03:10:02.300 --> 03:10:07.300]  And the red guard out of LA that are here in Austin that go around worshipping Mao.
[03:10:07.300 --> 03:10:10.300]  They don't even know that Mao is like hated in China, even by the communists.
[03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:17.300]  They don't know what planet they're on and they actually run and then crawl in dumpsters.
[03:10:17.300 --> 03:10:22.300]  In fact one time I was at a dance studio picking up my girls that were doing some ballet.
[03:10:22.300 --> 03:10:27.300]  They had this other big dance area and I heard these moms going oh yeah I love to crawl in dumpsters.
[03:10:27.300 --> 03:10:32.300]  They're saying it's so fun to wall around the dumpsters and then I heard people talking later about it.
[03:10:32.300 --> 03:10:41.300]  So it's just disconnected from reality, living on credit, worshipping big government, having no idea robots from France to China are replacing them,
[03:10:41.300 --> 03:10:45.300]  having no idea there's chemical weapons being put in the vaccines, food and water.
[03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:55.300]  I mean imagine when stuff collapses, these people, I mean you go to downtown Austin, there are literal hordes of yuckies wandering around.
[03:10:55.300 --> 03:11:00.300]  The hipster's dead and they're saying the yucky capital in these articles, Zuckerberg is commanding them,
[03:11:00.300 --> 03:11:05.300]  I'm not joking, it actually says it, are being deployed to Austin to bring down Texas.
[03:11:05.300 --> 03:11:12.300]  I mean you talk about zombie invasion folks, you talk about zambos, I mean they are it.
[03:11:12.300 --> 03:11:17.300]  And again they are the enlightened ones, they know like three words, racist, sexist, homophobe.
[03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:20.300]  And they just bleat them over and over again.
[03:11:20.300 --> 03:11:26.300]  And again we are in Austin, I guess God put me here for a reason, my mom's from here.
[03:11:26.300 --> 03:11:35.300]  Just 25 years ago to battle these people, I was here long before they arrived to try to build our command base to contend with them.
[03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:40.300]  And you can laugh at them but something this demonic, this weak, this artificial, this pathetic,
[03:11:40.300 --> 03:11:45.300]  it's like Hercules when he's sent to hell in one of his labors to rescue somebody.
[03:11:45.300 --> 03:11:51.300]  In the total darkness you just don't even know how to fight them because they're just, how do you fight people stumbling,
[03:11:51.300 --> 03:11:55.300]  drooling, saying I kill my kids and then crawling in trash cans?
[03:11:55.300 --> 03:11:57.300]  Because there's more of them than us and they can vote.
[03:11:57.300 --> 03:12:01.300]  How do you defeat the hordes of evil, John Rappaport?
[03:12:01.300 --> 03:12:07.300]  Well first of all I would call them suckies instead of yuckies.
[03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:14.300]  And you know let's just go after Facebook because this is the Facebook generation right?
[03:12:14.300 --> 03:12:18.300]  You can be a troll, you can put up little photos of yourself,
[03:12:18.300 --> 03:12:25.300]  you can say, well is it racist, homophobe, whatever, over and over again and somehow you can survive.
[03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:30.300]  So this seems to me we should recharacterize it as the Facebook generation.
[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:35.300]  I raise suckies, they're launching this meme this week, let's hijack yuckies and make them suckies
[03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:40.300]  and explain to them that you're deep in debt, you've been conned, you love the system,
[03:12:40.300 --> 03:12:45.300]  you think doubling down on the system will save your ass, you're called the total loser.
[03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:47.300]  Right, the total loser.
[03:12:47.300 --> 03:12:52.300]  Zuckie equals schmuck extraordinaire, sorry.
[03:12:52.300 --> 03:12:55.300]  I apologize, I'm ranting, go ahead Rappaport.
[03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:59.300]  No, go ahead, Diane, I'm finished, I got Zuckie, that's it.
[03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:03.300]  You coined the term Zuckie, all hail John Rappaport.
[03:13:03.300 --> 03:13:09.300]  Well that's basically it, is that they're trying to program them and by making it trendy and cool
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:14.300]  that they have no jobs, no future, they'll be deep in debt and they'll have nothing to do.
[03:13:14.300 --> 03:13:15.300]  Why are you a Zuckaphobe?
[03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:18.300]  Sit around and eating artisanal donuts.
[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:20.300]  I'm a proud Zuckaphobe.
[03:13:20.300 --> 03:13:21.300]  Yeah.
[03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:26.300]  What's going to happen, Leanne, what's going to happen John, first Leanne, when all this goes belly up, which it is.
[03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:32.300]  The Globals are running to bunkers right now, God knows when it, I hope it doesn't happen, but it's inevitable.
[03:13:32.300 --> 03:13:36.300]  What happens when the next Great Depression hits to the Zuckie Horde?
[03:13:36.300 --> 03:13:43.300]  I mean, they're going to be the ones that are teaching us how to get our food out of garbage cans, you know, I mean, that's frightening.
[03:13:43.300 --> 03:13:49.300]  Wait a minute, that's true, at Whole Foods and everywhere they promote this poor culture of not having money, even though it's a rip-off,
[03:13:49.300 --> 03:13:53.300]  and so I guess they are pre-positioning to be losers in the Depression.
[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:54.300]  Right.
[03:13:54.300 --> 03:13:59.300]  Oh, that's why it's sexy to be bankrupt, they realize they've been conned, so now they're going with it.
[03:13:59.300 --> 03:14:01.300]  It's, they're hipsters.
[03:14:01.300 --> 03:14:04.300]  They're embracing the fact that they were conned, oh I get it.
[03:14:04.300 --> 03:14:09.300]  Yeah, that's the thing with the hipsters, they're always a step ahead, so.
[03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:13.300]  So actually they're delicate, wait a minute, Rappaport, they're geniuses.
[03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:15.300]  They're confusions.
[03:14:15.300 --> 03:14:17.300]  The garbage can movement.
[03:14:17.300 --> 03:14:18.300]  Right.
[03:14:18.300 --> 03:14:20.300]  How to get food.
[03:14:20.300 --> 03:14:22.300]  Wow, who thought of that, that's great.
[03:14:22.300 --> 03:14:23.300]  Yeah.
[03:14:23.300 --> 03:14:26.300]  Well the thing about them, and I'm not joking, they worship trash dumpsters.
[03:14:26.300 --> 03:14:28.300]  Yeah, I forget what it's called, there is actually a-
[03:14:28.300 --> 03:14:35.300]  There's a whole movement and they have like secret symbols that they spray paint on the garbage cans,
[03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:40.300]  that this garbage can has rotten food in it, this one's good, it usually has fresh food in it,
[03:14:40.300 --> 03:14:43.300]  or we've already ransacked this garbage can, all the good food.
[03:14:43.300 --> 03:14:45.300]  So they're quasi-homeless.
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:46.300]  Yeah.
[03:14:46.300 --> 03:14:48.300]  But they still support the system, they love it.
[03:14:48.300 --> 03:14:49.300]  Right.
[03:14:49.300 --> 03:14:54.300]  Well that's how that one kid said he pays for all of his abortions, is that he gets the money donated to him.
[03:14:54.300 --> 03:14:56.300]  So.
[03:14:56.300 --> 03:14:58.300]  Zuckies.
[03:14:58.300 --> 03:14:59.300]  Yeah.
[03:14:59.300 --> 03:15:03.300]  But then they always have like the guy driving up in the $80,000 brand new Jaguar,
[03:15:03.300 --> 03:15:09.300]  who's the foundation minion, who's managing them, and they go and like sit around a professor and worship him,
[03:15:09.300 --> 03:15:13.300]  and he goes, ehh, the women just give themselves, ehh.
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:16.300]  So smile with your eight degrees, no jaguar.
[03:15:16.300 --> 03:15:19.300]  I will send you out, crawl to the trash can.
[03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:23.300]  And you're the worst of the worst, because you are a white alpha male.
[03:15:23.300 --> 03:15:24.300]  I am.
[03:15:24.300 --> 03:15:26.300]  Yeah, you're, you're done.
[03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:28.300]  You've had your time.
[03:15:28.300 --> 03:15:30.300]  They tell me they're going to rent Jeremy.
[03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:32.300]  You're anti-dumbster.
[03:15:32.300 --> 03:15:33.300]  Yeah.
[03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:34.300]  That's the problem.
[03:15:34.300 --> 03:15:36.300]  Oh, dear you.
[03:15:36.300 --> 03:15:42.300]  Meanwhile, don't they know this whole mind control was written basically by globalist,
[03:15:42.300 --> 03:15:46.300]  who just so happened to be a lot of me white alpha males?
[03:15:46.300 --> 03:15:53.300]  Well, Zuckies, you know, Facebook, CIA money, basically, you know, kept it on the map and created it.
[03:15:53.300 --> 03:15:59.300]  So these are just sort of little CIA clones running around these Zuckies.
[03:15:59.300 --> 03:16:05.300]  What do you call the fake liberals that are so fascist?
[03:16:05.300 --> 03:16:12.300]  We need a better name for them, but, you know, they used to be called limousine liberals, remember those days?
[03:16:12.300 --> 03:16:20.300]  Best one, you know, they would be, we're for everybody that has nothing while I'm sitting in the back of my limo on Park Avenue
[03:16:20.300 --> 03:16:23.300]  on my car phone calling my broker.
[03:16:23.300 --> 03:16:27.300]  And, and, and those type of Democrats would always not pay taxes.
[03:16:27.300 --> 03:16:29.300]  Yeah, they were doing it.
[03:16:29.300 --> 03:16:30.300]  Well, I carried with this.
[03:16:30.300 --> 03:16:31.300]  What was it, his boat?
[03:16:31.300 --> 03:16:36.300]  They kept moving around in order to avoid taxes up in New England there.
[03:16:36.300 --> 03:16:39.300]  Yeah, they'll do anything to avoid taxes.
[03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:45.300]  They've probably spent half a day figuring out how to avoid taxes because that's how they make most of their money.
[03:16:45.300 --> 03:16:48.300]  So yeah, they were the limousine liberals.
[03:16:48.300 --> 03:16:59.300]  Now they're, I don't know, the rich idiots who are trying to, you know, bring everybody else down because they know the government is their friend.
[03:16:59.300 --> 03:17:00.300]  Big government is their friend.
[03:17:00.300 --> 03:17:02.300]  Big government protects them.
[03:17:02.300 --> 03:17:09.300]  Big government protects big money, Wall Street corporations, which are all tied into the globalist takeover.
[03:17:09.300 --> 03:17:11.300]  So they feel like they're immune.
[03:17:11.300 --> 03:17:12.300]  They're on the right side.
[03:17:12.300 --> 03:17:18.300]  And that big system gives the gives their zuckies a little piece of chicken feed.
[03:17:18.300 --> 03:17:23.300]  So they worship it, not knowing they're a prisoner in a cage being given food three times a day.
[03:17:23.300 --> 03:17:26.300]  I mean, I resent somebody giving me food in the cage.
[03:17:26.300 --> 03:17:28.300]  I wouldn't be, oh, thank you.
[03:17:28.300 --> 03:17:32.300]  And then hate people that were outside trying to blow the wall up to get me out.
[03:17:32.300 --> 03:17:36.300]  Even if it was an artisanal donut.
[03:17:36.300 --> 03:17:39.300]  Well, I'm just not elitistly hating these trendies.
[03:17:39.300 --> 03:17:43.300]  They talk to them. They're so stupid.
[03:17:43.300 --> 03:17:48.300]  And it's very frustrating and infuriating that they think that you're so stupid.
[03:17:48.300 --> 03:17:49.300]  You know what I mean?
[03:17:49.300 --> 03:17:53.300]  Like a self made human being who has built his own empire has tons of empire.
[03:17:53.300 --> 03:18:06.300]  Oh, of course it is the, you know, but we, you know, we're the bad guys because we don't, you know, believe in killing our kids and fighting the system by, by killing everyone and getting us all to kill each other.
[03:18:06.300 --> 03:18:11.300]  We're not even judging people that have had abortions. We're just saying the globalists are pushing it for a bad reason.
[03:18:11.300 --> 03:18:16.300]  John Rappaport, big victory today. Great articles on Bilderberg at no more fake news.com.
[03:18:16.300 --> 03:18:21.300]  We commend you. I want to get you on soon about your books and just about things in general.
[03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:25.300]  45 second closing comment and Lee in.
[03:18:25.300 --> 03:18:27.300]  Don't forget about freedom, folks.
[03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:32.300]  This is not going away just because we had a great victory right now.
[03:18:32.300 --> 03:18:34.300]  They're coming back for more.
[03:18:34.300 --> 03:18:39.300]  They're going to pass these treaties. They're going to do whatever they possibly can to do it.
[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:46.300]  And they have to know that millions of us are awake and we're not going to take it.
[03:18:46.300 --> 03:18:47.300]  Absolutely not.
[03:18:47.300 --> 03:18:53.300]  It's just such a fake celebrity culture where they can just celebrate being conned and having no future.
[03:18:53.300 --> 03:18:57.300]  And so then people love the globalism condom because it's their identity.
[03:18:57.300 --> 03:19:05.300]  You adopt it and then defend it when it's your shackles. It's just total idiocy, Leigh Ann.
[03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:06.300]  Right, absolutely.
[03:19:06.300 --> 03:19:14.300]  And that's why we can't be distracted by everything they've got going on out there because they do want to bring back this whole TPP and TPA as early as next week.
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:17.300]  They're just going to keep on bringing it back around, wearing us down.
[03:19:17.300 --> 03:19:28.300]  What it is about global governance, putting it in place with this TPP, and the key is that it's going to be a six-year fast-track authorization.
[03:19:28.300 --> 03:19:32.300]  So the next president will have, you know, it's a living document. They can do whatever they want.
[03:19:32.300 --> 03:19:36.300]  Yeah, that's one reason the Democrats didn't do this. We're not giving a Republican dictatorial power for four years.
[03:19:36.300 --> 03:19:38.300]  I mean, you don't give anyone that.
[03:19:38.300 --> 03:19:39.300]  Right.
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:41.300]  Leigh Ann McAdoove, great job.
[03:19:41.300 --> 03:19:42.300]  Who's hosting the news tonight?
[03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:43.300]  Me.
[03:19:43.300 --> 03:19:48.300]  Leigh Ann McAdoove, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv, great job, Ravelport, great job, crew.
[03:19:48.300 --> 03:19:49.300]  See you this Sunday.
[03:19:49.300 --> 03:19:52.300]  Lord Willen, don't take the show for granted, folks.
[03:19:52.300 --> 03:19:53.300]  I know I don't.
[03:19:53.300 --> 03:19:54.300]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:19:54.300 --> 03:20:14.300]  Thanks for joining us.
