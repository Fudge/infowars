[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:38.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.360 --> 00:39.360]  We are live.
[00:39.360 --> 00:42.920]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:42.920 --> 00:52.640]  It is, of course, the first day of June 2009, already into the halfway point of the year.
[00:52.640 --> 00:55.520]  Not technically, but already into the sixth month of the year.
[00:55.520 --> 01:00.320]  I think it's coming up on the 15th, half of this year, what have elapsed.
[01:00.320 --> 01:08.080]  Absolutely incredible, ladies and gentlemen, 2009 is already getting long in the tooth.
[01:08.080 --> 01:12.720]  Okay, we had Jesse Ventura on about a week and a half ago, but I wanted to get him on
[01:12.720 --> 01:18.000]  for a full hour so we could pick his brain about a host of issues and get his political
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.800]  perspective on a lot of things that are happening.
[01:20.800 --> 01:27.840]  And also, try to nudge him along in the 1776 direction with the information we have.
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.560]  We've already influenced him quite a bit, and he is influential and gets a lot of face
[01:31.560 --> 01:34.160]  time on mainstream television.
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.240]  And so, it's always great to have Jesse Ventura on the show.
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.360]  That is coming up in about two and a half hours from now.
[01:42.360 --> 01:46.920]  He'll be with us for one hour, and we'll open the phones up and take a few calls as
[01:46.920 --> 01:47.920]  well.
[01:47.920 --> 01:57.360]  We'll have open phones today at 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57.360 --> 02:01.560]  You know, I tried to look for it this morning, but I only had about five minutes to look.
[02:01.560 --> 02:07.320]  I was so busy, but at about 7.30 this morning, I spent a few minutes looking for it and couldn't
[02:07.320 --> 02:08.320]  find it.
[02:08.320 --> 02:13.880]  I got up to learn, what we already knew was going to happen, and it happened, bankruptcy
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.400]  for the once biggest corporation in the world, General Motors.
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.400]  But we traded that in for Slave Martin Google.
[02:23.400 --> 02:28.520]  And I spent about five, ten minutes looking for the countless radio shows I did, and I
[02:28.520 --> 02:34.440]  got attacked for it, saying General Motors will be bankrupt within two years, started
[02:34.440 --> 02:36.920]  saying it two years ago.
[02:36.920 --> 02:40.320]  And that was because I'd seen a lot of different business reports and government documents
[02:40.320 --> 02:46.720]  and globalist plans to bankrupt General Motors and then use it as a tool of federal control
[02:46.720 --> 02:47.720]  in the U.S.
[02:47.720 --> 02:55.720]  That is the remains of it, the skeleton of it, to menace like some walking dead zombie
[02:55.720 --> 03:02.960]  of the people, as a government vehicle, the husk of what it formerly was, and that the
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.720]  rest of it would be moved to Brazil and China, in fact, Bob Chapman was one of my sources
[03:08.720 --> 03:15.400]  for that, saying that two years ago, in fact, we can dig up his newsletter, but the issue
[03:15.400 --> 03:24.640]  is we got attacked a lot for that, and now it is bankrupt by design, but then we'll
[03:24.640 --> 03:29.120]  have people email us and call us and say, oh, no, it's bankrupt, but not by design.
[03:29.120 --> 03:36.840]  And then as they publicly see it move to Brazil and China, they will deny we ever said it
[03:36.840 --> 03:39.560]  was going to be moved to Brazil and China.
[03:39.560 --> 03:45.120]  So the 30 billion bailout money, that's going to be to move it offshore and then to ship
[03:45.120 --> 03:51.040]  in these toasters with wheels, these little cardboard boxes that buzz around at 45 miles
[03:51.040 --> 03:56.320]  an hour and are so much more dangerous than regular cars.
[03:56.320 --> 04:01.160]  This is government taking over everything, but it's not socialism.
[04:01.160 --> 04:07.320]  The media keeps saying, oh, we're Marxist-Leninists now, no, we're not private corporate Gordon
[04:07.320 --> 04:13.520]  Gekko fictional types, who are really people like Ted Turner and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers
[04:13.520 --> 04:22.800]  and George Soros are using the envelope of government to give them cash and power to
[04:22.800 --> 04:26.520]  carry out their looting operations.
[04:26.520 --> 04:33.440]  Imagine what Gordon Gekko of Wall Street fame with Charlie Sheen would do if he had an army
[04:33.440 --> 04:36.600]  of regulators and SWAT teams to back him up.
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.320]  Speaking of SWAT teams, the full story with a whole bunch of eyewitnesses in the police
[04:40.320 --> 04:44.360]  report is now out from Oklahoma attacking the paramedics.
[04:44.360 --> 04:47.440]  It was worse than we originally said.
[04:47.440 --> 04:50.960]  The paramedics didn't touch the God kings.
[04:50.960 --> 04:54.440]  The police were choking them with pleasure.
[04:54.440 --> 05:00.680]  Just out of the clear blue, totally psychopathic, this is tyranny.
[05:00.680 --> 05:04.480]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly
[05:04.480 --> 05:06.480]  bacteria and viruses?

[05:59.040 --> 06:04.480]  Complaining needs in the New World Order's war against humanity.
[06:04.480 --> 06:07.440]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[06:07.440 --> 06:11.960]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[06:11.960 --> 06:13.280]  us would like to see.
[06:13.280 --> 06:18.440]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[06:18.440 --> 06:19.840]  of the American people.
[06:19.840 --> 06:24.200]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[06:24.200 --> 06:29.280]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[06:29.280 --> 06:37.400]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[06:37.400 --> 06:39.080]  It's not about left to right.
[06:39.080 --> 06:40.960]  It's about a one-world government.
[06:40.960 --> 06:47.880]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.

[06:56.080 --> 07:01.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[07:01.920 --> 07:04.880]  Hi this is Steve Shank, eFoods does it again.

[07:39.680 --> 07:40.680]  worry about.

[08:02.120 --> 08:08.680]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.680 --> 08:23.680]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:23.680 --> 08:29.680]  Okay, here are the headlines that will be detailed today in the next three hours, 52
[08:29.680 --> 08:30.680]  minutes.
[08:30.680 --> 08:35.080]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura joins us for a full hour coming up later in the
[08:35.080 --> 08:37.600]  transmission.
[08:37.600 --> 08:39.960]  Full motors files for bankruptcy.
[08:39.960 --> 08:46.720]  They were laughed at two and a half years ago, detailing that now it's mainstream news.
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.120]  The globalists bragged in multiple publications, we need to repost those articles we wrote
[08:51.120 --> 08:56.520]  years ago, that they plan to butcher the main industries of the United States.
[08:56.520 --> 09:00.600]  Oh, yes, NAFTA and GATT, we're going to be great for America.
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.040]  You're now seeing the aftermath of it by design and the very same crew that engineered it
[09:04.040 --> 09:10.240]  all are now saying, set up a bank of the world that you will pay your carbon taxes to, private
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.000]  families, to the gores and others, and that you will have milk and honey.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.880]  And when things are only worse, 10 years from now, remember, they always create a bigger
[09:20.880 --> 09:25.880]  crisis, offer a solution, the public stumbles forward and goes along with it.
[09:25.880 --> 09:28.640]  Even if we don't go along with it, they still enforce it.
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.560]  This is rogue global criminal government.
[09:33.560 --> 09:41.360]  Full motors files for bankruptcy on the heels of Chrysler, Geithner tells China its dollar
[09:41.360 --> 09:43.160]  assets are safe.
[09:43.160 --> 09:50.240]  This out of Reuters is the entire world moves away from the dollar all by design.
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.120]  But as the Federal Reserve has said many times the last five years, they want a slow implosion,
[09:55.120 --> 10:01.320]  a slow death of the United States so they can slowly consolidate the wealth and so you
[10:01.320 --> 10:08.720]  don't riot, and that's not just me saying that, that's Bloomberg financial today.
[10:08.720 --> 10:14.960]  Zolik warns stimulus, sugar high won't stem unemployment, World Bank President Robert
[10:14.960 --> 10:19.400]  Zolik warned policymakers that fiscal stimulus plans are insufficient to turn around the
[10:19.400 --> 10:26.040]  real economy and rising joblessness threatens to set off political unrest across the globe.
[10:26.040 --> 10:32.080]  The paramilitary forces stand by to suppress the public while the transference of liberty
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.680]  to absolute tyranny is affected.
[10:36.680 --> 10:40.080]  Stand by for a complete enslavement unless you resist.
[10:40.080 --> 10:45.240]  Stand by, stand by.
[10:45.240 --> 10:48.960]  Prabhu crows American capitalism gone with a whimper.
[10:48.960 --> 10:51.160]  This is not capitalism.
[10:51.160 --> 10:54.680]  This is not socialism taking over America.
[10:54.680 --> 10:57.100]  This is piracy.
[10:57.100 --> 11:01.680]  When a group of pirates pulled up along your cargo ship and robs you, it's not socialism
[11:01.680 --> 11:04.000]  or communism or fascism.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.520]  It's rule of the gun-ism.
[11:08.520 --> 11:14.200]  But while you're busy arguing about left and right and so demyre and the rest of them,
[11:14.200 --> 11:19.840]  while we're busy playing racial politics, the New World Order is crushing us no matter
[11:19.840 --> 11:23.440]  what color you are.
[11:23.440 --> 11:27.760]  It must be said that like the breaking of a great dam, the American descent into Marxism
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.600]  is happening with breathtaking speed against the backdrop of passive hapless sheeple.
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.200]  They're using our terms at Pravda now.
[11:38.200 --> 11:39.200]  Pravda.
[11:39.200 --> 11:42.560]  Excuse me, dear reader, I meant people.
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.760]  True, the situation has been well prepared and off for the past century, especially the
[11:48.760 --> 11:52.760]  past 20 years, and it goes into this.
[11:52.760 --> 11:55.400]  On the heels of these type reports, here's the Wall Street Journal.
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.920]  This is a deception.
[11:58.920 --> 12:06.440]  Lawmakers build taxpayers for TVs, cameras, lexices, and it's true that the average house
[12:06.440 --> 12:14.440]  member gets five times what the average social security payer gets out of government that
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.800]  we've supposedly paid in, that all immediately goes offshore to come back and buy off our
[12:18.800 --> 12:25.160]  local politicians and buy off infrastructure, and it's true that the senators get even more
[12:25.160 --> 12:28.840]  than that, and it's true they're corrupt and exempt themselves from most laws and don't
[12:28.840 --> 12:33.200]  read the bills they sign that are written by lobbyists, and it's true they're a group
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.920]  of criminals and it's all a big joke to them.
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.480]  It's all true, and it's true that the exact same scandals going on in England with the
[12:44.480 --> 12:50.960]  parliament, with houses, and cars, and credit cards, and fancy nightly dinners, and golf
[12:50.960 --> 12:56.600]  club memberships, country club memberships, but that's all a distraction.
[12:56.600 --> 13:02.800]  The controlled globalist media owned by the big money laundering drug dealing central
[13:02.800 --> 13:09.440]  banks that have stolen 14 plus trillion in the U.S., over 10 trillion in Europe from
[13:09.440 --> 13:13.280]  their people, that the people have to then pay interest on, oh, here's all our money
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.840]  and we'll pay interest on it to give you the private money to come back and buy off our
[13:17.840 --> 13:24.800]  water treatment facilities, our dams, our lakes, our power plants, our police, our cities,
[13:24.800 --> 13:34.880]  our infrastructures, our ports, our corporations, Chrysler given like a nugget of fat plump
[13:34.880 --> 13:43.040]  prize with 20 billion of bailout money put on it as icing given to Bilderberg owned Fiat,
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.640]  the plump and juicy wreckage by design of General Motors, commandeered by the federal
[13:48.640 --> 13:52.800]  government being openly given to Brazil and China, just as the Panama Canal was given
[13:52.800 --> 14:00.840]  as a plump prize, booty, spoils of a captured slave nation, still drunk on fake American
[14:00.840 --> 14:06.200]  flags made in China by slaves and watching football strutting around, jutting out their
[14:06.200 --> 14:15.240]  chest acting tough American slave males, stupid slaves that think they're free, get
[14:15.240 --> 14:21.920]  to free your mind first, bubba, but you wouldn't do that, so now the physical slavery cometh.
[14:21.920 --> 14:27.920]  Now you and your wives and children will go into bondage to Pharaoh.
[14:27.920 --> 14:33.040]  You one of these slaves, you'll get it and you're so cowardly and so foolish, you will
[14:33.040 --> 14:41.080]  worship those that enslave you because you're cowards, now some of you aren't and it won't
[14:41.080 --> 14:46.880]  be a majority of us to take the republic back, but know this, the enemies all in, they've
[14:46.880 --> 14:52.240]  stake their names, their treasure, their blood, their future, their families, everything
[14:52.240 --> 14:58.800]  on bringing in a total tyranny worldwide, a new world order, and childlike delusions
[14:58.800 --> 15:04.280]  about this country aren't going to change that, only a full commitment of your blood,
[15:04.280 --> 15:11.720]  your name, your treasure, your family, your energy, that is the only thing that will meet
[15:11.720 --> 15:23.800]  this threat, and if you like the humiliation of slavery, then choose, but forget that you
[15:23.800 --> 15:29.280]  are our countrymen, and please don't call us the enemies of the republic and the traitors
[15:29.280 --> 15:35.480]  you dimwits.
[15:35.480 --> 15:39.400]  So what are they doing in England and the United States, they're talking about congressmen
[15:39.400 --> 15:47.720]  that get a $75,000 lexus with government money, or they'll talk about some congressman who
[15:47.720 --> 15:54.680]  was over the post office and stole $100,000 worth of stamps, petty thieves, how about
[15:54.680 --> 16:01.480]  the trillions, the congress is just a collection of little prostitutes who sell out to the
[16:01.480 --> 16:07.040]  biggest dollar signs with a few good men and women mixed in, rendered helpless and neutralized
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.880]  by the criminal gang that run the committee chairmanship, and so the establishment wants
[16:11.880 --> 16:17.200]  to further discredit congress and further have them off balance fighting for their political
[16:17.200 --> 16:21.440]  lives to do whatever they're told by the banker takeover masters, the people that control
[16:21.440 --> 16:28.600]  Obama and the republican leadership as well are telling the congressman, you do what we
[16:28.600 --> 16:34.800]  say when we say or that mistress you had 25 years ago comes out, you do what we say when
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.560]  we say or that boyfriend you had 10 years ago comes out, you do what we say when we
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.400]  say or we'll talk about that questionable campaign contribution you took when you were
[16:43.400 --> 16:48.800]  first running for office and didn't know the rules, you've seen the congressman we've
[16:48.800 --> 16:54.820]  burned, you do what we say when we say, you do everything you're told, you pass the cyber
[16:54.820 --> 17:03.200]  bullying act ending free speeches it's known, or your life is over politically, you appropriate
[17:03.200 --> 17:09.040]  the new trillions for the foreign offshore banks and the tens of billions to put up
[17:09.040 --> 17:17.520]  nice little package and bow and gift market, a little gift card to Brazil and China with
[17:17.520 --> 17:27.040]  general motors, you do what you're told now and you jump when we say jump or we'll burn
[17:27.040 --> 17:31.880]  every one of you, any of you that got a mustard stain on your tie, any of you that got a crooked
[17:31.880 --> 17:37.920]  toenail, any of you whose wives or husbands have been involved in any form of corruption
[17:37.920 --> 17:42.640]  because the feds themselves have written laws where everything's illegal, where everyone's
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.680]  a criminal, where no one can follow the laws, believe me I've looked at many of them, there's
[17:47.680 --> 17:52.000]  no way to follow the tax code the way it's written, there's no way to follow real estate
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  law the way it's written, there's no way to run for dog catcher the way the laws are
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.680]  written and not break the law, I ran for state rep for one week and when I saw what
[18:00.680 --> 18:12.760]  a dirty business it was and how impossible it was, I dropped out immediately.
[18:12.760 --> 18:17.360]  And so all the public is busy looking at the thieves stealing pennies, they won't look
[18:17.360 --> 18:25.320]  at the big masters that hold the chains that are around the necks of these bloated decadent
[18:25.320 --> 18:30.720]  cross-eyed attack dogs that we know as the Congress and this Sotomayor, I mean give me
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.320]  a break, I've been looking at her record, she always votes against free speech with
[18:35.320 --> 18:43.520]  newspapers you name it, student free speech, she always votes, there was one case with
[18:43.520 --> 18:52.320]  a fire department where the top scores were by whites and she ruled they all be fired
[18:52.320 --> 18:58.800]  and people with lower test scores be hired, she openly believes no one should be able
[18:58.800 --> 19:04.120]  to own firearms in federal appellate court rulings, those are all on record and of course
[19:04.120 --> 19:11.200]  she said a Latina woman is better than a white person, she's on record, it's what she said
[19:11.200 --> 19:16.040]  and we're meant to debate it and discuss it and all fight with each other all day, put
[19:16.040 --> 19:20.560]  the liberal poverty pimps always do, they're the racist, they're the people that deal in
[19:20.560 --> 19:30.160]  race and tribalism and divide and conquer, so we'll talk about that coming up.
[19:30.160 --> 19:34.360]  Also Iranian officials defuse bomb and plane toilet, what's that really about, well it
[19:34.360 --> 19:39.480]  dovetails with this out of Reuters, Iranian official blames US and deadly mosque bombing
[19:39.480 --> 19:44.740]  and the big news of the day, cyber security is framework for total government regulation
[19:44.740 --> 19:50.880]  and control of our lives, an absolute tyranny, first I'll take your phone calls when we
[19:50.880 --> 19:56.760]  get back then I'll break all this and a lot more down, very important broadcast today
[19:56.760 --> 20:06.200]  and I am fired up and ready out of the gates.
[20:06.200 --> 20:10.080]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products in health
[20:10.080 --> 20:16.520]  aids, do you think they endorse these products for free, I don't think so, I'm here to tell

[20:49.640 --> 21:00.920]  but the excess around your, anyway, life change tea, it speaks for itself, that's getthetea.com.
[21:00.920 --> 21:06.840]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear, we've
[21:06.840 --> 21:13.000]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.320]  as well funded.
[21:14.320 --> 21:19.480]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[21:19.480 --> 21:20.480]  of the American people.
[21:20.480 --> 21:26.520]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election, if you have a demagogue
[21:26.520 --> 21:31.680]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a
[21:31.680 --> 21:37.000]  group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.720]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government, this film documents
[21:41.720 --> 21:48.680]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda, get your copy of the Obama
[21:48.680 --> 21:55.640]  deception today at infowars.com or download it at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[21:55.640 --> 21:59.080]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[21:59.080 --> 22:04.560]  Gold, it's like nothing else on earth, from the Romans through the Renaissance, from the
[22:04.560 --> 22:10.520]  industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time, for 6000 years
[22:10.520 --> 22:13.200]  gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[22:13.200 --> 22:17.360]  According to the World Gold Council in the US Mint, demand is at an all time high the
[22:17.360 --> 22:21.920]  stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a
[22:21.920 --> 22:25.680]  fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[22:59.640 --> 23:03.880]  This is Alex Jones for American Tax Settlement, we have received news that the IRS is currently

[24:03.240 --> 24:09.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[24:09.800 --> 24:13.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[24:13.760 --> 24:19.920]  That's right, it's a war being waged by the state itself owned by a private crime syndicate
[24:19.920 --> 24:21.320]  against free humanity.
[24:21.320 --> 24:27.040]  They wage wars with their pharmaceuticals, the poisons and the water in the air, the
[24:27.040 --> 24:31.400]  government seizing people's children by over a million poor souls a year here in the United
[24:31.400 --> 24:32.400]  States alone.
[24:32.400 --> 24:35.020]  It's the same system worldwide.
[24:35.020 --> 24:37.840]  They wage wars with their monetary system against us.
[24:37.840 --> 24:40.540]  They wage war by brainwashing the public.
[24:40.540 --> 24:45.200]  They wage war by attacking the family and turning children against their parents in the public
[24:45.200 --> 24:46.200]  schools.
[24:46.200 --> 24:50.680]  They wage war on you a million different ways and then teach you to worship them and to
[24:50.680 --> 24:52.720]  love tyranny.
[24:52.720 --> 24:56.300]  Warrantless wiretaps is tyranny.
[24:56.300 --> 24:58.680]  Children being trained to tattle on their parents is tyranny.
[24:58.680 --> 25:01.360]  The people being disarmed is tyranny.
[25:01.360 --> 25:08.800]  Our criminal government launching illegal wars without Congress declaring war is tyranny.
[25:08.800 --> 25:12.760]  The casual society control grid is tyranny.
[25:12.760 --> 25:17.360]  The paramilitary police tasering old ladies and then laughing about it is tyranny.
[25:17.360 --> 25:24.200]  The police in Oklahoma attacking paramedics, we now have the police report and the eyewitness
[25:24.200 --> 25:25.360]  reports.
[25:25.360 --> 25:28.960]  It's now confirmed as exactly what the video originally appeared.
[25:28.960 --> 25:32.400]  The ambulance wouldn't get out of the police car's way, it couldn't, it had cars in front
[25:32.400 --> 25:33.900]  of it.
[25:33.900 --> 25:37.680]  So the police went around on the shoulder and then later chased the ambulance down after
[25:37.680 --> 25:44.960]  they'd gone to their call, got them out, put the EMP in a headlock, ran around the side,
[25:44.960 --> 25:45.960]  opened it up.
[25:45.960 --> 25:49.200]  The other one got out of the back who was tending to the sick woman, physically attacked
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.880]  him.
[25:52.880 --> 25:59.280]  The EMP took the physical attack and is now being charged, they're saying they're about
[25:59.280 --> 26:02.560]  to charge him for assaulting the cops.
[26:02.560 --> 26:09.800]  A nutcase cop pulls him out, begins shoving him and choking him.
[26:09.800 --> 26:14.840]  He is smart enough, no, he'd probably get killed to sit there and take it.
[26:14.840 --> 26:19.320]  And the cops have to say, no, we're always right, we're God in front of everyone and
[26:19.320 --> 26:22.560]  see they're going to get crazier and crazier.
[26:22.560 --> 26:27.280]  And like Nero, burning Rome and fiddling while he does it, laughing about it, it turns out
[26:27.280 --> 26:34.040]  this cop, you know, his, his dad, he's a big judge in the town and turns out he doesn't
[26:34.040 --> 26:39.920]  like ambulances and has a long history of this.
[26:39.920 --> 26:46.120]  And they're going to say, that's the way it is, we're charging you, boy.
[26:46.120 --> 26:52.920]  And so the insanity continues and the good police are discredited because the system
[26:52.920 --> 26:59.960]  protects the crazy bad ones and the good cops leave the force and tyranny accelerates.
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.520]  And then corruption accelerates because no part of the criminal system can report on
[27:04.520 --> 27:10.520]  or stop any other part of the criminal system and the very worst in society get in control
[27:10.520 --> 27:16.560]  and the big government PR firms brainwash the public that it's all good and it gets
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.920]  worse and worse and worse and then offshore banks come in and rob and carpet bag and
[27:21.920 --> 27:29.200]  steal everything and society collapses and we become like North Korea or Mexico.
[27:29.200 --> 27:34.120]  We become like Guatemala.
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.120]  We become like Vietnam.
[27:37.120 --> 27:39.080]  We become like Cambodia.
[27:39.080 --> 27:43.240]  We become like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of other nations or a tiny corrupt
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.600]  elite with a paramilitary force rules over the mass of poor pathetic slaves with no future
[27:49.600 --> 27:51.400]  for your children.
[27:51.400 --> 27:59.680]  No honor, no decency, no rule of law, rule of the Napoleonic strong man, rule of the
[27:59.680 --> 28:10.480]  king rat, rule of tyranny.
[28:10.480 --> 28:18.880]  That is the system that we now live in.
[28:18.880 --> 28:23.160]  This is the country that we have become.
[28:23.160 --> 28:28.600]  The whole world is being managed and administered by the very same group of technocrats.
[28:28.600 --> 28:34.320]  That's why we have all the same government programs with the exact same names are similar
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.440]  from Australia to England to Canada, the United States to Western Europe and now under globalization.
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.800]  They say you get the IMF and World Bank fiat currency and liquidity and loans if you adopt
[28:45.800 --> 28:47.480]  and standardize.
[28:47.480 --> 28:54.920]  We are now under a global tyranny by a group of eugenicist technocrats who believe they
[28:54.920 --> 29:00.640]  are God and who believe that they are engineering society for the betterment of themselves and
[29:00.640 --> 29:05.680]  their progeny, the ultimate control freaks.
[29:05.680 --> 29:08.720]  And so all the major corporations are going to go bankrupt.
[29:08.720 --> 29:12.320]  The government is going to come in and take control of the bankruptcies and hand what's
[29:12.320 --> 29:18.640]  left of it to the corporate writers that captain the global ship of state known as the New
[29:18.640 --> 29:25.800]  World Order and a great new dark age of depravity and oppression and humiliation and bondage
[29:25.800 --> 29:29.720]  is upon us.
[29:29.720 --> 29:32.520]  The cage doors are slamming shut.
[29:32.520 --> 29:38.360]  The global cashless society is going into place with a worldwide cyber security grid.
[29:38.360 --> 29:43.480]  We'll take your calls and then get into all the news as I mentioned on the other side.
[29:43.480 --> 29:50.960]  This is the GCN radio network, I am Alex Jones, you're fighting the new dark age.
[29:50.960 --> 29:54.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.760 --> 30:00.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.520 --> 30:04.760]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no
[30:04.760 --> 30:09.800]  longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[30:09.800 --> 30:15.200]  These have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[30:15.200 --> 30:19.720]  Deficiency in any one or more important minerals actually results in disease.

[30:59.120 --> 31:07.560]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.560 --> 31:11.960]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all
[31:11.960 --> 31:13.400]  of us would like to see.
[31:13.400 --> 31:18.560]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[31:18.560 --> 31:19.960]  of the American people.
[31:19.960 --> 31:24.320]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since B1 in this election.
[31:24.320 --> 31:29.440]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[31:29.440 --> 31:37.560]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[31:37.560 --> 31:41.120]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[31:41.120 --> 31:48.040]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[32:00.880 --> 32:03.880]  You worry, if you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[32:03.880 --> 32:07.200]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[32:07.200 --> 32:10.600]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's
[32:10.600 --> 32:12.120]  a learning curve.
[32:12.120 --> 32:14.200]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[32:14.200 --> 32:17.680]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[32:17.680 --> 32:19.480]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[32:19.480 --> 32:22.280]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[32:22.280 --> 32:26.000]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.

[32:39.200 --> 32:40.800]  in weeks, not years.
[32:40.800 --> 32:43.080]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[32:43.080 --> 32:45.320]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[32:45.320 --> 32:50.200]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[32:50.200 --> 32:52.560]  Right now, knowledge is power.

[32:53.560 --> 33:20.760]  I think a storm's coming.
[33:20.760 --> 33:31.600]  The war is over, everybody knows the good guy's lost, everybody knows the fight was fixed,
[33:31.600 --> 33:42.520]  the poor stay poor, the rich get rich, that's how it goes, everybody knows.
[33:42.520 --> 33:46.320]  Yeah, we're down but we're not out.
[33:46.320 --> 33:53.360]  And we just get focused, get educated on the facts and take action and expose these criminals
[33:53.360 --> 34:00.640]  and point out that despite all their titles and all their finery, there's nothing but
[34:00.640 --> 34:03.280]  scallywag trash.
[34:03.280 --> 34:04.760]  We can turn this around.
[34:04.760 --> 34:07.600]  If we don't, it's going to get bad.
[34:07.600 --> 34:14.560]  The globalists are clearly setting up and planning hot war here in the United States, hot purges.
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.440]  They know there's so much liberty and freedom left here that it's going to take a lot of
[34:18.440 --> 34:20.120]  intimidation and a lot of killing.
[34:20.120 --> 34:25.720]  A lot of you out there that serve the system are going to find out you're not pets of the
[34:25.720 --> 34:26.720]  new world order.
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.200]  Let's go to your phone calls, I'm going to go quickly to your calls, so please have
[34:30.200 --> 34:33.320]  your questions and comments ready, we appreciate you calling.
[34:33.320 --> 34:35.560]  Birdman in Florida, you're on the air.
[34:35.560 --> 34:38.680]  Hey, brother Alex, how you doing?
[34:38.680 --> 34:39.680]  Good Birdman.
[34:39.680 --> 34:43.800]  Great, I really appreciate your program so much.
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.320]  If you give me a couple of relaxed minutes, I want to ask you if I can tell people about
[34:48.320 --> 34:50.320]  my old punk band 1984.
[34:50.320 --> 34:53.320]  Okay, go ahead and tell us about your punk band.
[34:53.320 --> 35:00.840]  Well, from 81 to 85, that's all we ever sung about with everything that you guys talk about.
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.840]  And I would like to get someone to put overdubbed some of your voices on some blank tracks from
[35:05.840 --> 35:09.960]  your programs to scream about the same thing.
[35:09.960 --> 35:17.880]  It's MySpace.com forward slash, you spell it out, it's 1984, and I'll send them some
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.480]  blank tracks and we'll let them know about it.
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.200]  Well, there's a lot of people getting the word out through music and that's why the
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.520]  establishment is moving in with an attempt to suppress liberty and freedom and they're
[35:30.520 --> 35:34.320]  admitting they spy on everybody now to create a chilling effect.
[35:34.320 --> 35:39.920]  We just have to throw caution to the wind and take action.
[35:39.920 --> 35:45.160]  Now, in 1913, they stopped Goldback currency.
[35:45.160 --> 35:50.480]  Would you say that America hadn't existed since then and everything that's happened and built
[35:50.480 --> 35:54.200]  upon since that time is a perversion?
[35:54.200 --> 36:00.000]  Well, to be clear, we were still on somewhat of a Goldback currency in 1913.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.040]  They did the same year give us a 1% income tax and then they slowly ratcheted that up
[36:05.040 --> 36:11.520]  by the early 1950s, it was 10% to 15% depending on your tax bracket.
[36:11.520 --> 36:15.040]  So the country was built without the income tax, they always say, we need the income tax.
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.280]  It all goes to interest to offshore private banks.
[36:19.280 --> 36:23.840]  But by the 70s, they did take us off the gold and silver standard.
[36:23.840 --> 36:32.680]  Up until that time, you could go in reportedly and get your Federal Reserve notes turned
[36:32.680 --> 36:41.080]  in for legal tender currency, actual metal, silver or gold, but they phased that out.
[36:41.080 --> 36:44.840]  Now, there were periods and there were you couldn't own gold though.
[36:44.840 --> 36:51.800]  Like 1933, they declared the War Powers Act and we officially, publicly, went under federal
[36:51.800 --> 36:59.040]  reorganization, martial law, just like Europe later went into receivership under the Marshall
[36:59.040 --> 37:00.040]  plan.
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.280]  You went under a similar Marshall plan to the private bank of England through the Federal
[37:04.280 --> 37:09.640]  Reserve and everyone had to turn their gold in for half price and they were given paper
[37:09.640 --> 37:10.640]  back.
[37:10.640 --> 37:17.960]  Technically, it's cloth, cotton, but we call it paper, the script or dollars, dollar bills
[37:17.960 --> 37:21.960]  and the different denominations thereof.
[37:21.960 --> 37:30.880]  And what happened there was then the private bankers gave themselves our gold publicly.
[37:30.880 --> 37:35.360]  Now, a lot of Americans weren't total brainwashed slaves, so they held onto their gold and a
[37:35.360 --> 37:40.280]  few years later, gold doubled in prices and then people that had buried their gold ended
[37:40.280 --> 37:42.120]  up doing quite nicely.
[37:42.120 --> 37:46.760]  But around half the public, depending on which study you look at, did turn in their gold.
[37:46.760 --> 37:52.800]  Most people turned in a little bit, but the paramilitary police would drop by and take
[37:52.800 --> 37:56.400]  you to jail if they knew you had gold and they didn't turn it in, so I appreciate your
[37:56.400 --> 37:57.920]  call bird man.
[37:57.920 --> 38:05.200]  That's the freedom of America to our beloved Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[38:05.200 --> 38:08.760]  Let's talk to Tex in Texas, Tex here on the air.
[38:08.760 --> 38:09.760]  God bless you, Alex.
[38:09.760 --> 38:16.280]  I'm an old man and I'm a long time listener to your show and I've learned a lot from
[38:16.280 --> 38:17.680]  you and your staff.
[38:17.680 --> 38:23.880]  Alex, I've been studying the Illuminati, you were a lot of crowd, whatever they want to
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.760]  call themselves for over 50 years, actually 60 years.
[38:27.760 --> 38:29.680]  Are you there, Alex?
[38:29.680 --> 38:31.240]  Yes, I'm listening to you.
[38:31.240 --> 38:32.240]  Okay.
[38:32.240 --> 38:33.640]  At first I was confused.
[38:33.640 --> 38:40.600]  Why did rich men want to destroy the system that allowed them to accumulate their wealth?
[38:40.600 --> 38:46.440]  In the 1950s, it was a fellow over in Florida who put it together for me with his Don Bell
[38:46.440 --> 38:47.440]  reports.
[38:47.440 --> 38:50.120]  I don't know if you're familiar with Don Bell.
[38:50.120 --> 38:56.640]  I am vaguely familiar, yes, but he had quite a following in Texas at one time and I put
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.720]  you in Tex Mars right up there with Don and that's the highest praise you can get out
[39:01.720 --> 39:02.720]  of my household.
[39:02.720 --> 39:04.120]  Well, I appreciate that.
[39:04.120 --> 39:05.120]  I'm flattered.
[39:05.120 --> 39:16.240]  You got me identified, Tex Mars knows who I am, by the way, he's sort of a friend.
[39:16.240 --> 39:20.000]  You got to bear in mind, this praise comes from an old laggy and I was hammered all my
[39:20.000 --> 39:26.640]  life that nothing good can come out of Austin and you can prove me wrong.
[39:26.640 --> 39:33.080]  Unfortunately, I can count on my fingers the number of people who believe me and bear in
[39:33.080 --> 39:39.120]  mind, I'm not an ostrich, people who know me know where I stand and what I'm warning
[39:39.120 --> 39:40.120]  them about.
[39:40.120 --> 39:44.560]  Well, people, a lot of them have had the fight taken out of them, they've been mesmerized
[39:44.560 --> 39:47.800]  by entertainment and the culture because things were so good.
[39:47.800 --> 39:49.960]  I mean, we know this happens historically.
[39:49.960 --> 39:55.400]  When you have plenty, people become decadent and the point you started out with, why would
[39:55.400 --> 39:58.800]  rich men want to destroy a system that made them rich?
[39:58.800 --> 40:04.720]  Because they openly write and say that this free market system would produce competition
[40:04.720 --> 40:08.760]  for them in the future and they want it all sewed up.
[40:08.760 --> 40:14.160]  So they want something more like Mexico with a tiny elite class over a bunch of slaves.
[40:14.160 --> 40:16.920]  And unfortunately, that's now what is happening here.
[40:16.920 --> 40:20.080]  I agree with you.
[40:20.080 --> 40:27.280]  So I'm a man of very meagre means and limited abilities, but I have learned to connect the
[40:27.280 --> 40:28.280]  dots.
[40:28.280 --> 40:34.840]  And I do not consider myself an expert, but I know what I know because I've had good teachers.
[40:34.840 --> 40:36.160]  And that's why I called you.
[40:36.160 --> 40:42.400]  I've got two dots that I need help on if you could help me if they are connected.
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.440]  The first dot is that I'm familiar with H.G. Wells and I know who you are, his 1930s essay,
[40:47.440 --> 40:54.720]  The Shape of Things to Come, in which he predicted, with great accuracy, World War II, and that
[40:54.720 --> 41:00.800]  this would be the Illuminati's second attempt at the world government.
[41:00.800 --> 41:07.800]  Then he went on in this essay to embellish Albert Pike's original plan made in the 1800s.
[41:07.800 --> 41:08.800]  1877.
[41:08.800 --> 41:09.800]  Okay.
[41:09.800 --> 41:11.800]  I knew you're mine.
[41:11.800 --> 41:12.800]  Yeah.
[41:12.800 --> 41:17.640]  The three world wars all planned out exactly as the last two have happened, the next to
[41:17.640 --> 41:19.320]  be in the Middle East.
[41:19.320 --> 41:20.320]  Right.
[41:20.320 --> 41:22.880]  Well, he said specifically that it would come out of Basra.
[41:22.880 --> 41:26.480]  And I don't know if you're aware that they made a movie, the English made a movie of that
[41:26.480 --> 41:27.480]  essay.
[41:27.480 --> 41:28.480]  Yes.
[41:28.480 --> 41:29.480]  An old black and white movie.
[41:29.480 --> 41:32.720]  It was made before World War II.
[41:32.720 --> 41:37.440]  My second dot is a few weeks ago you had Steve Quayle.
[41:37.440 --> 41:45.000]  I really wasn't that familiar with his work, but I resonate with it, his absolute Christian
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.200]  perspective of what's going on.
[41:48.200 --> 41:54.480]  He said kind of cryptically on your show that he had one more piece of information
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.320]  that would indicate to him that the globalists were ready to drop the hammer and start the
[41:59.320 --> 42:02.720]  bloody phase of that plan and programming.
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.920]  And I was wondering if off the air, did he tell you what he was talking about?
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.360]  And if you're at liberty to say what it is, are these two dots connected, I guess is my
[42:11.360 --> 42:12.360]  question.
[42:12.360 --> 42:15.520]  Well, it's all connected.
[42:15.520 --> 42:21.640]  And I appreciate your call, I've had a lot of discussions with Steve Offair and I'll
[42:21.640 --> 42:30.200]  have to think about the second dot before I answer it because Steve was specifically
[42:30.200 --> 42:36.480]  talking about the roundups, the martial law takeover.
[42:36.480 --> 42:40.680]  And he said that he hadn't gotten that last dot to go on air and say, this is definitely
[42:40.680 --> 42:41.680]  it.
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.720]  And he was saying it was probably either a dry run or this could be it.
[42:45.720 --> 42:46.800]  And that's what we said day one.
[42:46.800 --> 42:51.200]  We said either they're going for broke with this fair mongering or this is a dry run.
[42:51.200 --> 42:55.440]  And then they came out weeks later and said, yes, this is a beta test.
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.360]  We believe the next big one's coming and they're all getting ready for forced inoculations
[42:59.360 --> 43:07.080]  and martial law, according to CNN Fox News, the Associated Press.
[43:07.080 --> 43:12.160]  So they certainly are testing their federalization, testing their takeover.
[43:12.160 --> 43:18.280]  Going back to H.G. Wells, for those that don't know, he was a Fabian socialist in the model
[43:18.280 --> 43:29.560]  of Cecil Rhodes, Sir Cecil Rhodes, who was just a corporate front man publicly for the
[43:29.560 --> 43:35.320]  Saxe-Coburg gothers, the British slash German royal family.
[43:35.320 --> 43:38.640]  And he wrote the essay, the New World Order in 36.
[43:38.640 --> 43:42.200]  He wrote things to come or the shape of things to come the book.
[43:42.200 --> 43:46.440]  And then it was made into a movie, which is excellent even today that came out.
[43:46.440 --> 43:52.600]  I was in 1938, you write the book was in 33, going from memory here, but folks can look
[43:52.600 --> 43:53.600]  that up.
[43:53.600 --> 44:00.360]  In fact, the great part about having my crew, even before we go live at prisonplanet.tv,
[44:00.360 --> 44:06.360]  coming up here in about an hour and 15 minutes, they can Google stuff for me so I can talk
[44:06.360 --> 44:07.360]  while they Google.
[44:07.360 --> 44:15.080]  You guys turn my big screen on in here and search engine, H.G. Wells, the shape of things
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.480]  to come so I can get the year publishing date on that.
[44:19.480 --> 44:20.480]  Thank you.
[44:20.480 --> 44:24.440]  I really appreciate it.
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.040]  Doesn't matter why I obsess on little points like that, but I want to get the year right.
[44:29.040 --> 44:31.800]  I guess it does matter.
[44:31.800 --> 44:35.720]  One must train the brain to always be exactly accurate.
[44:35.720 --> 44:38.320]  The shape of things to come, 1933.
[44:38.320 --> 44:39.320]  Okay.
[44:39.320 --> 44:40.320]  Yeah.
[44:40.320 --> 44:41.320]  I was right.
[44:41.320 --> 44:45.200]  1933 and 36 for the New World Order.
[44:45.200 --> 44:50.920]  And then I believe the movie, H.G. Wells, Things to Come, was 38, but click on that.
[44:50.920 --> 44:52.160]  We'll see if I'm right there.
[44:52.160 --> 44:55.560]  I'm always testing my memory to try to keep it sharp.
[44:55.560 --> 44:57.400]  Things to come is under it.
[44:57.400 --> 45:02.960]  Okay, I digress.
[45:02.960 --> 45:13.240]  The point is, he was an open, admitted, one-world government pusher, and he believed in Darwinism
[45:13.240 --> 45:14.480]  and in social Darwinism.
[45:14.480 --> 45:18.520]  Now, you can believe in Darwinism and not believe in social Darwinism.
[45:18.520 --> 45:21.400]  I'm not getting into a debate about those two things here.
[45:21.400 --> 45:23.400]  Always hot button issues.
[45:23.400 --> 45:31.360]  See, I realize when I say a term, people out there are all pre-programmed to then either
[45:31.360 --> 45:39.520]  shut their minds or open their minds or to go through a pre-designated thought processes.
[45:39.520 --> 45:43.080]  Let's have open minds here.
[45:43.080 --> 45:45.240]  I'm just stating what they believe.
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.560]  Then you can decide whether you agree with them or not.
[45:48.560 --> 45:53.720]  I would make that decision morally, but also about where are you in that perspective?
[45:53.720 --> 45:55.720]  You may be a control freak.
[45:55.720 --> 45:59.480]  You may think you're powerful and cool and God's gift to the planet and have all the
[45:59.480 --> 46:01.360]  answers and everybody else is an idiot.
[46:01.360 --> 46:09.200]  You're arrogant, conceited, which I've found actually narrows vision and intellect, but
[46:09.200 --> 46:10.200]  whatever.
[46:10.200 --> 46:15.480]  A lot of people are drunk on delusions of grandeur.
[46:15.480 --> 46:19.400]  The issue is, if you're going to support social Darwinism, you should at least know
[46:19.400 --> 46:21.720]  that you're not part of the elite and you're being targeted.
[46:21.720 --> 46:29.320]  See, that's one of the biggest tricks of the social Darwinist is that they make it sound
[46:29.320 --> 46:34.560]  reasonable and they put you in the position of being one of the controllers.
[46:34.560 --> 46:36.760]  They say, hey, if you were king of the world, what would you do?
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.280]  And then, oh, well, of course, I would make the hard decision of exterminating a majority
[46:40.280 --> 46:47.120]  of people because most folks are dumb and stupid or fat or lazy or don't care about
[46:47.120 --> 46:48.880]  things and don't want to be informed.
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.560]  And so why should they be here consuming the earth and hurting the environment?
[46:52.560 --> 46:56.160]  Well, let me give you a newsflash.
[46:56.160 --> 47:01.640]  You number one are seen as scum by the elite, 99.9% of you.
[47:01.640 --> 47:07.960]  That's A. B, you're only given part of the eugenics view, the public view of positive
[47:07.960 --> 47:10.320]  and negative eugenics.
[47:10.320 --> 47:16.000]  I don't have time to do a treatise on this, so go look it up yourselves for those that
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.480]  don't know what it is.
[47:17.480 --> 47:19.720]  That has nothing to do with eugenics.
[47:19.720 --> 47:25.560]  Real eugenics is about dumbing down the mass and targeting those that would be intelligent
[47:25.560 --> 47:28.600]  and targeting them for extinction.
[47:28.600 --> 47:37.560]  This is a control freak system of scorched earth and salting the earth.
[47:37.560 --> 47:41.920]  You know, they don't come to conquer with the scientific dictatorship.
[47:41.920 --> 47:45.680]  They want to conquer us physically and economically to get the grid in.
[47:45.680 --> 47:49.840]  That's only phase one to roll in and kill us dead and hammers.
[47:49.840 --> 47:53.640]  You understand that good old boys and people that think they're rich and people think they're
[47:53.640 --> 47:55.000]  part of the establishment.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.400]  You are not part of the establishment.
[47:58.400 --> 47:59.520]  Stop thinking you are.
[47:59.520 --> 48:04.600]  The globalists write books and publications and white papers laughing at you fools how
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.000]  you've been co-opted.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.720]  That's the first thing one of these globalists or want to be globalists does is they talk
[48:10.720 --> 48:15.560]  about, oh, the elite like you, Alex, and the elite understand you, Alex, and you could
[48:15.560 --> 48:17.040]  be one of us.
[48:17.040 --> 48:18.640]  That's all you ever hear out of their mouths.
[48:18.640 --> 48:23.200]  It's a load of bull, and they're usually buying it themselves.
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.200]  Rothkopf's wrong with his article about his book, Super Class in the Washington Post.
[48:28.200 --> 48:29.720]  It's saying, yeah, there's a world government.
[48:29.720 --> 48:33.040]  Yeah, it's a tyranny, but it's for your best interest.
[48:33.040 --> 48:35.080]  And 6,000 of us run it.
[48:35.080 --> 48:38.480]  Just like the writer for the Financial Times of London says, yeah, there's a tyrannical
[48:38.480 --> 48:43.000]  world government, but it's for your best interest, and they have thousands of academics come
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.600]  out and endorse it.
[48:46.600 --> 48:48.200]  Those academics aren't part of it.
[48:48.200 --> 48:54.040]  Now, I'll tell you, somebody like Pionka is really dangerous because he says openly,
[48:54.040 --> 48:56.200]  I'm not worthy to live.
[48:56.200 --> 48:59.480]  I need to die, and so does my family.
[48:59.480 --> 49:09.360]  So that only a super elite humanoid, super homo sapien sapien can go on.
[49:09.360 --> 49:12.560]  You know, at the top there, I am prepared to kill myself.
[49:12.560 --> 49:16.000]  I am prepared for the great oneness that will come.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.520]  Don't worry, soon it will be here with us.
[49:18.520 --> 49:22.640]  Soon we'll have the control grid in place to release the great plague that will cleanse
[49:22.640 --> 49:26.760]  us, cleanse the earth of our wicked parasitic species.
[49:26.760 --> 49:33.400]  I mean, go read the white papers.
[49:33.400 --> 49:43.160]  All these arrogant, haughty, wannabe children of wealthy families, of billionaires who think
[49:43.160 --> 49:47.680]  everything's a joke and laugh at all the pain in the world.
[49:47.680 --> 49:49.800]  You are going to be skinned alive by the New World Order.
[49:49.800 --> 49:54.440]  I hope you understand that you're going to be impaled on the spikes that you sat there
[49:54.440 --> 50:00.280]  and laughed at others being impaled on it.
[50:00.280 --> 50:08.840]  This is the ultimate evil, the ultimate tyranny, the ultimate scientific dictatorship wrought
[50:08.840 --> 50:17.240]  in the furnaces of Hades, loosed on the planet.
[50:17.240 --> 50:21.440]  If you knew history, you would know that death and destruction and misery and pain is the
[50:21.440 --> 50:29.320]  norm, it is the ether in which we swim and rare, liberty is such an unbelievably precious
[50:29.320 --> 50:37.480]  thing and it's always paid for in rivers of blood.
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.320]  But you aren't even willing to speak out or stand up or be laughed at to fight for liberty
[50:41.320 --> 50:42.320]  or freedom.
[50:42.320 --> 50:48.000]  So you will be usurped, you will be overrun, you will be conquered, you will be put in
[50:48.000 --> 50:55.360]  chains, you will be killed and you'll be so drugged and mind controlled, you will love
[50:55.360 --> 51:00.920]  your captors as you're torn limb from limb.
[51:00.920 --> 51:05.640]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground
[51:05.640 --> 51:06.960]  up shells?
[51:06.960 --> 51:10.760]  Think about that, would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[51:10.760 --> 51:13.840]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[51:13.840 --> 51:19.000]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health, a delicious tasting
[51:19.000 --> 51:24.120]  chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.

[52:00.720 --> 52:04.920]  Hey folks Alex Jones here, I'm sitting on a special alert to all those out there listening
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.160]  with credit card debt and struggling to make payments, I'm going to give you a very important
[52:09.160 --> 52:12.880]  phone number, due to a declining economy and credit crisis.
[52:12.880 --> 52:18.000]  You now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.600]  by calling the bailout group.
[52:19.600 --> 52:24.440]  This program has already settled over $100 million of debt and are saving individual
[52:24.440 --> 52:26.840]  consumers thousands of dollars.
[52:26.840 --> 52:30.560]  Folks if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments,
[52:30.560 --> 52:33.000]  the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.760]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[52:37.760 --> 52:41.440]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this, the call is free and in 10 minutes they will
[52:41.440 --> 52:43.040]  show you how much you can save.
[52:43.040 --> 52:47.640]  Right over the phone with one simple call, let the bailout group bail you out of debt,
[52:47.640 --> 52:52.200]  reduce your payments by up to 60% and save you thousands of dollars today.
[52:52.200 --> 53:01.120]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554, 800-324-6554, the bailout group.
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.560]  West in a century ago half of the American public grew much of their own food, today
[53:05.560 --> 53:10.240]  it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food, during a great
[53:10.240 --> 53:15.520]  depression over 18 million people suffered from starvation and as America continues
[53:15.520 --> 53:21.080]  down its current path, for many the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[53:21.080 --> 53:25.880]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you
[53:25.880 --> 53:29.080]  save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store.
[53:29.080 --> 53:33.440]  Invest in your family's future by stocking up with your very own supply of seeds available
[53:33.440 --> 53:35.560]  from GetSeeds.net.
[53:35.560 --> 53:41.440]  Each order includes over 14,000 non-GMO chemical free seeds that will provide you with food
[53:41.440 --> 53:42.440]  for years.
[53:42.440 --> 53:50.800]  Call 877-394-6657 to get 100 varieties of our heirloom seeds for just $49.
[53:50.800 --> 54:05.600]  Once again, that's GetSeeds.net or call 877-394-6657 to establish your own food supply today.
[54:05.600 --> 54:11.160]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:11.160 --> 54:21.960]  Okay, I kind of went into a rant about HD Wells.
[54:21.960 --> 54:30.280]  That's the thing, I mean he didn't just write the foundation of what we know as modern science
[54:30.280 --> 54:37.640]  fiction, he admitted that the Eloi and the Morlocks, that that was an analogy of the
[54:37.640 --> 54:46.200]  global elite, evolutionary super-intelligent man-eating that basically keep small farms
[54:46.200 --> 54:51.560]  of Eloi that they physically eat on plantations.
[54:51.560 --> 54:57.000]  That's the analogy of what the elites do to us and how we're mindless and running around
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.240]  in our loincloths like savages being fed on by them, but he wrote non-fiction books about
[55:03.240 --> 55:04.240]  things to come.
[55:04.240 --> 55:10.000]  All heaven-plantable chips, everything will be one-child policies, eugenics, the majority
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.280]  of the public would have already been called, and he said there'll be a lot of beautiful
[55:15.280 --> 55:21.280]  young, gallant people that will die fighting the New World Order, and he's very sad that
[55:21.280 --> 55:27.760]  most of us have to be killed.
[55:27.760 --> 55:38.160]  You see, he was coming along right at the height of eugenics, right at the height of
[55:38.160 --> 55:43.640]  what is the foundation of what we live in today, the one-child policies, the tyranny,
[55:43.640 --> 55:49.680]  the control freaks, the quote, social welfare net that is a net, it is a slave grid, is
[55:49.680 --> 55:55.200]  a domestication grid, and you know pigs or sheep or cows, they don't know when they're
[55:55.200 --> 55:59.880]  out on the pasture on the back forties that they're going to be slaughtered, that they're
[55:59.880 --> 56:01.920]  being bred for slaughter.
[56:01.920 --> 56:07.720]  A horse when it's lived a long life of service to you, pulling the plow or whatever, it doesn't
[56:07.720 --> 56:12.360]  know when you decide to get rid of it when it's old, and its teeth have fallen out, that
[56:12.360 --> 56:21.400]  you're loading it onto a trailer, have it rendered into dog food, and the elite talk
[56:21.400 --> 56:22.400]  about us like that.
[56:22.400 --> 56:29.920]  And they say, you know, the people rebelling against us is as ridiculous as sheep rebelling
[56:29.920 --> 56:36.760]  against the practice of eating sheep, mutton.
[56:36.760 --> 56:41.040]  They say once their control grid's in place, and that's what I want to get into, I asked
[56:41.040 --> 56:47.680]  Paul Watson before he went to China, Paul Watson likes to travel once a year, he's going to
[56:47.680 --> 56:55.320]  China, his second visit there, and he'll be reporting on the North Korea situation from
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.280]  China for us with reports, killing multiple birds with one stone, but Steve Watson is
[57:00.280 --> 57:09.200]  minding the fort at info wars.net, prisonplanet.tv, and prisonplanet.com, as is Curt Nimoh and
[57:09.200 --> 57:15.200]  Aaron Dykes and others, but cyber security is framework for total government regulation
[57:15.200 --> 57:17.880]  and control of our lives.
[57:17.880 --> 57:23.200]  I want to go over that after I continue with calls, Justin, Tori, Alex, Rick disagreed,
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.760]  just hung up or I would have gone to him, Esa, John, and many others.
[57:28.760 --> 57:30.120]  So that is coming up.
[57:30.120 --> 57:37.800]  Before I end this hour, I really do want to encourage listeners to visit the secure online
[57:37.800 --> 57:43.080]  video bookstore for all the great videos and books that we carry, that I produce, but also
[57:43.080 --> 57:48.080]  the best videos and books I found out there about none, that are available at infowars.com.
[57:48.080 --> 57:53.800]  Not to mention all the Patriot t-shirts I was wearing on the beach down the Texas coast
[57:53.800 --> 58:00.520]  this weekend, my favorite shirt we've had made, the Minuteman that says, live, free, or die
[58:00.520 --> 58:03.040]  on it, and people kept asking, what's live, free, or die mean?
[58:03.040 --> 58:08.480]  And I said, it's what America means, and some people would, you'd see cop types walking
[58:08.480 --> 58:11.040]  with their wives and they'd see it and get actually scared.
[58:11.040 --> 58:14.160]  And my wife's like, well, that guy acted scared of your shirt, while he goes, you see the
[58:14.160 --> 58:18.240]  high and tight haircut and the guy's in good shape.
[58:18.240 --> 58:21.160]  He's been taught, I'm probably a mad killer for wearing it.
[58:21.160 --> 58:26.040]  I mean, folks, I should have had a hidden camera, people just, especially the cops and military
[58:26.040 --> 58:30.800]  people, they thought they'd seen a ghost with that Minuteman on my shirt, because to them,
[58:30.800 --> 58:35.160]  that Minuteman, everything America stands for is like the devil.
[58:35.160 --> 58:37.240]  And I guess liberty is somewhat of a ghost.
[58:37.240 --> 58:50.560]  So they had seen a ghost of a Minuteman.
[58:50.560 --> 58:54.520]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us
[58:54.520 --> 58:57.720]  in the truth movement for years, Inner Health Botanicals.
[58:57.720 --> 59:01.920]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around called Inner Food.
[59:01.920 --> 59:03.840]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.960]  And now the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food, his editor's choice award
[59:08.960 --> 59:11.280]  or best superfood of 2009.
[59:11.280 --> 59:15.880]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners.
[59:15.880 --> 59:20.640]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[59:20.640 --> 59:23.480]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[59:23.480 --> 59:28.560]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the
[59:28.560 --> 59:29.560]  immune system.
[59:29.560 --> 59:33.760]  It's a truly healthy coffee that tastes great, and take it from me folks, it really does
[59:33.760 --> 59:34.760]  taste great.
[59:34.760 --> 59:46.920]  Don't forget to try their other great products, go to www.enerfod.com, that's www.enerfod.com
[59:46.920 --> 1:00:12.920]  or just click on their banner on infowars.com for special pricing.
[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:22.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:34.120]  All right, we're taking your phone calls, I want to get into cybersecurity's framework
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:38.440]  for total government regulation and control of our lives, I want to get into the bankruptcy
[1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:41.000]  of General Motors by design.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.640]  Some news is starting to finally report that the Cyber Bullying Act would absolutely end
[1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:46.140]  the First Amendment.
[1:00:46.140 --> 1:00:49.800]  Everybody in the patriot movement's focused on the hate bill, which is important, but
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:57.640]  it's nothing, nothing compared to the cyber bullying, so that's all coming up.
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:01.800]  Right now, let's go back to your calls, Tori in Idaho, you're on the air, welcome.
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:06.440]  Hi, Alex, I have a couple questions for you.
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:12.920]  First of all, my girlfriend's in the military, and she's an army reserve, but she's not active.
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:17.040]  She's been told, though, that she's set to go to Afghanistan in 2010.
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:22.440]  Now, if things stay the way that they are and we don't go to war with Pakistan and whatnot,
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:28.720]  really, my question is, would you suggest that we get her out of the military?
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:34.240]  Because, I mean, I've heard lots of stories about people getting raped and killed by the
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:36.520]  private military corporations and whatnot.
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:38.040]  Well, there's not lots of stories.
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:39.040]  I keep getting emails.
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:43.040]  Well, go ahead and ask your question, then I'll comment on it.
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:44.040]  Okay.
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:50.400]  Oh, my other one, now, the price of houses have gone down quite a lot where I live,
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:54.360]  and I have a relative who's considering whether or not to buy his first house.
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:59.000]  I'm wondering what your opinion is on that, like, would it be best to wait until after
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.040]  the depression or the recession, whatever you want to call it?
[1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:04.960]  Alright, let me take that second question, that is way too varied.
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:10.520]  I don't know your area, your county, anything about your real estate history, what type
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:17.240]  of house they want, what their financial situation is, what their skills are, what their health
[1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:19.120]  situation is.
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:28.080]  I can tell you what I would do is I'm certainly not going to be financially overextending
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:33.120]  myself in this type of situation, but in a year or two, you're undoubtedly going to
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:37.080]  end up having even lower real estate prices in most areas of the country.
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:39.480]  It varies widely.
[1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:43.120]  Some places have gone down so fast that they're predicting they may bounce the next six months,
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:45.400]  but a lot of areas are just beginning to fall.
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.520]  I think I'm saying Austin wouldn't fall.
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:54.920]  It's falling close to 35% in the last year alone, and it was one of the slowest to rise
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:59.880]  because Texas fell so much in the 80s that it didn't rise as much as other parts of
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:02.040]  the country, but now it's plunging.
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:07.360]  It was seen as not being too overvalued, but it's plunging right now, so I can't give
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:13.360]  you advice because I don't know all of the pieces on the chess board, you know, for your
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:18.920]  particular friend, every person has a different battlefield in life they're looking at.
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:24.560]  As for the first question, I wouldn't join the military because this isn't our military
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:29.320]  anymore, and it's totally bought and paid for by offshore banks, and the head of the
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:32.840]  Naval War College brags about it.
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:36.560]  And because of the vaccines they give them, which we know are filled with cancer viruses
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:42.520]  and soft-killed weapons on record, and yes, thousands of Army investigators alone have
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:48.320]  been murdered trying to investigate corruption.
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:53.640]  The military barracks are just rotting and sewage running around on the floor.
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:58.280]  The airplanes, the seats are collapsing and covered.
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:00.040]  Rats are living on most of the aircraft.
[1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:05.280]  For those that don't know, yes, rats and mice get in them.
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:09.720]  People on a lot of military transports defecate in buckets now because everything's collapsing
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:11.120]  because the generals don't care.
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:13.120]  In fact, it's the opposite.
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:20.440]  The generals and colonels fly around on air-conditioned little pleasure pod aircraft having sex with
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:21.440]  their secretaries.
[1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:25.720]  I mean, it's just a total corrupt empire imploding.
[1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:30.160]  And you saw what happened to Pat Tillman when he tried to speak up and wrote letters
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:32.920]  home that he was going to come home and expose the war as a fraud.
[1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:34.800]  They murdered him.
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:38.280]  But if she goes AWOL, they're going to give her a disarmament discharge and come after
[1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:39.280]  her Second Amendment.
[1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:41.480]  But because she's a veteran, they'll probably do that anyway.
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:48.160]  So again, I'm honored that you would ask my opinion, but that is a question you need
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:50.680]  to decide for yourself, Tori.
[1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:52.160]  I appreciate your call.
[1:04:52.160 --> 1:05:00.840]  Justin, Alex, Robert, John and others, your calls are coming up.
[1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:06.240]  this summer.
[1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:10.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:14.680]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:15.960]  allows you to have.
[1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:16.960]  It's true.
[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:21.120]  The government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:25.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:27.640]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:31.200]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:34.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:39.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:43.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:45.240]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
[1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.680]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:56.200]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:03.040]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:06.880]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:07.880]  important than ever.
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:10.600]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:13.600]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:17.520]  You'll never have to go to the super-dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:19.920]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:23.160]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation with you.
[1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:27.560]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:31.840]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of

[1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:59.640]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:03.760]  The thing is here, growing season.
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:05.960]  The economy is not getting any better.
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:07.800]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:08.800]  Think about it.
[1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:12.920]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.520]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.

[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:32.640]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. we are here live, Jesse Ventura coming up
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:34.800]  part way into the next hour.
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:38.560]  Another visit with us, he was with us about a week and a half ago.
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:41.600]  I'm going to your phone calls right now.
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:45.000]  Justin in North Carolina, Justin, you are on the air.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:48.200]  Alex, my friend, how you doing today?
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:49.200]  Not too good.
[1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:52.240]  I knew they were going to kill General Motors two and a half years ago from government documents
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:56.640]  we read on air and of course we got laughed at and I know they're going to shut down almost
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:02.200]  every other major U.S. corporation and hand it over to firing offshore looters and it's
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:05.480]  real sad to know they're going to bankrupt the country and turn a bunch of paramilitary
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:09.520]  police loose on us and then a lot of cowardly people are going to grovel and do whatever
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:13.120]  the government tells them for the promise of things getting better when they're only
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:14.120]  going to get worse.
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:16.280]  But other than that, I guess I'm doing okay.
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:21.240]  Well, what I want to call and tell you that two things I want to say, you've been a great
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:24.280]  inspiration to us here at We Are Changed North Carolina.
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:29.160]  I'm a member and co-organizer of that and I've got me a radio show starting on Saturday
[1:09:29.160 --> 1:09:31.680]  morning coming up starting this Saturday.
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:33.760]  You mind if I throw a quick plug on it real quick?
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:34.760]  Sure, go ahead.
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:35.760]  All right.
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:39.760]  It's called Eternal Vigilance with Justin Prim on revolutionbroadcasting.com.
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:42.760]  They're going to run it from 10 a.m. to 12 noon.
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:46.800]  Our show this week, I'm extremely proud of the opportunity to get a chance to do this
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:51.240]  and Alex Jones is my inspiration and I appreciate your work.
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:55.480]  Another thing I want to ask you about Alex, we're talking about the internet cyber thing,
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:57.400]  the bill that they're getting ready to pass.
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:00.080]  What do you think they're going to do to try to implicate this?
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:03.760]  Do you think it's going to be a false flag operation to get the bill passed like a cyber
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:04.760]  patriot act?
[1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:06.360]  I mean, what's your opinion on this?
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:12.080]  Yes, they've already been launching lots of fake staged attacks and then openly admitting
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:17.240]  they did it, but they'll come out and say a hospital got hacked and somebody was trying
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:20.360]  to shut off ventilators.
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:26.720]  An airport got attacked, the FAA, we think it's the Russians and then months later it
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:31.960]  comes out in government journals that, oh, that was the cyber command in San Antonio
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:36.200]  with some of the hackers they've hired testing the defenses.
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:38.960]  And so I'm going to break all that down at the bottom of the hour.
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:40.480]  I appreciate your call.
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:45.880]  I want to cover this properly and try to go over many of the different facets to it.
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:53.160]  But it's as big as the war on terror, it's as big as Homeland Security.
[1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:55.280]  You know, what does Homeland Security mean to you?
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:58.920]  It means that everything you buy and sell is tracked, your prescription drugs, when
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:04.080]  you buy a car, when you rent a car, when you get a hotel room, when you get an apartment.
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:07.520]  Now when you buy a carton of cigarettes, when you get prescription, you know, everything's
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:08.920]  being tracked.
[1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:12.080]  Homeland Security means that when I go to Port Aransas, Texas, where I've been going since
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.160]  I was a little kid, or my dad went when he was a little kid, and where his dad went when
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:22.000]  he was a little kid, there's Homeland Security trucks driving around harassing people and
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  local cops harassing people.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.720]  And if you try to go to the national seashore 10 miles away, they got plate scanners and
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:30.080]  they harass you.
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:33.960]  It means you live in a third world secret police system.
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:40.520]  It's like living in Moscow 30 years ago.
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:46.000]  And they're openly announcing Internet too, where there will be no free speech.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And all these people are emailing me, and I saw comments in Paul Watson's article that
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.800]  was posted on infowars.com, originally at Prison Planet, but if you want to read the
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:59.840]  comments, they're up on the infowars.com versions where I saw it.
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:04.480]  It's like, Alex Jones, I know a lot about computers.
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:10.680]  And let me tell you, they're not going to shut down the Internet.
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:13.120]  They can't.
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:19.880]  The Internet was designed to be able to take a nuclear attack from Russia, and you can't
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:23.200]  shut it down.
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:32.480]  Yes, that's what DARPA set it up for in the 60s, the Intranet.
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.760]  And yes, the White House in the 80s had the Internet.
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.520]  And yes, it became popularized in the early 90s.
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:47.080]  But the whole point, one facet on the Swiss Army knife of tyranny, one of the little do-hickeys,
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.640]  one of the little gizmos, one of the little widgets on the Swiss Army knife that has
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:58.000]  a thousand heads, openly, AP, Mother Jones, I even printed these articles this morning
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.080]  to cover them here later.
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:07.800]  The White House announces their goal, number one goal of Cybersecurity Act is, quote, to
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.240]  be able to shut off the Internet.
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.280]  That's the whole announcement.
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:19.400]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:22.720]  The power to shut down is the power to destroy.
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:30.120]  It's like Baron Harkinen in the Dune books, which they put in the film, not in the books.
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:31.120]  The Heart Plug.
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:32.880]  Oh, everyone gets one around here, don't worry.
[1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:35.120]  They want a Heart Plug on the Internet.
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:40.560]  You just pull the plug, tears open a big patch in the heart, the blood spells out.
[1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:43.800]  You're just, America is just having its Heart Plug installed.
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:48.760]  Don't feel bad, everyone gets one.
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:52.200]  Everyone will play a clip when we go live at prisonplanet.tv of someone having their Heart
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:53.920]  Plug pulled.
[1:13:53.920 --> 1:13:54.920]  It's freedom.
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:58.040]  Let me get it through your head out there.
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:01.200]  I don't get up here and make stuff up.
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.920]  I don't get up here and say GM's going to go bankrupt two and a half years ago in the
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:11.000]  next two to three years and then read government documents on air because I'm trying to scare
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:12.920]  you.
[1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:16.440]  I get up here because that's what they were planning, stating they were going to move
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:23.800]  it to Brazil and China on record.
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:28.040]  I don't get up here and tell you they're going to set up Youth Brigade, which they're
[1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:30.800]  now openly announcing.
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:40.920]  I put this in my film Police State 2000 released in early 1999 because it was government documents.
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:46.400]  They're now announcing they're going to take blood at DMVs around the country.
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:49.200]  That's in my first film made in 1997.
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:51.160]  I said, here's the executive order.
[1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:54.600]  We don't know if they're going to implement it, but here's the executive order.
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:58.760]  People say, oh, you said they'd be taking blood and urine at DMVs.
[1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:00.120]  Where is it?
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:03.440]  That was 13 years ago.
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:12.560]  My point is they passed the criminal executive order.
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:18.160]  And now they're announcing, see, I'm already getting into cybersecurity from that fellow's
[1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:22.040]  question.
[1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:23.520]  Let's take some calls and I'll get into it.
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:28.080]  I need to do it all at one time.
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:38.880]  The open announcement is for its safety, all Internet hubs, all telecommunications centers
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:48.280]  will have federal boxes in them that everything by federal law is hardwired into so that the
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:55.680]  feds can shut down any part of the web or the entire web whenever and however they want.
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:00.000]  This is announced by them.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:05.400]  Stop living in denial.
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:07.640]  This is the whole point.
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:10.480]  This is what Jay Rockefeller, the senator, said in the hearings.
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:14.320]  We've played the video here.
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:17.240]  We don't have time to live in denial anymore.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:18.960]  There is a new world order.
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:20.720]  There is a European Union.
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.640]  There is an American Union.
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:24.920]  They are bankrupting the dollar.
[1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:26.880]  The police have been militarized.
[1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:32.960]  They are spying on you without warrants.
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:37.680]  This is the telecommunications act of 1996, part two.
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:43.160]  The telecommunications act of 1996 openly stated that they would give $5 billion, then
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:50.160]  it became $9 billion, that's how the cost overruns, by federal law that all telecommunications
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:17:00.360]  hubs, Internet, phone, cell phone, fax, satellite have whole floors that everything is run through
[1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:04.640]  that the NSA runs and has its own personnel in.
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:07.280]  As I always said before, it came out in the news a year ago.
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:11.000]  In my films, on record, I said the phone companies aren't wiretapped.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:16.520]  The phone companies are the wiretapped.
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:22.680]  I'll just cover cybersecurity now and then get it to your calls.
[1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.840]  I kind of hesitate to even get into it because there's so many.
[1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:25.840]  You know what?
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:26.840]  No.
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:27.840]  About 40 after, I'm going to get into cybersecurity.
[1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:28.840]  I want to take calls now.
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:31.200]  I need to go over my notes and make sure I present it all.
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:34.760]  I'm going to repeat some of what I've said.
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:45.640]  The issue here is that on record, they openly wiretapped everything in 1996.
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:49.640]  You notice that if you go back to the articles in the first few weeks from 9-11, they said,
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:54.400]  oh, the NSA got all the chatter and all the intercepts of this terror attack that was
[1:17:54.400 --> 1:17:59.480]  about to happen, but were ordered to stand down, and the NSA and CIA and FBI people that
[1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:04.520]  tried to do their job, they either got killed or were reprimanded, and those that blocked
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:08.320]  them and ordered them to stand down got record cash bonuses.
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:13.720]  We cover that in 9-11, the road to tyranny, the first 9-11 film, and still one of the
[1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:18.320]  seminal 9-11 films.
[1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:20.800]  The proofs and the pudding, we know what we're talking about.
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:26.560]  So then they said, oh, we just started spying on you after 9-11 to stop al-Qaeda.
[1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:31.600]  We don't listen to U.S. citizens without warrants, and then the NSA employees go public and say,
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:34.000]  we listen to Americans' phone sex.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.840]  We listen for business reasons.
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:37.480]  We listen to everything you do.
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:40.760]  Of course they do.
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:45.400]  And then Obama gets up and says, I'm not listening to your phone calls and emails.
[1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:46.400]  We're not.
[1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:53.760]  We just need to protect you from the Russians and the Chinese.
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:58.400]  That has nothing to do with it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:03.240]  The Russians and the Chinese certainly are trying to figure out the systems over here.
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:10.840]  The globalists built and designed the systems they use over there and are in all their systems.
[1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:14.840]  All the big IT experts outside of government say this cyber security thing will make identity
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:16.000]  theft even worse.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  They know that.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.400]  That's how they're going to push for the chip.
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:21.680]  They know the casual society causes all the theft.
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:29.200]  They know big banks releasing blocks of data causes over 90% of credit card theft.
[1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:33.080]  They know they cause the crisis and offer the solution.
[1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:34.880]  Then their solution makes things worse.
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:41.360]  They offer the next solution.
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:46.560]  And so yes, they can shut down the free internet in China.
[1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:49.320]  They can shut it down in Australia as the government has announced they're not even
[1:19:49.320 --> 1:19:53.760]  putting a spin on it in Australia.
[1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:55.280]  And now they're shutting it up here.
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:58.160]  The companies based here are the ones that set it up in China.
[1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:01.200]  We'll be right back.
[1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:04.720]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:09.400]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:12.920]  It's called protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems
[1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:17.600]  to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions.
[1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:21.160]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:25.240]  Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:28.680]  bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[1:20:28.680 --> 1:20:31.880]  Protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock
[1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:34.440]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:37.520]  Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary
[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:40.000]  taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.520]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:47.040]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hygrids, it's now easy.
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:52.240]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-sheaf superfood should visit the protogrow website at growlikecrazy.com.
[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:57.800]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[1:20:57.800 --> 1:21:01.760]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:07.680]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:13.840]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:15.160]  just as well-funded.
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:20.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:21.840]  of the American people.
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:26.200]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:31.320]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:37.800]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:39.480]  It's not about left or right.
[1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:41.360]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:48.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:21:48.280 --> 1:21:56.480]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:01.080]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:05.280]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:07.680]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:12.840]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:15.880]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:20.160]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:24.080]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:27.840]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:29.120]  from Jekyll Island.
[1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:33.240]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:38.120]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:39.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:44.360]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:49.200]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:52.280]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:57.080]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:57.080 --> 1:23:00.280]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:02.680]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:06.040]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:09.640]  on earth, because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[1:23:09.640 --> 1:23:13.440]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to
[1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:17.640]  store your seeds for the future anywhere, even underground, for 100 years.

[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:26.880]  waterproof and comes with a whopping 6,000 healthy vegetable seeds, from 20 varieties
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:28.920]  that will grow anywhere in the USA.
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:32.360]  Unless you trust the government, the heirloom garden seed time capsule and heirloom seeds
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:35.640]  from survivalistseeds.com is your long-term food solution.
[1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:40.360]  Our competition charges $0.10 to $1.25 per seed for these same heirloom varieties, but
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:44.320]  you can now have a head of lettuce, a bundle of carrots, a basket of tomatoes, a giant
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:46.200]  watermelon and 16 other varieties.
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:48.720]  For about a penny a seed each, be prepared.
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:53.240]  Buy your heirloom seeds today from survivalistseeds.com and have food insurance for your family
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:54.240]  forever.
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:58.480]  This is survivalistseeds.com, survivalistseeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of the
[1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:02.600]  Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:16.920]  Okay, Rick in California disagrees, he goes ahead of the line.
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:17.920]  Rick, go ahead.
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:21.200]  Oh, first I'd like to say I'm one of your biggest fans.
[1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:26.560]  I had your backup in Denver carrying the camera when you were going at it with Michelle Malcolm
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:31.360]  and I was there when you pointed out the obelisk to the other person with me around the square
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:32.360]  there.
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:36.240]  But we had a disagreement in the past and it's taken me 90 days how to get to the bottom
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:37.240]  of this disagreement.
[1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:41.560]  And what I would like to do is go off air, talk to Erin or somebody and tell how to
[1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:48.560]  nail this witness who was used to perpetrate a big lie on 9-11 in an area of 9-11 that
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:52.240]  was very shrouded in mystery and how to nail him in this lie.
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:55.760]  And I don't want to talk about it on the air because I want you guys to have the scoop
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:56.760]  on it.
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:57.960]  Okay, well Erin is at lunch.
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:25:01.800]  Is there somebody else I can give the info to?
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:05.520]  Sure, give it to John Harmon right now.
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:07.120]  Anything else, sir?
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:08.120]  That's it.
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.560]  Okay, well I don't know what we disagree about but thank you, I appreciate it.
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:14.120]  John, will you get the info from him?
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:18.240]  I'm not whining though, people get mad that I don't follow this lead or that lead.
[1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:23.640]  I'm completely overwhelmed to the point of where I'm almost spinning my wheels half the
[1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:25.840]  time if I try to do too much.
[1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:34.000]  I need to just focus in on key points, filmmaking, doing the radio show, covering the news, but
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.520]  I do love all the tips we get.
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:40.280]  Let's go to Alex in Texas, yeah, Alex in Texas is next.
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:41.280]  Go ahead.
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:43.120]  How are you doing, Alex?
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:44.120]  Good sir.
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:49.600]  All right, I had a question to ask you, I've been doing some investigating for a while
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:57.320]  about the globalist agenda and I want to know what exactly is Project Bluebeam?
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:01.080]  Project Bluebeam and parts of it have been declassified and it's been reported on by
[1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:05.960]  a lot of people that have defected from the New World Order to stage a second coming of
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:13.400]  Christ of Buddha, of Muhammad or of space aliens.
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:20.000]  This has been in the mainstream news, part of its giant hologram machines that can project
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:26.840]  a thousand foot tall flying saucer or Jesus or whatever they want and the Pentagon's looked
[1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:35.600]  at that to disorient or make a military stand down or a domestic population stand down and
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:38.080]  Project Bluebeam is very, very real.
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:43.280]  Very, very real, you say, oh, okay, all right, thank you.
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:44.760]  Thank you so much.
[1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:51.040]  And along those same lines, Alex, talk about Project Bluebeam, Larry King on singing in
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:52.040]  and others.
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:54.400]  We've played the clips here on air.
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:27:00.880]  They'll say tonight, giant cigar shaped flying saucers over Utah and Arizona.
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:05.560]  And then they show the video and it's up close, you know, shot with the telephoto video lens
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:07.160]  of a blimp.
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.160]  It's got the propellers.
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:11.440]  It's got the four rudders on the back.
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:16.680]  It's got those surveillance blisters on it, the equipment.
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:22.440]  We've got the MSNBC articles where Homeland Security launched these in the last decade.
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:25.720]  They fly around at 100,000 feet.
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:28.800]  But see the media, though, talk about conspiracy theorists.
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:31.920]  They won't say what it is because that's national security.
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:39.920]  They'll say it may be an alien when any moron with a telescope can look at it and say that's
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:41.920]  a blimp.
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:47.320]  These are unmanned robot robotic blimps, but the public says, there's no such thing as
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:48.320]  a robotic aircraft.
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:50.120]  I mean, I still get that.
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:57.320]  I mean, the public is really behind the eight ball here, but it's a religion of denial.
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:01.120]  It's a religion of living in their turtle shells.
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:04.120]  And so there's Project Bluebeam right there.
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:08.120]  But you know, that goes back to the 40s and people would see a supersonic jet and or they'd
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:12.640]  see a, you know, V-shaped bomber and they'd tell them, oh, we didn't, that wasn't Air
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:13.640]  Force aircraft.
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:15.400]  You must have seen an alien.
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:18.000]  Yeah, I saw an alien.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:23.800]  And then we are the conspiracy theorists because we're saying most of this isn't space aliens.
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:27.400]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Texas.
[1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:29.120]  Robert, you're on the air.
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:30.120]  I'm on.
[1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:31.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:36.360]  Well, it's nice to talk to the legendary Alex Jones.
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:42.000]  Okay, let me do a couple of things real quick.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:45.640]  I wanted to plug my channel real quick, if that's okay, I'm I'm carrying Alex Jones content
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:47.200]  on there since they abandoned channel.
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:51.840]  I know you got it back on there, but it is Funkmaster five on YouTube, just in case
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:54.200]  anybody wants to check it out.
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:59.600]  And another thing I was going to ask is I was going to ask, do you know the Dionysus
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:03.600]  connection with the Bohemian Grove and the song that it shows?
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.400]  So number one, the Bohemian Grove was set up in 1873.
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:12.320]  And they've had a ton of secret publications, a lot of which have been sold by their widows
[1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:13.320]  or children.
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:17.120]  You can get thousands of peace for them.
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:20.600]  So no, they're I constantly I'm not saying you're doing this.
[1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:26.200]  I constantly though get calls going, you didn't cover this ritual they do or you didn't you
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:28.680]  didn't cover this statue or that statue.
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:31.400]  The place is 2,700 acres.
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:33.520]  They've published thousands of things.
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:38.600]  So I don't know about it, but but but tell me when we get back, what you're discussing
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:42.600]  and where I can find out more enlighten us on the other side, I'm going to take a few
[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:46.920]  more calls after that, then I'm going to break down the cyber security takeover.
[1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:49.160]  This is big, really important.
[1:29:49.160 --> 1:29:51.360]  Stay with us.

[1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:05.920]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer
[1:31:05.920 --> 1:31:10.640]  provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.

[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:31.440]  chance and a little song, another kiss, another kiss.
[1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:36.400]  Okay, we were talking to Robert in Texas still.
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:38.720]  Okay, make your point about Bohemian Grove.
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:45.520]  Okay, the opening song that they choose for the cremation of care is entitled Beethoven's
[1:33:45.520 --> 1:33:47.040]  Symphony No. 7.
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:50.920]  Now, an alternate title for that is Under the Sign of Dionysos.
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:58.200]  Dionysos is the Greek god which actually predates Greece, which represents a couple things,
[1:33:58.200 --> 1:34:04.520]  fertility for one, which is tied in with sacrifices, and another one is casting aside oneself and
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:13.240]  worries to become drunk and promiscuous without caring about any of the consequences.
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:18.520]  That is directly tied and is the inspiration behind that song that they chose.
[1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:21.440]  It just shows that they do everything for a reason.
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:22.840]  Yes, you refreshed my memory.
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:24.240]  Yes, I am aware of that.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.280]  I thought you were talking about some publication or something, and they've got so many.
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:30.200]  I can't keep track of it all.
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:33.440]  They've also got a giant Buddha in there.
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:34.840]  They do rituals too.
[1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:40.440]  They've got some Catholic statue in there.
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:44.720]  I was in there four and a half hours, and only part of that while it was daylight, probably
[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:51.120]  about two hours of daylight, and I was walking by the camps, and it's names like Lost Boys,
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:52.280]  Dragon.
[1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:59.560]  It's all occultic and skulls, big signs with skulls on them, and Lafitte, the pirate, and
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:01.960]  just the whole thing is occult.
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:07.120]  But that entire ritual, they first address the owl as a female deity, then as a male
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:08.120]  deity.
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:16.640]  They've got the spirits of those past Grove members now be conjured and be here, and we've
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:22.640]  had a lot of different mainline professors who study ancient religions look at it, and
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:30.760]  they say it's a mixture of a whole bunch of different Babylonian, Greek, you name it.
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:37.120]  The owl was Lilith, the owl was also another Greek goddess, but they also addressed it
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:42.000]  in some of their literature as Molek, who was a bull, yes we know that Molek was a bull
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  on an owl.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  The point is, is they go through an hour and a half ritual addressing it as different
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.440]  gods, really, and that's the point I try to make in the order of death film.
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:55.440]  It's a DVD combo.
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:01.600]  It has the updated, expanded, original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove in the 46 minute
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:07.440]  film Order of Death with the re-infiltration of Chris Jones, who's now in prison, they
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:15.240]  study him up, we're going in there, and also some of the protests and things that happened
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:21.440]  there that Ed Holman shot video of, where the people protesting it are doing a ritual.
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:26.960]  I mean, it's just all ritual, all religion, and the media tries to deny that and say,
[1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:28.320]  oh, they're just having a play.
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:33.680]  I was in that crowd, they were taking it deadly, deadly serious, and then they also, when they
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:42.280]  talk about care, there are several boxes in the book of Faust, the supposed dark ages
[1:36:42.280 --> 1:36:48.680]  German who conjures the devil, and Faust really existed, the question is, is it kind of like
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:53.880]  Robin Hood existed, but all this lore gets added to it, and the doctor Faust makes a
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:37:00.680]  deal with the devil, and they put care in a box, and that's the thing that the devil
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:07.720]  is always trying to seal up is Dr. Faust's conscience, so it has Faustian stuff mixed
[1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:08.720]  in.
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:14.680]  I mean, it's just from one end to the other, it is occultic, all about getting rid of your
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:20.400]  cares, getting rid of your conscience, and kind of like a voodoo ritual as well.
[1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:25.760]  They know they've got all this bad karma, all this bad hoochoo coming at them, all this
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:31.680]  bad report you sow, all this bad stuff coming back on them, so they put it on the effigy
[1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:38.800]  of the child that they burn to the owl, to the bull, to the, and then they put out a
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:45.200]  different literature showing it being a demon, a horned devil, an owl, a bull stomping on
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:52.640]  a bloody child, we've gotten some of their internal literature, so this idol is like
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:38:00.680]  a super idol, it's a Babylon mystery school whore, but they generally, two-thirds of the
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:06.040]  time they address it as a female, so it is a goddess, and I appreciate your call, thank
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:07.600]  you so much Robert.
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:18.240]  John in Florida, John, you're on the air.
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:22.440]  Please folks, I've got to start a ditto thing or something, you're the man, and I'm just
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:26.400]  doing my job, and I'm another example of what you can do if you take action, all of you
[1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:28.480]  can take action as well, go ahead.
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.680]  I grew up in one of the three counties in West Virginia, and this guy wrote the book
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:38.960]  Bloodletting in the Coldfields, it's about the Mine Wars, and it just shows what, well
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:46.000]  you say the New World Order now was a conquistador or whatever, and then back in 1914, it was
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.960]  another Pinkerton Army came in there, actually came into the three counties, it was a hundred
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:55.200]  thousand man army, and they confiscated a million rounds and a hundred thousand guns,
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:02.000]  they had machine guns, and they actually had a war there where the book let out that there
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:08.320]  was more shots went off in those three counties in the Spanish-American War, and that just
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:12.760]  shows you when they get motivated, when they really want something, they're going to go
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:17.480]  after it, I mean that was a little bit long ago, maybe 19, I think, I don't know exactly
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:19.200]  if it was 1914 or whatever.
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:26.040]  And who was involved in that, the Rockefeller family and the Hearst family that owns popular
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:30.040]  mechanics that attacks and demonizes patriots today?
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:36.600]  Well, you know who the governor, well it was started about in the 70s and 80s, the governor
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:41.840]  finally came down there, and they said J. Rockefeller spent it all, he spent 12 million
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:47.640]  dollars just trying to get elected governor of West Virginia, and that's a people, that's
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:51.560]  a people though that stood up, they didn't stand down.
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:58.600]  Absolutely, God bless you, you know that's a great example, after World War II, there
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:04.160]  was a famous town in Tennessee, we shoot a whole show on this, and they came back home
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:07.440]  and the cops were taking their property and pulling them over and writing them tickets
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:12.840]  and raising their taxes and bossing them around and setting up checkpoints, and the governor
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:17.200]  wouldn't kick them out, so the World War II vets went in there and kicked the police
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:21.720]  out and had a big shootout with them, and the feds had to back off and say they did
[1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:23.160]  the right thing.
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:30.520]  Pinkerton security along with other private groups in Michigan and West Virginia and Colorado
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:39.240]  and New York and New Jersey all over the country, from the 1860s right through into the 30s,
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:45.240]  I mean there are hundreds of cases where they would machine gun whole crowds down, they
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:50.320]  would come into mining camps in Colorado where the people own the land and they would kill
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:56.040]  every man, woman, and child, I mean they'd ride three-year-olds down on horseback, they
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:41:02.320]  did it all, and that's what Blackwater is, that's what private mercenary armies are,
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:15.600]  I mean the British landed in one landing 17,000 German soldiers in 1776, up against
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:28.600]  Washington's 5,000, 17,000 Germans alone, and it's the same thing, it was the German
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:38.120]  king, George III, called on his cousins over in Germany, he was German, to bring them over
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:43.120]  and they did, now the Hessians real fast said these people got a better deal than I got,
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:47.680]  they were brought up as slaves, they were brought up but not chained as slaves under
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:53.360]  mind control, under cultural mind control, that they worked as slaves as farmers, that
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:00.200]  they had to go to these military academies and that they were property, white slaves,
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:05.400]  in one landing there were over 50,000 Hessians conservatively used in the war here by the
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:18.040]  British, they used 17,000 in their attempt to take New York, 17,000 Hessians, and yes
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:23.880]  they are, that's all the police are now, and when you hear about Northcom, they just plan
[1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:31.240]  on using regular army and regular marines and militarized paramilitary local police
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:37.080]  against the American people, they've openly announced it, they're openly setting a precedence
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:44.040]  right now to use them against us, now the good news is every time they tried to use
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:49.600]  Pinkerton and other private security firms and government organizations and they use
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:55.440]  the army against the bonus marchers, every time they do that it blows up in their face
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:01.520]  and they've got to end up backing off, yeah you can mow us down, yeah you can commit more
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:06.720]  wake-os and you can make movies about it and try to legitimize it, it still wakes people
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:19.480]  up and in the end you lose, and Pinkerton were thugs then they're thugs now, cold blooded
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:26.120]  murdering thugs, that's the same thing that Blackwater Worldwide's doing all over the
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:34.440]  planet right now, they work for the people that are bringing down this country, that's
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:42.960]  why there's 200,000 contractors for the 150,000 US troops in Iraq and I got more emails saying
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:50.960]  what's this in the Obama deception, you say over a million dead Iraqis, well in 2005 the
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:44:02.560]  Lancet Journal said 450,000 dead, in 2006 it said 600 plus thousand dead, in 2007 it said
[1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:12.920]  800 plus thousand dead, in 2008 it said over a million dead, you can just Google Lancet
[1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:23.160]  survey Iraq dead, but I get these emails going well our news only says 100,000 dead Iraqis
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:34.240]  and our news only says 4,600 dead US troops, well our media also tells us that having the
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:49.280]  NSA spy on every one of us without warrants is constitutional, look this is tyranny plain
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:55.240]  and simple, okay I said I'm going to cover cyber security news, this is big news then
[1:44:55.240 --> 1:45:03.680]  I'm going to go to John and Ingrid and Jeff and CJ and Steve and others, but I tell you
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.040]  I may get rid of this five, six year rule I've had of people that disagree, more like
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:10.960]  a ten year rule more I think about it, go to the head of the line because they usually
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:20.880]  just use it as a trick, they usually just use it as a trick to get on air first and
[1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:24.800]  I always find callers that disagree are more interesting because they're usually so out
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:29.440]  of left field if they actually disagree, so we'll see if Jeff does coming up, he just
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:34.680]  walked in, Rob do just walked in and gave me this story, military recruiter killed an
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:38.560]  Arkansas shooting, one army recruiter was killed by me and the second was wounded in
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:44.840]  a shooting at a recruiting office and a suspect was arrested, police said, police lieutenant
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:49.240]  Terry Hastings said the recruiter was shot when a man in a black SUV opened fire on the
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:54.640]  office in Little Rock about 10.30 am, the vehicle stopped in interstate, 6.30 a short
[1:45:54.640 --> 1:45:58.360]  time later and the suspect was taken into custody, Hastings said the suspect pulled
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:03.680]  over and surrendered without incident, police said they found an assault rifle in the vehicle,
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:09.920]  Hastings said he did not know whether the recruiting office was specifically targeted
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:17.040]  or was randomly chosen, Hastings said shortly afternoon the investigators had not yet questioned
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:22.520]  the suspect and the police were still processing evidence from the crime scene, as a precaution
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:26.920]  police also called a bomb squad because they said there were packages in the SUV, Hastings
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:31.200]  said a robot would open the packages, authorities did not immediately identify either of the
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:37.160]  victims of the suspect, you know, I remember five years ago we started getting the reports
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:42.680]  out of Houston and Denver and other big cities where they'd go in and tell 16 year olds you
[1:46:42.680 --> 1:46:49.600]  sign this contract agreeing to join the military or we're going to have you arrest it and then
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:53.640]  the media denied that was the case, they said oh no the police aren't, the military aren't
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:58.960]  doing that and then it came out that it was recorded them doing it and then I said you
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:06.640]  watch they will promote the sergeants that are doing this and sure enough they've promoted
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:12.080]  them everywhere and then now the feds get to go in and recruit and threaten and push
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:18.120]  in every public school in the country, kids as young as five years of age and a bunch
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:22.600]  of US cities are saying you're not going to do that in our public schools taking local
[1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:31.440]  control over, I mean are these local schools or not and Obama's pushing to make that illegal
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:36.280]  so I wonder if this is tied into that or I wonder if it's a drug deal gone bad or you
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:42.120]  never know government's so corrupt or you never know if one of the guys at the recruiting
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:50.880]  station had you know gone out with the guy that shot him's wife, I mean we're just speculating
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:54.960]  once you better believe in this case they're going through the guy's computer right now
[1:47:54.960 --> 1:48:03.720]  hoping he visited my website, in fact that's in my stack, I'll get to it in the last hour,
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:19.680]  there was the case over the weekend in Kansas of an individual going to a local church where
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:26.400]  a famous abortionist was a deacon and shooting him once killing him and the guy left and
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:31.440]  the police were waiting on the highway by his house and arresting him without incident
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:38.460]  they're now pointing out that it's a militia member, former militia member arrested back
[1:48:38.460 --> 1:48:43.920]  on I believe it says 96, you better believe the first thing the ADL and Southern Parfait
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:49.640]  Law Center are doing is going to the thousands of sites that guys visited that if he visited
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:54.880]  info wars.com and I'm on the radio in Kansas City first thing they're going to do is hang
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:59.120]  that around my head because they're scared of this show folks we're telling it like
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:07.400]  it is they want to set a precedent to shut me down now that said member John Brown who
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:12.400]  in Kansas they've got no fewer than 14 statues I looked it up this morning at the state house
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:19.320]  you name it John Brown the abolitionist killed a whole bunch of people slave owners he massacred
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:25.240]  nine in Kansas nine slave owners killed him down in a hammer shot him through then let
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:30.200]  an army of white abolitionist in blacks on an armory in another state killed a bunch
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:38.600]  of people and the state honors him for assaulting the military and police and killing them and
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:50.080]  they got statues for him all over Kansas now I'm not defending John Brown Abraham Lincoln
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:57.720]  you know said that he was a misguided soul but you got to ask why state houses and why
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:02.720]  county seats all over the country and why black community centers all over the country
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:09.600]  have statues to John Brown who went around killing white slave owners now are those black
[1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:15.200]  human beings yes they are are those babies human beings see this is the warped situation
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:20.600]  if we win and defeat the new world order and stop the killing 50 plus million babies is
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:30.360]  not enough will there be statues to this guy I'm only asking the question I don't think
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:37.280]  people should go around killing abortionist because it'll make them into victims and that's
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:42.640]  the only way they're going to be able to continue peddling their trade I'm believing what Gandhi
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:47.400]  said and put out and you point out there a bunch of eugenicists that it was passed that
[1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:53.000]  Hitler started abortions in Germany but the eugenicist over here pushed it then we can
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:51:02.800]  defeat it that way but then you got to say John Brown's bad too heart disease is on
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:07.600]  the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:13.120]  detected by you but the symptoms are there loss of energy blood sugar spikes and drops

[2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:15.760]  when I have all the serious news to cover what on earth is a eight dollar Jesse Ventura
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:24.000]  doll doing in here governor of Minnesota Navy Seal mayor volunteer football coach he also
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:35.120]  did national commentating for national football you know that this is just utterly ridiculous
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:45.440]  where did this come from why do we have this one this is for who sent it a fan okay oh my
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:53.320]  god this is so ridiculous oh my goodness we can open it up here here hold on old kid with
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:02:06.320]  a I got really serious news to cover folks and I'd love to have fun around here but I'm
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:11.480]  not going to be mentioning that one Ventura's on with us okay let's stop right there let's
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:19.440]  get serious there's a lot of denial going on about the nature of the internet and the
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:26.520]  direction it's going in internet to a consortium of private industry universities and government
[2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:34.640]  has openly announced that internet to conferences across the world in Austin Texas in Tokyo Japan
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:39.680]  in London England you can go read the minutes of their meetings they have big conventions
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:44.800]  they always announce their slogan is the internet is dead and they say they're not going to
[2:02:44.800 --> 2:02:50.160]  upgrade the old hubs they're going to have under the name of cyber security the feds come in
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:55.240]  and take over all the telecommunications switching hubs the peer to peer and that they're going
[2:02:55.240 --> 2:03:00.400]  to end the internet as you know it in the next decade and that's going back five six
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:06.040]  years ago so we're now into the time period when these big changes they say are going
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:13.640]  to take place and we've written detailed articles about how they're killing the internet that
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:19.320]  have been picked up by the San Francisco Chronicle and other major publications so our opinion
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:25.280]  you know has been seconded by major publications I mean we're not just shooting our mouths off
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:30.800]  here we've done the research and we're giving people the big picture you know the there's
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:37.960]  other people in denial about all of this that are posting in this story that's up on infowars.com
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:45.520]  and prismplanet.com and they're saying in this article oh Alex don't fear monger the government
[2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:52.800]  couldn't shut the internet down if they wanted to well there's a problem with that here's
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:59.680]  mother Jones should Obama control the internet and it says Obama wants the power to shut
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:05.600]  the internet down to save it to protect it that that's the whole spin but the head of
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:11.480]  cyber security put in for months by Obama met with the Pentagon and he came out and said
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:15.600]  I'm quitting this is undemocratic the Pentagon's taking over the internet is going to surveil
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:16.600]  everybody.
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:22.520]  In fact Google that for folks that are watching us live on TV right now Google head of cyber
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:28.400]  security quits show them an AP headline he quit saying they're taking over three months
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:33.120]  ago so people say there'd be a whistleblower if they were doing this there is the head
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:40.920]  of it quit here's another one out of Info Science Institute Obama could shut off the
[2:04:40.920 --> 2:04:45.760]  internet to the entire US if he wanted should President Obama have the power to shut down
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:50.040]  domestic internet traffic during a state of emergency Senators Jay Rockefeller Olympia
[2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:57.320]  so no think so and then it's got their testimony that's mother Jones stop being in denial the
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:01.320]  goal of internet to shut it down.
[2:05:01.320 --> 2:05:05.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator

[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:24.360]  grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:05:24.360 --> 2:05:28.600]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four
[2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:32.880]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families
[2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:37.640]  lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:38.080]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you so much for joining us i'm going over
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.960]  for stations that just tuned in and listeners that just tuned in i'm going over this article
[2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:51.120]  that is so important it's up on prisonplanet dot com and it's also on info wars dot com
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:09:00.800]  and it's titled cyber security is framework for total government regulation and control of our
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:08.560]  lives and i want to start this analysis here by pointing out people are in denial about this
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:13.600]  there are people commenting on the story saying we're fear mongering this is not the beginning
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:21.920]  of the end of the internet well i just covered in the last segment mother jones headline should
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:28.240]  obama control the internet and the headline is should president obama have the power to
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:32.800]  shut down domestic internet traffic during a state of emergency senators john rockefeller
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:37.920]  democrat west virginia and olympia snow republican main thinks so on wednesday they introduced a
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:42.400]  bill to establish the office of national cyber security advisor an arm of the executive branch
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:46.720]  that would have vast power to monitor and control internet traffic to protect against
[2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:54.160]  threats of critical cyber infrastructure the broad power is rattling some civil libertarians
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:10:02.160]  and then you can go read the bill you see when level two and cogent just two medium size peer
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:08.400]  to peer internet providers had a fight with each other four or five years ago about a third of the
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:15.040]  web was inaccessible well by design under federal law they want to put snooping hubs and federal
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:22.000]  machinery federal pieces of equipment in even smaller isps where the entire web can be turned
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:32.320]  on shut down parts of it turned on shut down anytime the establishment wants to and that is on record
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:37.920]  so this is what they're doing and
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.880]  after jesse ventura leaves us later i'm gonna properly uh go through all of this
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:49.840]  because i just can't do it in the in the time we have but but at the end of the show the last
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:53.600]  30 minutes i'm going to devote exclusively the more i think about it to just breaking down
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:58.000]  the whole history of this how the grid works and what's happening but i told you jam was going to
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:02.160]  go bankrupt two and a half years ago by design and that they would use the bailout money to ship
[2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:08.240]  it to china and brazil we're on record we told you that they were going to stage 911 attack on
[2:11:08.240 --> 2:11:12.480]  the world trade towers and blame it on bin laden months before it happened you know we tell you
[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:19.440]  all of this stuff we know the enemy's game plan we know what they're doing and it's as clear as
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:26.400]  the nose on my face uh right now let's uh go ahead and go to jeff in hawaii who says he disagrees
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:34.080]  go ahead jeff hello yes jeff yes yes yes i really do disagree but i do think you should change your
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:39.280]  rule you know because you do get a lot of collars who just say they're going to disagree and then
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:45.280]  they get put front right and then they pump some show or some internet space or whatever
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:52.960]  over so i find you do extremely difficult to believe most of what you say at this point
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:12:00.160]  this uh bird flu thing you blew completely out of proportion you said you were losing touch
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:06.240]  with your ability to think a couple of weeks ago i think you should admit you're a right
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:12.880]  winger for one and quit saying you're trying to break the left right paradigm hello i'm listening
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:21.760]  to you okay and i this guy called in friday uh to your show jason was the host but jason was
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:25.920]  real trite with the guy the guy was going to disagree and he was going to say that you guys
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:30.240]  are uh you know picking on obama a whole lot more than bush which i totally agree with that
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:36.480]  and i want to back that guy up but jason wouldn't uh really wouldn't listen to the guy just uh got
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:41.600]  really trite really smart alecky with him and the guy ended up just kind of hanging up during
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:46.160]  the break and never got any points out but i would say that we're being bombarded with obama
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:50.880]  being the tip of the spear uh i mean bush wasn't the tip of the spear he was kind of like a good
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:57.360]  old boy who you kind of like underneath you know you're kind of like him i want to say that mining
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:04.640]  mercury mining gold causes mercury poisoning are you familiar with this i know that yeah there's
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:11.520]  so i know there's a lot of mining that has bad byproducts yeah the the two deepest mines in the world
[2:13:11.520 --> 2:13:20.080]  gold mines are in south africa uh you know in 86 there was like 177 blacks fried in a gold mine
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:25.280]  in south africa and sir sir i appreciate your call sir listen i gave you about two minutes to run on
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:30.240]  there and say i'm a right winger i'm not a right winger or a left winger if you think i'm right
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:36.560]  wing because i'm pro second amendment pro national sovereignty and because i'm against high taxes and
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:43.040]  regulations and control so that politicians can feather the nest of themselves and big corporations
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:49.680]  and special interests then yes i'm a right winger uh but uh i don't believe in this whole left
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:54.720]  right thing and i got somebody on the line with us for the next hour to take calls and cover the news
[2:13:54.720 --> 2:14:00.560]  and talk about his view on the world we really appreciate uh movie star former top professional
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:09.440]  wrestler um a little league uh volunteer coach i guess uh navy seal football coach a football
[2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:14.880]  coach and and you also called national football too didn't you yeah i worked two years for the
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:20.960]  Tampa Bay Buccaneers with gene decker off on the radio and then one year with the Minnesota Vikings
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:26.000]  all right well governor ventura it's good to have you back with us i appreciate you spending time
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:30.960]  with us uh what is most important on your mind right now happening in the world what
[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:36.240]  what is angering jesse ventura and what is exciting of jesse ventura what's what's negative and what's
[2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:43.280]  positive well jesse's never angry alex you know that i i'm just enthusiastic that's all i don't
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:50.880]  get mad i get even uh no i i guess what perturbs me is the feeling that i guess i'm not
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:57.200]  mainstream anymore by what's some of the things that i believe and uh when i talk to people and
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:04.160]  do the press junket on the on the book tour i find so often that people are just poo pooing
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:11.040]  this torture issue they're they're you know they're making it seem like well these people deserve to
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:18.400]  be tortured if anyone on the planet does and therefore it's okay to do it and i i'm appalled
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:25.200]  over that because we have to be a country that goes by the rule of law even when the rule of law
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:33.680]  is not is inconvenient or not maybe in our favor we still otherwise what do we stand for alex if
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:43.200]  we if we just do it when it works for us and i just am really pushed today as to why i have to defend
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:50.400]  my country from torturing people i never believed i'd have to do that well i agree with you i mean
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:56.080]  it's fundamental that the nazis and the soviets and the rest of them tortured people and so
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:15:59.440]  they were the bad guys the north vietnamese tortured people so they were the bad guys and
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:06.080]  poll pot did it so they were the bad guys now they have the nerve to make jack bower the hero
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:11.360]  on tv and he tortures people to get answers and then now we've got big republicans coming out on
[2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:17.360]  fox news we have the clip saying go ahead and just kill everybody at guantanamo bay without a trial
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:22.640]  and then we have this army colonel coming out saying in the new york post in us say today
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:29.920]  ralph peters saying kill us media in future wars that criticize the government have you heard of
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:36.320]  this no i haven't you know i i'm not as well read on on the topics always as you are alex many of
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:43.680]  that stuff i hear from you for the first time um you know people need to understand the large
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:49.120]  picture here that that there's an old saying that uh one of my best friends that i grew up with
[2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:55.760]  his father he passed away a couple years ago in his nineties who was a good friend of my father we
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:02.080]  we were young boys together and our fathers actually grew up together and uh he used to always
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:09.120]  make the saying that you you never let the camel get its nose under the tent and of course what
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:14.720]  you meant by that is if a camel gets his nose under the tent rest assured eventually the whole
[2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:20.640]  body is going to get in the tent it's inevitable give them an inch they'll take you a mile exactly
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:28.400]  the same philosophy and so when we take an attitude on this torturing that well it's okay under
[2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:35.680]  certain instances we'll get ready because we're not going to end it there it's it's man's natural
[2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:42.320]  aggression and power that it's going to expand and pretty soon you know when people like i had i had
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:50.400]  someone defended by saying that well our constitution says that it only protects american citizens
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:57.200]  so if you're not an american citizen you're not protected by our constitution well to that i say
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:18:03.920]  hogwash because that would be the equivalent benefit tourist came to america and was arrested
[2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:09.920]  for something that we could take that tourist in and waterboard them exactly to find out what they
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:14.640]  know well the declaration of independence states that all men are created equal and that this was

[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:21.600]  one 800 259 9231 because listeners can always bring up questions and angles and ideas that i would
[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:26.560]  have never thought to ask a great guest like mr ventura former governor of minnesota a new book
[2:24:26.560 --> 2:24:33.360]  out in paperback don't start a revolution without me uh but jesse what's what's positive that you
[2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:42.480]  see in the world going on right now i see us communicating and i give i give kudos to president
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:48.800]  obama for that because we should always talk with anyone before going to war with them
[2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:55.920]  you know people people don't realize that war should be the last option war is the result
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:25:02.320]  of failed diplomacy it's a result of failed politics and it should be always left as the
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:08.000]  last resort and it seems we've gotten into a mode now that it's become the first resort
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:13.920]  and i'm not saying we shouldn't defend ourselves of course we should but we should always be
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:20.400]  available to talk and communicate i love the fact that word there's there's a realm of communication
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:27.040]  going on now is as rough as it is between washington and cuba if you didn't hear alex i came out and
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:32.720]  said that i would love to be named the ambassador to cuba the first one if we get to the point where
[2:25:32.720 --> 2:25:40.080]  we can get to that level of communication i've been to cuba it's a beautiful place and where we
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:46.480]  boycott it we embargo it and all we're doing is hurting the cuban people you know we're sitting
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:51.840]  here waiting for pastro to be overthrown by his country it's not going to happen i got news for
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:26:00.160]  you pastro is going to die an old man and and and and and we're wasting all this time let me put
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:06.560]  it into connotation like this alex that policy in cuba's like a football game you come in with a
[2:26:06.560 --> 2:26:11.520]  game plan if you get to the fourth quarter and you haven't scored yet don't you think it's time
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:18.000]  you reevaluate your game plan absolutely it's been almost 50 years since the embargo hasn't it
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:24.560]  yes and it's ridiculous i was down there cuban people have to import milk from new zealand
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:29.920]  now we got milk right here in minnesota we could send right down the river to him in the mississippi
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:36.960]  and right across the gulf it's a win-win situation why do they stand in the way of a win-win situation
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:41.280]  well i'm no fan of the corrupt government they had before fidel but it certainly was very corrupt
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:48.080]  after the issue is and most sociologists and historians agree the embargo helped fidel castro
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:53.120]  we'd all been friends and nice and opened it up and kept all the hotels and casinos there
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:58.240]  he would have gotten thrown out very quickly the fact that the west was antagonistic allowed the
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:04.080]  soviets to fill that vacuum and allowed things to deteriorate to the point they are now well and the
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:10.480]  point of the matter is the cuban people i i've met that they're very proud people and they're not
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:19.200]  going to be dictated to by us if they want castro gone they will do it and they don't need us prompting
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:25.760]  them to do it or us to do the other all the stuff behind the scenes people need to realize way back
[2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:33.040]  in the 60s we were practicing terrorism on cuba we were blowing up ships in their day we were
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:39.600]  attempting to assassinate their leaders we were doing all these acts of terrorism but we fail you
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:45.200]  know one of the things that irks me i sit outside the country and watch the u.s now and alex our
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:51.760]  ego is unbelievable we can never admit we're wrong and it's like our way or the highway
[2:27:52.880 --> 2:27:56.000]  and i just don't think in the world today you can live that way
[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:03.280]  well i agree with you uh jesse vinter um my issue as we're ready to go to break her in a
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:07.280]  few minutes i want to go ahead and start asking this question now when you were down here in
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:12.400]  austin back in october you made the point that obama was already fudging that obama was already
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:19.600]  going back from saying day one i bring in the troops to 16 months 21 months now 50 000 indefinitely
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:24.480]  and i know as bad as bush and cheney were you want to give him benefit of the doubt but what i'm
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:29.760]  seeing is slick deception he says he wants to be taught with iran but increases covert operations
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:35.600]  and i have that mainstream news today he says you know oh i want to talk to other countries but
[2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:40.640]  actually continues the encircling of russia uh and other nations and he's moving ahead with
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:45.280]  his cyber bullying bill that if somebody says that you hurt their feelings uh that then you get a
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:52.240]  federal felony for what you say i i'm computer illiterate so that you're going off into places
[2:28:52.240 --> 2:28:58.080]  into star trek for me now no i understand that governor but the point is is that is that i'm
[2:28:58.080 --> 2:29:04.560]  telling you barack obama uh going with your earlier instincts of saying he's already fudging i'm
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:10.320]  telling you this guy says one thing and does another well let's remember something he's still
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:18.400]  just a democrat always remember that and then and there are them and the republicans they control
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:26.800]  the whole game and they don't allow anyone else into the game and and so bear that in mind is
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:31.680]  just that you know if like like on the whole torture issue the reason they want to move on
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:38.000]  is because they're both caught and so even if the democrats didn't order the torture they knew
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:42.400]  what was going on and they condoned it which is just as bad yeah let's finish up why they want
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:46.320]  to move on i know you got to go to break i hear the music yeah let's finish up with torture when
[2:29:46.320 --> 2:29:49.920]  come back then take phone calls get into a host of other issues with governor jesse munterra

[2:33:26.960 --> 2:33:32.240]  the break we were talking about torture again torture torture tortures on your mind and in my
[2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:39.040]  film uh the first 9-11 film that was put out uh back in 2002 9-11 the road to tyranny i show the
[2:33:39.040 --> 2:33:45.440]  washington post headline where it says we're torturing their children we're we're interrogating
[2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:50.160]  putting pressure on people's children to make them answer questions and then with khalid shake
[2:33:50.160 --> 2:33:55.040]  mohammad and others they admit they threatened his kids and then now general to goomba's own army
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:34:01.600]  report us army uh msnbc headline in fact pull that up folks army report children raped syhersh of
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:06.640]  new yorker magazine they've confirmed that they torture people's children in front of them so as
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:12.480]  you were saying it's light years ahead of just guantanamo bay and insects and sleep deprivation
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:20.080]  and and and waterboarding you know alex i would really and i would do this on my own time i would
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:26.400]  go out like they say they won't release these photographs to the public i would go out there
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:30.000]  and i i will they would let me go go in and see them
[2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:36.400]  well i remember a week and a half ago you first broke down here on air that you would do that
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:41.360]  you know i i would love to go out there and to bring me to a room where these photographs are
[2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:47.280]  that none of us are being allowed to see because i think i'm qualified i was a mayor i was a governor
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:54.000]  uh when i was in the navy i had a top secret security clearance you know so i i think that
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:35:00.320]  you know i'm 57 years old going on 58 i think that i'm an adult and i think that as a taxpaying
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:05.360]  citizen that i should have the right to be able to walk in there view these photographs that
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:11.360]  you know we can't put out because we don't want them splattered all over every newspaper in america
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:17.360]  to get the uh muslim world that much more angry at us which the bottom line of course is if we
[2:35:17.360 --> 2:35:22.640]  had to behave in this manner we wouldn't have to worry about this would we alex i was about to
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:27.920]  say that's like saying we can't show the nazi or soviet atrocities because it might anger the world
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:32.240]  we have to show this so that it doesn't continue to happen but but that's the whole issue is
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:36.720]  they have to be released because the neocons and others are still out there
[2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:42.400]  defending all of this and obama does double speak well let's let's start and chip away at it let's
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:49.040]  see if we can get me out there to see them you trust me don't you yes jesse i think you should
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:54.480]  well then let's go from that route and say okay since the general public we should be able to
[2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:59.920]  send a couple representatives from the general public i agree let's send ron paul to well send
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:08.000]  my well but but ron's still elected let's send two people who are not elected a couple of people
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:15.360]  that are just regular citizens well i know this man fell out there take us into the room i promise
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:23.840]  i won't throw up i have a pretty strong stomach if it's that bad and uh you know let me go in
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:29.520]  and view these and when i come out i'll come on your show and anybody else is shown hold the press
[2:36:29.520 --> 2:36:36.400]  conference and state unequivocally you know is there a problem here well man cal a talk show
[2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:41.120]  host that we interviewed coming on tomorrow he was waterboarded last week and lasted six
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:47.440]  seconds i say the average person last 18 seconds you've been waterboarded yes so i i laughed i saw
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:53.600]  man cal's thing on the internet my wife brought it up and uh i i loved it i mean i didn't love it
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:58.720]  that he was waterboard i love the fact that he he had the courage he took the position that water
[2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:03.760]  boarding was you know we should allow him to do it because it's saving lives and it does this and
[2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:09.200]  it does that which is not true because any information you get from somebody being tortured
[2:37:09.200 --> 2:37:15.040]  is is not uh you know good information it's not sound they're going to say whatever it is they
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:22.320]  have to say to stop the torture and uh man cal got waterboarded he left he wasn't strapped down
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:27.520]  not they should have did it the way they did it to us you were strapped down your arms and legs
[2:37:27.520 --> 2:37:32.080]  your head was put in where you couldn't move it and generally somebody dropped a knee into your
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:38.480]  stomach so you couldn't get a breath of air then they start waterboarding yeah well he was allowed
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:43.840]  to just lay there they started to waterboard him he could break it off anytime he felt like it he
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:50.160]  lasted six whole seconds and it took him about three or four minutes to compose himself and when
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:56.000]  he did he said that it was 20 times worse than what he ever imagined it to be and he definitely
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:01.200]  said it was torture jesse i've got the answer if you want to get publicity on this torture
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:06.080]  this would be huge you need and we could hire the crew even come up to minnesota have the news
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:12.960]  there do it have you waterboarded to show people and challenge media people waterboarded i'm not
[2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:19.280]  getting waterboarded no i know okay then you can do the i don't need it but i i don't if look at
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:27.440]  alex i went through but basic underwater demolition seal training a friend of mine just emailed me
[2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:33.360]  who likewise went to a different seer school than i did and he said it was torture he also went to
[2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:42.400]  but he was class 56 i was class 58 we served together overseas um if two guys who went
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:48.720]  through navy seal training are telling you that it's torture isn't that believable and not everybody
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:54.160]  knows it's torture but that's the issue of these control freaks like carl rove told him the news
[2:38:54.160 --> 2:38:59.440]  media years ago that he controls reality that they are history's actors they are saying here
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:04.080]  no it's not torture and it's okay if we do it to non-citizens but the military
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:09.840]  commissions act and the enemy combatant act states they can secretly strip a u.s citizen
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:14.960]  of their rights and then do it to us remember they swore the patriot act wouldn't be used against
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:19.840]  u.s citizens and now they admit that every state has used it thousands and thousands of times but
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:23.440]  going back jesse because i've got to get this question out to you i'm saying you're angry
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:28.720]  about torture i'm angry about it you ought to challenge all these media people that have been
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:33.760]  promoting it as a good idea and not as torture you ought to challenge them to go on national
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:39.920]  television and that you would waterboard them that was the point you know i i would not waterboard
[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:45.440]  them because i'm not a professional what you need to do is get one of these sears school instructors
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:51.680]  to do it okay what if i call man cal what am i going i've only been the recipient of it i would
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:57.360]  not want okay i would not want to be the one doing it because i'm not trained to do okay but
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:02.960]  i'll let them listen wait when they did it to all of us in sear there was a doctor right there
[2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:10.480]  so don't for them to say that this is not dangerous as a lie because how do you know what the person's
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:16.080]  heart condition is like are they giving them physicals before they do it to them i agree with
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:20.800]  you but let me go for that like when i said that big cheney i could get him to confess to the
[2:40:20.800 --> 2:40:26.320]  share and take murders i don't believe that anymore because i thought about it realized
[2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:31.920]  cheney's got that weak heart to begin with he would never last and i don't think it would kill him
[2:40:31.920 --> 2:40:38.880]  and that's the point whether you when they're doing this to people they haven't even charged
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:45.200]  them with a crime and yet we're torturing them supposedly to get information from them that's
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:51.200]  what the nazis did that's what you know and now we're doing it well then again we invade countries
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:56.880]  now don't we but but that's the point i'm trying to make is a challenge you could em see it fine
[2:40:56.880 --> 2:41:01.440]  because i couldn't get the attention to be able to do this what about having an event
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:06.560]  where you challenge all these media whores that have been on air there's dozens of them saying
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:11.360]  that it isn't torture where you publicly go on the air on all these stations you're going on
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:15.520]  well and then challenge them and challenge them and then have them come and get water
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:21.040]  boarded they'd all give up in 15 20 seconds they would all admit yes it's torture and then you
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:25.680]  would have proven the point we need to prove you know what i'd rather do it with our head
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:32.320]  government officials who really can make the change you know doing it to media people like
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:37.520]  kennedy and people like that all that's going to do is build their ratings and help for their
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:43.760]  nonsense positions i would rather do it at all i'd rather get in and see the photos alex and be
[2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:48.800]  able to come out and report to the general people what i saw well let me tell you what the army saw
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:53.200]  and guys pull it up on screen have you seen the army report it's almost got no attention
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:58.800]  msnbc new yorker magazine three years ago reported on it the army's own reported myths
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:03.840]  they torture children by design including sodomizing them in front of their parents
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:10.080]  well i find that you know that's another charge that i would have to see to believe
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:17.920]  i've got to see it i tell you what i mean if there's photographs of this i i'm not you know i'm
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:25.200]  i'm old enough i've seen enough in my life i can take it i won't lose sleep over it hopefully
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:31.200]  and okay here it is jessie i mean right now we're sorry i'm not doubting alex but again i've got
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:35.600]  you know i gotta go i want to go see this stuff i don't know i fully understand i think it's a
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:39.440]  good idea people should call obama and tell him let you in there to see him but congress has been
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:43.440]  allowed to see this and they said it included children being raped but that it shouldn't be
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:50.240]  released okay if you google sighers children raped you'll get new yorker magazine and others and we've
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:56.400]  got these up on stream you know you know what i think is better alex we need to wake up america
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:02.800]  over the fact that this is going on and that it's unacceptable and they better speak out about it no
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:07.920]  that's my point how do we get attention to it we we point this out like you're doing i mean you're
[2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:12.240]  really one of the only people that's been on national news even challenging this and and i see
[2:43:12.240 --> 2:43:17.120]  your point that you feel like you're the normal person going you don't torture people this is
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:23.360]  america and then the media is acting like you're the weirdo oh yeah and and and not only that but
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:29.760]  even people behind the scenes are telling me that this is okay to do because it's saving lives
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:38.320]  and i'm trying to say well but there's a bigger picture than even that to you know that uh if
[2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:44.960]  you believe even that we're saving lives we still have to stand for something and not only that but
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:52.720]  aren't the terrorists winning than alex i mean they can't beat us militarily we all know that
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:58.720]  but if they can change america and they can turn us into some sort of fascist
[2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:06.240]  torturing country well then they're winning well look you know you've come out you've come out and
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:11.280]  question the official fairy tale of 9 11 you know the official story is impossible you know they stage
[2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:16.880]  the gulf of tonkin and they blew up Cuban airliners and blamed it on different groups and it's in
[2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:23.440]  army manual put out in 2004 they teach captains now how to stage false flag terror attacks and so
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:29.120]  you know this whole excuse that we've got to listen to you with wiretaps to keep you safe from al-qaeda
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:34.640]  and it comes out they've been doing it for decades before 9 11 i mean it's all a big excuse to set up
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:41.520]  tearing it to know what you know what happened to me today alex what uh the normal line that i use
[2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:47.600]  because whenever whenever i do national media when i come back whether it's a book tour or whatever
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:56.080]  it is my home phones always go goofy and so does my wife's computer and sure enough i'm doing the
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:45:03.120]  media stuff on the paperback book and today the normal line that i always do my interviews on
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:08.640]  was dead and and i almost missed an interview this morning because i didn't know it was dead
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:16.240]  and uh and uh when i found out of course we were able to call up and we did the interview
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:22.960]  half hour late but that happens to me every time i go national anytime i start doing these national
[2:45:22.960 --> 2:45:29.200]  shows my telephone start going bonkers at my house is that why you said you've added extra
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:36.720]  backup phone lines now uh no i i i have them all just for purposes like the one that i've been using
[2:45:37.360 --> 2:45:43.280]  uh for doing all my media is my fax line because if i pick up the phone quick they don't get the
[2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:49.040]  fax machine you know and that's what i do because i sit right by my desk and when it rings the light
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:56.400]  goes on and that's the one i use and while that one was dead today yeah it's amazing in fact when
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:46:00.640]  you were governor you said you had the phone guy out after and they said oh yeah i've never seen
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:05.120]  anything like this oh yeah when we went when we got me hooked up because you get a red phone in
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:09.120]  your house that if it's even knocked off the hook of course the local police come which is good
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:14.320]  you know you want that ability to be protected even though you've still got protection there
[2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:20.320]  and but when they came out after i left office the professional phone guys looked at my phone
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:25.120]  and they said we've never seen a setup like what was on this thing we don't even know what it was
[2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:32.160]  it's well for those that don't remember you know i'm i'm i'm uh you know i'm i'm like the redheaded
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:37.920]  stepchild of this country i got it i you know i got elected not with money and i got elected
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:44.160]  by ideas and i beat the status quo and it scared a lot of people so i would assume they want to
[2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:49.840]  know what i'm doing well that's what i was about to say for the people that are in denial the cia
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:55.760]  visited you and 20 something of them your first day in office don't even know what my first day
[2:46:55.760 --> 2:47:00.560]  now it was your second day or whatever whatever don't know it's a couple weeks in office but uh
[2:47:00.560 --> 2:47:06.400]  and i under you know and now i know why they did it because all their questions dealt with
[2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:11.760]  how i got elected sure sure but i don't see me coming in so they were in hindsight trying to
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:16.880]  learn what happened i don't know if that's to prevent it in the future or whether it's to
[2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:23.120]  be able to understand that the future i'm not really sure to what it'll be used for well that
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:28.720]  was my point was that soon after being elected you were visited by 20 plus members of the cia who
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:33.600]  wouldn't tell you why they were there so according to what uh my my memory serves you basically said
[2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:38.480]  look i'm not gonna answer questions and left because of that that shows how well we had a
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:43.360]  question and answer period but i just you know had to give them a hard time about it but but didn't
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:47.600]  you ask them for memory uh that how you're not supposed to be operating domestically well that
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:52.320]  was my first question i asked them why they operate within the united states when their mission
[2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:57.680]  statement says that they're only supposed to be operational outside the united states why would
[2:47:57.680 --> 2:48:03.840]  they be inside it and you really can't get an answer from them they haven't gone you know and i
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:09.520]  guess uh i guess because they're federal and i was only a governor they didn't feel required to
[2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:13.520]  give me an answer well now they were breaking the law so they didn't want to comment because you were
[2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:17.760]  hitting the nail on the head okay but look i want to ask you these i'm trying to
[2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:24.800]  tell me that was it i mean you had them right between the eyes look here's the bottom line
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:30.320]  very part alex was this when i looked around the room at these 23 people
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:39.040]  oh they're your neighbors and what i mean by that is they're all ages they look like the woman
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:44.720]  down the street that comes out and sweeps her step off in the morning that didn't look like james
[2:48:44.720 --> 2:48:51.280]  bond and casino royale they look nothing like sean connery they look i guess i'm dating myself
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:57.680]  they look nothing like the quintessential secret agent that you would imagine they didn't even
[2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:05.440]  look like hollard hunt for that matter you know they looked like that was to me the real eye
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:11.920]  opener well have you noticed looking at who they were i mean have you noticed all the radio and
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:18.960]  tv ads recruiting this giant domestic cia they are recruiting for domestic operations north com
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:22.240]  is announcing that they're going to have military operations in the united states
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:29.280]  well i don't know what you know what do we do alex re-enlist and take back the military
[2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:34.560]  i'm too old well you know this is my point i believe you're a moral person and by that
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:40.320]  you follow what you think's right and you know you're not here to be bought off you're not here
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:46.640]  to compromise you do what jessie ventura thinks is right i'm telling you i studied obama this guy
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:51.680]  is a velvet glove george bush over the iron fist and he's saying they're going to continue
[2:49:51.680 --> 2:49:57.600]  to hold people secretly he's saying no rights for detainees uh he is looting us with the foreign
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:02.720]  banks just as much as george bush did down the road what is it going to take for you to start
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:07.840]  speaking out against obama a lot of folks on the road it'll be about a year from now
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:14.880]  because i've i've gotta give him his due for at least uh more than a hundred days alex i gotta
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:21.360]  see what happens and give him at least a year because i can't imagine what it was like to
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:29.360]  step into that and and and and and what he probably knows just like when i became governor
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:38.240]  after a hundred days as governor i was probably fifty percent smarter than i was prior to being
[2:50:38.240 --> 2:50:46.320]  elected governor and then i but i still was probably another 25 percent away from knowing
[2:50:46.320 --> 2:50:53.600]  everything so i've gotta give him a little bit more time before i went to before i would harshly

[2:54:18.240 --> 2:54:22.800]  his new book out in paperback international bestseller don't try to revolution without me
[2:54:22.800 --> 2:54:26.640]  don't start revolution without you you're definitely out there standing up against
[2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:32.400]  torture the police state the new world order in many ways and for the bill rights and constitution
[2:54:32.400 --> 2:54:37.040]  what do you think of christ we're going under now gm uh they're going to give them bailout
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:42.320]  money to move to china and brazil the wall street journals now reporting i mean this
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:48.320]  globalization this naftan gat this is butchered the hell out of our country well again uh you
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:54.160]  know you gotta see it happen before you you know i i i don't know the economy well enough to know
[2:54:54.720 --> 2:54:59.600]  whether the bailout is proper or not i don't you know because both sides have voted for it
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:04.560]  you know that's when you know it's bad well yeah well when bush was in he they all voted for the
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:11.360]  bailout and then obama comes and they continue to vote for the bailout is the bailout the answer
[2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:16.320]  i don't know but there's nothing we can do about it because they are our elected officials and
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:21.040]  they run the country so i guess we're going to live or die by the decisions that they make
[2:55:21.040 --> 2:55:27.840]  because after all we elected them didn't we so what happens is things start falling apart even more
[2:55:27.840 --> 2:55:34.320]  and both parties on every issue eighty ninety percent of the people want to go one way which is
[2:55:34.320 --> 2:55:39.120]  always with the bill rights and constitution the people actually on average in polls get it right
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:44.320]  but the politicians are all together with the offshore banks i mean this is coming to a head
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:51.280]  again you know it still comes down to us when you strip everything away from it all we elect them
[2:55:53.280 --> 2:56:00.080]  i've been fighting for it for i mean i i voted for john anderson way back in the 80s well you
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:06.480]  know about the money you know about the money these parties my entire adult life i understand
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:12.080]  that well alex as long as we keep electing democrats and republicans this is what you're
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:15.920]  going to get no i understand that jessie and you're right about the whole left right control
[2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:20.960]  paradigm and special interest owning both but you had celebrity and we're a sharp intelligent guy
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:26.320]  and and barely won and then they kind of figured out how to block people like you in the future
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:31.440]  it's the money the people know both parties are shot but but the money only pushes the
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:36.720]  establishment candidate i mean what do people do just vote for so for third party no matter what
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:45.440]  yeah yeah do it as a protest vote i do it i go there and when there's any an election i go there
[2:56:45.440 --> 2:56:52.480]  and i pick out any candidate who's not a democrat or republican that's what i do and i protest vote
[2:56:53.040 --> 2:56:58.880]  to me if you go there and pick them out then you play you're playing their game
[2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:05.520]  ultimately they still get to be in charge because they got you to vote for them and i'm not seeing
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:10.640]  you alex as an individual i mean everybody out there no i understand let's jam a call in bill
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:16.640]  in canada kid you're on the air with jessie van turham hey guys i don't i feel how are you
[2:57:16.640 --> 2:57:22.320]  real good hey i got a question for for both you um and it's pertaining to
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:29.600]  legitimate legitimacy of barack obama being the president and i'm just kind of surprised
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:38.080]  that nobody talks about it at all well that's because the media has chosen to to focus in
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:42.720]  on that early on instead of all the other things that were wrong with obama that we can prove all
[2:57:42.720 --> 2:57:50.160]  his lying about wiretapping and torture and police state wars and special interest they always focus
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:53.920]  on that because you can't prove it one way or the other jessie van turham what's your take on the
[2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:59.680]  whole birth certificate thing i you know i i'm not i i guess i haven't paid much attention to it at
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:08.160]  all i i i you know to me how could they how could he not be a citizen well mccain was born in the
[2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:13.040]  panama canal zone before there were bases there that's another question how could both candidates
[2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:18.880]  have questionable in but the point is there they come from parents who are from here i mean if they
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:23.840]  happen to be working abroad that doesn't mean you're not an american citizen does it well his
[2:58:23.840 --> 2:58:34.160]  mom was from here the dad was a communist from uh kenyan maybe you can be the ambassador to kenya

[3:01:53.920 --> 3:01:58.480]  like otmeg denigine comments color well yeah i understand that i'm not necessarily talking
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:02.960]  about going to war but i'm talking about something like uh when the communists took over in the
[3:02:02.960 --> 3:02:08.000]  soviet union when the communists took over in china you think it's a good idea to have a business
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:13.920]  relationship with them or shouldn't we sort of try to uh well the model well we've been doing
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:20.480]  business with china we've been doing business with vietnam and uh why wouldn't we do business
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:26.560]  with cuba let me tell you what happened you know to me remember it's it was interesting when i was
[3:02:26.560 --> 3:02:34.720]  in china do you remember when we blew up the embassy yes yeah okay so i asked some about
[3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:40.000]  some people who lived over there i said how did the chinese people take to that when we blew up
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:45.520]  their embassy and these people had lived there for 10 or 12 years they said well at first they
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:52.160]  kind of gave us some steely-eyed stairs a little bit initially but they said within 24 hours all
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:59.680]  the chinese people shrugged off and went act government you know we got to remember something
[3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:05.920]  government thrives i'm creating hostilities between we the people look here's the issue
[3:03:06.640 --> 3:03:13.120]  during the decades of embargoes against iran guess the one u.s company that was allowed to ship in
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:19.120]  oilfield and nuke components hella burton and then dick cheney got caught doing it and said oh well
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:24.720]  it's no big deal we have a subsidiary in the caymans doing it when you put those sanctions on them
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:30.720]  it only allows corrupt select groups to sell the goods and that's what these governments love jesse
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:38.160]  i agree again it's uh and you're not harming you know you when you when you put sanctions on and
[3:03:38.160 --> 3:03:44.960]  all that you're only harming the people do you think the del Castro misses a meal do you think
[3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:52.720]  somehow our sanctions make his wife somehow more demanding no all you're doing is hurting the poor
[3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:59.600]  people of cuba in not doing business with them and not attempting to raise everybody's lifestyle
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:05.760]  it's a win-win and these embargoes are not win-wins at all jesse we know the truth you just want to
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:10.880]  go surfing on those great beaches that supposedly have great waves well i could do it anyway all
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:17.360]  you got to do is sneak in there by the way though why should okay we live in a free country why should

[3:08:10.160 --> 3:08:15.920]  the governor mentura he might come in studio with us already had that in austin once a great guy uh
[3:08:17.040 --> 3:08:23.360]  when he's driving down at 35 in his rv in september october to go down to mexico and jesse
[3:08:23.360 --> 3:08:29.040]  you were telling me uh you got a new t-shirt well that's enough information alex the listeners
[3:08:29.040 --> 3:08:35.120]  don't need to know no more than that oh you're my new t-shirt that i wear now it says i got it
[3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:42.640]  down in the bar it says won't work for anything and that won't work for anything that's the
[3:08:42.640 --> 3:08:48.240]  lifestyle i'm living now i won't work for anything there's nothing that i can be offered that would
[3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:54.240]  require me to go to work and inspire me to do so but there's a positive for that since i don't
[3:08:54.240 --> 3:09:00.640]  want to work anymore that means i won't be taking up a job from somebody who does okay i've got two
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:03.680]  more questions for them we're going to take calls for the 10 or some minutes we have left with you
[3:09:03.680 --> 3:09:08.240]  over the term we appreciate all the time make them easy so i can get to the callers okay well
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:12.000]  no these now this is a heavy question and i and i wanted i was sitting there at the beach with my
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:17.120]  family this weekend thinking about this interview and i wrote these notes what makes you know jesse
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:21.760]  ventura tech but more than that i was sitting there with the sun setting with the moon up
[3:09:22.320 --> 3:09:28.240]  watching the texas coastline and you know i was sitting there thinking what is this planet
[3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:33.040]  you know what is the sun the moon we're in the middle of the galaxy in the universe and we're
[3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:38.640]  these weird creatures and we have children and our lives are so short and and and we're nothing but
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:48.080]  parasites so i wanted to ask you about that alex we give nothing back we only use well i think
[3:09:48.080 --> 3:09:52.960]  that's what every life form does you'd see life itself as a parasite so i wanted to ask but wait
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:59.920]  we have no parasite that eats us except ourselves ourselves the super predator class so that was
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:06.160]  my question what makes jesse ventura tech what do you think you know the the end of the universe is
[3:10:06.160 --> 3:10:12.320]  what is this all about i don't know you know but i i i would just say this i i feel very fortunate
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:19.680]  right now that i live in a place half the year where two two really ecological systems meet
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:25.760]  and that's the ocean in the desert and that's a very rare thing to be able to see these two
[3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:33.760]  meet and see the results of it and it's a remarkable life to live and watch it and the pace of it because
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:40.480]  even though the pace is very slow it's constantly changing no day is ever the same
[3:10:41.040 --> 3:10:47.440]  even though they may appear to be they're not and that you know and right now i like the
[3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:54.080]  solitude of that life and i like the life of exploring simple things a little bit you know
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:11:00.000]  i've been caught up on my whole career in front of crowds and in front of you know getting named
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:06.480]  notoriety and becoming quote unquote this event and at this point in my life i i strive for a
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:11.920]  much more solitude quiet existence you know that's what i've discovered i don't get bored alex
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:17.280]  no well and more than a just experience it's that hierarchy of needs you've gotten fame and
[3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:22.160]  fortune and notoriety and and you know been well known and are more well known today than ever
[3:11:22.160 --> 3:11:27.440]  and so you don't need it as much and in my own little small way i sure wanted to be successful
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:32.800]  and sure wanted to be the big radio host and now that people know me everywhere i go even other
[3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:38.080]  countries and i can't imagine you know as as as much fame as you've got in a way it's a blessing
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:44.720]  but it's also a curse so i actually constantly wander lost about i wish i could go get lost on
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:50.400]  some forgotten seashore but but then i feel sorry well the point is alex you just have to do it when
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:11:56.320]  you're when you decide to make the move which i did after teaching at harvard i just felt you know
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:01.600]  the window of opportunity of adventures closing on me because of father time you know you always
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:07.120]  remember that as an athlete there's one opponent you'll never beat the end of that is time no matter
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:12.560]  how great we are we're not on the great adventure you know and so for me it's a matter of just
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:18.400]  you have to make a choice at some point like i did and grow up on this adventure
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:22.880]  here and that's what i'm doing right now and i'm not letting anything get the way and
[3:12:23.360 --> 3:12:28.800]  when i'm down there i don't even pay attention to a lot of the things that you know when i'm down
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:35.840]  there i never hear the word terrorism it's weird and yet when i come back to this country
[3:12:35.840 --> 3:12:42.080]  not a day goes by that you don't hear that word well that's clearly being used to to control us
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:48.640]  well it's also a to create a lifestyle of fear you know and the life that i lead believe it or
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:55.520]  not down deep in mexico is a lifestyle of total unfair you know it and there is there really
[3:12:55.520 --> 3:13:01.360]  is that the only fear is that you might get hit by a hurricane what do the locals think while uh
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:07.520]  coming stomping out of the dunes is uh jesse ventura they don't know me from anyone i'm just a big
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:13.280]  gringo that can't speak good spanish you know that's all they know out of me because you know i don't
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:19.360]  dress well you know in any provocative way when i'm down there i wear old blue jeans and t-shirts
[3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:26.720]  and i barefoot as much as i possibly could be and so i i i gained that freedom down there even
[3:13:26.720 --> 3:13:32.160]  when i go to town there's no one there in town that ever recognizes me i guess they don't watch
[3:13:32.160 --> 3:13:38.000]  larry king of that stuff down there so uh but you're a character anywhere i mean you would draw
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:42.880]  attention anywhere just because i don't know not really only because of the physical presence
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:48.480]  and and many many times i'm told even by tourists that i run into down there is that they don't
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:54.720]  recognize me till i speak so if i keep my big mouth shut i can tend to stay anonymous a little bit
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:13:58.640]  you know what it is i think the image of you with a shaved head in the mustache is the more
[3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:05.280]  iconic one from the governor and and it's it's probably the long hair it might be we'll go back
[3:14:05.280 --> 3:14:12.880]  to the dreadlocks at the beard again i wrote my motorcycle that whole summer and was never once
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:18.000]  recognized on it all through minnesota where i've been governor a mere couple years before
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:22.400]  sounds good to me uh let's talk about the only thing they were doing where people were locking
[3:14:22.400 --> 3:14:31.200]  their doors at the stop lights because they thought i looked so sinister well hey you are a member of
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:37.360]  one of the more tough guy sinister biking clubs aren't you well i used to be years and years ago
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:45.600]  you know i left in 1975 i was part of the black and white which is the mongols and uh we carry a
[3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:53.040]  bit of a reputation you know but uh that was just another life that i decided when i came out of the

[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:24.480]  like to interact with brother ventura thank you very much brother ventura for your courage to
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:30.400]  speak out about some topics that don't know that a retired military has spoken before i would like
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:36.640]  to make a comment and a short question to you you as i are familiar with the expression one
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:42.080]  submarine always a marine that is almost the same like once a military always a military
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:47.200]  over a year like in other places around the world with dictatorship they say that the difference
[3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:52.480]  between a civilian and a military is that the civilian almost ever can be militarized while a
[3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:59.360]  military almost never can be civilized my question is how can i trust a former military
[3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:05.120]  will embrace their brothers and sisters in civilian life once retired oh yeah i get the
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:08.960]  question i gotta let you go because we only got a minute left we got a little how can you
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:14.240]  trust someone who is in the military what about george washington well i i believe you can trust
[3:18:14.240 --> 3:18:20.080]  someone who is in the military just by talking to them and realize that they served in the
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:25.680]  military to protect the freedoms that we hold true and that uh you know i remember during the war
[3:18:25.680 --> 3:18:31.040]  in vietnam i was asked at one point they were going to march on the base and i refused i told
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:35.680]  them i won't go out there and beat up americans that's ridiculous i didn't i will not do that
[3:18:35.680 --> 3:18:39.600]  that's a first amendment right they have the right to protest oh really they asked you
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:43.040]  to go beat up people when you were told they didn't ask me to beat them up they just had
[3:18:43.040 --> 3:18:47.600]  me they wanted me to stand watch and if these people pushed forward well what else would
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:53.360]  we be able to do and i don't want to be in that position because i thought i didn't join the
[3:18:53.360 --> 3:18:59.360]  military to beat on americans well absolutely nothing and what they did how they covered
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:04.000]  i didn't have duty that day so see how smart i was i got out of duty and could go to the beach
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:10.880]  well no that's what comes down to my madness always alex well you know the military kills
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:14.720]  people and breaks things they don't police their own people isn't that the very definition of a
[3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:21.040]  police state yeah exactly you know our our military should not be in so just because you served in
[3:19:21.040 --> 3:19:27.600]  the military does not mean that you can't be trusted as a civilian because you chose to get
[3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:32.560]  out of the military i chose to after six years and certainly embrace being a civilian again
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:36.880]  governor ventura let me say bye to you during the break uh that's it for the interview but

[3:24:08.560 --> 3:24:12.320]  like i know i was going currently through your calls that was because i wanted to get as many
[3:24:12.320 --> 3:24:21.440]  in as i could for guessing the term look i have sent him articles i've sent him films
[3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:28.560]  and i have seen him wake up and then talk about those things on the news and
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:34.160]  he's an influential guy because the media has him on a lot they find him interesting the public
[3:24:34.160 --> 3:24:40.800]  finds him interesting multiple generations like him and so we are slowly educating him and he came
[3:24:40.800 --> 3:24:45.360]  out for 911 truth on my show when i called him up at the show he said i'm going to come on your
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:50.320]  show i remember you give me those videos and austin and i've seen some more and i'm going to come on
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:56.080]  your show and break that i think they blew the towers up and you heard ventura on this show
[3:24:56.080 --> 3:25:01.200]  break that just like willy nelson and jesse ventura and rick link letter and so many others
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:06.800]  have come on here and it's gotten news every time that was in the associated press national news
[3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:12.000]  you name it when uh willy nelson came out and then it makes it kosher for other people to
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:16.880]  say oh 911's an inside job but i disagree with ventura on quite a few issues but i think overall
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:27.600]  he's a good guy plus i know him in person and uh oh it doesn't matter look i want to go over cyber
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.520]  security in detail at the end of the show and integrate it in with all this other news and
[3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:36.160]  and the thing that happened with general motors going bankrupt and the dollar plunging it's it's
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:41.840]  just getting too insane but let's go to mark in oregon who had a lengthy question i think we're
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:48.160]  talking about my film versus ventura and and uh so i let's go back to mark mark go ahead yeah
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:54.320]  alex i was just going to say that you know i i've been listening to the obama deception clip
[3:25:54.320 --> 3:25:59.440]  so many times and of course jesse ventura has a very strong presence even in an audio sense
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:07.440]  and he says that obama has been fudging since day one of the election up to the presidency and i
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:15.920]  assume that he includes the presidency is fudging but i see it as if not disingenuous just highly
[3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:22.560]  ironic and contradictory that he says he wants to give obama a year to see how he's going to do
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:28.560]  when he must have seen the obama deception by now he may he may be trying to protect his own life
[3:26:28.560 --> 3:26:35.040]  and his own family and i respect that but people who have a public voice and who have fame if they
[3:26:35.040 --> 3:26:40.400]  don't step out in front of the microphone at this point and expose the evil tyranny which is about
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:47.120]  to engulf us all alex which is what the info war is all about is to try to expose this this tyranny
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:52.160]  that they want to put on us and they're so close to it and i know that because i follow you very
[3:26:52.160 --> 3:26:59.040]  closely and you have all of the accurate information which proves that and shows that so clearly uh no
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:04.240]  no i hear you and i figured uh that that was a long point that's why i held you over uh and i
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:09.360]  appreciate your call i mean what do i say to that ventura came out and said he's already fudging
[3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:16.560]  about the war he's fudging about all these things and then now he realizes obama's popular and
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:24.720]  that i've talked to him privately too he doesn't want to be premature and really going after obama
[3:27:24.720 --> 3:27:28.160]  but i'm sure you're gonna see him criticize i mean you heard him say the democrats are all bad too
[3:27:29.280 --> 3:27:34.880]  don't vote for any of them i didn't vote for any of them i just think that uh well i heard him on
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:41.280]  fox say i hate bush so much that anything's better but see that's a lie bush was obviously arrogant
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:47.440]  obviously bad obviously corrupt he wasn't a good salesman like obama who's slick and charismatic
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:52.320]  he's much more dangerous you know we had a caller before ventura came on
[3:27:53.440 --> 3:27:58.720]  who i didn't really comment back to because i knew they just got ventura on right when i went to
[3:27:58.720 --> 3:28:03.440]  his call ventura was on a little bit earlier than he was supposed to be uh which is fine we just had
[3:28:03.440 --> 3:28:07.680]  more time with him the caller's like i think you're secretly a right winger and you really like
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:15.760]  george bush and that's why you you know criticize obama and not george bush and that's just asinine
[3:28:16.880 --> 3:28:24.400]  i mean i went on air when george bush had a 90 plus percent approval rating 94 largest in us history
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:30.400]  and i said the people controlling him staged the 911 attacks with no other host was saying that
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:36.000]  or doing that and i was attacked on this network by their talk show host and i had people george
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:41.920]  Humphrey's really nice tv producer nice lady got in my face and cussed at me the night after 911
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:48.720]  my show was on after theirs and she was there and she got in my face and cussed me out and a couple
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:52.480]  years later was running george's show and never apologized when they were doing 911 truth
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:59.600]  you know i mean i've got to be there first folks i'm always there saying the hard things that need
[3:28:59.600 --> 3:29:08.640]  to be said and i detest george bush and uh his handlers dick cheney and carl roe and it's wrong
[3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:13.760]  and mentally ill when all those fake mainline right wingers were calling me a hardcore communist
[3:29:13.760 --> 3:29:19.040]  and a taliban sympathizer and i was secretly trained in taliban camps and all this made up crap
[3:29:20.480 --> 3:29:24.880]  to then when obama comes out and i say my gosh this guy is the worst thing that we ever seen
[3:29:24.880 --> 3:29:29.760]  because he is slick and go oh you're just a right winger you're so desperate to hold on to your
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:34.960]  left right paradigm that you've got to put me in and make me part of it just look hate me love me
[3:29:34.960 --> 3:29:40.640]  whatever just don't put me in that don't don't don't you know don't tell me what i think and what i

[3:33:08.320 --> 3:33:25.600]  radio network the fresh news agency had a headline we linked to up on prison planet dot com
[3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:35.040]  sunday that told like it is cyber security the new direction of the pentagon they're saying
[3:33:35.040 --> 3:33:39.760]  everything is cyber everything is internet everything is computer everything is hacking
[3:33:39.760 --> 3:33:45.440]  computers everything is loading viruses onto printers that they gave the iraqis in the months
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:54.400]  before the invasion in 1991 1990 this is the control grid this is the master control system
[3:33:54.400 --> 3:34:02.480]  and i filled up almost an entire booklet this weekend of ideas and points i wanted to make
[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:10.080]  about this and i tend to get off into other news and start taking calls and having guests on and
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:15.680]  not getting to all this properly because i don't want to just cover a piece of it i want to cover
[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:21.040]  every piece of it that i see and then every pre-program response like earlier i've tried
[3:34:21.040 --> 3:34:26.640]  to get into this twice today and then run out of time and i just get to the point of yes they're
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:31.680]  announcing this is the power to shut the internet off yes they're saying they're going to filter
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:35.920]  yes they're saying they're going to restrict you know just so when i talk about this and people are
[3:34:35.920 --> 3:34:40.480]  listening or watching at prison planet dot tv or a year from now watching this you know when it's
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:48.480]  got a million views on the internet somewhere if we still have the web that i can counter that's
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:54.080]  why i'm successful i can counter every preconditioned piece of this info they have if i take the time
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:59.600]  out to do it because i know the first thing when i get up here on air and say they're openly
[3:34:59.600 --> 3:35:03.280]  announcing they want to be able to shut the internet down they're not shutting it down that's
[3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:08.960]  impossible they are saying they want the power to be able to shut it down that they're going to tax
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:13.920]  it and regulate it and track everything you do and make you have subdomains on other people's sites
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:19.600]  and get rid of the free internet as we know it and yes if they take over all the major hubs yes
[3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:26.000]  they can do it and then i can get into all the evidence but there's just so much denial i mean
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:30.880]  i had people up until last week denying gm was going to go bankrupt when i told you two and a
[3:35:30.880 --> 3:35:37.600]  half years ago it was i think i need to hire just an employee to go through all our videos and
[3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:43.920]  articles and shows just to toot our horn because that's what matters that that that that is effective
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:48.640]  here's lindsay williams and he got it from a separate source former head of an oil company
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:54.080]  going around saying um nine ten months ago that oil for at least the next six to eight months was
[3:35:54.080 --> 3:36:01.280]  going to drop below fifty dollars a barrel when it was at 149 a barrel that sounded insane it happened
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:08.320]  and then a listener pointed out hey paul watson wrote a bill berg group article
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:12.880]  jim tucker said his bill berg sources said they were going to cut the price of oil by at least
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:20.480]  half that sounded crazy in 2008 in june a year ago just a year ago sounded it was 149 dollars a
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:26.800]  barrel it sounded insane and it turns out we're the source of all that the source of the revelations
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:31.920]  prisonplanet.com with that exclusive with jim tucker and we don't even know we predicted it
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:38.400]  like everything else i mean we know if they're exact plan that's why they're attacking me everywhere
[3:36:38.400 --> 3:36:43.360]  and going after me with asinine attacks in mainstream media and alternative and everywhere else
[3:36:44.320 --> 3:36:50.080]  because they know we've hit on what's accurate and it takes me realizing just how important
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:55.520]  that the issues are i'm talking about well you call rob doing here i want to ask who's on the
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:36:59.040]  show tomorrow because i know i told him a bunch of guests i want on and i may just cancel some of
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:04.160]  what you call doing here i want to decide right now because i may just do four hours with no
[3:37:04.160 --> 3:37:09.440]  calls no guests no nothing to go over all my notes and things i want to cover because it's
[3:37:09.440 --> 3:37:13.920]  exhaust i'm not whining but it's just it is it's it's it's psychologically and intellectually

[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:50.720]  some new hard thing will happen tomorrow let me just do this as simply as i can i'll do a simple
[3:37:50.720 --> 3:37:55.760]  synopsis tomorrow i printed a bunch of articles up to back all this up and then we'll uh
[3:37:58.320 --> 3:38:02.320]  we'll detail it all tomorrow at least one hour of the show plus the economy and the bankers
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:08.880]  and killing the dollar openly i mean it's all happening they're openly raping us come on in uh

[3:38:42.160 --> 3:38:46.880]  radio show possible number one we're going to have the money bomb june eleventh a listener
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:53.440]  started the first money bomb eric northstrom it was listeners ideas and the extra two hundred
[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:58.800]  fifty thousand dollars that was raised helped us move into a seven thousand eight hundred and
[3:38:58.800 --> 3:39:05.200]  something square foot building helped you you know helped us set up this prison planet dot tv
[3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:12.960]  system that you're seeing right now and took us to that level um if we could if we could raise
[3:39:12.960 --> 3:39:19.040]  another two hundred thousand dollars i could hire a couple more video people and get the space next
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:23.840]  to us and do the tv thing properly if not i'll do it on the cheap's that we have had something
[3:39:23.840 --> 3:39:28.800]  like thirty thousand dollars pledged so far or actually given you can enter your email there
[3:39:28.800 --> 3:39:35.200]  to pledge you can stay in contact with us it's uh info wars money bomb dot com info wars money

[3:39:45.360 --> 3:39:51.520]  dollars and uh the hundred percent of them of the money bomb money will go towards buying new
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:57.680]  equipment and personnel and what we need to do here and believe me i almost don't want to take
[3:39:57.680 --> 3:40:03.440]  on more responsibilities but other people aren't doing it so we've got to go to the next level and
[3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:08.640]  do it and i've been trying to put more things out like the new erin rusa video that's now out at

[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:37.280]  my god i'm just little alex jones and i'm down here at port aransas at the start of the big beach
[3:41:37.280 --> 3:41:44.160]  season absolute heaven baking sun i mean i just i swim around on the ocean all day the water
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:51.920]  i i could say i visited the caribbean this weekend but i didn't i visited the gulf of
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:58.880]  mexico i've never seen the gulf this clear i swam out 500 yards or so onto the jetty
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:04.240]  because i get there at the jetty to crab fish and there's scuba divers everywhere going i'm
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:11.200]  seeing spanish mackerel and sergeant fish and sharks and people were catching sharks and i went
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:16.000]  to the store bought a cheap mask and snorkel over jellyfish i didn't care you couldn't keep me out
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:24.080]  of clear water i jumped in that and and and skin dived for hours the jetty it was absolute heaven
[3:42:24.080 --> 3:42:28.400]  and going to that jetty since i was a little kid and it's it's not dirty water it's just sandy and
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:35.680]  churning and it was it was amazing i was i mean to dive the port aransas jetty was a real treat

[3:42:41.440 --> 3:42:45.040]  the big stinging kind people call me crazy but it was fun because they all had wet suits on
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:51.440]  thought i was nuts but and i did i saw spanish mackerel big old crabs walking across the bottom
[3:42:51.440 --> 3:42:55.680]  because it's a different type of beach to to uh skin dive than the caribbean

[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:12.560]  see i hesitate on all this like i've been doing a lot of thinking about the nature of man the
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:17.360]  nature of the universe the nature of our species our history what we are what we're meant to do
[3:47:17.360 --> 3:47:23.280]  it's mind-blowing revelations of research and and of understanding and everything that i've been
[3:47:23.280 --> 3:47:31.840]  having just amazing but then i want to articulate it properly and now i'm finishing up a book the
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:38.720]  answer in 1974 1776 and i've got to lock myself in the office in here this week and next week to finish it
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:45.280]  and the book telegraphs a lot of these ideas but not all of them and
[3:47:45.280 --> 3:47:54.240]  and i want to move slowly on air i want to diagram and blueprint everything and show the
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:47:59.840]  interconnections almost like a college course so it's done and i can say there it is that's
[3:47:59.840 --> 3:48:08.480]  how they operate that's how i understand what they're doing but simply put you know the feds
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:12.960]  want rfid tracker chips and all products and you know that they listen to all the cell phones
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:17.040]  and regular phone calls and emails and faxes under federal law and that's now been admitted
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:21.600]  and you know that they're announcing they want cyber security to save us from al-qaeda and the
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:27.920]  russians and the chinese supposedly attacking the internet and then i see all these articles
[3:48:27.920 --> 3:48:34.560]  where the pentagon cyber security in san antonio has meetings and says oh we're attacking our own
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:39.600]  networks to test feasibility and then we tell the public we've been hit by the russians as a pretext
[3:48:39.600 --> 3:48:44.560]  to get this passed just completely immoral out in the open i've got all those articles
[3:48:45.600 --> 3:48:50.800]  and i can't even get the public to the point of being able to understand that or admit that
[3:48:50.800 --> 3:48:56.720]  because they're too busy emailing me saying it's impossible to shut the web down well here's mother
[3:48:56.720 --> 3:49:01.200]  jones should obama control the internet should president obama the power to shut down domestic
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:05.440]  internet traffic during a state of emergency and that's what three months ago they had a cyber
[3:49:05.440 --> 3:49:09.840]  security that they hired quit and said this is a government pentagon takeover of the web to shut
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:16.480]  it down and to end the freedom on it i mean he's on record this is the guy the white house hired
[3:49:16.480 --> 3:49:21.520]  boldly comes out with courage i'm surprised he hasn't committed suicide tells you what's a police
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:26.960]  state and the thumb suckers are emailing me saying it isn't real of course it's real just like two
[3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:31.360]  and a half years ago we read articles where they were planning to shut down general motors and ship
[3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:38.480]  it to china and brazil and now it's going to happen in front of your eyes this isn't a freaking game
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:45.040]  people this is the end of our republic senators john rockefeller olympia snow thinks so that the
[3:49:45.040 --> 3:49:48.880]  web should be shut down on wednesday introduced a bill establishing the office of national
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:50:03.120]  cyber security here's another one and this is my federal law stated in the bill go read it we're
[3:50:03.120 --> 3:50:10.160]  linked to it read it instead of saying it in real face it we're not in kansas anymore they say that
[3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:16.000]  they will go in and even small isp's will have government switches on them and everything has
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:21.760]  to be wired through the government equipment that's the telecommunications act of 1996 where it said
[3:50:21.760 --> 3:50:26.800]  all phone companies and all telecommunications and all internet have to be wired through our
[3:50:26.800 --> 3:50:31.440]  equipment and they built whole floors or whole buildings next door to every phone company hub
[3:50:32.080 --> 3:50:37.200]  publicly with everything wired to the nsa and i made films 10 years ago telling you that because
[3:50:37.200 --> 3:50:42.480]  i had the telecommunications act and then they come out last year san francisco control room
[3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:47.840]  everything goes through it and there's boxes like this all over the country and they go well how
[3:50:47.840 --> 3:50:52.560]  did they know they knew because the engineers knew what they were designing for the nsa to then only
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:50:58.080]  have keys to the door but we knew from the telecommunications act it stated what it was
