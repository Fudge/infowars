[00:00.000 --> 00:12.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.920 --> 00:22.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:22.400 --> 00:27.600]  welcome to the alex jones show on this friday december 19th 2014 i'm david night
[00:27.600 --> 00:31.680]  your host here in austin alex jones is going to be joining us from the road in
[00:31.680 --> 00:35.280]  the second hour at the bottom of this hour we're going to be talking to paul
[00:35.280 --> 00:42.720]  joseph watson about the absurdity of this sony hack of the interview the way
[00:42.720 --> 00:47.120]  this is being played out the way that it's being used to call for internet
[00:47.120 --> 00:51.080]  censorship again we have an article up on info wars dot com from paul joseph
[00:51.080 --> 00:57.080]  watson the sony hack reinvigorates support for privacy busting syspa style
[00:57.080 --> 01:01.560]  legislation yes that's exactly what they've wanted all along i believe this
[01:01.560 --> 01:05.960]  is a false flag i believe even if it's not a false flag i do believe that it is
[01:05.960 --> 01:09.400]  i'll tell you why i think it is even if it isn't it was obvious from the
[01:09.400 --> 01:12.680]  beginning that they were going to try to make the case for this i had no idea it
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.560]  was going to get this big i thought this was an absurd story from the beginning
[01:17.560 --> 01:21.720]  we have some analysis of some of the emails that appeared there and the
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.640]  state department itself said north korea is always making blustery claims we
[01:25.640 --> 01:29.240]  don't take any of this stuff seriously but now they're taking it seriously now
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.000]  they're saying we have a house cyber committee chairman saying
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.680]  first sony next to the electric grid then wall street
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.160]  we have a leak of a well actually it's not leaked it was declassified by the
[01:41.160 --> 01:47.000]  defense intelligence agency says when do they declassify 10 year old reports
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.400]  from the defense intelligence agency only when it's to their advantage to
[01:51.400 --> 01:54.600]  spread fear mongering and so we have a report that they declassified that said
[01:54.600 --> 01:59.320]  hey north korea was planning to do attacks on u.s nuclear plants with
[01:59.320 --> 02:02.120]  guys running around i don't know if they're going to throw scorpion bombs at
[02:02.120 --> 02:04.200]  them like they're talking about isis having
[02:04.200 --> 02:07.240]  you know that story from the daily mail where they said that people are being
[02:07.240 --> 02:10.920]  terrorized by isis because they were putting scorpions and clay pots and
[02:10.920 --> 02:14.520]  throwing them at the residents to terrorize them so presumably uh the
[02:14.520 --> 02:17.560]  defense intelligence agency now wants us to believe that
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.240]  10 years ago north korea was planning attacks on u.s nuclear
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.480]  plants but of course they didn't nothing happened with that and of course
[02:25.480 --> 02:28.120]  they could have probably because we have very
[02:28.120 --> 02:31.400]  likes controls if they're concerned about that why don't they do something
[02:31.400 --> 02:34.920]  about the border but of course they're going to use this
[02:34.920 --> 02:39.160]  anyway they can we now have a we also have another report from
[02:39.160 --> 02:42.680]  a news organization here fox news actually is reporting
[02:42.680 --> 02:46.200]  evidence and sony hack attack suggests possible
[02:46.200 --> 02:50.680]  involvement by iran china or russia that's right
[02:50.680 --> 02:54.680]  fill in the blank any enemy will do we can blame anybody for this we can
[02:54.680 --> 02:59.240]  excuse any activity because we all have to be
[02:59.240 --> 03:02.680]  so scared about these baseless
[03:02.680 --> 03:08.520]  blustery attack threats from supposedly north korea
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.320]  they don't identify themselves as north korea they identify themselves as
[03:11.320 --> 03:14.920]  guardians of peace richard nixon first used that phrase when he went to nixon
[03:14.920 --> 03:18.760]  he said we're here as the guardians of peace we come in peace
[03:18.760 --> 03:21.960]  it's like another movie marz attacks maybe we ought to start calling these
[03:21.960 --> 03:25.720]  neokines gop guardians of peace and we could
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.160]  include in the gop all the democrats that play along with them
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.680]  all the news media that plays along with them there's a lot of
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.040]  lies coming out in the news we've got nebraska and oklahoma
[03:36.040 --> 03:40.120]  are suing colorado over marijuana legalization
[03:40.120 --> 03:44.680]  they're saying that the legalization of marijuana has created an increased
[03:44.680 --> 03:47.800]  law enforcement burden in neighboring states and so you've got the attorney
[03:47.800 --> 03:52.200]  general from nebraska and oklahoma claiming that federal
[03:52.200 --> 03:57.240]  marijuana prohibition trumps colorado's law isn't that sad
[03:57.240 --> 04:01.160]  isn't that sad throwing the tenth amendment under the bus
[04:01.160 --> 04:04.760]  to support marijuana prohibition which they never
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.000]  put into the constitution why did we have alcohol prohibition put in the
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.960]  constitution but no other drug they just declare
[04:11.960 --> 04:15.320]  everything is illegal unless they explicitly
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.160]  approve it and that's what we have here with this and of course
[04:19.160 --> 04:22.360]  the it's just the opposite of that the states
[04:22.360 --> 04:26.680]  uh trump the federal government on that because the federal government doesn't
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.200]  have any directly delegated authority to prohibit
[04:30.200 --> 04:33.480]  anything like drugs we also see another lie coming from
[04:33.480 --> 04:36.920]  verizon saying that their new encrypted calling act
[04:36.920 --> 04:41.320]  is going to encrypt everything from the call to the source but then
[04:41.320 --> 04:44.840]  we see from a report from bloomberg they're talking about how
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.920]  they've been playing football with the nsa and they have backdoors open to them
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.000]  it doesn't matter if you have encryption if you've got a backdoor
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  handoff of all the data to the nsa at the source
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.840]  stay with us we'll be right back for all of recorded history civilizations

[08:15.480 --> 08:19.960]  six times officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect in the

[08:23.480 --> 08:27.720]  save me i don't understand what's going on a community rates low on an
[08:27.720 --> 08:31.960]  information scale when the press radio and other
[08:31.960 --> 08:36.440]  channels of communication are controlled by only a few people
[08:36.440 --> 08:39.400]  doesn't raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce
[08:39.400 --> 08:41.480]  stories about the government that wind up being
[08:41.480 --> 08:44.200]  aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government
[08:44.200 --> 08:47.960]  how time you're asked what's your question what difference at this point
[08:47.960 --> 08:52.120]  doesn't make quite a confident observer looks for signs of despotism in the
[08:52.120 --> 08:56.360]  community looks beyond fine words and noble phrases
[08:56.360 --> 08:59.880]  there are actions i have the legal authority to take as president
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.600]  that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just
[09:04.600 --> 09:09.160]  tonight i'm announcing those actions what i say go see

[09:14.200 --> 09:18.440]  you saw you died
[09:18.440 --> 09:22.440]  yes and modern warfare our military leaders are finding that words and
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.000]  ideas are highly effective weapons you just have to be repetitive about this
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.320]  we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into
[09:31.320 --> 09:34.440]  thinking about guns in a vastly different way
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.520]  we are trained to deceive if we have to you really don't have to trust me you
[09:38.520 --> 09:40.840]  shouldn't trust me in fact by my actually
[09:40.840 --> 09:44.840]  participating that i will take the news communities of this kind
[09:44.840 --> 09:50.440]  despotism stands a good chance the nine most terrifying words in the
[09:50.440 --> 09:53.720]  english language are i'm from the government and i'm

[10:14.360 --> 10:17.880]  david night your host alex jones is going to be joining us in the second
[10:17.880 --> 10:20.360]  hour paul joseph watson is going to be joining us
[10:20.360 --> 10:23.400]  at the bottom of this hour to talk about this
[10:23.400 --> 10:27.560]  sony free speech syspa issue and that's really what it is that's the way they're
[10:27.560 --> 10:30.200]  turning this regardless of who's releasing all the
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.280]  gossipy emails this is going to be used to try to justify
[10:34.280 --> 10:37.400]  censorship political correctness and most importantly
[10:37.400 --> 10:41.560]  shutting down the internet without any due process that was what syspa was
[10:41.560 --> 10:45.720]  always about these media companies uh in hollywood especially
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.000]  the music companies the mpaa they're absolutely convinced
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.600]  that they're losing a ton of money mpaa is convinced that they're
[10:52.600 --> 10:58.120]  dropping sales are result of piracy not the trashy music they're putting out
[10:58.120 --> 11:03.240]  so they are hard on to get this passed and they have been working with every
[11:03.240 --> 11:06.520]  kind of legislative uh issue that they have over the last
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.520]  several years we've had it i think it's five times had sopa syspa acta pippa
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.280]  uh syspa again they still haven't been able to get those passed
[11:14.280 --> 11:18.920]  through we've had uh european parliaments shut it down as well as american
[11:18.920 --> 11:23.240]  uh representative government nobody wants this we don't want to see the
[11:23.240 --> 11:27.080]  internet taken over the ability to shut down
[11:27.080 --> 11:30.200]  sites if one of these major corporations just
[11:30.200 --> 11:35.000]  uh labels you as someone who has infringed upon their copyright without
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.480]  any due process without a trial just immediately
[11:37.480 --> 11:40.760]  take you down black we don't want to see that happen but they do
[11:40.760 --> 11:43.800]  they're going to try to push it through in the trans specific partnership we've
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.240]  seen that data leaked but now they're going to try to justify it with this and
[11:47.240 --> 11:50.440]  they're also telling us that we have to be worried because the next thing is a
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.840]  wall street the power grid nuclear power plants uh this is all
[11:54.840 --> 11:58.200]  things that we have to be concerned about so we've got to give control of the
[11:58.200 --> 12:01.720]  internet explicitly to the government that's the way they're going to use this
[12:01.720 --> 12:04.440]  but as part of these emails that have come out
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.880]  we've also seen evidence that sony was working with the rand corporation with
[12:09.880 --> 12:13.400]  a consultant there who specializes in north korea as well as with the state
[12:13.400 --> 12:18.600]  department to make this into a propaganda vehicle
[12:18.600 --> 12:22.360]  that they could use to overthrow the north korean government
[12:22.360 --> 12:25.560]  and in this analysis of this we're going to talk about this more with paul
[12:25.560 --> 12:28.200]  joseph watson they said wow the north korea is going to be upset
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.680]  are you upset that an absurdist comedy would be used as propaganda
[12:32.680 --> 12:38.600]  do you realize that every movie that hollywood does is carefully feeding you a
[12:38.600 --> 12:41.160]  message feeding you their worldview feeding you their
[12:41.160 --> 12:44.280]  political view doing predictive programming to you
[12:44.280 --> 12:46.840]  that is what they were doing with this i said it's going to get people in the
[12:46.840 --> 12:49.400]  south thinking about what it takes to get rid
[12:49.400 --> 12:53.240]  of this north korean regime especially kim jung
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.000]  and of course these are going to find their way into
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.680]  north korea from south korea so they'll get them thinking about it too
[13:00.680 --> 13:05.320]  that was a very chilling revelation we're going to talk to paul joseph watson at
[13:05.320 --> 13:08.360]  the bottom of the hour about all the different fallout from sony how absurd
[13:08.360 --> 13:11.640]  it's gotten that they're now banning a team america
[13:11.640 --> 13:15.800]  that some of the theaters are going to play in its place what's next red dawn
[13:15.800 --> 13:19.320]  we have they they held that up for a year because the complaints from the
[13:19.320 --> 13:22.120]  chinese government then they made the north koreans the
[13:22.120 --> 13:25.640]  bad guys and that finally when they came out i guess that's now been banned too
[13:25.640 --> 13:29.560]  out of political correctness and fear uh in the last segment i was talking about
[13:29.560 --> 13:33.240]  how nebraska and oklahoma are going to sue colorado over marijuana legalization
[13:33.240 --> 13:35.560]  saying the attorney generals they're saying that
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.560]  it has increased their law enforcement burden to have marijuana be legal
[13:39.560 --> 13:42.600]  in colorado look if they're worried about their law
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.760]  enforcement burden they need to talk to the federal government about the open
[13:46.760 --> 13:49.640]  borders and the mexican drug cartels they don't
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.480]  need to try to destroy the tenth amendment and what they're saying is
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.960]  well we believe that federal marijuana prohibition preempts colorado's law
[13:57.960 --> 14:02.200]  there is no legitimate federal prohibition of marijuana in the first
[14:02.200 --> 14:04.840]  place they never passed a constitutional amendment
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.600]  to prohibit it they don't have the power the reason we have
[14:08.600 --> 14:13.080]  a prohibition of alcohol we got two amendments in the constitution
[14:13.080 --> 14:15.880]  one prohibiting alcohol another one making it legal again the reason they
[14:15.880 --> 14:19.240]  put that in there was because once upon a time in america
[14:19.240 --> 14:22.600]  we had a congress that respected the constitution
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.440]  these guys know fully well that the tenth amendment stands that if they
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.200]  don't have specifically delegated authority
[14:30.200 --> 14:33.960]  then they don't have the authority to prohibit anything in any country in a
[14:33.960 --> 14:37.560]  court in any uh state and of course the uh states
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.400]  reserve those rights and they have just exercised it in colorado so they're
[14:41.400 --> 14:44.680]  now trying to overthrow that in adjacent states we also see a head fake
[14:44.680 --> 14:48.120]  from varizon talking about they have a new encrypted app
[14:48.120 --> 14:51.320]  it's offered by cell crypt they released this yesterday they say they're going to
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.880]  offer encryption for business and government customers end to end
[14:55.880 --> 14:59.400]  and then there's an asterix and they say well law enforcement agencies will be
[14:59.400 --> 15:01.880]  able to access communications that take place
[15:01.880 --> 15:05.800]  over voice cypher as long as there's a legitimate
[15:05.800 --> 15:09.640]  law enforcement reason for doing so now you know how that works out
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.480]  you know that they don't need to have a search warrant
[15:13.480 --> 15:16.360]  they don't need to have a reason they just pass some legislation in the
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.680]  congress doing that so that's nothing but a head fake
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.520]  also as a head fake we see autism linked to particulate air pollution this is
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.280]  something that the epa has been trying to do for a very long time
[15:30.280 --> 15:34.600]  we'll talk about that more in detail also uh the fda just slipped through
[15:34.600 --> 15:38.360]  approval of a more potent form of garter cell
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.520]  twice the aluminum there you go that's what you uh were calling for you said
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.200]  you know what we need is we need a vaccine with twice the aluminum so
[15:46.200 --> 15:50.120]  you've got it and we're going to talk about what the numbers really tell us
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.800]  from merc's study how much more risky uh coming down with a very serious
[15:55.800 --> 15:58.520]  adverse side effect from the vaccine is how much
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.480]  greater a risk that is than there is for cervical cancer in the population
[16:03.480 --> 16:07.640]  yet another one of the lies but before we go to those stories and before we
[16:07.640 --> 16:10.040]  cover at the bottom of the hour the uh sony
[16:10.040 --> 16:14.760]  hack with paul joseph watson i wanted to go back to
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.920]  some very disturbing news that's come out about the torturers
[16:18.920 --> 16:23.960]  that our government has done in our name and that they're getting away with i
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.640]  want to read first this story uh that has gotten
[16:27.640 --> 16:31.640]  europeans very upset and talking about how they need to get arrest warrants
[16:31.640 --> 16:35.560]  out ed snowden's lawyer has called for europeans to prosecute
[16:35.560 --> 16:39.320]  us torture architects he says we need to work the case up
[16:39.320 --> 16:42.600]  so that when people like george tenet former head of the cia
[16:42.600 --> 16:45.800]  come to europe we have the documents ready to arrest them
[16:45.800 --> 16:51.240]  because they are war criminals we used to not just prosecute war criminals for
[16:51.240 --> 16:54.200]  doing this kind of stuff we actually executed them
[16:54.200 --> 16:58.280]  the ones on the bottom the ones who were following the orders uh some of those
[16:58.280 --> 17:01.640]  we executed from japan when they did water torture we now call it
[17:01.640 --> 17:04.760]  waterboarding we now call it enhanced interrogation
[17:04.760 --> 17:10.200]  but we used to execute torturers at one point time when america was a moral
[17:10.200 --> 17:14.360]  country now we excuse it now we promote it
[17:14.360 --> 17:17.400]  but uh it's something that is going to follow these people
[17:17.400 --> 17:21.720]  and it is something that perhaps in europe they will get arrested for it
[17:21.720 --> 17:25.880]  some of these guys in their old age are going to find that they're going to be
[17:25.880 --> 17:29.080]  spending that in prison or they're going to be spending it on the run
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.520]  let me read you what happened to this one fellow who was
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.240]  his last name is el mazare he was a rest he was seized at the
[17:37.240 --> 17:40.760]  macedonian border officials say after being mistaken
[17:40.760 --> 17:44.440]  for being a member of al-qaeda now he was a german
[17:44.440 --> 17:47.400]  citizen he was held in a macedonian custody and
[17:47.400 --> 17:50.920]  macedonian custody for 23 days and then he was rendered
[17:50.920 --> 17:54.440]  that's what they call it when they transport you without any kind of a
[17:54.440 --> 17:57.800]  court order this is the type of thing
[17:57.800 --> 18:02.200]  that shows where the ndaa is going to go for americans in the future now let me
[18:02.200 --> 18:05.080]  tell you what they did after they sent him somewhere where they could
[18:05.080 --> 18:08.360]  conveniently torture him the cia put him through a process that the agency
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.360]  refers to as capture shock he was a german
[18:12.360 --> 18:14.840]  citizen he was subjected as part of his capture
[18:14.840 --> 18:19.320]  shock to being stripped putted shackled and severely beaten and
[18:19.320 --> 18:22.600]  sodomized the man was then drugged and taken to a
[18:22.600 --> 18:25.800]  secret detainee facility located in afghanistan called
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.880]  the salt pit at the secret prison he was held for four months
[18:29.880 --> 18:33.240]  frequently beaten kicked tortured smashed into walls among other various
[18:33.240 --> 18:36.040]  forms of abuse that we've now seen in this report
[18:36.040 --> 18:40.120]  at no time was he ever charged this german with a crime
[18:40.120 --> 18:43.320]  he was never given the ability to contact his family or his country
[18:43.320 --> 18:46.760]  to the outside world he had simply disappeared
[18:46.760 --> 18:50.440]  that's what we call indefinite detention
[18:50.440 --> 18:55.320]  with the ndaa and rendering eventually the agency realized that they had
[18:55.320 --> 18:57.800]  apprehended the wrong man but they continued to hold him captive for another
[18:57.800 --> 19:01.560]  few weeks before they decided to give him his freedom back i guess they were
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.840]  deciding as to whether they could safely release him where they just needed to
[19:04.840 --> 19:09.400]  kill him even in his release they say this is activist post article
[19:09.400 --> 19:12.680]  oops cia abducts and tortures wrong man they say even
[19:12.680 --> 19:16.280]  when he was released the cia demonstrated how little they value or
[19:16.280 --> 19:19.480]  respect human life he was blindfolded ear muffed
[19:19.480 --> 19:22.520]  and chained to the seat of an airplane that eventually dropped him in
[19:22.520 --> 19:28.200]  albania this german citizen was dumped on the side of the road with 14 and a
[19:28.200 --> 19:31.320]  half thousand dollars to buy his silence and zero
[19:31.320 --> 19:34.600]  explanations when we come back from the break i have
[19:34.600 --> 19:36.760]  something that is far more troubling than that
[19:36.760 --> 19:39.480]  stay with us we're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour paul joseph

[24:24.120 --> 24:27.320]  paul joseph watson is going to be joining us in the next segment
[24:27.320 --> 24:31.080]  and we're going to talk about this massive propaganda campaign attack on
[24:31.080 --> 24:34.680]  freedom of speech freedom of the internet that has come out of the
[24:34.680 --> 24:41.000]  censorship of not only the interview the new sony movie but also a
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.240]  10-year-old movie parroting another north korean leader that some of the
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.080]  theaters were going to show in its place and then the absurd narrative that
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.440]  we're being fed from the gop in this country the
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.160]  guardians of peace the neocons who want to control everything who want to
[24:57.160 --> 25:01.000]  turn all of this into an attack on their enemies
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.240]  now there's been a a lot of talk about what should be done
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.280]  about the cia torch report and of course the media
[25:08.280 --> 25:12.280]  has been feeding us the line with their polls i don't know if these polls are
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.200]  genuine or not or are they maybe push polls because you know you can
[25:16.200 --> 25:19.400]  get a poll done to support any point of view that you want to
[25:19.400 --> 25:23.560]  make appear to be the mainstream thought they're telling us that
[25:23.560 --> 25:28.120]  americans have increasingly come to recognize that the things that the cia
[25:28.120 --> 25:31.160]  is doing in our name are torture and they've
[25:31.160 --> 25:34.760]  increasingly come to the point that they're good with it
[25:34.760 --> 25:37.800]  well you know we've seen some pretty disturbing stuff out of the cia report
[25:37.800 --> 25:40.920]  but the most disturbing stuff has not come yet there's a story from
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.160]  anti media dot com actually dot org i'm sorry anti media dot org
[25:45.160 --> 25:49.720]  classified evidence says that us soldiers raped boys in front of their
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.000]  mothers they point out according to a number of global
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.080]  mainstream media sources the pentagon is covering up a disturbing
[25:57.080 --> 26:01.480]  video that was never made public with the rest of the recent torture report
[26:01.480 --> 26:04.440]  this is a video that goes back to abu garab and they point out that well
[26:04.440 --> 26:08.360]  respected journalists like seymour hirsch have been talking about this he
[26:08.360 --> 26:13.160]  went before the aclu just recently and talked about
[26:13.160 --> 26:17.000]  what he has seen he was talking about the release of the torture report and he
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.680]  said that while this video has remained under
[26:20.680 --> 26:24.200]  wraps he says it's only a matter of time before it comes out and he said that
[26:24.200 --> 26:27.720]  it's going to be far more disturbing than anything we have seen
[26:27.720 --> 26:33.240]  in the torture report he says he's been debating about whether to talk about it
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.960]  but he says some of the worst things that happen to you you don't know about
[26:35.960 --> 26:40.040]  okay videos there are women there some of you have
[26:40.040 --> 26:44.120]  may have read that they were passing out letters communications to their men
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.840]  he said this was abu garab the women were passing messages out saying
[26:48.840 --> 26:52.360]  please come and kill me because of what's happened here
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.040]  and he said basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with
[26:56.040 --> 26:59.640]  young boys children in cases that have been recorded
[26:59.640 --> 27:05.240]  the boys were sodomized by us soldiers with the cameras rolling
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.320]  and worst above all is that the soundtrack of the boys
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.920]  screeching that your government has they're in total terror and that is
[27:14.920 --> 27:19.000]  going to come out it's impossible to say to yourself
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  how did we get here who are we what has this country come to when we have
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.640]  sadistic people like that who can not only do it but record it
[27:29.640 --> 27:33.320]  let's go to that break you know when republicans say
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.000]  you know why now why this timing why not this time because no time is a good
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.320]  time no that's not true she's leaving her
[27:39.320 --> 27:42.760]  chairmanship so diane feinstein wants to get this off her desk
[27:42.760 --> 27:45.800]  and look i agree with you the united states of america
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.800]  is awesome we are awesome but we've had this discussion
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.760]  we've closed the book on it and we've stopped doing it and the reason they
[27:52.760 --> 27:55.880]  want to have this discussion is not to show how awesome we are
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.160]  this administration wants to have this discussion to show us
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.320]  how we're not awesome this administrator i can't take any more of her
[28:03.320 --> 28:06.600]  we are not awesome and we have not had this discussion
[28:06.600 --> 28:09.800]  and this evidence has been covered up and it will come out it will be talked
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.560]  about this is a lie just like the stuff that is coming out
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.160]  about autism being linked to particulate pollution
[28:17.160 --> 28:22.600]  just like this this false sony hack that they're using to try to justify
[28:22.600 --> 28:26.200]  taking control of the internet shutting down freedom of speech
[28:26.200 --> 28:29.720]  everything they tell us is a lie i'm so fed up with this look at this cartoon
[28:29.720 --> 28:33.960]  that we got on our desk pull this up this is a great cartoon buckley gave me
[28:33.960 --> 28:36.840]  just before we came in here and then and it's it's like headlines people are
[28:36.840 --> 28:41.080]  looking at you see a headline rectal feeding of navy seals shows up on the
[28:41.080 --> 28:44.200]  top of the newspaper and the guy walks by and says well i'm sure they were just
[28:44.200 --> 28:47.720]  patriots defending their caliphate in other words if the shoe is on the other
[28:47.720 --> 28:50.520]  foot they say an army ranger was chained to the
[28:50.520 --> 28:54.120]  ceiling and kept awake for a week and the person says well that's just
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.640]  enhanced interrogation and not torture we know would they say that if it was
[28:57.640 --> 29:01.080]  american soldiers that this was happening to another one an american was
[29:01.080 --> 29:04.280]  doused with water left to die of hypothermia on the dungeon floor and
[29:04.280 --> 29:07.640]  the lady watching the news says in fairness you have to consider the
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.240]  whole context of the report context of the time
[29:11.240 --> 29:14.440]  that was what we were told by john you he said well if they did this
[29:14.440 --> 29:18.200]  kind of stuff that would be illegal because we wouldn't have approved that
[29:18.200 --> 29:21.720]  but i just don't believe that was the entire context of the report
[29:21.720 --> 29:26.360]  if it's in the report they did it they admitted they did it
[29:26.360 --> 29:30.200]  and seymour hirsch is telling us that he's seen a video
[29:30.200 --> 29:34.440]  of children screaming that our sadistic government
[29:34.440 --> 29:37.800]  recorded and kept that video is going to come out
[29:37.800 --> 29:40.680]  we'll be right back with paul joseph watson talking about the other silly

[33:50.760 --> 33:55.160]  before we do i want to let you know that we have extended
[33:55.160 --> 34:00.200]  this two-day sale that was earlier this week we extended it yesterday to
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.840]  guarantee shipping it was originally a two-day sale sale because
[34:04.840 --> 34:08.520]  wednesday the 17th was the last day that we could guarantee shipment
[34:08.520 --> 34:12.760]  for christmas alex added extra staff yesterday so that
[34:12.760 --> 34:16.600]  he could make sure that anybody that ordered it yesterday could get it by
[34:16.600 --> 34:20.440]  christmas we've had such an overwhelming
[34:20.440 --> 34:24.120]  support of this of the sale that we thought we'd extend it
[34:24.120 --> 34:28.040]  for you as well because it is a huge savings it's a way for us to say
[34:28.040 --> 34:32.040]  thank you to our supporters and again it's the essential holiday pack
[34:32.040 --> 34:37.240]  secret 12 x2 nascent iodine and silver bullet for only 59.99 it's about 20
[34:37.240 --> 34:40.920]  dollars a bottle it's about an 80 savings over retail
[34:40.920 --> 34:45.160]  57 off and again we can't guarantee shipment
[34:45.160 --> 34:48.920]  by christmas but we're extending that offer you'll find that on
[34:48.920 --> 34:52.440]  info wars life dot com the essential holiday health pack
[34:52.440 --> 34:57.800]  with secret 12 that's the b12 supplement nascent iodine x2 and
[34:57.800 --> 35:01.560]  silver bullet now going to paul joseph watson
[35:01.560 --> 35:07.160]  in the uk paul what do you make of this article that you put up here the the
[35:07.160 --> 35:10.840]  fact that they're grasping for any excuse to bring this thing back they've
[35:10.840 --> 35:14.040]  had at least five tries to jam this thing through
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.720]  from the media companies they're the ones i think who are really the corporate
[35:17.720 --> 35:21.480]  partners with the surveillance state thinking that their business
[35:21.480 --> 35:25.240]  is not doing as well because of massive piracy i think it's just the garbage
[35:25.240 --> 35:27.640]  that they're putting out like the interview i had no interest in going to
[35:27.640 --> 35:30.280]  see that i still don't have any interest in going to see it
[35:30.280 --> 35:33.160]  but i think it's it's the content that they're putting out more than it is a
[35:33.160 --> 35:36.920]  privacy but they're pushing for this kind of control but it's going to be
[35:36.920 --> 35:42.120]  much more comprehensive than just protecting media
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.920]  well that's right this from my perspective is about reanimating the dead
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.160]  corpses of cisper and sopa which of course both failed
[35:51.160 --> 35:58.360]  now of course back in 2010 the two other most alarming cyber security incidents
[35:58.360 --> 36:02.120]  were stuxnet the stuxnet virus and the flame virus
[36:02.120 --> 36:05.560]  at the time they were blamed on the likes of china
[36:05.560 --> 36:09.800]  and russia and we were called conspiracy theorists
[36:09.800 --> 36:13.320]  for pointing to the evidence and the motivation
[36:13.320 --> 36:17.720]  and this is not just you know hot air they literally called us conspiracy
[36:17.720 --> 36:22.600]  theorists i compiled a list of where we were called this back in 2010
[36:22.600 --> 36:26.680]  absolutely and they're doing it again now paul they're now saying that this hack
[36:26.680 --> 36:30.120]  was probably uh china or russia again but also adding
[36:30.120 --> 36:33.480]  into the mix iran because we don't like iran now and that's fox news it's the
[36:33.480 --> 36:38.120]  fox news conspiracy theory yeah and they said the same
[36:38.120 --> 36:43.400]  thing for stuxnet we said it was most likely the us or israel in combination
[36:43.400 --> 36:48.360]  came out in 2012 that yes it was the u.s government and israel that created
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.080]  stuxnet and nobody called us a conspiracy theorist on that anymore
[36:53.080 --> 36:56.760]  and now the fbi has done a complete 180
[36:56.760 --> 37:00.600]  as of three days ago they were saying that basically
[37:00.600 --> 37:03.880]  the vast majority of the evidence suggested that this was
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.760]  an insider that had direct knowledge and access to sony infrastructure and
[37:08.760 --> 37:13.880]  passwords that had conducted this hack attack now suddenly they've got some
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.480]  kind of memo from the white house who based their
[37:17.480 --> 37:22.840]  claims their accusations their assertions on no evidence whatsoever as we saw in
[37:22.840 --> 37:27.480]  the case of mh17 blaming russia for the shootdown of that
[37:27.480 --> 37:30.840]  while presenting no evidence whatsoever other than
[37:30.840 --> 37:34.280]  you know screenshots from video games and things like that that they borrowed
[37:34.280 --> 37:38.280]  from kia so it looks like today obama is going to give a press conference
[37:38.280 --> 37:41.640]  in a couple of hours the fbi is going to release a statement
[37:41.640 --> 37:46.200]  and say the same thing that that this is north korea working in concert with
[37:46.200 --> 37:49.320]  iran rusher and china and they're going to present
[37:49.320 --> 37:54.440]  no evidence whatsoever and as he said david this is about cisper and sopa
[37:54.440 --> 37:59.000]  yeah the cyber security information sharing act of 2014
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.320]  immediately like piranhas they all jumped on this yesterday
[38:03.320 --> 38:09.400]  mccain lindsay feinstein obama himself saying that this sony hack
[38:09.400 --> 38:12.200]  proves that congress needs to pass this bill
[38:12.200 --> 38:15.800]  which was completely dead it had no chance of passing
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.680]  and now it's been re-animated and it would allow companies to monitor private
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.520]  communications and disclose user activity to the government
[38:24.520 --> 38:27.800]  eliminating any kind of warrant process whatsoever
[38:27.800 --> 38:31.720]  so quibono that's how the government benefits
[38:31.720 --> 38:35.320]  then if you look at the six major hollywood studios
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.480]  they want to re-animate the sopa bill which also failed
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.480]  because it would force isps to comply with companies
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.120]  who demand that websites accused of copyright violation be shut down on a
[38:48.120 --> 38:54.120]  whim again with no due process whatsoever so this whole fallout from this sony
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.560]  hack and what they're trying to propose to remedy it in terms of more draconian
[38:59.560 --> 39:02.760]  cyber security more laws that allow user
[39:02.760 --> 39:05.800]  data to be handed over with no due process whatsoever
[39:05.800 --> 39:11.080]  only benefit the government and major hollywood studios like sony
[39:11.080 --> 39:15.160]  so then you look at the actual evidence which says that it was an inside job
[39:15.160 --> 39:18.680]  that somebody on the inside of sony was responsible for this hack
[39:18.680 --> 39:23.400]  not north korea not iran rusher or china and you ask yourself the question
[39:23.400 --> 39:26.120]  if they're the ones that are going to get the bounty out of it then who's
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.360]  who's likely to be the main culprit well you've already had sony pictures
[39:30.360 --> 39:34.520]  selling us a zero dark 30 in cooperation with the
[39:34.520 --> 39:38.120]  intelligence community the u.s government promoting obama
[39:38.120 --> 39:42.280]  for president trying to portray him as the man who took down osama bin laden
[39:42.280 --> 39:46.600]  starting out that movie with a torture sequence and showing that
[39:46.600 --> 39:49.720]  well that's how we got the information that allowed us to kill
[39:49.720 --> 39:54.200]  osama bin laden who'd been dead for years prior to that but it was also sony
[39:54.200 --> 39:58.680]  so you know this inside job may be more inside than we realize certainly
[39:58.680 --> 40:02.680]  they've made the case we've had a tech analysis of it we talked about that
[40:02.680 --> 40:06.280]  yesterday they talked about how it was about a hundred terabytes of data
[40:06.280 --> 40:10.520]  and if you look at the timing they said an officials inside of
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.200]  sony have even said it has to be somebody who's a disgruntled former
[40:14.200 --> 40:17.400]  employee somebody in it who is guiding this through because they wouldn't have
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.400]  had time to go through that many emails you think about how many emails that is
[40:21.400 --> 40:25.480]  with a hundred terabytes of data for them to immediately go through and pull out
[40:25.480 --> 40:28.440]  the this type of stuff but we also now have some
[40:28.440 --> 40:32.120]  other data that's coming out that gives us another perspective on it but as you
[40:32.120 --> 40:36.760]  pointed out paul it's not just syspa but it's also they're trying to
[40:36.760 --> 40:40.520]  turn this into a much broader spectrum trying to blame it on iran china or
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.240]  russia you know the onion had a parody up and they said
[40:43.240 --> 40:47.560]  if we want to bring putin to his knees maybe it's time we embargo his netflix
[40:47.560 --> 40:50.600]  account maybe that's what we should do now we should embargo putin's
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.600]  netflix account there's an article up on infowars.com the
[40:54.600 --> 40:58.280]  sony hack might have killed a certain kind of satire
[40:58.280 --> 41:01.560]  now one of the things i found interesting in this article was a quote from a
[41:01.560 --> 41:05.400]  cyber security expert peter singer who said the ability to steal
[41:05.400 --> 41:09.880]  gossipy emails from a not so great protected computer network
[41:09.880 --> 41:13.960]  is not the same thing as being able to carry out physical
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.640]  9-11 style attacks and 18 000 locations
[41:17.640 --> 41:21.400]  simultaneously because that's what the house cyber security chairman is
[41:21.400 --> 41:26.120]  warning us he says first sony next the electric grid and then
[41:26.120 --> 41:31.320]  wall street paul it's it's amazing the fact that
[41:31.320 --> 41:35.000]  previously we all laughed at north korea
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.880]  for this bellicose baseless rhetoric that they come out with every single year
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.080]  normally right before christmas just by coincidence
[41:43.080 --> 41:45.880]  saying that they're going to destroy the world
[41:45.880 --> 41:50.360]  everybody laughs in their face you know it's a country that can barely feed its
[41:50.360 --> 41:53.240]  own population the experts who have looked at this said
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.080]  that north korea does not have the sophistication to carry out this attack
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.600]  yet now the white house is acting as their pr mouthpiece they're turning
[42:02.600 --> 42:08.200]  north korea from a paper tiger into this rampaging godzilla
[42:08.200 --> 42:13.160]  that's going to attack nuclear plants that's going to attack 18 000 cinemas
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.680]  that's going to bring down the entire country now they're talking about
[42:16.680 --> 42:19.960]  electrical grids i mean and paul there's an article
[42:19.960 --> 42:24.120]  the white house become the the pr agency the kim jong-gun
[42:24.120 --> 42:27.080]  yeah it's completely ridiculous it's preposterous
[42:27.080 --> 42:32.040]  they have done it suggests north korea has not claimed responsibility for
[42:32.040 --> 42:34.840]  this yeah again read what the experts are saying
[42:34.840 --> 42:40.120]  if they had pulled this off they would be all over it like white on rice claiming
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.920]  responsibility for it dealing a great you know a blow to the great satan
[42:44.920 --> 42:49.640]  i mean that would play so well nationally for their domestic propaganda
[42:49.640 --> 42:53.160]  they would instantly claim responsibility if they were behind it
[42:53.160 --> 42:56.920]  they haven't and the the people who were behind the hack
[42:56.920 --> 43:02.680]  who gave interviews anonymously said you know we're not backed by any state
[43:02.680 --> 43:07.000]  and in their in their message to sony in their initial email to sony
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.400]  the interview this film about you know these ci agents going over to kill kim
[43:11.400 --> 43:14.040]  jong-gun they never mentioned that movie in the
[43:14.040 --> 43:17.400]  initial message this this whole narrative about the
[43:17.400 --> 43:21.720]  interview and linking it to north korea didn't come from this hacking group
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.560]  it came from the white house it came from the media that glommed onto it
[43:25.560 --> 43:29.880]  and has never let go in the in the three or four weeks since
[43:29.880 --> 43:33.800]  paul illustrating what you were just saying uh as well
[43:33.800 --> 43:36.680]  that's a good point that of course it would be crowing about the fact that
[43:36.680 --> 43:40.680]  they had done it if they actually had done it but there's also emails that
[43:40.680 --> 43:44.040]  have come out the daily based reports that uh
[43:44.040 --> 43:47.560]  they looked at some of the emails and they looked at communications going
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.240]  back and forth about what they had said to the state department
[43:51.240 --> 43:55.640]  and what they had said to a rand consultant and one of the emails going
[43:55.640 --> 44:00.440]  back to june 26 says michael i talked with ambassador king
[44:00.440 --> 44:04.600]  a few minutes ago their office has apparently decided that this is typical
[44:04.600 --> 44:08.760]  north korea bullying so back in june the state department
[44:08.760 --> 44:12.200]  was dismissing this as you point out this is something that north korea does
[44:12.200 --> 44:15.480]  all the time they do this every year she pointed out and he was saying back in
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.880]  june this is nothing this is just a bellicose posturing by the north koreans
[44:19.880 --> 44:23.400]  and now we're supposed to take it so seriously that we're supposed to give
[44:23.400 --> 44:26.440]  them complete control of the internet the ability to
[44:26.440 --> 44:31.000]  shut down websites just on the mere accusation of a hollywood studio do we
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.960]  really after what we've seen from these hollywood studios
[44:33.960 --> 44:37.240]  do we really want to give them that kind of power or the mpaa
[44:37.240 --> 44:41.080]  do we want to give the government that kind of power this goes way beyond
[44:41.080 --> 44:44.920]  political correctness and they have turned this thing around 180 degrees from
[44:44.920 --> 44:49.320]  where they were just back in june exactly and it's
[44:49.320 --> 44:53.080]  it's it's amazing that they've taken this cartoon character
[44:53.080 --> 44:57.240]  villain north korea and now this is this is their big bogeyman
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.200]  i mean now it seems that they're lumping in china iran and russia because people
[45:02.200 --> 45:05.720]  just aren't believing it they've been saying it's north korea for three weeks
[45:05.720 --> 45:09.000]  even though the fbi said there was no evidence of that
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.200]  but even if you look at the actual the the language in those messages those
[45:14.200 --> 45:17.240]  threatening messages people have studied it and said
[45:17.240 --> 45:21.960]  this just looks like an english person who's deliberately trying to sound
[45:21.960 --> 45:25.960]  korean yeah because it what you would expect to see if they were
[45:25.960 --> 45:29.480]  if english wasn't their first language and they were from north korea would be
[45:29.480 --> 45:32.840]  something akin to what they call conglish but it's not
[45:32.840 --> 45:36.680]  it's it's like an english speaker that's pretending to be bad
[45:36.680 --> 45:41.960]  at writing english it's that transparent it's it's like the anthrax notes it's
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.320]  so transparent that they can't even get the language right
[45:45.320 --> 45:48.360]  i wonder if anybody has checked newt gingrich or lindsay grams computers to
[45:48.360 --> 45:50.600]  see if they've got the emails from their computers
[45:50.600 --> 45:55.480]  this is if it's coming from that gop poll one of the things that came out in
[45:55.480 --> 45:59.240]  in these emails besides the fact that they were dismissing it as just typical
[45:59.240 --> 46:02.760]  north korean bullying that was a quote from one of their emails
[46:02.760 --> 46:06.360]  besides that the daily beast reports that there were
[46:06.360 --> 46:09.960]  several emails going back and forth between the state department as well
[46:09.960 --> 46:13.880]  as a rand corporation consultant an expert in north korea
[46:13.880 --> 46:16.440]  they say the claim that the state department played an active role in the
[46:16.440 --> 46:20.520]  decision to include the film's gruesome death scene is likely to cause
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.040]  fury in north korea but they said emails appear to suggest us government may
[46:24.040 --> 46:27.560]  have supported the notion that the interview would be useful
[46:27.560 --> 46:31.880]  propaganda against the north korean regime now this is what the rand
[46:31.880 --> 46:35.880]  corporation guy said he said uh i've briefed in my
[46:35.880 --> 46:39.000]  book preparing for the possibility north korean collapse i've been clear that
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.920]  the assassination of kim jong-un is the most likely path to a
[46:42.920 --> 46:45.960]  collapse of the north korean government he said i believe a story that talks
[46:45.960 --> 46:49.480]  about the removal of the kim family regime and the creation of a new
[46:49.480 --> 46:53.320]  government by the north korean people well at least the elites will start some
[46:53.320 --> 46:58.040]  real thinking in south korea and i believe that in the north
[46:58.040 --> 47:01.480]  once the dvd leaks into the north which it almost certainly will
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.480]  i would personally prefer to leave the ending alone
[47:05.480 --> 47:09.080]  so here you've got a picture of this guy from the rand corporation
[47:09.080 --> 47:12.120]  and again the state department concurred with that
[47:12.120 --> 47:16.280]  and what they're doing is using this absurdist comedy as we view it was oh
[47:16.280 --> 47:20.280]  this is just a parody it's an over-the-top parody of something
[47:20.280 --> 47:23.720]  they understand that it can be used for predictive
[47:23.720 --> 47:27.240]  programming purposes they understand it can be used for propaganda
[47:27.240 --> 47:30.440]  and they are seriously analyzing this and i would say paul
[47:30.440 --> 47:34.520]  what does that tell us about this same studio that produced
[47:34.520 --> 47:38.040]  zero dark 30 as a propaganda piece we need to understand
[47:38.040 --> 47:41.080]  it's pretty blatant and obvious in that piece but we understand need to
[47:41.080 --> 47:44.600]  understand that hollywood is doing this to us in every movie even a silly
[47:44.600 --> 47:50.440]  seph rogan comedy well we know for a fact the hollywood pentagon
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.440]  industrial complex the pentagon has to sign off on scripts
[47:54.440 --> 47:58.600]  yes so these films to even get made for them to rent the military bases the
[47:58.600 --> 48:02.680]  helicopters it is they're in direct contact with the pentagon
[48:02.680 --> 48:06.440]  for these big movies at every step of the way that's not a conspiracy theory
[48:06.440 --> 48:10.360]  in fact the pentagon brags about it on their own website
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.160]  and then we had a situation a few years ago with
[48:13.160 --> 48:17.000]  red dawn where they didn't seem to be so concerned about
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.440]  portraying north korea in a negative light then because of course
[48:20.440 --> 48:23.800]  the original story in the remake of red dawn
[48:23.800 --> 48:28.040]  was for the chinese to invade america they were concerned that that would hurt
[48:28.040 --> 48:32.920]  the market in china so they changed the enemy to north korea so then the plot
[48:32.920 --> 48:36.520]  was based around a north korean invasion of america
[48:36.520 --> 48:39.880]  that was i believe maybe 2010 around that time
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.400]  there was no concern then about upsetting north korea
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.320]  and now suddenly they're all panicked that this film could
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.960]  could upset north korean i mean who within sony made that decision to pull
[48:51.960 --> 48:54.760]  the film would they have really made that decision if
[48:54.760 --> 48:57.960]  if this was north korea that was responsible for this
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.160]  hack attack i think it's amazing that they pulled
[49:01.160 --> 49:07.000]  this south park comedy team america because it had
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.720]  portrayed kim jong-un's father in that movie
[49:11.720 --> 49:15.240]  i guess they're going to i guess they're going to pull red dawn as well because
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.200]  you know they held it up for a year because the chinese didn't like it and
[49:18.200 --> 49:21.320]  and now i guess if the north koreans don't like it that can't be shown at the
[49:21.320 --> 49:24.760]  movie theaters anymore this is a 10 year old
[49:24.760 --> 49:28.680]  movie with puppets and they were going to screen it at the alamo draft house
[49:28.680 --> 49:32.280]  center here in austin and other locations throughout texas
[49:32.280 --> 49:37.160]  and they had that pulled by paramount said that we will be in complete chaos
[49:37.160 --> 49:43.000]  there you go the world from falling apart and so you see the new world is
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.360]  inevitable that's what inevitable inevitable
[49:48.360 --> 49:52.760]  one more time inevitable things are inevitable but are you going to change
[49:52.760 --> 49:55.960]  yeah things are inevitably going to change the subtitle that was freedom is
[49:55.960 --> 49:59.240]  hanging by a thread they're all puppets but the reality is is that freedom
[49:59.240 --> 50:02.920]  really is hanging by a thread we've narrowly defeated uh these attacks on
[50:02.920 --> 50:06.360]  free speech and the internet before and they're going to use this as a pretense
[50:06.360 --> 50:10.840]  to bring it back yeah and the the key article that people
[50:10.840 --> 50:15.160]  need to read is project goliath inside hollywood secret war against google
[50:15.160 --> 50:21.160]  that documents how desperate they are to reanimate the dead corpse of sopa
[50:21.160 --> 50:25.560]  to get these so-called copyright violators in prison to get the websites
[50:25.560 --> 50:30.040]  taken down on a whim and this hack is going to grease the skids for that
[50:30.040 --> 50:33.720]  that exact thing which is why so many in these other big studios are only going
[50:33.720 --> 50:39.240]  to benefit from this in the long run and they have a financial incentive not
[50:39.240 --> 50:43.800]  just the pressure but the access to politicians the access to markets the
[50:43.800 --> 50:47.400]  access to the equipment as you pointed out when they did top gun that was only
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.920]  really possible for paramount because they had the cooperation the military
[50:50.920 --> 50:54.600]  letting them use their planes to get footage
[50:54.600 --> 50:57.720]  otherwise they would have not been able to pull that movie off or it would have
[50:57.720 --> 51:00.280]  cost them a fortune we're going to be right back with paul joseph watch stay

[54:16.360 --> 54:19.240]  is paul joseph Watson from the uk we've been talking
[54:19.240 --> 54:24.120]  about the ramifications of the sony emails being hacked
[54:24.120 --> 54:29.560]  reportedly by the guardians of peace the g.o.p and now we see the guardians of
[54:29.560 --> 54:33.000]  peace g.o.p like newt gingrich and lindsay
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.920]  graham and john mccain and mike mccall all pushing for revival of syspa
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.360]  we're told by the white house another guardian of peace that
[54:42.360 --> 54:46.920]  the sony hack is a matter of national security
[54:46.920 --> 54:50.680]  it is a serious national security said white house
[54:50.680 --> 54:55.800]  press secretary josh earnesty earnestly is uh telling us lies yet again
[54:55.800 --> 55:00.200]  emails that have leaked is not just gossip about
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.040]  various stars we also have emails that have been leaked that show
[55:04.040 --> 55:07.560]  a communication going back and forth to the state department saying that they
[55:07.560 --> 55:10.760]  don't take any of these threats seriously a few months ago
[55:10.760 --> 55:14.920]  now it is a matter of national security these threats and the fact that they got
[55:14.920 --> 55:17.640]  these threats we also see emails leaked
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.160]  that say that uh they're consciously leaving
[55:21.160 --> 55:25.960]  in the explicit assassination of kim jong-un
[55:25.960 --> 55:30.280]  in order to plant in the minds of the people of south carol of
[55:30.280 --> 55:33.880]  south carol of south korea and north korea eventually
[55:33.880 --> 55:38.120]  that they may be ought to get rid of this guy so even a silly comedy like
[55:38.120 --> 55:43.640]  that hollywood is calculating how they can shape public opinion
[55:43.640 --> 55:47.960]  as a piece of propaganda paul your comments
[55:47.960 --> 55:52.120]  yeah we've seen that before now that the latest news is that the hackers have
[55:52.120 --> 55:55.880]  said if they don't release this movie they will stand down
[55:55.880 --> 55:59.880]  and that's it the whole situation will be over so again
[55:59.880 --> 56:03.800]  i just put up an article saying that this is almost certainly an inside job
[56:03.800 --> 56:07.080]  sony is going to lose tens of millions of dollars over this
[56:07.080 --> 56:12.760]  the piracy of this film but the cost to the economy in general of piracy per
[56:12.760 --> 56:18.440]  year is about 250 billion dollars compared to tens of millions that sony's
[56:18.440 --> 56:21.560]  going to lose in this instance so if you look at the financial
[56:21.560 --> 56:24.840]  motive of this if it greases the skids for
[56:24.840 --> 56:28.840]  sopa to be reanimated then it's going to make a lot of people
[56:28.840 --> 56:32.520]  a lot of money and then if you look at what the actual analysts who have looked
[56:32.520 --> 56:36.680]  into this have said for example mark w rogers security expert
[56:36.680 --> 56:40.360]  quote it's clear from the hard-coded paths and passwords in the malware
[56:40.360 --> 56:43.240]  that whoever wrote it had extensive knowledge of sony's
[56:43.240 --> 56:47.480]  internal architecture and access to key passwords
[56:47.480 --> 56:51.400]  exactly and then sony executives themselves told tmz
[56:51.400 --> 56:55.240]  we are told by people at sony this is tmz who are investigating
[56:55.240 --> 56:58.360]  believe the hackers had intimate knowledge of mail systems and their
[56:58.360 --> 57:02.200]  configurations they also believe the hackers have knowledge of the internal
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.200]  media distribution systems and the internal it systems including
[57:06.200 --> 57:10.920]  human resources and payroll so every shred of evidence suggests that this was
[57:10.920 --> 57:15.160]  an insider behind this attack yet now obama and the
[57:15.160 --> 57:18.040]  fbi are going to come out and blame north korea
[57:18.040 --> 57:21.640]  iran china and russia again extrapolating it
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.040]  david into a more broader sense this new cold war that we've
[57:26.040 --> 57:30.280]  had going on for months now we've got the the attack on russia the financial
[57:30.280 --> 57:33.240]  attack the collapse of the ruble russia's closer
[57:33.240 --> 57:36.680]  alliance with china again this is about the unipolar world
[57:36.680 --> 57:41.480]  versus the multipolar world it's all part of that wider cold war offensive
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.400]  against russia and china and again you've got our guardian of peace newt
[57:45.400 --> 57:49.320]  gingrich saying this is an act of war and we need to hunt them down he said
[57:49.320 --> 57:53.160]  we've had our first battle in the cyber war and we've lost and
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.240]  and so i guess uh from his standpoint i don't know maybe he wants to go even
[57:57.240 --> 58:00.680]  further than all out control and censorship of the
[58:00.680 --> 58:04.280]  internet maybe he wants to have an actual shooting war they can
[58:04.280 --> 58:08.760]  use this as a pretense because we see one incredibly ridiculous pretense
[58:08.760 --> 58:12.040]  after the other i just think it's amazing to see
[58:12.040 --> 58:15.640]  how many different ways they can spook the american people
[58:15.640 --> 58:19.400]  and now we've got a silly little virtual false flag attack
[58:19.400 --> 58:23.560]  that they're trying to trump up into new legislation a new paradigm
[58:23.560 --> 58:27.400]  taking away our freedoms yet again thank you so much paul for joining us

[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.480]  join us in this hour from the road but he is on the road so we're not sure of
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.920]  the exact time of that we're also going to be joined by our
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.440]  reporters in washington state joe biggs and darin mcbreen
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.160]  they're there of course to follow up on the story
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.800]  that we uh broke i guess over the weekend uh about the
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.640]  person coming up to the mrat vehicle asking the police who were displaying it
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.680]  at a walmart of what this thing did when they started
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.520]  telling her what it did she asked the obvious question why do we need that
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.280]  in a small town and he replied well for constitutionalists people who stockpile
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.680]  ammunition and weapons not for the police who are stockpiling
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.240]  military vehicles and militarized uh weapon systems
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.080]  so we had a back and forth as as the uh
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.680]  we tried to contact the police chief there the actually the sheriff there we
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.440]  tried to contact him for comment uh to try to be
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.240]  fair to try to get his comments not something we're required to do
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.760]  they did not contact us back rather the following monday
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.960]  they posted a video on their facebook page criticizing info wars so
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.720]  we wanted to go out there and get some answers because there's a
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.560]  rally that's going to be held tomorrow i believe it's at two o'clock
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.160]  you can check our website info wars dot com will give you the details of
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.520]  the exact location the exact time of where that is if you're in the area if
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.080]  you're in the spokane area if you're in the idaho area
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.160]  there are people there who are very concerned who want to have a dialogue
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.800]  who want to ask a cop that was the hashtag that blew up on
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.160]  the interview from cnn a lot of people across the country are outraged by the
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.800]  way the police are uh not punished for excessive use of force the way
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.200]  they're being goaded into the excessive use of force and these militarized
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:18.520]  vehicles are part of the way that they're being goaded into
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.200]  over the top force into rules of engagement if you will that we have
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.800]  never seen from the police in terms of looking at themselves as military
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.480]  organizations paul joseph wasen was just on with us and
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.000]  yesterday we talked about the fact that the california highway patrol
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.080]  is now describing itself as a paramilitary organization to perspective
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.240]  recruits people who might want to get a job there
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.680]  they've posted on their site in multiple times in multiple ways
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.920]  that they are a paramilitary organization and if you have military experience
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.200]  they might be interested in talking to you well
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.880]  spokane area and of course i don't know if the relationship to the spokane police
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.920]  to the spokane sheriff's department if there is a relationship even
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.000]  nevertheless even that area has had its problems
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.720]  with excessive police violence uh there was a case that was settled for
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.920]  several million dollars actually it's a little over
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.320]  it was 1.67 million dollars uh with the family of a man
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.280]  that was killed by police officer his name was autosem he was beaten shocked
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.640]  and shocked and hogtied by police officers
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.800]  after he was accused erroneously of theft that was something that happened
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.040]  back in 2006 it took five years for it to go to trial
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.600]  uh nevertheless uh that not only was there a civil judgment given to the
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.680]  family but the jury convicted a spokane police officer
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:44.440]  carl tomsen of needlessly beating him and then lying to cover up his actions
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.440]  that's good when you have people that are doing bad actions in your police
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.520]  department and they get convicted that's what we want to see it's not possible
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.280]  and we will never get to the point where there's not any bad police officers
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.840]  just like we're never going to get to the point where there's never
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.800]  any bad uh gun owners or people just in general society you're always going to
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.000]  have good and bad people in any society it's a cross section as
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.400]  frank serpicoa said the real question is can the system
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.480]  purge those out i think one of the most important things that can be done
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.560]  is not necessarily uh body cameras that was
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.320]  they were investigated by the justice department they just wrapped up and put a
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.560]  report out uh just this week december 16th 2014 of the
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.000]  spokane police department uh reviewing their practices
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.440]  some of the right recommendations are body cams and yet
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.200]  we just had another death in spokane
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:42.280]  where a police officer who had a body camera didn't have it turned on
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.480]  and even when they have it turned on in some localities
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.560]  they're not prosecuted not even indicted that's why matt shea one of the
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.600]  representatives there in washington we're going to be talking to at the rally
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.280]  tomorrow reporters be talking to that's why he pointed out we need to have
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.640]  oversight not only the police officers but of their curriculum stay with us
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:04.280]  the average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges

[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:21.160]  your host today on this friday december 19th 2014 alex jones is hopefully
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.840]  going to be joining us on in this hour he's on the road and we're trying to
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.680]  establish contact in the last hour we're going to be
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.680]  talking to our reporters who are in washington state joe biggs and darin
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.520]  mcbrain and just before the break we were talking
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.840]  about what is happening in spokane they have just
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.960]  finished an investigation of the police department and again i don't know if
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.880]  there's a relationship at all between the spokane police department and the
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.480]  sheriff's department our reporters are there because of what was
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.840]  said about an mrap vehicle to talk about that program
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:59.160]  there's a large protest it's going to happen tomorrow i think it's at two
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.360]  o'clock but you can get the details of the location of the time at info
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.720]  wars dot com but we're also concerned about
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.720]  the fact that this sheriff who pushed back against these comments
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.600]  said they were taken out of context they clearly were not
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.520]  the lady asked the deputy why they had
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.640]  use of a why they had a need for a vehicle like this
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.240]  and he immediately replied for the constitutionalists
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.920]  we know where that comes from that comes from the southern poverty law center
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.800]  that is a narrative that's been fed out as part of training has been put out as
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.680]  part of scenarios that they have worked with
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.000]  and of course this sheriff has in the past called in the southern
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.840]  poverty law center to train his personnel and it was
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.040]  good people within the sheriff's department that blew the whistle on that
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.440]  that exposed that to the community at large and caused that to be shut down
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.480]  as it should have been southern poverty law center
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.240]  has attacked anybody that don't they don't agree with politically
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.240]  labeling them as terrorists and so they're good people within the system
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.160]  we see that there was a settlement recently of a shooting that took a
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.200]  long time to uh to go through the courts there was
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.520]  a civil settlement to the family of the man who was unjustifiably
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.240]  killed as well as a conviction of the police officer
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.160]  who shot him and then covered it up that's the thing that should happen
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.280]  when these things come to light well never as i said in the last segment have
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.120]  a situation where we have nothing but good cops they're a cross-section of
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.560]  society and just like you have good and bad people in society you have good
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.440]  and bad people in the police force the question is
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.640]  will the system be able to purge them out as we're talking to representative
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.240]  matt shea from the area he had some very good suggestions it's not
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.760]  just that we need to have outside oversight when there's an incident
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.680]  like this to make sure that everyone in the community feels that everything
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.000]  has been done to serve justice we need to have
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.600]  someone who is not connected with that police department to oversee these
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.960]  trials but we also need to have civilian oversight or
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.240]  community oversight i don't want to use civilian because
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.840]  that implies that they're military and we don't want to feed that mentality even
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.760]  though they're self identifying this california highway patrol as a
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.280]  they're self identifying themselves as a paramilitary organization they repeat
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.200]  that over and over again but the community needs to have oversight of the
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.480]  police department not just in terms of when things go wrong
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.400]  but even more importantly oversight of their training that was what
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.000]  matt shea representative of washington state said when we had him on earlier this
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.360]  week so we're going to be talking to our reporters who are there
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.280]  it is a major problem we've had is reported back in february
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.320]  of this year this headline from info wars dot com
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.280]  americans killed by cops now outnumber americans killed in the iraq war
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.880]  and we can't even get the complete statistics on that
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.000]  because they're not keeping those kind of statistics
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.920]  and if they believe that they are at risk from the general public as they're
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.320]  being caught that we are a threat to them that they need to have programs that
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.160]  go through our social media postings are purchasing records
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.480]  to evaluate our threat to them so that they can immediately when they pull you
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.440]  over have any interaction with you at all they can
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:18.840]  identify your threat level are you a green a yellow or a red threat to them
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.680]  think about how incredibly dangerous that is besides the violation of privacy
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.040]  for your government to profile and label people like that
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.840]  are they going to get it wrong of course they're going to get it wrong
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.400]  they are going to label people red who are not a threat to them
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.000]  maybe they're a threat to the political regime like the tea party is a threat to
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.920]  obama but they're not physical threats to the to the police yet
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.840]  they will label people like that and many people are going to get killed who
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.040]  should not be killed because it's going to scare the officers
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.640]  because of their training their real risk as we've seen
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.240]  half of them are about the same number that are getting shot
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.600]  are getting killed in car accidents and half of those people are getting killed
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.880]  because they're not wearing seat belts they have a very
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:07.240]  low use of seat belts percentage wise among the police nationally
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.800]  an even greater threat to their health is morbid obesity we have this report
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.480]  from the Daily Mail saying that us cops have the highest rate of obesity
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.160]  amongst any profession in the country along with firefighters and security
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.760]  guards nearly 41 percent of boys in blue they say
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.960]  are obese according to a study by the american journal
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:30.600]  of preventive medicine so there you go
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.600]  the health and lifestyle that you live is a greater threat to you the fact
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.200]  that you don't wear a seat belt those are much greater threats to you
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.760]  than the populace you don't need to be on a hair trigger
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:47.000]  i want to go to some health news there was a story that
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.920]  just broke uh it's on Reuters saying that autism
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:57.160]  in a new study has now been linked to particulate air pollution
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:01.400]  and i think there's an interesting backstory to this because this was not a
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.160]  a study that was necessarily done by the epa i don't know who paid for this this
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.680]  is a harvard school of public health study
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.120]  but i think it's very interesting that the budget that was just passed by the
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.840]  GOP primarily they were the ones who put the
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.960]  budget together they cut the funding of the epa
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.160]  the epa has had its funding cut for several years now
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.800]  but i think this was a shot across the bow because obama has said
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:33.400]  that he is going to enact climate change legislation he's talked about a war
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.680]  on coal and after the election he said that
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.120]  there's nothing that the new majority republicans
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.720]  can or will do about it he's going to get his
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.440]  climate agenda through so i think that their cut of the epa budget was really
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.280]  kind of a shot across the bow saying we can cut your funding if we want to
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.720]  i don't know if they will or not remember it was richard nixon who created
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.880]  the epa but we've seen them using particulate matter
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.640]  to push things through in the past one of the first stories that i
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.840]  covered when i came here to info wars dot com was the epa itself
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.600]  feeding test subjects diesel fuel in order to push for higher particulate
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.480]  matter screening higher numbers in other words to reduce the
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.840]  amount of particulate matter that people would be
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.920]  exposed to but to increase their bureaucracy that was the whole point
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.160]  they had gone through and advertised for people who had heart disease or
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.680]  respiratory illness they took them into a room at
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:38.440]  the university of north carolina they hooked them directly up to the tailpipe
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.680]  of a diesel engine and they gave them levels
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.840]  that were over 70 times what the epa said were fatal
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.520]  levels of particulate matter remember lisa jackson
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:54.600]  went to congress and representative democrat representative markey
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.000]  fed her questions he says now particulate matter is very very serious
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.400]  isn't it and she said yes uh it more people die from it than die of cancer
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.760]  and he said really tell me about this and so they
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.680]  they had this little dialogue that was set up a little dog and pony show
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.440]  it's not true they were trying to push these numbers
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.960]  and if it was true they're guilty of war criminal actions trying to kill these
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.600]  people so they come out on the one hand they say more people are dying of
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.720]  particulate matter than they are than are of cancer
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.080]  and then they take the level that they say is not just going to make people
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.720]  sick she was very emphatic about that she says i'm not saying that that level
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.560]  makes that it will kill you and then they give that to their own test
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.160]  subjects at a level 70 times higher than that so that's
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.840]  kind of the background on that and also pull this up guys they look at this
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.480]  epa page where they give you basic information
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.840]  about fine particulate matter as they call it ptm
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:53.080]  p m 2.5 that is a particulate matter that is two and a half
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.800]  micro micrometers and diameter that's 130th the diameter of a human hair
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.720]  now on this side up in that corner if you're looking at this
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.040]  on a video you can see a picture of the smoky mountains
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.400]  and they have left that up there for years that was
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.560]  in my report two years ago when i came here and they say smog including p.m
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:19.240]  2.5 obscures the smoky mountains that is not why the smoky mountains are smoky
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.680]  the smoky mountains were smoky long before
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.920]  there was any smog long before there were any cars or industry long before
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.440]  there were any european settlers that came here the indians called it
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.120]  the smoky mountain and they're talking about how it increases hospital
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.800]  emissions and emergency room visits well you know what it does that when you
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.720]  screen for people who have respiratory illness and heart conditions and hook
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.920]  them up to a diesel engine that also increases
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:48.760]  hospital admissions and emergency room admissions
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:54.520]  but that is another way that they're now going to try to
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.880]  increase their regulatory the regulatory reach
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.960]  on production of energy and that is through saying it's
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.000]  fine particulate matter and we need to cut that down now they're going to blame
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.480]  autism on it well autism we know there is a strong correlation
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.240]  to the things that are put into vaccines like aluminum
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.520]  now we've just had the FDA this week approve a new
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.080]  Gardasil it's Gardasil 9 it's new and improved
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.600]  and it has twice the amount of aluminum
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.880]  now they didn't follow the normal procedure normally
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.640]  they would get this approved by a group called
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:37.720]  vaccines and related biological products advisory committee the vrb pack
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.040]  and the vrb pack normally is sent this information about new drugs
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.280]  and they sent out a letter and said well we don't really think that
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.560]  we didn't send this to you because we didn't think that we needed consult with
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.280]  you over this because there's no concerns and no
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.800]  controversial issues and then they look at it and they say
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.960]  they have more than double they've gone from 225
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.960]  micrograms to 500 micrograms of aluminum and of course they put that in there
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.360]  as an adjuvant to irritate your immune system
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.280]  to try to provoke a reaction well there's a lot of reactions
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.120]  that it provokes they say for the first time we've seen from merc
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.960]  the developers of Gardasil they have disclosed they say what may indeed be
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.400]  close to the true rate of serious adverse events that people are
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:31.480]  suffering after the use of Gardasil and this article is up on healthimpactnews.com
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.320]  they point out that if you normalize the number of people that have serious
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:39.320]  adverse events after this by their own data
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.560]  that would be 2,300 serious adverse events per every hundred thousand people
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.760]  who get a vaccine. The number of people who get cervical
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:51.240]  cancer is 7.9 so you're going to give somebody
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.920]  something that 2,300 people are going to have an adverse reaction where if you
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.600]  don't give them something less than eight are going to have that reaction
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:04.120]  that's the logic of our government. We get that question a lot here at
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:08.200]  bigberkeywaterfilters.com and in a word the answer is protection.

[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.920]  now this next story is something that just broke today uh chicory brought this
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:23.320]  in this morning and said you won't believe this we got walmart amazon and
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.560]  kmart and sears have been told by the new york attorney general
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.240]  uh that they've got to stop selling toy guns
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:35.000]  no toy guns for christmas i remember years ago when my sons were young
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.920]  i was trying to find them toy guns and cowboy stuff and
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.480]  of course you couldn't find that i could get them uh kits where they had
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.320]  billy clubs and swat teams and all this other kind so they could print it and
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.160]  i guess to be uh you know beating each other in a protest
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.760]  uh but i couldn't find anything that was just a straight up cowboy gun i had to
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:59.720]  go to uh something that was not the big box retailers in order to find that i
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.680]  did i wanted them to grow up playing with guns i
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:07.080]  want them to use guns that is their right as a free man
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.680]  and it's all of our rights but this is what the state attorney general
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:15.160]  is doing he sent out a cease and desist letter to walmart
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:20.600]  amazon kmart sears and toy arsenal dot com telling the retailers the toy guns
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:26.360]  are selling online to new yorkers are too realistic here's that clip
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.880]  they look like the real thing but these guns are toys
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.560]  for as little as ten dollars you can buy them online and in stores
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.480]  even though they're illegal in new york attorney general eric schneiderman
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.240]  says that stops now toy guns are mistaken for real guns
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.840]  there could be tragic consequences schneiderman's office conducted an
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.480]  investigation that found many retailers selling prohibited toy guns online
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.400]  and shipping them into the state investigators also uncovered at least
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:58.600]  one retailer selling illegal toy guns in its stores the state and federal law
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.800]  are clear retailers cannot put children at risk
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.080]  by selling toy guns they're virtually indistinguishable
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.080]  from the real thing there you go okay so and remember
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:14.120]  we were told that um this young boy who was playing with the bb gun
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.760]  and the cops zoom up if you watch the video you can see the cop car come to a
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.960]  screeching halt uh the guy who's in the passenger seat
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.480]  jumps out and immediately shoots dead this child who's not threatening
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.720]  anybody not doing anything what he was doing was not as threatening as ralphie
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.680]  and christmas story but uh they say well it was a
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.200]  too realistic looking they said that it didn't have an orange
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.040]  gun on the tip how could they tell if it was
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:47.560]  in his pants it was in his pants and it didn't matter whether it had an orange
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.120]  tip or not and in both that incident that was in
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.920]  ohio where there is an open carry law people are allowed to open carry
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:59.480]  in ohio where there's open carry that young man 12 year old with a bb gun
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.200]  uh a guy who was an older adult who was in his early 20s in another
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.520]  location in ohio one of them was in date and the other one was in cleveland
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.320]  and a walmart he was walking and you can see that video if you're watching it
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.360]  right now there was a call to 911 saying
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.400]  that we have somebody who's threatening people with guns
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.320]  he was lying to 911 and you can see that from the video
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.400]  tape he persisted in that lie until the videotape came out he was not threatening
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.240]  anybody he was holding the gun from walmart that he was going to
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.840]  purchase in one hand and had a phone a cell phone in the other hand he was
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.000]  talking to his wife as he was shot and you can see this cop run in and shoot
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.920]  him in both of those cases people came out and said
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:47.480]  we need to get rid of toy guns that is not the problem
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.440]  the problem is this shoot first mentality not assessing the situation
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.920]  being so trigger happy that is the problem we need to train our police we
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.760]  don't need to have people shot down because they have guns or because they
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.800]  have real guns that's an open carry state they
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.400]  did not assess the situation in either those circumstances to determine
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.080]  whether the person was threatening anybody even with
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:14.360]  a toy gun there was no communication they just run in
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.560]  in both of those cases and shoot the people dead and yet the solution is
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:21.880]  supposedly that we need to ban toy guns
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.400]  absolutely amazing we're going to come back after the break start taking your

[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.880]  trained to shoot first to not assess the situation
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.200]  who have been so scared about the threats against their lives in the general
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.800]  public that they shoot first and get away with it over and over again
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.160]  increasing the tension back and forth between the
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:29.640]  community and the police this is a deliberate tactic by the government
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.720]  to not address this to increase the tensions between them that's why our
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.320]  reporters are there because in that particular area
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.040]  with their mrap when question about that he said he needed it for
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:43.000]  constitutionalists that's coming straight from the southern poverty
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.280]  law center that's straight out of their talking points and of course he did have
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.160]  them in that area that sheriff training his staff
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.720]  and some good cops pointed out the propaganda that was involved in that
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:56.840]  to the public at large and they shut that down
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.360]  now there's an article up on info wars dot com mexico's
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.840]  sinaloa cartel is now dominating u.s heroin market
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.960]  is that really any surprise since we've been in afghanistan
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.800]  the worldwide supply of opiates has gone from
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.000]  10 out coming out of afghanistan under the taliban to
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.200]  well over 90 every year is a bumper crop coming from there
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:25.960]  and it should be any should it be any surprise that the mexican drug cartels
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.880]  are aligned with that traffic flow that
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.160]  is coming out of the cia and the u.s government we've seen that before
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:37.000]  haven't we where cocaine was coming out of
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.120]  central america going into the crack cocaine market and la that was exposed
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:46.040]  by gary webb and his articles and books dark
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.640]  alliance same sort of thing we see happening and yet
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.080]  what's the response to the legalization of marijuana in
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.640]  colorado we see the nebraska and ohio attorney generals
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.800]  are now trying to stop colorado's legalization
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:06.440]  of marijuana saying it's increased their law enforcement expenses
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:10.280]  not the open borders with the mexican drug cartels coming in
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.760]  no it's the legalization of marijuana in colorado that's increasing
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:17.640]  their legal expenses their law enforcement expenses
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.960]  look the drug war is the biggest boom to the law enforcement budgets there
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.920]  ever was their asset forfeiture programs are ripping off the public
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.640]  charging inanimate objects with crimes never any due process just confiscating
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:34.120]  the equipment without any due process this is
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.880]  where the patriot act and the war on tear all started
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.200]  20 years ago back in the early 90s the late 80s
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.160]  that was where they started first attacking the rights and now they're
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:48.920]  consolidating that with militarized police in the name of the war on tear
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.880]  first we had to have SWAT teams because of the war on drugs and now it's the
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:55.000]  war on terror there are also arguing that federal
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.520]  law these two attorney generals in nebraska and ohio are saying federal law
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.000]  takes precedent over colorado law there is no
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.360]  legitimate law and the federal government to prohibit
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.280]  marijuana as i said before it required a constitutional amendment to prohibit
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.400]  alcohol and then to reinstate it it required another one so we've got
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.400]  about 10 of the amendments in the constitution
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.760]  that are about the prohibition of alcohol and the
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.840]  legalization of alcohol why did they have to have that
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.960]  the only reason that's there is because once upon a time
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.880]  we had a government a congress that respected the constitution
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.560]  now they do whatever they wish just as we see
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.400]  the logical conclusion of that is you eventually wind up as you scoff at the
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.760]  constitution as you do whatever you wish as you claim powers that you don't
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.200]  have as a congress as a president the logical
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.560]  conclusion is you wind up with a president who at this point is now
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.400]  just issuing memoranda or verbal orders about
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.720]  massive programs a blanket amnesty for illegal aliens
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.800]  it's not little memoranda or executive orders like when they're going to have a
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:06.440]  holiday break these are things that are gigantic issues
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:09.320]  that he's overriding the will of congress saying
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.840]  for a long time i don't have the authority to just do whatever i wish i'm
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.080]  not a dictator saying that 22 times and then becoming a dictator
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:20.520]  that's where we wind up that's where we are now
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:24.840]  the next step of course is for this dictator or the one who follows him
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:28.520]  to start using the indefinite detention of the
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.800]  india to retain to render to torture american
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.680]  citizens on our street that's where it all ends we've seen this
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:40.600]  movie before we know how it ends let's go to your calls right now let's go to
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:44.360]  uh steven in florida steven you said you want to talk about toy guns
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:49.160]  yeah hey good afternoon david um yeah the article you were just citing about
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:54.120]  the uh attorney general up there in new york state which is my home state uh
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.640]  it doesn't surprise me but here's what i was thinking about
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:02.360]  alex showed in his documentaries how homeland security is
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:06.280]  uh trying to recruit the boy scouts to go after veterans
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.880]  and uh he played many times that clip of the eric holder when he was the
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.960]  assistant attorney general um under clinton
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:20.760]  talking about how we need to brainwash the public into giving up their guns
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.480]  and i know i think about our charlotte thompson israeli who you guys have had
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:29.560]  on several times in her book a deliberate dumbing down of america
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.120]  and how they were going to take control of the schools
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.520]  and program these kids to basically go along with the agenda
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:40.920]  and with this deal about you know saying oh you can't have kids have these toy
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.200]  guns they're too realistic and they were therefore a threat
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.360]  this is about conditioning the younger generation because i think with the
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.400]  adults it's going to be real harder to convince them
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:55.320]  although there's a lot of zombies coming up among them but with the kids
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:59.000]  what they're being programmed with for the media and the schools
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.520]  this kind of thing and then there's fear tactics such as what was used
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.400]  just a few weeks ago a half hour from me where the cops if you remember
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:14.840]  burst into a school a middle school in a winter haven in florida and with guns
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.680]  blazing you know and you know psychologically traumatized all these
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.400]  kids of course they don't want to talk about that
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.560]  but i'm saying there's a deliberate conditioning of the kids
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:31.560]  yes to be afraid of the guns rather than peering what they should which is the
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:35.800]  criminals that want them to be that way which is the people running our
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.120]  government and so this is why it's incumbent on parents
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:43.880]  you've got to make sure that you're controlling what your kids are being
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.560]  exposed to because basically what i'm saying
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:53.240]  david is americans are so unaware to a great extent of psych warfare and how
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:58.840]  it works and that's why alex calls what he has info wars it's a military term
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.320]  for psychological warfare but a lot americans really don't know what we're
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.920]  up against if we have our kids being conditioned this way
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:10.360]  we're gonna have a real big problem on our hands because
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.280]  they're already being zombified as it is from reality
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:17.960]  oh absolutely and it's all about getting the kids at an early age
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.800]  i don't know about did they have law enforcement
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.920]  in the schools and metal detectors when you were in schools they didn't when i
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.160]  was i'm older now i'm in my 50s we just started
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.000]  having like guards you know the hall guards and stuff like that
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.600]  yeah but as a hall monitor is way different than
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.880]  having armed police going through the halls and of course we had to just had a
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.160]  case here locally just outside of austin where
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.120]  there and there's video that exists of the footage so was a young man who was
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.000]  breaking up a fight between two people and this cop comes up after at the end
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.160]  of all of this and singles him out and shoots him with a taser he goes
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:58.280]  straight down on the concrete has a massive concussions left him
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.800]  brain damaged and that's a lawsuit that is that is running through there but
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.960]  again that type of of action and what you're talking about it's not just a
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:09.400]  fear of guns that they're trying to put in people and just not
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:14.360]  trying to sponge that out of the culture they're also trying to put a fear of
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.320]  the government in them that's a big part of this conditioning
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.320]  a big part of the programming that's what the tsa is all about it is a
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:25.240]  psychological program it's exactly what people behavioral
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.360]  psychologists like bf skinner have always done with their operant
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.160]  conditioning just like clicker training training
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.440]  let me put my hands on you and touch you let me harass you i'll immediately
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:37.960]  reward you with letting you fly on a plane
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.560]  that's exactly what they do to animals and that was what bf skinner was talking
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.720]  about my wife was a teacher she had a master's degree in
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:48.280]  education she read bf skinner beyond freedom of
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.200]  dignity she said this is outrageous and they were making
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.880]  everybody read that as part of the graduate program because they want them
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.840]  to think that way they want them to understand that it's a conditioning
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.240]  response and this situation that's going on in
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:04.280]  washington where they were bringing the m-wrap out there they were putting that
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:09.800]  in public and i believe i agree with the lady who shot the video i think that was
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.240]  conditioning i think that was trying to
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:17.800]  make the public afraid of the police show them their overpowering
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.400]  presence there that they've got all their equipment you know be very afraid of us
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.800]  i think that's a big part of all of this but it also entices the police to
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:28.920]  want to use the things that they're trained for that's why they're on a
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:32.440]  hair trigger that's why they shoot first it's all part of their training
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:37.960]  thank you so much steve and florida let's go to uh david in kansas david
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.640]  how you doing uh david it truly humbles me to be able to speak to you with it
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.480]  today i got a couple topics you can just bear with me and not like cut me off or
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.760]  you know i just want to get them out i just want to agree with that you're a
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:53.160]  dead on when they are training the kids at a young age to
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.880]  be afraid of guns but also to be afraid of the government
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:44:00.680]  i grew up in the late 80s early 90s you know into the mid 90s
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.040]  and when i was like in fifth or sixth grade whenever we used to go to like the
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.840]  library like me and my friends would play
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.800]  secret service like we would have a president and we would protect him you
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.760]  know we'd make gun sounds and the teachers wanted care
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.800]  and now you look at that same school that went to has a police officer on duty
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.640]  the you know the full school school cycle and
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:25.160]  how they're what they're doing is just making it worse there's more
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.400]  school shootings today than there was and you know like 93 when i was
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:32.280]  you know coming through up up through elementary school
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:36.920]  uh oh yeah and the second sorry go ahead it's like
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:40.440]  thing i can say real quick is is about this cannabis issue
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:44.920]  uh i think their ultimate goal they are they are programming you know i'm a
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.800]  candidate a a marijuana advocate i don't want to be you know like
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:50.680]  he's nowhere in marijuana something to ca
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:56.200]  came up with it but i think they are pushing it because the
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.600]  strengths today i was addicted to orchids and i can back you on
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.800]  the uh mexican drug cartels every major city i've lived in from
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:08.280]  vegas to austin to kansas city the mexicans run
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.360]  everything i mean they have it down to it's a business and it's the mafia it's
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:18.280]  not like mexican americans it's illegals uh but
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.880]  when i was living in colorado springs they're predicting for the
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:28.200]  2014 the net uh tax profit was 60 million in july it was
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.880]  already over 100 million what they what they're going to do what they need to
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.320]  do is they they don't need to legalize it but
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.680]  that's what they're going to do to get to get a control on it and then all the
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.640]  cannabis is going to be lower quality it's going to be full of
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:45.880]  poisons and it's going to cannabis is the single
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:50.440]  thing that got me off orchids it's a lifesaver uh i don't think you should
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.080]  be doing it as a party drug you know but if a physician can prescribe to you
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.520]  you know enough opiates to bring down 100 men
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:01.960]  you know per day then they should be able to describe this this is something
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:04.840]  i've been very passionate about it is this drug war it's affected almost
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:06.840]  everyone of my friends everybody in my family
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:10.520]  uh it's it's a huge farce and it's the same thing with the guns
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.040]  and i i really appreciate the time david god bless your crew
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.640]  and washington god bless alex stones on the road i got to be one of the top
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.920]  hundred and four supporters been doing it for about you know
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:24.600]  13 years now well thank you so much i really appreciate that
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.160]  yeah you know i'm not a marijuana user but it bothered me
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.440]  decades ago that they were using it to destroy our entire
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.880]  legal process to take away our rights to have trials
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:39.080]  to take away our right to even be charged with the crime that they could
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:44.040]  punish us by confiscating our physical possessions
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.480]  without even charging us with a crime i saw this happening to people over and
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.840]  over again that bothered me the corruption the increase in crime
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:54.120]  that always comes with any kind of prohibition that bothered me
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:57.480]  but one of the things that you pointed out the medical uses of marijuana
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:02.280]  that's the thing that really bothers me how can we shut our hearts to people
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:06.360]  who need this desperately as the only thing that can help them to get their
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:11.000]  appetite back to the an effective treatment for
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.600]  glaucoma or for high blood pressure there's so many different things that
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.160]  marijuana is effective for and yet we just harden our hearts to these
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:22.600]  children who are dying of cancer or people who
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.880]  can't keep anything down who can't eat anything or throwing up constantly who
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.520]  can be helped people who have said that the only
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:31.160]  thing that works for them i remember a case 20 years ago
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.000]  peter mcwilliams he wrote a book called is nobody's business if you do
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.760]  and he had AIDS and the only thing that would keep him with the
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.560]  medication that he's taken the only it was like a chemo
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:47.080]  patient everything that he would take would try to eat he would throw back
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.720]  up the only way that he could keep anything down
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.280]  was by using marijuana and he explained that to the judge the judge
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.440]  threw him in jail to keep him from violating his order of taking
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.360]  medical marijuana and this man peter mcwilliams
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:08.680]  died in jail choking on his own vomit i'm disgusted to live in a country like
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.920]  that i'm disgusted to live in a country
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.800]  where a terry shavo can be starved to death
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.160]  by the government people who try to give her any water
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:21.080]  are arrested and taken away i'm disgusted to see somebody like jeb
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:26.280]  bush who was governor of florida and who could have helped terry shavo who
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.840]  could have come in and intervened over the orders of a probate judge who
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:34.680]  murdered her give me a break he could have intervened
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:38.600]  george bush could have intervened they sent in the national guard to stop
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.120]  segregation orders are you going to send in the national guard to stop
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:48.440]  a judge from killing a helpless woman i think that should end any
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.720]  claims to a presidential campaign that the bushes have
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.440]  especially jeb bush he was on the scene he had the authority to override that he
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:59.640]  had the authority to allow people to give water and
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:03.880]  food to someone and let her die and they're letting people die
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:07.560]  because they're withholding medical marijuana and he was on that side of the
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:12.360]  issue along with this casino pimp who spent millions of dollars to try to
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.480]  keep that from happening in florida and they came
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.000]  really close to having it pass anyway it just wasn't the supermajority that they
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.520]  needed uh let's go to uh wolverton in tennessee wolverton
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.800]  uh wolverine sorry wolverine sorry no no you're good
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.520]  um i just want to talk about how if you look on the back of a police car
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.120]  it says government service that should be changed they work for us they're public
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.440]  servants and you know and it's the duty of the people
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:45.640]  to inform i mean i understand why people just don't care because you
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:50.360]  after all that you know the eric garner case you know on fox news you would see
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:54.200]  oh if you just listen to police if they ask to search your car let them
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.560]  search your car because you have nothing to hide that's bogus
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:01.240]  you know better than franklin said it best those that would sacrifice the
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.480]  central liberty for a little safety deserve neither as lose both
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.080]  and i completely agree with that statement and i think you would brought up
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:13.880]  edward snowden said if you say you'd have nothing to hide you
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:18.040]  don't care about the fourth minute then you don't care about that right
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:22.280]  that's right you basically don't don't acknowledge it that's right and
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:25.640]  there was a and along those lines i would just repeat that quote from that
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:29.480]  article by julian assange yesterday we have an article up today
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:33.480]  uh assange says the u.s is prosecuting barrett brown for quoting an assassination
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:36.200]  threat that was against me it wasn't against the fbi
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:39.560]  it was against julian assange i'll read that quote when we come back it's

[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.440]  the truth and that's why we should be so worried
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.800]  about what's going on with the police state with the surveillance state with
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.920]  the training as you pointed out they need to be trained properly they need to

[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:59.880]  and not for some authoritarian paramilitary organization we'll be right

[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.680]  one more thing oh before i played that clip let me take it back one step
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.960]  further we just had a caller who was uh talking
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:54.280]  about uh our basic rights and uh the way things are twisted and i wanted to
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:58.040]  repeat that quote yesterday we got from uh julian assange where he was talking
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:02.760]  about the prosecution of barrett brown was for quoting an assassination threat
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.000]  that was made against julian assange get that clip ready to play guys we'll play
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.520]  that clip for them but he points out something i think is very
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.600]  interesting he says twitter is a police interview that never ends
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.720]  facebook has all your friends wearing a wire
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:21.240]  youtube has you in the dock talking to the judge
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.800]  he says every social media user creates a vast library of statements
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.440]  that can be taken out of context by vengeful or ambitious officials
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:34.920]  users should be displayed their Miranda rights every time they log on to
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.920]  social media and this is why julian assange said that let's play that clip
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.320]  with in the in the in the national security united states it's pretty simple
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.560]  we've got special ops forces i mean a dead man can't leak stuff this guy's a
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.840]  traitor a treasonous and and and he has broken every law of the united
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.680]  states he's talking about julian assange and i'm not for the death penalty so if
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.440]  i'm not for the death penalty we want to do it
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:59.880]  illegally shoot the son of a well what about it oh i can't believe i believe
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.160]  with i'm i'm along with barb you know what when he comes out and says that
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:06.520]  he's holding everyone hostage that he's going to release there you go so that's
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:11.320]  the fox news clip where he says let's illegally shoot the sob
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:18.200]  okay now when barrett brown posted on twitter he posted that he said
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:23.400]  dead men can't leak stuff dot dot dot illegally shoot the sob
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.320]  and that was a quote that you just heard from bob beckle on fox news
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.120]  along with another fox news commentator who said yeah
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:33.640]  let's just assassinate julian assange because he's giving out information
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:39.000]  that shows the criminal actions of our government abroad
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.640]  he's the whistleblower he's exposing crimes that our government is committing
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:47.800]  and we haven't seen all these crimes yet as i mentioned in the first hour
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:51.960]  there's a video from a boo garab according to seymour hirsh hirsh and i
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.320]  trust him he's been a reliable source many years
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:01.160]  he says that he's seen the video of us soldiers in a boo garab
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:05.160]  bringing the children of women who are imprisoned there
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.160]  raping those children in front of the mothers
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.000]  sodomizing the young boys and the mothers are writing back letters
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.520]  saying come and shoot me i don't want to live anymore
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:19.320]  that's what our government is doing that's the kind of thing that julian
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:23.400]  assange was exposing and he was threatened by the fox news
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.680]  puppets saying we ought to just shoot the guy
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.200]  now when barrett brown gets angry because of the way he's been attacked
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.640]  for exposing criminal actions of our government
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:39.960]  he retweets that action uh that that comment from bob beckle saying
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.560]  that men can't leak stuff let's just illegally shoot him
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:47.880]  the fbi said that they were being threatened that that was a threat against
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:51.000]  them because barrett brown was angry with them
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.280]  and that's what they're trying to keep him in jail for another eight years he's
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:57.800]  already been in jail for two years that's how they will twist and take out
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:01.160]  of context anything you put on social media so be careful
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:05.480]  but then there's not just social media they're going to grab information from

[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:51.960]  yes um i have i have um i heard about how uh if um we call it that texas
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:55.800]  could nullify federal gun laws if they try to
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:02.920]  enforce a um a new a new um anti anti gun bill um
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.480]  supposed to come in to december 24th i think it is oh that's the uh u n arms
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:12.200]  trade treaty yeah uh that's that's not going to be a valid treaty because uh
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:15.560]  first of all it's only been signed by the secretary of state it has been
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:19.160]  confirmed by the senate even if they were to confirm the treaty
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.520]  there's a big constitutional fight that's going to come up because it's not
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.440]  constitutional for them to affirm anything that violates the
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.280]  our own constitution so when the constitution express expressly
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:35.560]  uh allows recognizes doesn't allow it recognizes our god-given right to own
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:39.000]  guns when the constitution says that they can't sign that away with the treaty
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.440]  so that that's going to be a big fight and and hopefully that will be uh
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:45.480]  led from here if they try to push that through
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.000]  okay thank you yes thank you let's go to uh tom tom you said you want to talk
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.080]  about gun rights yes sir mr knight how are you today
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:56.680]  doing good i agree with you that banning and
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:03.480]  outlawing toy guns is ridiculous um my um uh
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:07.160]  hand in my pocket with my index finger extended in some
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:11.640]  yeah you know uh raised in such a way to look like the hammer of a gun
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.800]  will realistically get me shot real bad if i don't reveal quickly to a
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:20.840]  uniformed officer approaching me that that it's my hand and it's not
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:27.640]  just a gun um you know the exercising of of common sense it seems is so often
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:33.720]  the real issue uh that that we face um and and these struggles and these uh
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:37.000]  instances yeah we just had an article up on info wars today
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.680]  a man was just shot who had a spoon in his hand because it looked metallic i
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:43.240]  guess he thought it might have been a gun or a knife or something
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:47.720]  uh should we ban spoons as well as toy guns or maybe what we need to do
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:52.760]  is train the police to assess the situation to not be fearful of the
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:55.960]  population and to not shoot so readily we'll be

[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.800]  going to be happening because tomorrow at 12 noon
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:47.720]  there's going to be a protest about the i-594 which is about the
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.640]  transfer of weapons now and washington a new bill is passed so where you can't
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:55.880]  transfer a weapon between two people unless you've done a background check on
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:59.560]  them and if you do that david it's a felony which means if you and i go out
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:03.160]  to arrange to go shoot and i let you shoot my gun you let me shoot yours
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:06.280]  we're both breaking the law so that's something that's pretty intense they're
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.640]  going to be protesting that at 12 representative matt shea will be there
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:11.560]  as well and then at 2 p.m tomorrow we're
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:14.040]  going to be moving over to the spokane valley sheriff's
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:18.520]  apartment where we're going to protest the m-wrap they're expecting a very large
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:21.960]  out of you know a large group of people to come from all over
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:24.600]  i've spoken to people from seattle who said they're going to be willing to
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:28.920]  drive out here people from california so tomorrow's going to be a big day but so
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:32.440]  far it's been very interesting we had the interview with a representative matt
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:37.160]  shea just earlier with darryl mcbrain and i it was very good and i liked a lot of
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:41.320]  the things he had to say i think he's a very good person for washington and i
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:44.840]  wish we had more people like him all across this great nation
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.840]  absolutely he's got some very good remedies i think we're talking about
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:52.120]  how in situations where there's a question of
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:55.480]  excessive use of force by the police there needs to be
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.480]  not just a grand jury investigation that's run by the local district attorney
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:02.520]  that always works with the police department there
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:06.600]  it needs to be a little bit more open than a grand jury proceeding
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.280]  it needs to be and there's a picture of him as he joined us earlier this week it
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:13.560]  needs to be more open to the public a grand jury hearing is not open to the
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:15.960]  public it needs to have an outside prosecutor who
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:20.040]  doesn't have ties to that department and there needs to be a public oversight
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:23.800]  of that whenever that happens it needs to be treated differently than if it was
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:27.160]  a shooting between two people in the community
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.760]  one of them not being a police officer and of course it is treated differently
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:33.800]  it usually doesn't have that kind of oversight but he made the point when i
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:37.880]  was talking to him joe matt shea said we need to have
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:41.720]  oversight committees looking at the curriculum that the police
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:46.040]  are being fed and he pointed out that they had uh this the same sheriff had
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:49.480]  brought in the southern poverty law center that's one of the reasons why
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:52.920]  this deputy i believe was so quick to say constitutionalist because the southern
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:56.360]  poverty law center identifies anybody that believes in limited
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:59.400]  government and constitution as a terrorist the thing is
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:02.760]  the thing is though is he says he's a constitutionalist now either he doesn't
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.360]  understand the definition of what constitutionalist is
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:09.960]  or he does and this is an attack on the american people
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:12.680]  yes absolutely and we've seen this over and over again from their training
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:15.640]  scenarios and everything but it's especially true of the southern poverty
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:19.000]  law center and to their credit there were people in the department there in
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.320]  the sheriff's department spokane sheriff's department
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:25.000]  that made this public and stopped that training by the southern poverty law
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.800]  center so there are good cops and we need to be able to replace the bad cops
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:34.440]  i understand that when you talk to uh to matt shea he was talking on or the
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.480]  protest leader that i think there's a video up i haven't seen it but i was as
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:41.560]  taught john bound was telling me and nico we're telling me uh that um
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:44.760]  there was a a report up where one of the protesters said they're going to do
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.400]  anything they can to remove this sheriff well yes that's very true a lot of the
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:52.760]  people in the community feel that way but uh one of the things that was
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:56.120]  interesting when i was speaking to scott mcclay he is the uh the president of
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:59.960]  the rattlesnake motorcycle club he's the one heading up the protest tomorrow
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:04.840]  at 2 p.m he said that the sheriff here has called him a common crook a criminal
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:08.840]  and he has a zero criminal background whatsoever so this is the narrative that's
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.440]  going on around here if you're a constitutionalist a patriot you're
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:15.480]  now a criminal and this is something that's not just happening in spokane
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:18.200]  we're seeing this all across the nation now and that's something that we've got
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.120]  to look at and try to stop because like you said for some reason they're being
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:26.280]  taught a whole another thing this is a shoot first ask questions later no knock
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:30.840]  warned a complete and total militarized police state that's happening and we've
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:33.000]  got to do something about it
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.760]  yeah we we saw the uh the training scenario that was being fed to the
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:40.360]  military talking about how the tea party was going to
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:43.640]  ally with muslims and how they were going to
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.640]  surround and attack the tea party so it's not just people who agree in the
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:51.080]  constitution it's also the tea party and the scary thing about it joe is that
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:55.320]  we do see them actually attacking the tea party using the irs at the moment
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:59.480]  but that's not to say that they won't use law enforcement in the future
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:03.000]  roger that that's very true and also representative shea he said
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.080]  he actually has footage he sat in on the splc training
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.720]  with the sheriff's department here and he has footage of the uh sheriff saying
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.040]  i have a pen with a stroke of my pen i can take your rights away and or your
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:18.920]  life so we're going to get that footage we're going to try to get that out to
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:22.200]  you guys as soon as possible so info wars the viewers
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:25.960]  everybody can see that well speaking of footage we had a
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:30.440]  fellow call us i think it's andrew in washington uh he said he had taken
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:33.480]  some pictures of a lot of different types of mraps
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:36.840]  and he wanted to try to get a hold of you and give you a thumb
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:40.040]  yeah that's why i was breaking down the exact interview we're on top of a parking
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:42.920]  garage beside the liberty building auntie's bookstore
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.960]  right in the middle of downtown this is the view we have so if you want to
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.000]  swing out and bring us that information that'd be very grateful
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.680]  okay great that's good and tell us again now where these protests are there's
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:56.120]  going to be a protest at noon tomorrow that's going to be
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:58.840]  about this law that just got passed it actually
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:01.560]  was something that was in the legislature and then they put it up for
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:05.880]  referendum it passed as as a piece of as part of a
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:11.160]  referendum in the state and it criminalizes the transfer of weapons
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:15.640]  now even this sheriff who is not really apparently any friend to
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:19.800]  gun owners was saying that it was unenforceable but that's not the point
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:24.600]  what it does is it allows them to charge people as you point out with a felony
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:29.080]  basically uh and after the fact if they see that
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:32.280]  there's something else that they want to go after somebody with it could be a
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:36.120]  very minor violation and they could bump this up to a felony by
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:39.480]  putting this in after the fact it's a real tripwire isn't it
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:43.160]  yeah i mean how many people are going to be arrested for something nonviolent
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:46.760]  you know how many people go out and actually have guns because they want
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:49.880]  to go to the range and shoot when you take that away i mean that's
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:53.320]  that's about as ridiculous as the there's the bracelets that the bracelet
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:58.040]  that Eric Holder wants us to wear this is mind-blowing and everyone should be
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:02.040]  outraged at something like this you know you can't even hand over a weapon to
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:05.320]  somebody without giving them a background check
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.840]  and not have to worry about being arrested or tased or choked to death
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:13.240]  afterwards by police officer this is out of this world yes so now this is going
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:17.080]  to be a protest at noon tomorrow and tell us again where that protest for that
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:19.720]  law is going to be that's going to be downtown here
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:23.320]  i'll get that information out we'll try to put that up in a blurb later on i
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:26.600]  don't have the exact location right now but when i have that david i'll make
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:29.720]  sure i give that to one of the riders and we'll have all the information for
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:33.080]  tomorrow's protest put up on the site so we can get that out to everybody
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:36.680]  and i'll also make a video on youtube so people can go to the Alex Jones youtube
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.880]  channel as well we'll tweet it out we'll have all that information out for you
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:42.600]  guys this afternoon okay so people need to
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:46.680]  check info wars.com and they need to check the Alex Jones channel on youtube
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:49.880]  and then following that protest at noon about that law
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:54.680]  there is going to be a protest at the sheriff's department at 2 p.m.
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:18:00.120]  and of course we've had this hashtag ask a cop that is blown up on the internet
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.960]  because of people's outrage over the excessive use of force
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:08.040]  i think that's time that we have a dialogue with the police i think
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:11.080]  that that'll be an important thing an important aspect of that hopefully
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:13.800]  there'll be somebody there from the police department to talk have you had
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:17.720]  any success talking to the pio there
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:22.040]  well scott mcclay the the president of the rattlesnake motorcycle clubs he said
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.280]  that uh he's spoken to the police department the
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:28.040]  sheriff's department i should say in spokane valley and they're allowing us
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:32.120]  to be in the actual parking lot of the sheriff's department so we're
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:34.280]  hoping we can get a police officer to come out
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:38.440]  maybe if you start a dialogue let some of the citizens in this country
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:42.040]  ask some questions you know why is this happening you know i really like the
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:45.560]  the ask a cop question that jacari jackson put out why are the cops in
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:49.160]  ferguson lying about using cs gas on citizens
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:52.280]  so those are more questions we got to ask and hopefully they're going to come
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:55.960]  out and we can get a dialogue started hopefully the sheriff will stop ducking
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:59.960]  endogenous on his fantasy fake uh vacation whatever
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:02.920]  it is he's on what he already came out and said that he'd be willing
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:06.920]  to debate alex on the issues at hand so now it looks like he's ducking and
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:09.880]  dodging but we'll see if he uh can come out and uh
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:13.160]  tell man up and show up and come out and you know let us talk to him
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:17.000]  and just to repeat the chronology there we got that video that the lady shot
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.560]  there with the sheriff's deputy in the m-wrap uh the video did not go up on
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:24.120]  youtube and the article didn't go up until saturday
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:28.360]  mccyle had reached out to them on a friday night uh they didn't respond the
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:32.680]  next day they didn't respond on sunday on monday they put up his long video on
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:35.720]  facebook but they never and which we included in our article to try to be
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:39.240]  fair to give his uh a point of view there uh he said
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:43.160]  repeatedly that he'd like to come on the alex jones show and talk and we reached
[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:46.840]  out to him but we keep being told from the pio there that
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:49.880]  he's not going to be back until next year stay with us are going to be right
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:55.000]  back uh wrap this up with staff sergeant joe bigs retired and now in

[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:12.680]  welcome back to the alex show i'm david knight your host on this friday
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:17.160]  december 19th 2014 we're joined from spokane washington by
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:20.680]  joe biggs uh there along with darryl mcbrain and our cameraman
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:24.840]  reporting on the situation there that there's a protest massive protest
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:30.040]  tomorrow about the new law prohibiting the transfer of firearms that was just
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:34.360]  run through with the referenda on this last election as well as the sheriff
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:38.120]  who has made a lot of very troubling comments most recent one
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:42.440]  was saying that they needed an m-wrap to use against constitutionalists
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:45.640]  joe the m-wrap is something and you and i've talked about this this is something
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:49.160]  that was rushed into production by the military
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:53.320]  in a very very short time frame didn't go through the normal uh design reviews
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:57.560]  and competitive bidding as normal they rushed that to theater they
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:01.400]  have had a lot of problems a lot of very expensive maintenance they've offered
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:05.320]  these things to our allies if they just come and take them nobody showed up to
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:08.360]  come offer and so now what they're doing is they're
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:11.880]  giving these away as a lease program these different
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:15.960]  police departments putting the maintenance charges on those police
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:19.000]  departments and although there has been some
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:23.480]  uh localities where they have gotten the police or the sheriff to
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:27.240]  they've told them they need to send back the m-wrap they're not able to send that
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:30.680]  back unless they get the permission of the department of defense
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:34.120]  and now we've got congress buying some abram tanks we see in this article
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:37.640]  today that the army doesn't even want just like uh they can't get they don't
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:40.600]  want to get rid of these m-wraps these white elephants and put them locally
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:43.560]  now they're getting other equipment that they don't want
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:46.520]  course four uh foisted upon them by government this is something we've
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:49.480]  seen happening over and over again throughout the decades by the military
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.920]  industrial complex lobbyists pushing congress to do this
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:55.880]  well david what happens when you give a child a costume
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:59.480]  say a child you give him a spider-man costume he takes that roll on
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:02.840]  what happens when you give police military equipment
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:06.280]  military gear what are they going to do act like they're in the army
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:09.800]  and now like you said there's 120 million for tanks
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:13.160]  that the army says that they don't want but congress says or the defense
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:16.600]  spending bill includes 120 million for that so what's going to happen where
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:20.040]  these tanks going to go if the army says hey we don't want them we already have
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:23.160]  enough in our fleet what are they going to do they're already given the m-wraps
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:26.040]  to local police forces what's going to happen now abram's
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:31.560]  tanks on the roads in rural america you know this is something that we have to
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:34.840]  think about not saying that's what's going to happen but this is about it though
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:38.040]  where are they going to put them this is rapidly escalating there was a story
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:41.080]  that we talked to paul watson about yesterday it was up on info wars.com
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:46.200]  where the largest uh police agency in the united states of california highway
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:49.000]  patrol is self identifying themselves now as a
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.160]  paramilitary organization saying is this job for you
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:56.440]  people who want to work for the california highway patrol at their
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:59.560]  website they're saying we're a paramilitary
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:03.160]  organization we operate under a structured chain of command they talk
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:06.280]  about how they want people who have military experience to work for the
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:09.720]  california highway patrol they are rapidly
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:13.320]  maltrising and they're not even making any bones about it they're admitting it
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:16.200]  now yeah i mean what happened to it being a
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:20.680]  peace force these are supposed to be people to help enforce the law
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:25.160]  now they're an attack force they are an organized well not really organized but
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:30.760]  they are turning into a military this is something that's got to stop
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:34.360]  and to shoot first ask questions later mentality there's too many innocent
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:38.200]  americans that are dying because these guys are being taught the wrong things
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:42.120]  and the splc coming into spokane isn't going to help the situation out
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:45.560]  whatsoever we've seen them go from identifying them
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:49.080]  identifying themselves as peace officers to identifying themselves as a
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:53.960]  paramilitary organization everyone everyone should be very concerned
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.400]  about this it's been a very slow gradual process but it's
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:01.400]  accelerating quite rapidly now i mean it's 10 times worse than orwell could
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:04.360]  have ever predicted i mean you can't go through a city right now
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:09.000]  without some camera on a corner multiple cameras stingray systems everywhere
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:13.160]  i mean the the army's putting up a huge blimp to watch the east coast but that's
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:16.040]  only in defense of uh you know missiles coming in
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:19.080]  they're saying that it's not going to be used to spy on people or
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:22.840]  watch movements of people or cars or listen on cell phone
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:25.960]  conversations because we know david they never do things like that
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:29.960]  well maybe it's to watch out for these north korean terrorists because we now
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:33.320]  have this uh it's now official even though
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.920]  and this is interesting joe they put out a statement from the u.s government
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:39.880]  saying the fbi now has enough information to conclude the north korean
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:44.440]  government is responsible for these this hacking of sony and they say this was
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:48.760]  not attributed to any official by name nobody wanted to show up and say this
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:52.920]  nobody wanted to sign their name to this because it's so patently absurd
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.480]  it's such an obvious lie and yet that's the way they're scaring everybody into
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:59.960]  this massive police and surveillance state
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:02.680]  this really what they're telling people about this sony hacking
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:06.440]  is just as absurd as the narrative that's being fed to the police
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:09.160]  for a long time by the southern poverty law center
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:13.320]  and yet they don't have the ability to see through it
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:16.680]  the fbi couldn't locate a stolen cheeseburger i mean
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:19.880]  these guys don't know what they're doing this is this this whole thing is out of
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:22.440]  control and america's got to wake up to what's going on
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:25.880]  we've got to talk to each other we've got to share this information and we've
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:29.000]  got to stand up and say enough is enough i'm mad as hell and i'm not going to
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.720]  take it anymore absolutely joe biggs and spokane washington along

[02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:24.040]  night on this friday december 19th we're gonna go back to your calls we have a
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:27.080]  dominican california we're gonna talk to you about kim trails he said you want to
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:31.480]  talk about that before we do i just wanted to uh go back to this
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:37.560]  sony hacking situation and the absurdity the absurdity the fbi saying they now
[02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:40.520]  have enough information to conclude the north korean government's responsible
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:44.440]  for these actions and as i pointed out as i read this statement
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:48.200]  they didn't attribute it to any official by name nobody wanted to sign their name
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:51.960]  to that they didn't want to be uh coming across as
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.480]  jonathan gruber uh they did not want to uh appear
[02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:58.440]  handing that out or making that announcement we have had obama come out
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:02.920]  and say that of course and all the other guardians of peace from our country
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:08.920]  most of them actual g.o.p members in the grand old party since uh john mccain
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.800]  lindsay graham mike mccall all the people who support
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:19.400]  unqualified every military action every war every intrusion into our privacy
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:22.280]  every attack on the constitution that's being done
[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:25.720]  in this country by our government and there's an article that just went up by
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:29.880]  kit daniels uh nsa capable of false flag
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:35.480]  sony hack that's blamed on north korea this is a presentation that came out by
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:38.840]  charlie miller who spent five years exploiting foreign
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:43.400]  computers for the nsa he gave a presentation entitled
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:49.960]  kim jong ill and me how to build a cyber army to attack the us in which he
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:53.800]  explained various hacking methods and how easy it was to blame the attack on
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:57.800]  another country you get that kim jong ill that's the
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:02.440]  uh father of the current kim jong and he's saying kim jong ill and me in
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:06.280]  other words i can attack the us and make it look like it's coming from north
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:09.640]  korea i know how to do that of course he does you can easily
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:14.680]  route your attacks through another country he says maybe a computer from china
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.520]  is attacking you but really that computer is some russian dude who's logged
[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:22.600]  into that computer so you can't tell if it was russian or chinese on the other
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:25.960]  side it will make attribution really hard for your opponent
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:29.960]  because you'll be able to attack from a thousand different places
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:34.920]  and from all over the world and they're not going to know who you are
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:38.840]  that's how you do it they know that they've known that for a very long time
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:42.520]  when he wrote that uh that was the previous
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:47.080]  leader of north korea erin schwarz pointed out a long time ago and of
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:50.120]  course he was the guy that was the point man and
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:53.720]  shutting down these previous attacks on us syspa that they're now
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:59.160]  trying to revive our guardians of peace are now trying to revive that
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:02.600]  and he had pointed out that virtually all of these exploits that we're seeing
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:06.760]  all of the hacking is either the u.s government itself
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:10.760]  directly or they're funding these exploits
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:14.440]  from other people in other words our u.s government
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:17.880]  is the biggest group of hackers on the planet
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:21.640]  it has absolutely no credibility that this
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:27.480]  is a attack from north korea
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:32.520]  they're crying about and that's that's kim jung ill he was so ill he died
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:37.400]  and now we have kim jung un uh the u.m
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:40.360]  there everybody is and of course they had to cry
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.520]  and i guess we all have to cry about what's happened to sony we i guess we
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:47.080]  should all line up and start doing that to make
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:52.040]  newt gingrich and graham and mccain all happy and tell them
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:55.400]  that's okay we'll give you absolute total control of the internet so
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:58.600]  nothing like this ever happens again and as other security experts have pointed
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:02.600]  out it's a huge leap from going into some computer in a
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:06.520]  in a business that's not very well protected and grabbing their emails
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:09.400]  it's a huge leap from going to that to saying that you're going to have them
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:12.680]  attack the infrastructure and i tell you what if it if the infrastructure is
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:16.360]  attacked it's probably going to be a false flag just like this
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:19.720]  should we be concerned should it doesn't have any credibility with you
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:23.320]  that the fbi said this that it's now official from the fbi
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:27.480]  i just read at the end of the last hour that statement from julien assange
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:31.320]  where he pointed out that barrett brown has been in jail for two years are
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:34.120]  trying to keep him in jail for another eight and a half years why
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:38.440]  because he tweeted a quote from fox news where they were saying that the
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:41.480]  government ought to assassinate julien assange
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:44.840]  see that's the answer to everything isn't it for the neocons for the
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:48.520]  gop for the guardians of peace the answer to everything
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:54.360]  is to attack is to assassinate is to torture that's the kind of government
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:58.280]  we have the government that would twist that it's very
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:02.120]  obvious at this point it's not a mistake they're just using that saying
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:06.120]  that when he tweeted that dead men can't leak stuff
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:10.040]  illegally shoot the sob they said you're talking about the fbi
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:12.600]  and that's what they're trying to keep them in jail for they're saying that he
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:15.960]  was he was quoting bob becklen we played the clip for you
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:19.560]  let's go back to your calls dominic in california called about kim trails go
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:24.760]  ahead yeah hey david um yeah you know i moved into
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:29.400]  a new house about two months ago and i'm in a heavy agricultural zone here in
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.680]  california and there's been a lot of these
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:36.520]  kim trails over my area and i started filming them
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.560]  about a month ago and one day they it came really low by the house is
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:45.800]  like really low and within a couple hours they turned into a cloud and there
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:49.320]  was these web things falling everywhere in the air
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:54.280]  and i got it all on tape i put the video up on kim chasers dot com
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:58.920]  uh these uh these webs were like i mean they were up in the sky
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.120]  as high as the trail and they i mean they look like they're a hundred feet long
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:04.920]  and i mean they're all over this video everywhere
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:09.000]  and uh they i had to go pick up my daughter from school shortly after that
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.440]  and they were covering the fences and the trees at the school
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:15.800]  and i mean i saw them coming out of the trail what do you think
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:19.720]  do you think that the aluminum that just is maybe got jammed in the sprayer and
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:23.480]  it was spraying out like pumping up or like what could that be
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:27.560]  well i can't really speak to that i don't know i i do know that uh
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:31.480]  i mean where can people see that video again
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:35.400]  uh kim chasers dot com kim chasers dot com
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:39.160]  i do know we had a participant in the paul revere contest and he had an
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:43.320]  interesting um uh documentary as well as an app that he
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:47.080]  was doing it was called uh skiter alert i think was the name of it
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:50.280]  and people can get that app and they can
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:54.680]  uh they can report whenever they see something like that in the sky
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:58.440]  where they see kim trails nothing is unusual is what you just talked about
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:03.160]  but when they see a massive grid of persistent contrails in the sky they
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:05.960]  can report that and they've been able to correlate that with the changes in
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:09.080]  temperature so we know that it's that they've
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.280]  talked about doing this and they pretend that it's something that they haven't
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.360]  done and yet going back decades going back to the vietnam war alex jones
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:19.960]  interviewed a man who was decorated by president johnson because of his
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:23.160]  effect that he had on the weather during the vietnam war so they we know that
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:25.960]  they've been working on this for many many decades
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:29.320]  we know that they have talked about using kim trails to try to affect the
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:33.320]  temperature here on the planet to change the reflectivity
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:36.440]  so we know that they're doing it and yet they pretend that as well it's
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:40.360]  something that um we need to look into it but it's
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:45.320]  we're not really doing it yet at the last uh geoengineering conference that they
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:48.840]  had this year i think it was this fall in germany
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:52.440]  they had a paper written by one guy says well assuming that we were to do
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:56.120]  something like this who gets to set the thermostat
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:40:59.560]  and that's a really good question who gets to set the thermostat if they were
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:02.040]  to do something like that i don't really know what they're doing i don't know
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.080]  what you saw i'd very much like to uh see that report that you got over there
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:10.280]  thanks for calling in let's go to uh bob in main bob
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:13.640]  how you doing doing good what you want to talk about
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:17.960]  uh i was i'm kind of on topic today you guys talking about the police state and
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:21.960]  uh i had a swat team at my house trying to kick my door in this
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:27.720]  past winter and it's pretty terrifying you know and they had the wrong guy
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:31.720]  yes and that happens so many times that's that's so infuriating about this
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:34.680]  and as i said yesterday we're talking about this uh
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:38.200]  m-wrap program where they're putting all this heavy militarized equipment in
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.560]  they're saying well we're only going to use it for emergency situations that's
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:44.120]  what we were told about swat teams when they came out and yet we're seeing
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:47.240]  them being used every day on a daily basis and every
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.080]  day we're seeing people who are innocent being attacked if they kick in the door
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:55.080]  are are you under a home invasion or is this a swat team and we've just had a
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:58.680]  report yesterday of somebody who had their home broken
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:02.520]  into and the people yelled police and it wasn't the police it was a robbers they
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:05.080]  knew that this is every that's on everybody's mind
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:08.920]  so they used that to attack the people to get the upper hand over them to say
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:11.960]  that they were a swat team but it's a very dangerous situation if you tried
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:14.440]  to defend yourself the swat team will kill you
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:17.480]  yeah oh yeah and uh they showed up here in the middle of the night they put my
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:21.000]  face on tv and said that i was a criminal and
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:24.520]  don't find out they're only they only wanted the guy for the cop with that
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:28.280]  they wanted who somebody for cop with that the guy they wanted the guy for
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:30.840]  cop with that but they showed up here instead
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:34.120]  yeah i mean it was like they had a swat team in the middle of the night
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:37.720]  you know there was a case uh a couple of years ago where the department of
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:40.360]  education showed up in the middle of the night
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:44.040]  dragged a man and his children out on the front lawn face down probably what
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.680]  they just did to you it was the department of
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:50.040]  education's swat team and a year earlier the
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:54.520]  washington post had looked at their rfp so they had the request for proposal
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:57.640]  their their bid to get equipment and they said why is the department of
[02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:00.760]  education buying bulletproof vests and shotguns and
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:04.120]  all this other uh paramilitary equipment why does the department of education
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:07.320]  need that for and then they found out that's why we're so concerned when we
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:10.200]  see this equipment going to the police when we see
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:14.200]  these uh request for purchases for billions of rounds of ammunition
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:17.160]  we know they're going to use that we know that's not civilian ammunition we
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:20.920]  know that's for civilians because geneva convention outlaws the kind of
[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:24.280]  ammunition that homeland security was getting and we know that it's not for
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:27.560]  target practice because that's the most expensive ammunition you can get you're
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:31.080]  not going to use that for target practice even as prolificate as
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:34.840]  as profligate as our uh government is in terms of spending money they're not
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:37.800]  going to waste uh that much money if they're going to buy that kind of
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:40.760]  quantity of ammunition it was absolutely absurd and it was absurd for the
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:45.000]  department of education to get those kind that kind of equipment as well
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.440]  and i mean they called me a sovereign and everything else because i wouldn't
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:51.320]  give them my social security number through the window and they wouldn't show
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:56.760]  me the warrant and uh and uh and and it was and they
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:59.800]  had the wrong house the entire time they had the wrong guy that somebody with
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:03.720]  the same name as me but i mean i've lived in this town for 35 years and i mean
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:07.160]  everybody knows me you know if it was caught with that
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:10.600]  why did they just come here they know where i live you know yes yes
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:13.960]  well you're lucky that you weren't killed and the other thing that i read at the
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:18.920]  beginning of the show was that account of the german man who was uh had it was an
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:22.600]  arab a muslim whatever he had that type he had a muslim name
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:26.760]  and just like you said they they came to the wrong house because it was somebody
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:29.880]  else that they were looking for that had your name that was why that guy was
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:34.040]  picked up by the cia rendered out of the country tortured for a very long time
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:37.080]  and then dumped alongside the road and threatened not to talk about it
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:40.200]  he had the same name as the person that they were looking for was another case
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:43.560]  of mistaken identity and i guess that's what we have to look forward to that's
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:46.600]  the next level after we put up with these swat teams
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.920]  the next thing they're going to do is actually start using the nda a on us
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.000]  indefinitely detaining us uh shipping us to another country if they want to a
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.720]  torturous and of course you'll just disappear that was what
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:00.840]  his family saw they they didn't know what had happened to him he just
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:04.840]  disappeared one day point up here this summer just
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:07.720]  you know it's about a mile from my house i went through that and i wouldn't
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:09.560]  roll the window down all the way and the guys
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:12.760]  hauling at me calling me a sovereign yeah yeah well that's what they've been
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:16.520]  told see it's it's terms like a sovereign citizen terms like a
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:20.120]  constitutionalist that's why everyone was so concerned
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:24.360]  about that videotape it was not taken out of context the real context is that
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:28.120]  the southern poverty law center is using those types of terms
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:31.960]  to demonize people and again we've seen in scenarios that they even use the term
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:34.600]  tea party to try to portray people as being dangerous
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:38.520]  thank you so much bob i'm glad you survived that uh encounter with a swat
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:41.880]  team in maine again that's bob from maine he had his house
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:45.480]  swat teamed and he wasn't the guy they were looking for yet they put his face
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:48.520]  on television they put him face down on the ground
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:52.520]  nearly killed him with a swat team let's go to uh john and colorado john you
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:56.040]  want to talk about the marijuana laws there
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:59.480]  no i think we missed him that's too bad i wanted to ask him about that let's go
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:02.760]  to kevin and with in west virginia uh you said you want to talk about the
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.800]  beware program um yeah um i was wondering if we as
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:11.560]  citizens could have our own little beware program and kind of do the same
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:15.880]  thing that they're doing and point out what police officers
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:21.560]  are um corrupt or what police officers are not actually for the constitution
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:26.280]  but my question then is is that going to add fuel to the fire
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:32.760]  um with an osper sim type of mentality well that's true i i think that there
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:37.320]  needs to be citizen oversight of uh the police and as we
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:40.760]  we're talking to matt shea he said there ought to be citizen over there ought to
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:45.560]  be separate uh outside investigators whenever there's a possibility of
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:48.920]  uh police brutality excessive use of force whenever there's a shooting
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:53.480]  there ought to be an open public trial not a closed grand jury investigation
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:56.520]  and there ought to be an outside prosecutor and we ought to have
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:00.760]  oversight of the police in terms of their training as well so i think it would
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:06.760]  be appropriate to start looking at the the postings of the police and if
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:09.560]  they're posting stuff up that is threatening and we've seen that a lot
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:13.480]  of the repostings from the ask a cop were some very
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:17.640]  in-your-face postings from the police and of course uh they put out that
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:21.240]  t-shirt that we had an article up on info wars dot com yesterday
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:25.400]  they've got a a shirt that they're putting out a law enforcement insignia
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.480]  says uh breathe easy obey the law essentially the
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:33.080]  same thing that art osavado said here in austin
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:37.000]  hey if uh the the cop tells you do something
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.680]  just do it and you won't get hurt well
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:44.840]  do we have to mow their lawn do we have to lick their boots what do we have to
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:47.800]  do that that's that article up right now for anybody that's watching
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:52.520]  uh pro police breathe easy t-shirt draws the ire of brutality posters just obey
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:56.440]  the law you won't be beaten or murdered unless the cops feel like it that's the
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:00.200]  article that's up on our our website info wars dot com you can see that
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:04.120]  article and i guess really we should point this out and and
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:07.400]  it was actually uh kevin it was actually police
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:11.880]  inside the uh spokane sheriff's office who
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:15.560]  blew the whistle on the fact that the southern poverty law center was there
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:20.280]  propagandizing the sheriff's department so there are good cops who
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.560]  are not going to be doing that type of thing that we just saw there they're
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:26.920]  not going to be threatening the population and they're going to be
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:30.200]  blowing the whistle when you've got somebody like the southern poverty law
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:33.160]  center coming in teaching some very dangerous stuff so i don't think that
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:37.160]  that necessarily escalates things i think there needs to be a dialogue back
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:41.560]  and forth to the police don't you i totally do um
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:46.840]  my uncle is an x-required um police officer um for anorano county maryland
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:50.600]  and he was head of narcotics division and uh he wrote a book
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:53.720]  about um the corruption in the anorano county
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:58.040]  maryland police department um he hasn't published his book
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:01.320]  but he has given me a copy of it and all the names
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:05.560]  are not changed or anything but i was wondering is that something you guys
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:10.760]  will be interested in looking at or uh certainly if you've got a link to it
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:13.560]  where we could look at it or if it's been published yes and that too uh
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:16.600]  showtipsandinfowars.com i'd appreciate that thank you so
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:20.760]  much um let's go to uh will and fema eight will you
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:24.840]  said you want to talk about toy guns i think that's fema five
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:31.400]  oh fema five okay go ahead um yeah of course hearing the one caller prior
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:34.680]  on the mistaken identity yeah i had that even
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.680]  even though it wasn't with the police thank goodness uh partially with the uh
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:44.120]  my one bank i was with same name uh and actually also the same last four
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:49.400]  sosh that they looked up me by and what did they do at the bank
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:54.280]  when i was needing to get into my account and all i had was my uh debit card
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:57.880]  they looked up my name they asked for my last four of my sosh
[02:49:57.880 --> 02:50:01.880]  and they actually had to confirm my location of where i live because there
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:05.640]  was another person with my name and the last four of my
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:09.400]  sosh in their system yes yes absolutely
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:12.840]  yes a very dangerous thing and it's not just getting names mixed up when we're
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:15.800]  talking about this beware program the real beware program that they
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:20.600]  that the federal government pays uh 36 000 a year for the police departments to
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.040]  have they can go in and who knows what the
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:28.600]  assumptions are that they're making in order to assign a threat level of red
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:32.200]  yellow or green to you i mean that really
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.800]  begs a lot of questions when they're giving out threat assessments
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:39.560]  essentially not just telling the police that everybody uh the in the general
[02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:43.400]  population is out to kill them but then assigning a color
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:46.920]  to you telling them that you're a threat how do they know that you're a threat
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:49.960]  what are their fundamental assumptions there's a lot of possibility for false
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:52.520]  positives and that a very dangerous situation going

[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:33.400]  he has extended the special that we had earlier this week we can no longer
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:36.520]  guarantee christmas delivery but we've had such overwhelming response we
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:39.160]  decided that we would make it available to people
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:43.720]  it looks like there's a lot of demand for this that do it as a favor to the
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:47.960]  people who support us this is 59 99 for the essential
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:51.800]  holiday pack secret 12 x2 nascent iodine and silver

[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:01.960]  although we can no longer guarantee christmas delivery you might get it
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:05.400]  we're not sure let's go back to your calls in this last segment we have here
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:09.000]  steve and michigan go ahead steve
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.600]  hello hello go ahead uh yeah i've been a long time listener and supporter of
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:18.200]  your program and i've been tuning in to
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:21.560]  talk about the fema camps and the red and blue list
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:25.400]  and about how the nsa tracks everything we can do
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:31.960]  watch as your show and who's calling in and uh last night i was listening to i
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:36.600]  guess it was a rebroadcast and alex was talking about
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:40.280]  how they are and why they are letting uh info wars
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:43.080]  go on but i think there's one thing that everybody's
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:47.800]  overlooking excuse me uh what they're doing
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:52.760]  is the nsa knows everybody that calls into your show
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:56.520]  they know their name they know where they live they know everything about
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:56:00.040]  them so essentially the obvious reason
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:03.960]  that they're letting you guys go on and they're not going to touch alex
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:09.160]  until the very end is because you're essentially calling the herd for them
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:12.760]  well let me say this if we're going to get so
