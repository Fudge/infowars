[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:10.000 --> 00:25.000]  It is Friday the 13th, 2019. I am your host, Alex Jones. This is going to be a very informative and very important transmission.
[00:25.000 --> 00:32.000]  Tom Pappert is going to be steering the ship. We're going to have Andrew Tate, who is incredibly smart.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  And I had an amazing two hour meeting with him last night about what's happening in Europe, in Eastern Europe,
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  and what happened to Shilchescu at a model of what's going to happen here with the left. Really powerful information.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  He's going to be in for the third and fourth hour. He'll be hosting by himself in the fourth hour.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  If I'm done with the work I'm focusing on right now, I'll be coming back on the broadcast as well.
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  But regardless, we've got Owen Schreuer and the rest of the crew in D.C. with big breaking news there.
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  We just had Will Johnson obviously in front. Nadler is running the whole show trial situation in the house.
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  Info Wars is hitting on all cylinders. We're really rising the occasion with only 300-something days out from the election.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  And I'm just getting very thankful for listeners keeping us in the game, but we are not disappointing.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  And I'm just very thankful to God because this is a lot more important than a football game. This is for all the marbles.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  Again, I just want to say the crew we've got at Info Wars is amazing. And I am very, very thankful to them.
[01:38.000 --> 01:45.000]  I just can't help but be thankful. I'm very, very appreciative. And I think as bad as things are in the world,
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  we should sit back and thank God that really evil is being revealed in a way never before done.
[01:51.000 --> 02:01.000]  And we're coming from behind so far. And as we learn all of these horrors and as we learn about all these different big atrocities,
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  it's infuriating. And I get really angry myself, but if you just look at all the positive things that are happening,
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  the pedophile rings, the kidnapping rings, the blackmail rings, the globalism of satanic and anti-human,
[02:13.000 --> 02:22.000]  that it's a cultic, its roots, how it operates, its strategies, its structures, their whole system is being revealed
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  and their system cannot survive exposure. So the few minutes I have left in this segment,
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  let me get to the big news here. Even if the conservative coalition in the UK isn't perfect,
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  it's having to act like it's anti-New World Order, anti-globalist, and Nigel Farage is the power behind the throne
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  and he is a great patriot and wants sovereignty and free market and pro-western values.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  And Boris Johnson just won a staggering victory. Normally the globalists can use parliamentary manipulation
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  to always have a fractured divided government. As bad as our two-party system is, it's better than having, you know, 15 parties.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  That's how Merkel stayed in power, even though she gets like 20% of the vote.
[03:05.000 --> 03:13.000]  Well, this is a huge route for the Labour Party in the left that wanted to stay in the EU.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  And they put all these fake polls saying that, oh, even though the Conservatives and the Nationalists
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  have been 15 points ahead a few months ago, now it was a dead heat. That was just an attempt to keep people from going out and voting.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  It's a landslide, a spiral of the election fraud and all the illegals brought into vote.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  And it's about repudiating open borders and globalism and the Islamification of Europe.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  And it's a very, very good message. Huge demonstrations by the millions in France, Germany.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  People are really waking up and it is an exciting time to be alive.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  We'll be walking through all of this on this Friday 13th, 2019, worldwide broadcast.
[03:53.000 --> 04:02.000]  The headline is on infowars.com. Conservatives gain enough seats to outright majority in UK Parliament.
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.000]  Labour had a disappointing night losing big, big article breaking it all down on infowars.com.
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  So many other big facets we're going to be laying out. This whole fiasco in the house is backfiring on the Democrats.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  Now the Republicans can ask questions. If it goes to the Senate, the trial is going to destroy them as well.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  I think it's a mixed bag, but maybe Trump's right. There should be a long trial.
[04:27.000 --> 04:35.000]  So he has a chance to respond to all of this. It's all coming up today, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  Tomorrow's news today. Band-Auth video is exploding. Thanks to all of you spreading the word.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's really an exciting time to be alive and everything the globalists are doing is backfiring.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  All right, we're going to come back. I'll do a brief break down a Friday 13th history.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  Then Tom Pappert is loaded. Like I say, prepare. Please spread the word.
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  This is not a participation sport. Infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[04:59.000 --> 05:07.000]  The 12 days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Infowars with free shipping store-wide and double Patriot points.

[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  A date sometimes linked with the origin of Fry the 13th Superstition.
[06:29.000 --> 06:37.000]  King Philip IV ordered Demolais and scores of other French Knights Templars to be simultaneously arrested.
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  Then they were systematically tortured and killed.
[06:42.000 --> 06:50.000]  Some of the Knights Templars were able to flee to Scotland and began to establish a major move,
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  what was called the Black Nobility, out of areas of Europe and what is Italy today,
[06:56.000 --> 07:05.000]  to the British, Irish, and Scottish Isles, establishing what would later become the British Empire.
[07:05.000 --> 07:14.000]  This information that I'm laying out is mainline history, but again, the general public has been kept in the dark
[07:14.000 --> 07:22.000]  about the tentacles of history that stretch from the past into the future.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  And the different power structures that existed then still have their modern manifestations today.
[07:28.000 --> 07:36.000]  Look at the Vatican. It is its own sovereign nation based in what is again Italy today.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  But previously, just 160 years ago or so, Italy wasn't even a nation.
[07:42.000 --> 07:52.000]  It was a collection of kingdoms, just as the Austrian-Hungarian Empire was as well, but was then later fused together.
[07:52.000 --> 07:59.000]  The Knights Templar is one of the oldest continuing secret societies on the planet today.
[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  What were secret societies in ancient times are simply called intelligence agencies in modern times.
[08:07.000 --> 08:15.000]  But intelligence agencies themselves, operating in secret with unlimited budgets above the law, really just form gangs,
[08:15.000 --> 08:23.000]  or in many cases, organized crime units, themselves fractured with different factions within.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  This type of government destroys open, free societies.
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  And when unchecked, always grows like a cancer until the body politic falls into third world slavery and serfdom.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  And the globalists know that and are directing the planet towards the destruction of the nation state.
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  They don't even want a giant super-world government.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  They want a world regulatory system that enslaves the general public,
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  and then armored above the law city-states will rule all the subsections.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  You may have heard of this before. You see it in movies like Hunger Games.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  But Hunger Games is not inventing these ideas.
[09:01.000 --> 09:11.000]  It's simply compositing it into a science fiction projection or cosmology to begin to condition and direct the public.
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  In my film, In Game 2.0, that was released on the Internet to supplement the original film and DVD,
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  we show that government documents with Dr. Michael Kaufman that are public, where the UN admits they want to return
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.000]  to the world government systems that were first being developed by ancient empires like the Romans, Babylonians, and Egyptians
[09:34.000 --> 09:44.000]  to the planet on a planetary scale and based around paganism and occultism and even return human sacrifice.
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  This is all public. It's all diabolical. And it must be opposed.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  If we submit to it, we are signing our own death warrants.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  The system can easily be defeated if we will admit what is being established.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  But for the last 50 years, as they constructed private corporate world government,
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  the media has been telling us it doesn't exist.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  Now it exists, but they tell you that you'll be de-platformed.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  You'll be arrested. You'll be attacked. You'll be demonized.
[10:15.000 --> 10:26.000]  You'll be called anti-Semitic if you talk about it when Hitler himself created the brainchild that became the European Union.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  This is not a Nazi conspiracy. It's not a Jewish conspiracy. It's not a Vatican conspiracy.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  It is a corruption conspiracy. It is a conspiracy of Satanism, of the occult.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  And it works through all of these hidden organizations and hidden hands.
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  It works through the occult, which means hidden.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  This is your history lesson for Friday the 13th, 2019. I'm Alex Jones.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  Find more at banned.video.
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I am Tom Papert filling in for Alex today as he is off on a very important mission.
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.000]  You just heard the explainer for the significance of the day Friday the 13th.
[11:10.000 --> 11:19.000]  And Alex Jones in the previous segment gave a summary of the massive blow dealt to the globalists yesterday in the UK.
[11:19.000 --> 11:30.000]  The United Kingdom. Boris Johnson is reigning supreme in the single largest conservative victory the nation has seen since the days of Margaret Thatcher.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  It's truly unbelievable.
[11:32.000 --> 11:46.000]  Many, many, many, including Sky News are crediting the Brexit Party. That is, of course, Nigel Farage's party for pushing it over the edge and making Labour lose in the strongholds.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  It is held in some cases for nearly 70 years.
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  We've seen Jeremy Corbyn, who is, of course, the British Bernie Sanders promising socialism.
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  He doesn't even couch it saying democratic socialism. It's just socialism in the UK.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  We've seen him now resign in disgrace after a crushing victory.
[12:08.000 --> 12:21.000]  This also comes after media all across the world from Fox News to British media has been suggesting that the Liberals, the Labour in the UK were going to pull off an upset.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  And they were going to win or at least make it close enough that we might just get that second referendum.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  Of course, none of that will happen now. It's over 300 seats for the Tories, for the Conservatives.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  Nothing. They're almost wiped off the map.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  It's reminiscent of 2016 here in the United States.
[12:41.000 --> 12:53.000]  President Trump, of course, is promising a tighter relationship than ever before with the UK. He says that it will be a very prosperous relationship with a trade deal favouring the UK and shunning the European Union.
[12:53.000 --> 13:03.000]  And of course, Boris Johnson is not perfect. He is a little bit of an old hat Conservative, a George Bush Conservative, a Mitt Romney Conservative.
[13:03.000 --> 13:15.000]  But when the alternative is socialism, nationalizing industry, I'd say the British made a very, very good choice.
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  In the second hour, we'll have a national file British contributor, Jack Hadfield.
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  These are correspondent across the pond. We'll have him on to explain the significance of this victory.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  We're also going to have Patrick Howley on the show. He's another writer for National File.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  He's also a contributor at Epic Times, formerly at Breitbart, formerly at Daily Collar.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  He's going to explain the IG report with some insight that nobody else has really had.
[13:42.000 --> 13:50.000]  He's going to do the same for impeachment. He was one of the first people to really start breaking down the significance of all the little tidbits.
[13:50.000 --> 14:00.000]  While myself, Alex, and everybody else were discounting it, he looked into the actual 400-some page report and found some massive, massive contradictions.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  Let's start today by going over some of this British news.
[14:06.000 --> 14:20.000]  This is from infowars.com. Conservatives gain enough seats for the outright majority. 363 seats with the Labour winning a paltry 203.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  Boris Johnson is now promising closure over Brexit, and he is going to promise to reinvigorate the NHS.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  That's, of course, Britain's national socialist health system.
[14:32.000 --> 14:44.000]  He's hoping to help Britain heal after what has been years, years now, of hatred and loathing, both sides hating each other.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  And I want to underscore Corbyn, the socialist, the British Bernie Sanders.
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  He was promising to everyone that should he win, there would be a second referendum outright destroying democracy.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  If you don't vote the way the elite wants you to, well, you just keep voting until you get it right.
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  So it is a massive, massive landslide in the United Kingdom.
[15:10.000 --> 15:19.000]  I think that the British are going to have a bright new future, and this is essentially a transitory government.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  Soon we will likely see them go down the same path as the United States.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  We saw, of course, in the last election, the Brexit party made unbelievable gains.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  They were able to acquiesce, to let the Tories, the Conservatives, win.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  And now we finally have a freer Great Britain.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  When we come back, I'm going to unveil the deal of the day.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's, of course, the 12 days of Christmas at infowarstore.com.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  If you're watching the Alex Jones show, I'm Tom Papperton. We'll be back right after this short break.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  Dan Pilla dot com, that's Dan Pilla dot com, Dan Pilla dot com.
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  You don't know me and will never meet.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you have a problem,
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  if you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  and totally change your life.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  Get clean.
[17:42.000 --> 17:52.000]  Call now and learn more, 800-506-6740-800-506-6740.
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  That's 800-506-6740.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  Driving into the operations center this morning, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  I need to reach directly out of the audience and just spell out the facts.
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  When you spend your money at places like Dick's Sporting Goods, you're financing a group
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  that gives huge amounts of money to gun control disarming you and your family.
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  Then when you go down the list and look at these companies like Walmart,
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  did you know they're doing the same thing now?
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  Did you know that almost every big box store, including Target, they're the worst,
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  are actually funding the transgender movement targeting children?
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  Do you know what Jeff Bezos and Amazon's up to?
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it'll make your head spin.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  Why in the hell are we supporting these people?
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  Why are you going to buy your Christmas presents for your family from these institutions
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  that hate America and hate your guts?
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  Do your shopping at inforwarstore.com and get great products.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  And then rest assured, you're funding the resistance.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  You're funding the voice of liberty and the face of tyranny.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  Please shop at inforwarstore.com.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your products.
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds.
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.000]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know,
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  And you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  We're really proud of turbo force.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  So thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at inforwarstore.com.
[19:55.000 --> 20:02.000]  Then help us spread the word and let's just get busy in forestore.com.
[20:02.000 --> 20:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:15.000 --> 20:20.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.000 --> 20:32.000]  I am Tom Papert, editor-in-chief for National Cloud, filling in for Alex today as he's off on a very important mission.
[20:32.000 --> 20:38.000]  We're going to continue up on the coverage of the devastating blow to the globalists that occurred yesterday
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  in the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson's massive victory.
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  The biggest since Margaret Thatcher labor in a stunning defeat,
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  losing some strongholds they've held for nearly 70 years.
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  Tell me if this sounds familiar.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  This is by Paul Joseph Watson at infowars.com.
[20:58.000 --> 21:05.000]  Leftists plan to protest against democracy after conservatives win the UK election.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  They're saying, not my prime minister, resist racist Johnson.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  It's almost like these leftists, they just hate all freedom.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  They hate all democracy.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  They hate all representative government worldwide.
[21:19.000 --> 21:26.000]  So long as they don't get their way, they're going to cry and bitch and moan like the spoiled children they are.
[21:26.000 --> 21:33.000]  The leftist labor supporters immediately announced plans to protest the results of a democratic election once again,
[21:33.000 --> 21:41.000]  writes Paul Joseph Watson infowars.com, after the conservatives swept to a crushing victory in last night's UK election.
[21:41.000 --> 21:48.000]  Boris Johnson's Tories crushed labor led by Jeremy Corbyn in a decisive repudiation of hard left policies
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  and a reassertion of the 2016 Brexit vote.
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  By the way, folks, if you ever think things move slowly here in the United States,
[21:57.000 --> 22:05.000]  keep in mind that the British people voted for Brexit before we put Trump into office.
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  Many people consider it to be the prelude to President Trump's victory,
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  the massive vote for Brexit that saw the people of Great Britain,
[22:15.000 --> 22:23.000]  the people of the actual country vote to leave the fascistic communist union known as the European Union.
[22:23.000 --> 22:30.000]  Going on, many labor supporters reacted with the usual flood of outright hysteria and emotional meltdowns,
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  but some vowed to protest the result.
[22:34.000 --> 22:43.000]  An event hosted by Stand Up to Racism will see protesters gather at Downing Street today at 5 p.m. British time
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  for a not my prime minister rally.
[22:48.000 --> 22:55.000]  I can't wait to see the British version of the leftist hysterics here in the United States.
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  Maybe they'll get one screaming at the sky. No!
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  That would certainly be interesting and very familiar.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  In other words, just like every other time in recent years,
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  notes Paul, instead of taking their defeat gracefully and using it to facilitate a moment of reflection,
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  the left are just going to continue their prolonged hissy fit.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  Of course, there's another group holding a demonstration in Glasgow, Scotland,
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.000]  who they claim is not fit to represent a multicultural society.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  It's a multiculturalism grand.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  I mean, that's kind of what the Brexit vote was about,
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  control immigration, control who was coming into the country.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  This is part of the problem with socialized healthcare as well.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  So they have this socialized healthcare system, but then they have something called healthcare tourism,
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  where if you are from Iraq or Afghanistan or anywhere,
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  and you go to the United Kingdom and you say have stage two cancer,
[23:51.000 --> 23:57.000]  well, the British healthcare system, the NHS, the socialized medicine of the Brits,
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  they are obliged to help you.
[24:01.000 --> 24:08.000]  So you can set foot on British soil and immediately get hundreds of thousands of pounds in healthcare,
[24:08.000 --> 24:17.000]  provided to you at the leisure, provided to you at the cost of the British taxpayers.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  Certainly wonder these people voted for Brexit.
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  Going on, the fact they're literally protesting against the outcome of a democratic election,
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  again underscores how the left has been taken over by an ugly authoritarian mob.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  And I would add to what Paul wrote, an authoritarian mob of children,
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  of which maybe in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, but children nonetheless.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  Meanwhile, analysts are pointing out the last night's result is yet another indication
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  that the populist wave which swept Europe, and I would add the globe in 2016,
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  is not stopping any time soon.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  Now we'll be down to people like Farage and the Brexit Party to ensure the conservatives
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  follow through on their mandate and get Brexit done.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  And as I said in the last segment, many people are crediting the Brexit Party.
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  That is of course the brand new political party started by Nigel Farage for making this happen.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  There are a large number of people who would never vote for Labour,
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  but they would also never vote for the conservatives.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  Conservatives, of course, turned a blind eye to massive pedophilia scandals.
[25:29.000 --> 25:36.000]  They had the disgusting and useless Theresa May who sat on Brexit for years and did nothing,
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.000]  but bow to the demands of the European Union.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  So most folks, a lot of folks, were fed up with them.
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  So if they wouldn't vote for the conservatives out right, many saw the Brexit Party
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  as a happy alternative. These could be liberals, or at least classical liberals,
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  who wanted to see Brexit done, but could not see themselves voting for conservatives.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  So again, Brexit Party Nigel Farage is being credited greatly.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  Now this is another fun one by Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  Left-wing newspaper advises people, quote,
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  how to leave the United Kingdom after election loss.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  Remember, here in the United States, it was Canada.
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  They were all going to go to Canada.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  I don't think many people have actually left for Canada just yet.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  I could be wrong.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Let's see where they're going to go in the UK.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  Boris Johnson's Conservative Party swept to victory over Labour,
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  ran hard, left manifesto under their leader Corbyn.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  Shortly after the results of an exit poll were made public
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  showing the conservatives would win a large majority,
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  some leftists on Twitter began threatening to leave the country.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  The Independent Article asserted that some people of color
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  were considering leaving the UK if the Tories retained power, quote.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  Other than just packing possessions, kissing loved ones goodbye,
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  and boarding international transport,
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  how do you actually leave the country, asked the piece,
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  before giving advice on how people need to settle their tax affairs
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  before they move abroad?
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  I really don't think anybody's going to be leaving the United Kingdom,
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  especially not now, as it is once again on the path to prosperity.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  So in the next segment, we're going to have another message
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  from Alex Jones himself.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  Before we do that, I want to make the big reveal.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  Infowars.infowarstore.com is of course doing the 12 days of Christmas
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  with a new sale each and every day.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  And today, it is none other than Ultra 12,
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  which is a fantastic product that is right now
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  at an unbelievable price.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  This deal may be the best I've ever seen this specific product at.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  In fact, all of the deals that are on the 12 days of Christmas sale
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  right now, I don't think I've ever seen these prices before.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  These sales cannot last forever.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  And folks, you know you've got to do Christmas shopping.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  You know you've got to buy things for your loved ones.
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  Why waste your money with the establishment stores,
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  the Dix Sporting Goods, the Cabela's,
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  all of these terrible, terrible companies?
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  Why waste your money with them?
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  When you can get Ultra 12 at Infowarsstore.com,
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  when you can get Brainforce Plus at Infowarsstore.com,
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  Super Blue Singles and Super Blue Combo Packs 30% off,

[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  and of course, yes, Ultra 12, 60% off.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  These deals are going away soon.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  It is a fantastic way to say Merry Christmas to your loved ones
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  that you support the Infowar.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  This fight would not be possible without you,
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  the viewer, and the listener.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  So please, Infowarsstore.com, support this fight.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  When we come back, we'll have a short message from Alex Jones.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  Stay tuned.
[28:55.000 --> 29:09.000]  You're watching The Alex Jones Show.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  For real estate.com.
[29:56.000 --> 30:02.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code,
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.000]  genetically mutating us, poisoning us,
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  We're being taken off the land.
[30:22.000 --> 30:28.000]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God,
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems
[30:41.000 --> 30:46.000]  that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[30:46.000 --> 30:50.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  This is the post-human error.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  This is the crossroads.
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better,
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  and that's taking care of our individual health.
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season
[31:14.000 --> 31:21.000]  than to go to M4warstore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life changing
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  in what they will do for you and your family's body,
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  your outlook on life, your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  But then of course it also funds the M4war that is so incredibly critical.
[31:32.000 --> 31:37.000]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores
[31:40.000 --> 31:46.000]  and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings
[31:49.000 --> 31:54.000]  and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at M4warstore.com.
[31:54.000 --> 32:23.000]  That's M4warstore.com. Please make the right decision.
[32:24.000 --> 32:29.000]  And every day to find the new deals, secure a bottle of the good halogen,
[32:29.000 --> 32:36.000]  X3 at cost at $29.95 and get a free bottle of Biotru Selenium.

[32:55.000 --> 33:01.000]  at M4warstore.com and support the M4.
[33:01.000 --> 33:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:22.000 --> 33:31.000]  The world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  We live in this system where everybody likes to be a victim and whine and bitch
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  and complain all day and beg for help.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  Well, I'm not begging for help.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  If you don't fund the M4war, the globalists are going to be able to shut it down.
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  Now, I've got plans and I've got operations I can't reveal here on air,
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  but despite all the deplatforming and all the other attacks that I won't go into,
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  they're going to fail keeping us from having a platform to get the truth out.
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  I've got a whole bunch of irons in the fire,
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  but I don't have the resources to keep this on the air through the election
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  and then launch other lives.
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  It's like a video game where you have your lives and I'm down to one life.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  One of that getting more lives is for you to buy the product.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  So I was walking through the studio on Thursday night and I was looking at the lights off in here.
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.000]  This is what they want to do.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  They want to turn the lights off in here because they don't want me to be able to get up here
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  and do a big PowerPoint next week I'm planning from mainline science reports about vaccines
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  causing brain damage and infertility by design just like a fluoride.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  It's all on purpose.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  They don't want that because we've defeated their operations so many other times.
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  So it's simple.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  We have the 12 days of Christmas going and every day we add another thing that's on sale.
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  Well, right now we've got a big list of things that are on sale
[35:04.000 --> 35:12.000]  and the big one today and yesterday is going to be bodies ultimate turmeric formula.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  It's got a 95% curcuminoid.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  Nobody else has that that we know of.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  I mean there may be some other brand that does it and we don't know that.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  And the industry 5% is the average.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  Our lady body goes above 80%.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  We've got a 95% curcuminoid.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  That's what's good in the turmeric.
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  It's so good.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  It does so many great things.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  It's 60% off right now.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  It's very, very close to cost but we're selling everything out towards the end of the year
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  so that we have money to operate in the next year.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  This is so critical plus everybody needs it.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  So get it for yourself.
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  Get it for a gift.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  Now that was yesterday special.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  It's continuing on today because I'm shooting this on Thursday
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  but today will be tomorrow Friday.
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  It's Ultra 12, which is the same super high quality, best organic B12.
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  You're going to find out there that we had in secret 12.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  It's just when you change the formula, you have to change the name.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  So it's Ultra 12, the strongest, best you're going to find out there.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  Take it out of the tongue.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  I don't have time to go and everything that good B12 does.
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  But especially northern Europeans cannot absorb it normally through the stomach.
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  Have all sorts of genetic problems that are triggered by it.
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  But if you're black or you're Chinese and it's still B12, it's so great for everybody.
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.000]  This is the best you're going to find.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  But especially northern Europeans, give it a try.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  It'll blow you away.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  It's totally natural.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  It's totally pure.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  Ultra 12 is 60% off right now.
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  Free shipping store-wide, double-patriot points, M4store.com.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  We've got the BioPCA.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  It's very, very popular.
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  There's such a high quality version of that that's good for your nail, your hair, your skin, everything.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  That's a big special.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  We've got a toothpaste combo with both types of our toothpaste.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  We're 50% off and a lot more at M4store.com.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  But again, it's you supporting the M4 War that funds the operation that makes all of this possible.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  And these are great products.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  So just do your Christmas shopping with us.
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.000]  And we defeat the globalist and can launch all these operations and kick butt.
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.000]  You notice we've upped our game massively with only 300-something days left after the election.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  We are fighting hard as an example to everybody.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  We are doing this together.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  So thank you so much.
[37:19.000 --> 37:25.000]  Back to the live broadcast with Tom Papert, Savannah Hernandez, and the rest of the crew on this Friday edition.
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  And then I'll be back this Saturday and Sunday with live and special reports.
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  Taking care of some very serious things right now that we're having to deal with.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  But I'll be back on Air Lord willing.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  So thank you all again for your prayers, which is paramount.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  And thank you for remembering M4store.com.
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  I'm Tom Papert filling in for Alex.
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  We are only 325 days out from the election.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  It is coming and coming fast.
[37:57.000 --> 38:03.000]  My guest for this segment and the next is Patrick Halley's the senior reporter at nationalfile.com.
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.000]  That's my website.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  He also writes for the epic times.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  He's formerly at Breitbart, formerly at Daily Caller.
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.000]  And Patrick was one of the first people when everybody, myself included, was totally discounting the IG Horowitz report.
[38:16.000 --> 38:25.000]  Patrick was breaking it down sentence by sentence word by word, finding all of the inconsistencies between what was reported by the mainstream media
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  and what was actually found in the report.
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.000]  Also finding all of the, let's just say, questionable behavior from the FBI
[38:34.000 --> 38:41.000]  when it comes to the spying on Trump that they claim wasn't spying somehow using a trick of language, I guess.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  So Patrick, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  It's great to be on the Alex Jones show.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  My favorite.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  My favorite show.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  Well, it's phenomenal to have you here.
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.000]  So Patrick, I've got a giant stack of news here with everything that is coming out with this IG report as well as impeachment.
[38:57.000 --> 39:06.000]  But I just want to start by having you explain to us some, what is the biggest bombshell to come from the IG report in your opinion?
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  Well, I think it's clear that even the IG had meant that Obama was pretty centrally involved with this.
[39:11.000 --> 39:20.000]  You have McCabe basically throwing them under the bus and said that the reason that he believed the steel election reported needed to be included
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  is because President Obama had, quote, requested everything you have relevant to this topic.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  We have Obama getting briefed in the Situation Room by Comey.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  We have Obama getting briefed in July 2016.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  We have, you know, Obama's fingerprints all over this in addition to John McCain.
[39:38.000 --> 39:46.000]  In addition to a lot of these deep state fakers, these people, I mean, James Comey is totally disgraced in this.
[39:46.000 --> 39:54.000]  So, you know, this is something that I think confirms a lot of what we've been saying for years, thus proving that we're not the conspiracy theorists.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  The fake news actually is the conspiracy theorists.
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  That's right.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  We've been totally vindicated here on the Alex Jones show and Info Wars as a whole.
[40:02.000 --> 40:11.000]  And the conservatives as a whole have been vindicated for what we've all said over the last several years now that this likely goes all the way up to the top
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  of the executive branch of government during the Obama administration.
[40:14.000 --> 40:21.000]  But Patrick, one of the things that is very frustrating for a lot of folks, a lot of listeners and viewers, I'm sure it is.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  If it's as infuriating for them as it is for me, I would not be surprised.
[40:27.000 --> 40:36.000]  We had, for example, Comey come out right after the report dropped, but before Horowitz testified before Congress, before the Senate,
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  we had Comey saying that he, in fact, has been vindicated.
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.000]  So what is your message to James Comey, the Jolly Green Giant?
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  Well, James Comey is the Jolly Green Giant.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  He has definitely not been vindicated.
[40:52.000 --> 41:01.000]  And in fact, if you look at page 178 of the IG report, you have one of the most ridiculous emails ever in which James Comey actually tells Peter Strock
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  that even though he can't verify the Steele dossier, he's still going to go with it because it has, quote,
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  salacious material about the president-elect.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  Yet he says we could not vouch for the material.
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  So it's proof.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  I mean, this guy was putting it in email.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  That's how brazen these people were.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  They're deep state fakers.
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.000]  Conservative media isn't going to hold these people accountable because they're fundamentally on the same side.
[41:23.000 --> 41:29.000]  Because John McCain and Lindsey Graham, that little box puppet, were integrally involved in this.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  So both parties are complicit in this.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  The entire swamp is complicit in this.
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.000]  And until we actually have reform and these people are prosecuted and put away, then we're going to continue to be the slaves of the deep state
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  because we are ruled by unelected bureaucrats and these conservative ink morons.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  These just complete quizlings who are out there pretending to be FISA experts.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  They are the biggest losers.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  They need to go away.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  Everyone hates them.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  They're doing nothing for this country.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  Patrick, we're getting ready to go to break.
[42:03.000 --> 42:13.000]  When we come back, I want to discuss the possible ramifications for the deep state, this intelligence community, the modern secret society.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  Because that, I think, is a big fear of conservatives, that this is all going to be brushed off.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  They're going to get away scot-free.
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  Of course, we have Durham in the Attorney General's office, the DOJ, who is looking into this.
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  He's looking at reportedly possible criminal prosecution.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  I think at the very least, these people should be fired en masse.
[42:33.000 --> 42:40.000]  It makes no sense to have these people continuing to quote unquote serve the people of the United States of America.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  Patrick Howley is my guest. He's senior reporter at National File.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Also a writer for The Epic Times.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  He will be back with us in the next segment.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  I'm Tom Papert, filling in for Alex Jones.
[42:52.000 --> 43:21.000]  You are watching The Alex Jones Show.
[43:22.000 --> 43:37.000]  We're also coming out of the gates with specials we've never had before.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  The Christmas Mega Pack is at cost at $99.95.
[43:41.000 --> 43:51.000]  Get two bottles of knockout, two bottles of Brain Force Plus, one box of Turbo Force, one bottle of Ultimate Crill Oil, and one bottle of Survival Shield X3 at cost.
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.000]  Again, find this amazing special and over 100 others at M4store.com and support the M4.
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[44:01.000 --> 44:11.000]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy,
[44:11.000 --> 44:18.000]  and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[44:18.000 --> 44:29.000]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God.
[44:35.000 --> 44:44.000]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[44:44.000 --> 44:51.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error.
[44:51.000 --> 44:59.000]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  Andy in Florida. Thank you, Andy. Go ahead.
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  Hey, Alex. I love you, man. We love you.
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I've got to talk about one of your products.
[45:08.000 --> 45:14.000]  A little bit about me. I'm 245 pounds. I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.000]  I used to have a problem with Adderall. I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.000]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand and, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[45:25.000 --> 45:31.000]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche. This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.000]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall, and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[45:38.000 --> 45:45.000]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day, and you save so much money versus, you know, a monster, which is what, 499.
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is. And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  We're really proud of turbo force, so thank you, sir. Commit to buy a lot of your products at M4store.com.
[45:55.000 --> 46:02.000]  Then help us spread the word. Let's just get busy. M4store.com.

[46:13.000 --> 46:21.000]  And then research all the other things that are in Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus and what they will do for you and your family.
[46:21.000 --> 46:30.000]  This Christmas, for those of you on the fence who've never tried these products, I am selling both of the formulas at 65% off,
[46:30.000 --> 46:36.000]  the lowest price ever, with a free bottle of Biotru Selenium with it from the mustard seed.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, research what this does in your body, then experience it for yourself.
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  If you want to go to the next level, I'd say it funds the info award for losing money on this.
[46:46.000 --> 46:52.000]  This is my gift to you this Christmas, so you experience it for yourself like the other products.
[46:52.000 --> 47:20.000]  M4store.com. That's M4store.com. Please take action.
[47:23.000 --> 47:32.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:32.000 --> 47:56.000]  Mr. Crowley.
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.000]  You, sir. You, sir. There's enough confidence to try to make a drug deal.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  I swear, with hundreds of police officers around, who do you need me to go to the next level?
[48:08.000 --> 48:34.000]  That is, of course, Owen Schreuer, who spent yesterday outside the New York Times in New York City, bullhorning them for their fake news
[48:34.000 --> 48:50.000]  in New York City.
[48:50.000 --> 49:10.000]  We're discussing both impeachment and the IG report, so Patrick, I want to know, because you have been following the deep state for most of your adult life at this point.
[49:10.000 --> 49:26.000]  You're a very accomplished reporter. I cannot thank you enough for all of the great reports you've done. What do you expect, if anything, to happen in the way of reprisal for these people who have been implicated by Horowitz?
[49:26.000 --> 49:48.000]  Well, that's up to Attorney Durham. We'll see what Attorney Durham comes up with. In the meantime, we have a situation where the Democrats are now probably going to impeach. They seem committed to impeachment. We have a situation where you have Juliana Glover, the establishment Republican consultant, urging Republicans led by McConnell to take a secret ballot in the Senate so they can disguise their names from the public and remove Trump from office.
[49:48.000 --> 50:00.000]  And what we have to understand here is that the Republican Party is a quizzling party. Lindsey Graham refuses to call any witnesses. He refuses to call Hunter Biden. These people have subpoena power. They are not using the subpoena power.
[50:00.000 --> 50:14.000]  I mean, it is a joke. And they have these conservative media minstrels, these morons, these fat boomer losers who are sitting around on, you know, the internet trying to convince people that they're actually doing something while the country burns.
[50:14.000 --> 50:33.000]  I cannot agree more with that sentiment. So Patrick, you have also done some unbelievable reporting on Hunter Biden. You were the first one to get the papers from his divorce where he is allegedly ducking process servers who are trying to find him so they can serve him with more papers.
[50:33.000 --> 50:49.000]  We now know that his financial statements, including the money he made at Barisma Energy's may be subpoenaed as part of this messy divorce. He's in the midst of you also have compared him in a way to Paul Pelosi, Jr.
[50:49.000 --> 51:03.000]  That is, of course, the son of Nancy Pelosi, who seems to be another one of these black sheep children that uses their parents' name to enrich themselves to the tune of millions. You interviewed, of course, Karina Fang, the ex-girlfriend of Paul Pelosi, Jr.
[51:03.000 --> 51:22.000]  Last month, but I'm sure you've been following the escapades of Hunter Biden, who recently has been on an alleged crack and sex binge. Words that I do not believe we can repeat on air. This is a family show.
[51:22.000 --> 51:36.000]  But what do you think of the Republicans? I almost wonder if they didn't get a bit of courage by seeing Owen Shroyer storm the impeachment hearing earlier this week and call Jerry Nadler a liar.
[51:36.000 --> 51:45.000]  What do you make of this recent turn of events in Hunter Biden's life and how it may play out on the impeachment front?
[51:45.000 --> 51:56.000]  Well, Hunter Biden's ex-wife is trying to find him to drag him back into court, but he is evading being served because he's violated his divorce agreement a number of times.
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  Kathleen Biden says she threw him out. He was spending his money in strip clubs. He was spending his money on drugs and not going to the family.
[52:03.000 --> 52:20.000]  Meanwhile, you have Paul Pelosi, Jr. The FBI is investigating him, as I reported, because he is engaging in very shady business deals. I spoke to his longtime companion who said that he represents himself as the office of Nancy Pelosi when he does foreign business deals.
[52:20.000 --> 52:33.000]  This is a bad guy. These are bad people. And the Republicans aren't going to hold these people accountable because many of the Republicans are bad people, too. They're part of the system. And unless people just call out the nonsense, I mean,
[52:33.000 --> 52:52.000]  Fox News is just leading people around and thinking that there's some kind of opposition to the totalitarianism that's crushing this country. It's sad. It's pathetic what they're doing to people. It's not right. They're giving people a false sense of hope when what's really going on is the Republicans are complicit in the destruction of our country.
[52:52.000 --> 53:08.000]  Well, that's something that you brought up in the last segment. And I think it is ultimately very, very important that Lindsey Graham was implicated in all of these flies of fiascos. And now, of course, he's positioned himself as essentially a Fox News primetime host
[53:08.000 --> 53:23.000]  taking over for Sean Hannity most nights. He is a trying to position himself as a favorite among the GOP. I wouldn't be surprised if he runs for president again in 2024. And he seems to be linking himself as closely as possible to Trump. But at the same time,
[53:23.000 --> 53:41.000]  Lindsey Graham is saying that we're not going to call Hunter Biden to testify in the Senate. We're not going to call the whistleblower to testify in the Senate. We're not going to call Adam Shifty Schiff to testify in the Senate. What is going on with Senate Republicans?
[53:41.000 --> 53:55.000]  Well, Lindsey Graham's a quizzling. Lindsey Graham has never been on our side. He's been trying to water down the Trump agenda the whole time with an amnesty bill with a push for red flag gun laws to confiscate people's guns. He is very much of the swamp. He's still McCain's best buddy.
[53:55.000 --> 54:14.000]  McCain's very good friend, shall we say. And it's sad. So Fox News has him on in that funny comedy show they do at 9 o'clock. And he's the Fox hero. And so conservative people who are programmed by that Fox programming think, oh, wow, he's on our side.
[54:14.000 --> 54:27.000]  And so that psychic hold that the phone network has on people is powerful. But the fact of the matter is the country is being destroyed in real time. And it's not people like Alex Jones, people like us. The country is just beginning to crush right now.
[54:27.000 --> 54:42.000]  And so this last guard of conservatives, conservatives been around since what the early 60s, they ever accomplished anything. They can't conserve female restrooms. They can't conserve little girls being able to go to the bathroom by themselves without having adult men go into the bathroom with them.
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  They can't conserve anything. I'm tired of listening to these people. Done with them.
[54:46.000 --> 54:58.000]  So what is the solution to all this in the couple minutes we have left? Do we need to send 1000 Donald Trump's office, obviously going to info wars store dot com and helping to find the info war is a big way to push back.
[54:58.000 --> 55:10.000]  But how do we get a real political victory? We thought we had it when President Trump went to office, but we've seen the deep state sabotage him every step of the way. So what is the next step the American people need to take?
[55:10.000 --> 55:21.000]  We can't rely on anyone hero. I think hopefully this impeachment thing is going to create a massive radical backlash among patriotic people to stand up to what's going on. That's the only way that's going to affect change.
[55:21.000 --> 55:32.000]  We can't rely on people. I hope attorney Durham prosecute some people, even if he does, even if James Comey gets indicted. Is that going to save the country single-handedly? There's not going to be any hero to come along.
[55:32.000 --> 55:43.000]  None of these people who pop up on the split screen on the Fox comedy network are going to save the day. Okay, it's going to take people out in the streets. It's going to take what Alex Jones is doing. It's going to take what our community, our people are doing.
[55:43.000 --> 55:59.000]  That's what's going to save the day. Patrick Halley, senior reporter for National File contributor at Epic Times, formerly Breitbart, formerly Daily Caller. Nobody has a more impressive resume than you. Patrick, where can people find you on social media? Where can people follow you?
[55:59.000 --> 56:15.000]  I appreciate it. Go ahead and follow me on Twitter, Howly Reporter, H-O-W-L-E-Y Reporter, Howly Reporter.

[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  Patrick Halley, thanks again for coming on, brother. I hope you come back on real soon.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  Thank you. Thank you, sir.
[56:21.000 --> 56:38.000]  In the next segment, we're going to have another National File. He's actually the foreign correspondent in the United Kingdom. He's going to continue breaking down the relevance, the seriousness of the massive conservative victory that happened yesterday with Boris Johnson's
[56:38.000 --> 56:51.000]  conservative's reigning supreme in the UK. That's going to be coming up in the next hour on the Alex Jones show. We're also going to try to get some video of Owen Troyer. He's at it again, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:51.000 --> 57:10.000]  He was already a superstar. He was already a superstar and he has been for a very long time, but he's going to the next level this week. He's going from a superstar to a megastar, a household name. Everybody saw him in D.C. Everybody saw him in New York, so we'll try to check in with Owen.
[57:10.000 --> 57:19.000]  There he is. We'll come back with him for the first five minutes of the next hour. Of course, you're watching the Alex Jones, so I just want to remind you in these last couple seconds we have left.
[57:19.000 --> 57:30.000]  It's the 12 days of Christmas. These are products that you need. You need to do your Christmas shopping. Don't give your money to the globalist Jeff Bezos, who hates you, who wants to see your country be destroyed.

[58:00.000 --> 58:13.000]  Now, in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis, and then it just gets wilder from there.
[58:13.000 --> 58:25.000]  Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone. We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill.

[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  This is Owen Schreuer from info wars.com. I'm in the info wars battle truck bullhorning in downtown DC as the Democrats are voting to illegally impeach the president of the United States.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  So we're letting the American people in DC know about the sedition and the treason that the Democrats are engaged in.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Why is the Democrat Party attempting to illegally remove the president of the United States? Why is the Democrat Party engaged in open sedition? Why is the Democrat Party lying every day about the president?
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  Why do the Democrats want to see the economy collapse? Why do the Democrats want to see the border collapse?
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Why is Adam Schiff hanging out with Ed Buck? Why is Adam Schiff requesting nude photos of Donald Trump from Ukraine?
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  How did Nancy Pelosi make hundreds of millions of dollars as a congresswoman? How did you make your millions Nancy? We must investigate.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Why does Jerry Nadler look like an Oopa Loopa? He must be sent back to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory immediately.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Send Jerry Nadler back to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Jerry Nadler's Oopa Loopa friends are missing him.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Now was of course Owen Schreuer. He's back in DC. He was in New York yesterday. Now he's back in DC today all week.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Owen has been making headlines. I could not be more proud to have met this man. I could not be more proud to be here.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Where of course Owen got his start. Such a phenomenal patriot. Could not be better. Let's go see what Will Johnson did yesterday. Will Johnson of course confronted one Gerald Nadler.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  I prefer to call him the penguin. Let's go ahead and roll that video.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Nadler, how do you think the voters are going to look at this? How do you think the voters are going to look at this in the future?
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  2020 Nadler. Keep doing it because the American people see through it. It's going to work in President Trump's favor. Keep it up.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  He's your president and he will be in 2020. Thank you Nadler. You will be exposed for your treason.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  That was of course Will Johnson confronting the Oopa Loopa himself. Jerry Nadler. I prefer to think of him as penguin from of course the Batman universe.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  They couldn't be any more alike. Will Johnson confronted Nadler yesterday and Will didn't get arrested.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  I don't quite understand that one. I thought that the highest crime in the land is confronting the three foot two inch tall Jerry Nadler.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  When we come back I'll have Jack Hadfield. He is the UK correspondent for nationalfile.com. He's got a new article up talking about the devastating defeat for the British leftists.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Looking forward to having Jack on his debut appearance on the Alex Jones show. It's going to be a jam packed second and third hour.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Third hour we have Andrew Tate back in studio. He'll be guest hosting the fourth hour as well. You were watching the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  I'm Tom Papert filling in and folks I cannot stress it enough. Go make your Christmas purchases infowarstore.com.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  We need your help and you need these products their life changing. Stick with us. We'll be right back after this very very short break.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically. You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  Your bang for your buck fear gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy which God wants to see. We have to make the effort 110% God will finish the move.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalist.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  And just believe me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  You've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  We're in this together in four store.com. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I am Tom Pepper filling in for Alex today.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  And maybe back in studio in the third or fourth hour. So stay tuned and find out more about where Alex has been and what he's going to talk about later today.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  My guest for this segment and the next is National File UK correspondent Jack Hadfield. He's a phenomenal writer. He's been seen at Breitbart and a variety of other websites.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Now he writes for National File. Jack is of course from the UK. And he has been very excited, I think is fair to say about the recent victory.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  Jack, welcome to the Alex Jones show. Hello. Great to be on. Well, thank you for coming on. So we this seems to be a seminal moment for the UK.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  First, we had 2016, the Brexit vote where the public, the voters, the men and women of Great Britain voted to leave the cancerous European Union.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Now, of course, this is kind of a referendum because if we had Corbyn win, then he would have actually put it to a second vote and who knows what would have happened.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  But the British people spoke again. Talk a little bit about the importance of this election.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Yes, well, absolutely. It's been called the Brexit election by many commentators and pundits.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Really, the first Brexit election was the one in 2017, which Theresa May, the then prime minister, was trying to get a majority of her own to legitimate herself as she was only elected by members of parliament and not by any members of the Conservative Party or members of the public.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  So she felt like she had to be elected herself to gain a mandate to push forward her Brexit deal through. Unfortunately, it really didn't go as well as she expected.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, made it about everything other than Brexit and the NHS, the National Health Service, crime, immigration, any other thing. And so that ended up with her losing the majority.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  And for the last two and a half years or so, we've had dither and dather and delay and Brexit's been stopped and thwarted at every single opportunity.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  But when Boris Johnson, the now prime minister, was a Conservative Party and took over in June, July of this year, he actually managed to get a new Brexit deal with the European Union and something that many commentators and pundits thought was absolutely impossible.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  He managed to get rid of the backstop, the Northern Irish backstop, which was the sticking point for many who didn't like Mrs May's deal. And so he actually did manage to make this election actually about Brexit.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  That is what the, even though Corbyn tried his best again to make it about anything other than that, this time he failed. This has been the worst election for Labour since 1935. They're down to 203 seats, down 59 from the 2017 election.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  This has been the best win for the Conservatives since 1983, 1987 or so. So since the Thatcher years, this really was the most seminal election and the most changing election, the election that actually mattered since 1997 when Blair came in,
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  2010, 2015, you know, it was just kind of a, you know, there was no real change. But now, you know, this is serious. You know, we have actually won an incredible victory and we will be able to push through the results of the 2016 referendum, which was the largest democratic mandate in British history.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  And Boris now has a 80 seat majority to be able to push through pretty much everything he wants in the British system, as opposed to the Americans. If you have a majority in Parliament, so that's equivalent to the House of Representatives and House of Commons.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Pretty much nobody can stop you. That's it. Nobody can stop him unless there's some freak court decision that tries to stop Brexit. Brexit is going through on the 31st of January, 2020, and there's nothing that lefties or remainers can do about it.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Fantastic. So one of the other massive moments, and we saw something similar where the former Prime Minister stepped down. And of course, we saw Theresa May, the Gremlin take over. We've now seen Jeremy Corbyn step down from his leadership at the Labour Party.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Now, this guy, I mean, I don't think you can under or overstate, rather, exactly how terrible this guy would have been. He wants to nationalize various industries. He wants to dump money into multiculturalism. He's worse than Bernie Sanders, to put it mildly.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Talk to us about the significance of him stepping down.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Yes, well, Corbyn took the leadership of the Labour Party after the 2015 election, where Ed Miliband, who was sort of a soft left centrist, stepped down and he was actually put forward by MPs, by Labour MPs, because they wanted a wide variety of voices.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  You know, nobody thought he would win. But actually, there was a groundswell of people joining the Labour Party from the hard left, and also from conservatives who realized that, oh, if we get Corbyn into power, then we'll be able to condemn the Labour Party to electoral oblivion, I think was the phrase.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  So he won. He fought off a leadership challenge in 2016. And yeah, finally, after all this time, he's now stepping down. Now, if he had won, if he had become Prime Minister, which was, he wouldn't have won an overall majority.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  There was no way that's possible. But with the Scottish National Party, they took 45, 46 out of the 59 seats in Scotland in this election. If Labour had done well enough to then add that and create the magic number of 326 that you need for a majority, he could have been propped up by them, which means we would have had another referendum on Europe, another referendum on Scottish independence.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  We would have had, well, a Prime Minister, who the security services say was basically a useful idiot for the Soviet Hungarian intelligence back in the 1970s and 80s.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Somebody who was linked to the IRA, the Irish public in terrorist movement, linked to anti-Semitic people like the PLO, Palestinians, and well, just overall, it would have been an absolute disaster.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  I mean, I was thinking that I might even have to flee the country if he got in. And I'm saying that only semi-unironically, it was genuine. I was actually thinking about, I might have a knock on my door by one of his commissars for thought crimes.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  So yes, I'm very, very glad that he didn't get in. I think a large majority of the British population are also very, very glad that Boris won.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  You know, I want to say it's unbelievable that somebody like that could even be that close to the reins of power.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  But here in the United States, we, of course, have Bernie Sanders polling just behind Joe Biden.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  So it does seem like we may see, it seems to be this twin popular socialist revolution happening throughout the country.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  So just quickly, give us again the hard date for Brexit and what folks are most looking forward to when it finally comes.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  Well, the hard date for Brexit will be the 31st of January, 2020, and that will lead us into what is supposed to be a transition period.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Because that's the end of 2020. So at the end of January, we will be legally outside the EU, but remain in many of its institutions, says will be a fluid, smooth transition to Boris's free trade arrangement,
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  something that he will now have the power and the mandate to negotiate.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  He will be able to, thankfully, move away from what Mrs May would have negotiated in the future agreement if she had remained as Prime Minister,
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  which would have been closely aligned to the EU and something that really would have been, you know, like the rhinos in America, you know, well, a bino, a Brexit in name only.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  So Boris has suggested that he's going for a Canada style free trade arrangements, which is why Nigel Farage of the Brexit Party stood down candidates in all of the seats that the Conservatives won in 2017.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Because not because the withdrawal deal is that different apart from some of the crucial things like the backstop, as I mentioned earlier, but because the deal that Boris will negotiate now will be far more like Brexit than May ever could do.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  Jack, we're getting ready to come to break. When we come back, I want you to expand on this because a lot of folks are confused about the differences between Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and Theresa Mays.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  He's getting some bad press here in the United States, and I imagine in the UK as well. But you say that Nigel Farage had candidates stand down to ensure a Conservative victory.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Of course, I believe Sky News is crediting Nigel Farage's Brexit Party for helping to push the Conservatives over the edge by siphoning votes away from Labour.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  It's a very fascinating situation. We need to learn more about this. It's the populist movement worldwide exploding everywhere. You're watching The Alex Jones Show. I'm Tom Papper. We'll be back after this break.

[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  Today, the US had to save the Empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I am Tom Papert filling in for Alex. My guest is Jack Hadfield.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  We have a press conference with Boris Johnson explaining the significance of his massive victory. Let's go to that now.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  This election means that getting Brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  And with this election, I think we put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  That's British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claiming a huge victory, his Conservative Party won.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  OK, well, most of Theresa May's deal was basically fine. It was kind of, it was carrying on things that, oh yes, you know, let's of course keep cooperating, you know, with criminal investigations across the border.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  And oh, you know, let's keep doing scientific research and things like that.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  Most of it was very technical, you know, just stuff that was very obvious and that pretty much just had to be sorted out in terms of the bureaucratic end.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  The main sticking point for May's deal and the one that certainly got the most media attention was the so-called Nornairish backstop.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Now, the problem is with Northern Ireland, as compared to the Republic of Ireland in the South, they wanted to stop a so-called hard border, in which case there would be no border checks.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  They wanted to maintain ease of travel across the border, as was sort of said in the Good Friday agreement in 1997, 1999, somewhere around those years, which put an end to the troubles
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  and stopped the main threat of Irish Republican terrorism in the North.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  And in that, they had the common travel area where, again, it would be easy to move across.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  So basically, the backstop would keep Northern Ireland within the EU's customs union.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  It would be removed from the customs territory of the UK and put into that of the EU in order to keep goods and services flowing across the island of Ireland.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  However, that would mean customs checks in the Irish Sea and basically that would mean Northern Ireland would be pushed further towards uniting with the South,
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  in so in which case the EU were holding Northern Ireland above the rest of the UK and saying, look, you know, if you're going to leave, we're going to keep Northern Ireland and it's going to go back to the Republic.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  What Boris's deal does is it keeps Northern Ireland in the customs union of the UK, so it maintains as an integral part of the UK's own customs territory.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And there will be no customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, but there will be some regulatory checks.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  As there already are, there are already checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  You cannot bring fresh food across the Irish Sea, for example.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  So this is just maintaining the status quo really in the best, in really what is almost impossible tasks as querying the circle.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  Boris has really managed to get this, well, very tricky technical arrangement pretty much fixed.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  And that's something that May couldn't do.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  Fantastic. So now this, if Boris gets this right, if he can prove that a country can leave the disgusting Hitler's best dream known as the European Union, if Boris can prove that a country can leave this monstrosity and prosper and thrive,
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  what do you expect will happen to the rest of the European Union and all of its participating countries?
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Well, I expect the European Union to be broken down in the next few decades, or passed towards becoming this European federal super state, which is certainly what the Brits were concerned about.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  There is this split between North and South of Europe, certainly in culture in terms of how they operate their economic policy.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  You can never really fuse the economies of Germany and Greece together.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  It's just not going to happen. So either it's going to fragment and break apart and then probably maintain a sort of central Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, maybe France as well.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  And they might bind together more tightly into federal Europe and everybody else will be free from their devious clutches.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  But certainly the EU will, there is no way in the next few decades that it will maintain its current form.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  It is inevitable that something will happen.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Certainly, if we do make a success of Brexit and we aren't, and the EU doesn't put a chokehold on our international trade with them and potentially with others.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  And if we can do that, I think that certainly will motivate many of the other countries, perhaps Italy, which is very certainly with Matteo Salvini, who was their prime minister, who probably will be their prime minister again whenever they have their next election, which they do every year or couple of years or so down there.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  He will certainly be in favour of breaking apart from the EU.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  So potentially Italy might be one of the first ones to go if that does happen. But that's certainly five or maybe 10 years down the road.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Certainly until they can see that Britain can stand alone and does not need the EU breathing down its neck in order to be economically prosperous and a free nation.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  Fantastic. Jack Hadfield, he is of course the UK correspondent and a fantastic writer at NationalFile.com, formerly a Breitbart Jack. Tell folks where they can find you on social media.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  Yeah, you can find me on Facebook, facebook.com forward slash Jack Hadfield 1996 on Twitter at Jack Hadders, I think on gab at JH. Yeah, but I'm certainly on Twitter most of the time. And that's probably where you'd find most of my tweets and comments and articles.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Of course, for the viewers and listeners, you may remember Jack, he raised a lot of trouble back in his college days for refusing to sit through some of the gender and hate inclusivity classes.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  And basically they just let him graduate to get rid of him. So he's been a cultural warrior for quite a long time now doing very important work.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  You can read his article, Conservatives Win Huge Majority in Election at NationalFile.com. Jack, thanks for coming on the show.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Thank you for having me.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  Absolutely. When we come back, we're going to have another message from Alex Jones. He's on a very, very important mission right now. He may be back before the day is out. We're not sure, but he may be here for the third or fourth hour.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  He's mentioned, of course, it is a fascinating, fascinating schism between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. They're nothing alike in Eastern Europe. They have survived Islam. They have survived communism.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  I don't think they're about to let Angela Merkel or Macron take over and rule them with an iron fist.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  Of course, I want to remind everybody, please, InfowarsStore.com. Get your Christmas shopping done. Do it with Patriots.

[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it. That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God, but they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post-human error. This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet. This is the crossroads. Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do. It's the healthy thing to do. It's the thing that makes all of our lives better, and that's taking care of our individual health. And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarstore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life-changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life,
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  your focus, your health, your stamina, your libido. But then of course it also funds the infowar that is so incredibly critical. Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that's a true 360 win?
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future. Spend your money on high-quality products and have huge savings, and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com. Please make the right decision.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  My dear fellow Americans, I'm here watching CNN because it's all we have here at Estonia right now in terms of, but it doesn't have Fox. And Jake Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, whatever his name is, he's on. And of course it's the pundit, it's the, they are liars, okay?
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  They are deceivers to the American people, deceivers to the world. What they're doing here is they're deceiving the world. I don't understand why more people, why more of you are not upset like that guy that yelled in the Senate in the Congress the other day, the guy that got up.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  All need to be outraged about, listen, I'm for fairness, I'm for truth, okay? This is ridiculous. I've seen it for years, they're lying. They're connivers of Caesar's spirit. That's a Caesar's Senate. They're connivers. They are no good. And now the Senate wants to not have a hearing.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  They want to rush this through just like the Congress did because they're corrupt. They're protecting each other. They don't want to put Adam Schiff on the chair. They're making some kind of excuse that the President wants to make this a circus.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  He wants the American people to see the corruption in our government and they don't want to show it, all right? They don't want to show it. I want to see the corruption. I want to see them, these congressmen and people, I want to see them in the hot seat, all right?
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  With their ass turning on flames because they're being questioned. The American people should see this. It's not a circus. How dare you say it would be a circus in the Senate, McConnell and Romney if you said that?
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  How dare you? It's not a circus. The American people need to see this. They want to see the corruption what you guys are covering up each other about. What are you covering up? What do you cover up that you don't want to question Adam Schiff?
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  He lied to the American people so many times. Pelosi just said something that made my hair burn on fire. She talked about the new deal that, you know, looking at NAFTA was no good, but now we have this new deal and that she didn't give Trump any credit for it.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  She said to the, she snidely goes, it's way different. You should see it. She said, it's way different than what President Trump wanted. Well, Trump is the one that wanted and wants to renegotiate our deals. That's why we have a new deal and she's praising it now because Trump wants it for the American people, for America first.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  These people stink over and over again. I want you people to get foamed in the...
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  Robert Davi, that is of course a very, very pro-Trump actor. I'm sure he realizes he'll never work a day in his life. He says on Twitter with that video, we must get involved. The GOP is filled with weak vessels.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  He could not be more accurate. The GOP is a mess. Just look at what they're allowing to happen to the supporters of President Trump. This video was just released yesterday. It corresponds to a story from last month.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Let's go ahead and roll this. There it is. Absolutely horrifying. This is a child on a school bus for radio listeners being attacked brutally for wearing a Trump hat.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  This is what happens in the United States in 2019. Being a patriotic American and supporting your president can get you violently assaulted regardless of whether you're 14 or 40.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Of course, the man Davi was talking about was Owen Schreuer. That is the spirit we should all have, fighting tooth and nail for our country. But this article is up. NationalFile.com Child Hospitalized, rather, after an unprovoked attack over Trump hat.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  On November 21st, two girls and three boys beat and hospitalized a kid on their school bus on camera for wearing a Trump hat. As of December 12, 2019, the family of the victim has been granted permission by lawyers to share the 21-second clip of the brutal assault.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  I won't hold my breath to see if there's any justice in the court system. Meanwhile, the insanity of higher education continues. Of course, there's been the viral It's Okay to Be White poster campaign.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  I like Alex Jones. It's okay to be Alex Jones. It's okay to be American. I believe it's the t-shirt sold at infowarstore.com. But this recently happened. It's also up at nationalfile.com. The student behind It's Okay to Be White flyers expelled, then interrogated by the FBI counter terrorist unit.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Simply saying it's okay, not it's good, not it's superior, not it's the best, but simply saying it's okay to be a certain skin color results in the FBI counter terrorist unit giving you a knock on the door.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  By the way, think of all the killers, the cold blooded sociopathic SSRI addicted killers who have been reported to the FBI. It happened in Florida with that horrible, horrible school shooting that gave us David Hogg and Kyle Keshuv.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  That kid was reported to the FBI numerous times. Nothing came from it. Go back to the Boston bombing. The Russians of all people had intel on those two brothers trying to get the FBI to pay attention. They wouldn't. They didn't care.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  How many times has the FBI let this country down from FISA to these killers that they've let walk? But if you put up a flyer that says it's okay to be white, well, they're going to give you a visit, son.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  They're going to make sure you're not a terrorist or thinking all humans are equal. This is the story of NationalFile.com. The Oklahoma City University police manhunt that went viral after being reported by NationalFile in October resulted in the
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  explosion and police interrogation of a student activist on December 9th. We, of course, originally reported this in October that the police had launched a manhunt searching for this poor kid.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  Now an update from the Oklahoma State of the Student was tracked down, expelled and interrogated by OKC police for placing the flyers. Federal law prevented the student from being doxxed by university officials. Thankfully, OCU police director Bill City explained his reasoning for the
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  civilian police investigation thusly. The reason you look into those types of things is you want to make sure the individual is not a threat to other students. Putting up flyers is a threat to other students, or at least it might be.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  I did not explain how it's OK to be white. It could possibly be a threat to students. The OCU police department reportedly partnered with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force to locate and interrogate the suspect, the student activist.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  It's so hard not to laugh when you read these news stories. It's a flyer. It says it's OK to be white. It's OK to be white. It's OK to be brown. It's OK to be black. It's OK to be anything. It's OK to be American. It's OK to be Alex Jones.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  But not in this upside down world. OCU School of Law Dean Jim Roth praised the student's expulsion. And of course this is the school of law guy. He praised the student's expulsion in a statement saying exclusion and hate will not be tolerated here.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Exclusion and hate as they exclude a kid who they obviously hate. National Cloud reached out to a citizen activist involved in peaceful. It's OK to be white. Activism. This guy has, I don't even think he's from the states.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  I can't reveal my sources, of course, but this guy has organized hundreds or thousands of these. He also keeps a massive document going with all the police and media freakouts over the innocent flyers.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  We reached out to him for a comment. He said the only thoughts in this incident are that the response was draconian and hysterical but sadly predictable and should serve as a wake up call for anyone who does not want to live under totalitarianism.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  The people who want to ruin this young student's life are refusing to hate himself are evil. The response also clearly demonstrates a racial hatred and paranoid fear of white people deeply rooted in the establishment media, academia and government.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  Not only in the U.S. but across the West. If you replace the word white with any other group and put a flyer saying it's OK to be other group, they would likely have been no police attention or media coverage.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  This law student who is expelled is essentially a martyr. He sacrificed years of study, large sums of money and part of his reputation and future to warn people about this totalitarian threat.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  In the next segment, I want to go into this article. Another article up at nationalfinal.com shows 150 plus cases of outrage and manhunts over it's OK to be white.

[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  We're being taken off the land. We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human than the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play guide.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  I believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us. This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model. This is the post human error.
